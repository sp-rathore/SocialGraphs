For a while the U.S. government considered him and his family as \"illegal aliens\". On June 6, 1960, De La Torre received an order from Immigration and Naturalization Service to \"self-deport.\" He attended Blessed Sacrament School in Queens, New York and was baptized and confirmed by the Catholic Church. Simultaneously, his parents were priest/priestess of the religion [[Santería]].<ref>[http://www.eerdmans.com/Interviews/delatorreinterview.htm Interview with Miguel A.
