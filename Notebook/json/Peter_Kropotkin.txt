Only 150 boys&nbsp;– mostly children of nobility belonging to the court&nbsp;– were educated in this privileged corps, which combined the character of a [[military school]] endowed with special rights and of a court institution attached to the [[Imperial Household]].

The expeditions yielded valuable geographical results. The impossibility of obtaining any real administrative reforms in [[Siberia]] now induced Kropotkin to devote himself almost entirely to scientific exploration, in which he continued to be highly successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=214}}</ref>\n\nIn 1866, Kropotkin began reading the works of the French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], and other political thinkers such as [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Alexander Herzen]].

During this work, he was offered the secretaryship of the Society, but he had decided that it was his duty not to work at fresh discoveries but to aid in diffusing existing knowledge among the people at large. Accordingly, he refused the offer and returned to St. Petersburg, where he joined the revolutionary party.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=235–236}}</ref>\n\n===Activism in Switzerland and France===\nKropotkin visited [[Switzerland]] in 1872 and became a member of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (IWA) at [[Geneva]].

Instead, he studied the programme of the more radical [[Jura federation]] at [[Neuchâtel]] and spent time in the company of the leading members, and adopted the creed of anarchism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kropotkin|first=Peter|title=Memoirs of a Revolutionist|year=1899|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|Houghton, Mifflin & Company]]|location=Boston and New York|pages=282–287}}</ref>\n\nOn returning to Russia, Kropotkin's friend Dmitri Klements introduced him to the [[Circle of Tchaikovsky]], a socialist/populist group created in 1872. Kropotkin worked to spread revolutionary propaganda among peasants and workers, and acted as a bridge between the Circle and the aristocracy. Throughout this period, Kropotkin maintained his position within the Geographical Society in order to provide cover for his activities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Cahm, Caroline|title=Kropotkin: And the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism, 1872–1886|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780521891578|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zk7wTSWT3JUC&pg=PA44}}</ref>\n\nIn 1874, Kropotkin was arrested and imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for subversive political activity, as a result of his work with the Circle of Tchaikovsky. Because of his aristocratic background, he received special privileges in prison, such as permission to continue his geographical work in his cell. He delivered his report on the subject of the [[Ice Age]], where he argued that it had taken place in not as distant a past as originally thought. In 1876, just before his trial, Kropotkin was moved to a low-security prison in St. Petersburg, from which he escaped with the help of his friends. On the night of the escape, Kropotkin and his friends celebrated by dining in one of the finest restaurants in St. Petersburg, assuming correctly that the police would not think to look for them there.

He was invited to Britain by [[Charlotte Wilson]], with whom he co-founded the [[Freedom Press]], an anarchist newspaper which continues to this day. Kropotkin was a regular contributor.

He used many real-life examples in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating [[evolution]] is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups, without central control, authority, or compulsion. He did so in order to counteract the concept of fierce competition as the core of [[evolution]], which concept provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic, and social theories{{which|date=July 2014}} of the time and for the prevalent interpretations of [[Social darwinism|Darwinism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} In the last chapter, he wrote:<ref>{{cite book |author = Kropotkin, Peter | title = quotation from ''Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution'' | year = 1902 | url = http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kropotkin#Mutual_Aid:_A_Factor_of_Evolution_.281902.29 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense{{spaced ndash}}not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species.

He believed that should a society be socially, culturally, and industrially developed enough to produce all the goods and services required by it, then no obstacle, such as preferential distribution, pricing or monetary exchange will prevent everyone to take what they need from the social product. He supported the eventual abolition of money or tokens of exchange for goods and services.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nKropotkin believed that [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s [[collectivist]] economic model was simply a wage system by a different name,<ref>Kropotkin wrote: \"After the Collectivist Revolution instead of saying 'twopence' worth of soap, we shall say 'five minutes' worth of soap.\" (quoted in {{cite book |author=Brauer, Fae|chapter=Wild Beasts and Tame Primates: 'Le Douanier' Rosseau's Dream of Darwin's Evolution|editor=Larsen, Barbara Jean|title=The Art of Evolution: Darwin, Darwinisms, and Visual Culture|publisher=UPNE|year=2009|isbn=9781584657750|page=211|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZisTVt0GJQC&pg=PA211}})</ref> and that such a system would breed the same type of centralization and inequality as a capitalist wage system. He stated that it is impossible to determine the value of an individual's contributions to the products of social [[Wage labour|labor]], and thought that anyone who was placed in a position of trying to make such determinations would wield authority over those whose wages they determined.<ref>{{cite book |author=Avrich, Paul|title=[[The Russian Anarchists]]|publisher=AK Press|year=2005|isbn=9781904859482|pages=28–29}}</ref> He further developed these ideas in ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAccording to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:<ref name=Sale/>\n\n{{quote|With ''Mutual Aid'' especially, and later with ''[[Fields, Factories, and Workshops]]'', Kropotkin was able to move away from the absurdist limitations of [[Individualist anarchism|individual anarchism]] and no-laws anarchism that had flourished during this period and provide instead a vision of communal anarchism, following the models of independent cooperative communities he discovered while developing his theory of mutual aid. It was an anarchism that opposed centralized government and state-level laws as traditional anarchism did, but understood that at a certain small scale, communities and communes and co-ops could flourish and provide humans with a rich material life and wide areas of liberty without centralized control.}}\n\n===Self-sufficiency===\nKropotkin's focus on local production led to his view that a country should strive for [[autarky|self-sufficiency]]{{spaced ndash}}manufacture its own goods and grow its own food, lessening dependence on imports.  To these ends he advocated irrigation and greenhouses to boost local food production ability.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:La conquête du pain.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of [[anarcho-communism]]]]\n\n===Books===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book\n|title     = [[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]\n|publisher = [http://www.extendinghorizons.com Extending Horizons Books], [http://www.portersargent.com Porter Sargent Publishers]\n|location  = [[Boston]]\n|edition   = 1955 paperback (reprinted 2005), includes Kropotkin's 1914 preface, Foreword and Bibliography by [[Ashley Montagu]], and [[The Struggle for Existence]], by [[Thomas H.
