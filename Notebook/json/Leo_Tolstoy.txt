He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical trilogy, ''[[Childhood (novel)|Childhood]]'', ''[[Boyhood (novel)|Boyhood]]'', and ''[[Youth (Leo Tolstoy novel)|Youth]]'' (1852–1856), and ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]'' (1855), based upon his experiences in the [[Crimean War]]. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several [[novella]]s such as ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'', ''[[Family Happiness]]'', and ''[[Hadji Murat (novel)|Hadji Murad]]''. He also wrote [[play (theater)|play]]s and numerous philosophical essays.\n\nIn the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an equally profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work ''[[A Confession]]''. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], caused him to become a fervent [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] and [[anarcho-pacifist|pacifist]]. Tolstoy's ideas on [[nonviolent resistance]], expressed in such works as ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', were to have a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]],<ref name=\"ResistNotEvil\">[http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/Resist_Not.html Martin E.

In 1851, after running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the [[Caucasus (geographic region)|Caucasus]] and joined the [[Imperial Russian Army|army]]. It was about this time that he started writing.\n\nHis conversion from a dissolute and privileged society author to the non-violent and spiritual anarchist of his latter days was brought about by his experience in the army as well as two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61. Others who followed the same path were [[Alexander Herzen]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]]. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that would mark the rest of his life.

The similar evocation of battle scenes in Hugo's novel and Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' indicates this influence. Tolstoy's political philosophy was also influenced by a March 1861 visit to French anarchist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], then living in exile under an assumed name in Brussels. Apart from reviewing Proudhon's forthcoming publication, ''La Guerre et la Paix'' (''War and Peace'' in French), whose title Tolstoy would borrow for his masterpiece, the two men discussed education, as Tolstoy wrote in his educational notebooks: \"If I recount this conversation with Proudhon, it is to show that, in my personal experience, he was the only man who understood the significance of education and of the printing press in our time.\"\n\nFired by enthusiasm, Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded 13 schools for children of Russia's peasants, who had just been [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipated from serfdom in 1861]].

Just prior to his death, his health had been a concern of his family, who were actively engaged in his care on a daily basis. During his last few days, he had spoken and written about dying.

His contemporaries paid him lofty tributes. [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] thought him the greatest of all living novelists. [[Gustave Flaubert]], on reading a translation of ''War and Peace'', exclaimed, \"What an artist and what a psychologist!\" [[Anton Chekhov]], who often visited Tolstoy at his country estate, wrote, \"When literature possesses a Tolstoy, it is easy and pleasant to be a writer; even when you know you have achieved nothing yourself and are still achieving nothing, this is not as terrible as it might otherwise be, because Tolstoy achieves for everyone. What he does serves to justify all the hopes and aspirations invested in literature.\" The 19th-century British poet and critic [[Matthew Arnold]] opined that \"a novel by Tolstoy is not a work of art but a piece of life\".<ref name=\"Tolstoy, Leo 2014\">\"Tolstoy, Leo.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite''.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014.</ref>\n\nLater critics and novelists continue to bear testament to Tolstoy's art. [[Virginia Woolf]] declared him \"the greatest of all novelists.\"<ref name=\"Tolstoy, Leo 2014\"/> [[James Joyce]] noted that, \"He is never dull, never stupid, never tired, never pedantic, never theatrical!\". [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Tolstoy's seemingly guileless artistry: \"Seldom did art work so much like nature\". Such sentiments were shared by the likes of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]. The latter heaped superlatives upon ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]'' and ''Anna Karenina''; he questioned, however, the reputation of ''War and Peace'', and sharply criticized ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' and ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]''.\n\nTolstoy's earliest works, the autobiographical novels [[Childhood (novel)|''Childhood'']], [[Boyhood (novel)|''Boyhood'']], and [[Youth (Tolstoy novel)|''Youth'']] (1852–1856), tell of a rich landowner's son and his slow realization of the chasm between himself and his peasants. Though he later rejected them as sentimental, a great deal of Tolstoy's own life is revealed. They retain their relevance as accounts of the universal story of growing up.\n\nTolstoy served as a [[second lieutenant]] in an artillery regiment during the [[Crimean War]], recounted in his ''[[Sevastopol Sketches]]''. His experiences in battle helped stir his subsequent [[pacifism]] and gave him material for realistic depiction of the horrors of war in his later work.<ref>''Government is Violence: essays on anarchism and pacifism''. Leo Tolstoy – 1990 – Phoenix Press</ref>\n\nHis fiction consistently attempts to convey realistically the Russian society in which he lived.<ref>''Tolstoy: the making of a novelist. E'' Crankshaw – 1974 – Weidenfeld & Nicolson</ref> ''[[The Cossacks (novel)|The Cossacks]]'' (1863) describes the [[Cossack]] life and people through a story of a Russian aristocrat in love with a Cossack girl.   ''Anna Karenina'' (1877) tells parallel stories of an adulterous woman trapped by the conventions and falsities of society and of a philosophical landowner (much like Tolstoy), who works alongside the peasants in the fields and seeks to reform their lives. Tolstoy not only drew from his own life experiences but also created characters in his own image, such as Pierre Bezukhov and Prince Andrei in ''War and Peace'', Levin in ''Anna Karenina'' and to some extent, Prince Nekhlyudov in ''Resurrection''.\n\n {{multiple image\n | header = [[The Power of Darkness]]\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = 2015 at Vienna's [[Akademietheater]]<br /><small>Photographs: Francisco Peralta Torrejón</small>\n | image1 = Die Macht der Finsternis 2354-Peralta.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n | image2 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2417-Peralta.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = \n | image3 =Die Macht der Finsternis 2465-Peralta.jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 = \n }}\n''War and Peace'' is generally thought to be one of the greatest novels ever written, remarkable for its dramatic breadth and unity. Its vast canvas includes 580 characters, many historical with others fictional. The story moves from family life to the headquarters of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], from the court of [[Alexander I of Russia]] to the battlefields of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]]. Tolstoy's original idea for the novel was to investigate the causes of the [[Decembrist revolt]], to which it refers only in the last chapters, from which can be deduced that [[Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky|Andrei Bolkonsky]]'s son will become one of the Decembrists. The novel explores Tolstoy's theory of history, and in particular the insignificance of individuals such as Napoleon and Alexander. Somewhat surprisingly, Tolstoy did not consider ''War and Peace'' to be a novel (nor did he consider many of the great Russian fictions written at that time to be novels). This view becomes less surprising if one considers that Tolstoy was a novelist of the [[realism (arts)|realist]] school who considered the novel to be a framework for the examination of social and political issues in nineteenth-century life.<ref>Tolstoy and the Development of Realism. G Lukacs. ''Marxists on Literature: An Anthology'', London: Penguin, 1977</ref> ''War and Peace'' (which is to Tolstoy really an [[Epic poetry|epic]] in prose) therefore did not qualify. Tolstoy thought that ''Anna Karenina'' was his first true novel.<ref>''Tolstoy and the Novel''. J Bayley – 1967 – Chatto & Windus</ref>\n\nAfter ''Anna Karenina'', Tolstoy concentrated on Christian themes, and his later novels such as ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'' (1886) and ''[[What Is to Be Done? (Tolstoy)|What Is to Be Done?]]'' develop a radical [[anarcho-pacifism|anarcho-pacifist]] Christian philosophy which led to his [[excommunication]] from the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1901.<ref>''Church and State''.

Benson – 1973 – University of Illinois Press</ref>\n\nIn his novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'', [[Tolstoy]] attempts to expose the injustice of man-made laws and the hypocrisy of institutionalized church. Tolstoy also explores and explains the economic philosophy of [[Georgism]], of which he had become a very strong advocate towards the end of his life.\n\n==Religious and political beliefs==\n[[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tolstoy dressed in peasant clothing, by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]]\nAfter reading [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\"<ref>Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, August 30, 1869</ref>\n\nIn Chapter VI of ''[[A Confession]]'', Tolstoy quoted the final paragraph of Schopenhauer's work. It explained how the nothingness that results from complete [[self-denial|denial of self]] is only a relative nothingness, and is not to be feared. The novelist was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: <blockquote> But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for [[eternal salvation]] is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\" Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[simple living|voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: \"Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?\" and who replied: \"I have made a far more beautiful choice!\" \"Whom?\" \"''La povertà'' (poverty)\": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.<ref>Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, §170</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1884, Tolstoy wrote a book called \"''What I Believe''\", in which he openly confessed his Christian beliefs. He affirmed his belief in [[Jesus Christ]]'s [[Teachings of Jesus|teachings]] and was particularly influenced by the [[Sermon on the Mount]], and the injunction to [[turn the other cheek]], which he understood as a \"commandment of non-resistance to evil by force\" and a doctrine of [[pacifism]] and [[nonviolence]]. In his work ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', he explains that he considered mistaken the Church's doctrine because they had made a \"perversion\" of Christ's teachings. Tolstoy also received letters from American [[Quakers]] who introduced him to the non-violence writings of Quaker Christians such as [[George Fox]], [[William Penn]] and [[Jonathan Dymond]]. Tolstoy believed being a Christian required him to be a pacifist; the consequences of being a pacifist, and the apparently inevitable waging of war by government, are the reason why he is considered a philosophical anarchist.\n\nLater, various versions of \"Tolstoy's Bible\" would be published, indicating the passages Tolstoy most relied on, specifically, the reported words of Jesus himself.<ref>Orwin, Donna T.

Gandhi]] and other residents of [[Tolstoyan movement#Africa|Tolstoy Farm]], South Africa, 1910]]\n\nTolstoy believed that a true Christian could find lasting happiness by striving for inner self-perfection through following the [[Great Commandment]] of loving one's neighbor and God rather than looking outward to the Church or state for guidance. His belief in [[nonresistance]] when faced by conflict is another distinct attribute of his philosophy based on Christ's teachings. By directly influencing [[Mahatma Gandhi]] with this idea through his work ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' (full text of English translation [[Wikisource:The Kingdom of God Is Within You|available on Wikisource]]), Tolstoy's profound influence on the nonviolent resistance movement reverberates to this day. He believed that the aristocracy were a burden on the poor, and that the only solution to how we live together is through [[Christian anarchism|anarchism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nHe also opposed [[private property]] in land ownership<ref>I Cannot Be Silent. Leo Tolstoy. ''Recollections and Essays'', 1937.</ref> and the institution of marriage and valued the ideals of chastity and sexual abstinence (discussed in ''[[Father Sergius]]'' and his preface to ''The Kreutzer Sonata''), ideals also held by the young Gandhi.

Gorky relates how Tolstoy once read this passage before himself and Chekhov and that Tolstoy was moved to tears by the end of the reading. Other later passages of rare power include the personal crises that were faced by the protagonists of ''The Death of Ivan Ilyich'', and of ''[[Master and Man (short story)|Master and Man]]'', where the main character in the former or the reader in the latter are made aware of the foolishness of the protagonists' lives.\n\nTolstoy had a profound influence on the development of [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] thought.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/TheContemporaryRelevanceOfLeoTolstoy |title=The Contemporary Relevance of Leo Tolstoy's Late Political Thought |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2009|quote=Tolstoy articulated his Christian anarchist political thought between 1880 and 1910, yet its continuing relevance should have become fairly self-evident already.}}</ref> The [[Tolstoyan]]s were a small Christian anarchist group formed by Tolstoy's companion, [[Vladimir Chertkov]] (1854–1936), to spread Tolstoy's religious teachings. Philosopher [[Peter Kropotkin]] wrote of Tolstoy in the article on anarchism in the ''[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':<blockquote>Without naming himself an anarchist, Leo Tolstoy, like his predecessors in the popular religious movements of the 15th and 16th centuries, [[Petr Chelčický|Chojecki]], [[Hans Denck|Denk]] and many others, took the anarchist position as regards the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[property right]]s, deducing his conclusions from the general spirit of the teachings of Jesus and from the necessary dictates of reason.\n\nWith all the might of his talent, Tolstoy made (especially in ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'') a powerful criticism of the church, the state and law altogether, and especially of the present [[property law]]s. He describes the state as the domination of the wicked ones, supported by brutal force. Robbers, he says, are far less dangerous than a well-organized government. He makes a searching criticism of the prejudices which are current now concerning the benefits conferred upon men by the church, the state, and the existing distribution of property, and from the teachings of Jesus he deduces the rule of non-resistance and the absolute condemnation of all wars. His religious arguments are, however, so well combined with arguments borrowed from a dispassionate observation of the present evils, that the anarchist portions of his works appeal to the religious and the non-religious reader alike.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition |last=Kropotkin |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Kropotkin |year=1911 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page=918 |pages= |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri01chisrich#page/918/mode/2up |accessdate= |quote=Anarchism}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Tolstoy organising famine relief in Samara, 1891]]\nDuring the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China, Tolstoy praised the Boxers.

In the 1900 essay, \"On Anarchy\", he wrote; \"The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order, and in the assertion that, without Authority, there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that Anarchy can be instituted by a revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power ... There can be only one permanent revolution—a moral one: the regeneration of the inner man.\" Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's \"Words of a Rebel\", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.<ref>''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''.

Both performers were nominated for [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for their roles. There have been other films about the writer, including ''[[Departure of a Grand Old Man]]'', made in 1912 just two years after his death, ''How Fine, How Fresh the Roses Were'' (1913), and ''Leo Tolstoy'', directed by and starring [[Sergei Gerasimov (film director)|Sergei Gerasimov]] in 1984.\n\nThere is also a famous lost film of Tolstoy made a decade before he died. In 1901, the American travel lecturer [[Burton Holmes]] visited Yasnaya Polyana with [[Albert J. Beveridge]], the U.S. senator and historian. As the three men conversed, Holmes filmed Tolstoy with his 60-mm movie camera. Afterwards, Beveridge's advisers succeeded in having the film destroyed, fearing that documentary evidence of a meeting with the Russian author might hurt Beveridge's chances of running for the U.S. presidency.<ref>Wallace, Irving, 'Everybody's Rover Boy', in ''The Sunday Gentleman''.
