It draws heavily from the ''Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy'' in making the argument that voters have systematically biased beliefs about many important economic topics. Caplan writes that [[rational irrationality]] is an explanation for the failure of democracy.<ref name=mrv/><ref name=boneheaded>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2007/09/26/the-4-boneheaded-biases-of-stu|title = The 4 Boneheaded Biases of Stupid Voters|publisher = [[Reason Magazine]]|last = Caplan|first = Bryan|date = 2007-09-26|accessdate = 2013-09-28}}</ref> The book was reviewed in the popular press, including the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118401997995161399.html|title = Casting a Ballot With A Certain Cast of Mind|last = Casse|first = Daniel|date = 2007-07-10|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}</ref> the ''[[New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/magazine/27wwln-idealab-t.html?_r=0|title = Clueless|last = Bass|first = Gary J.|date = 2007-05-27|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> and the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/09/070709crbo_books_menand|title = Fractured Franchise: Are the wrong people voting?|last = Menand|first = Louis|date = 2007-07-09|publisher = ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]''|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> as well as in academic publications such as the ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/22_1/22_1_35.pdf|title = ''The Myth of the Rational Voter'' (book review)|last = Block|first = Walter|publisher = ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Vol. 22 (2011), Page 689-718|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> ''[[Public Choice]]'',<ref name=LomaskyReview>{{cite web|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k6396012k8647800/|title = Swing and a myth: a review of Caplan’s ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Lomasky|first = Loren|date = June 2008|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-28.pdf|title = Critique of Caplan's ''The Myth of the Rational Voter''|last = Farrand|first = Stuart|year = 2010|publisher = ''[[Libertarian Papers]]'', Vol. 2, Article No. 28|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> and ''[[The Independent Review]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?a=723|title = The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies (book review)|last = Callahan|first = Gene|date = Winter 2009|accessdate = 2013-09-29|publisher = ''[[The Independent Review]]''}}</ref> It received a scathing critique by Rupert Read in the ''[[European Review]]''.<ref name=Read2010>{{cite journal|last1=Read|first1=Rupert|title=Economist-kings?

These reviews appear to have failed to note that Caplan’s book celebrates the market and denigrates democracy at the very time when markets worldwide have failed and democracies have ridden to the rescue. It thus appears to have been undermined fatally by events that occurred as it was published (and which Caplan artfully omits to mention in the more recent paperback edition). Caplan’s book in fact stands in the long tradition of anti-democratic writings that argue that an elite must rule. An elite of free-market economists. An elite no longer in good odour, since the financial crisis (and the climate crisis) occurred and became starkly evident to all. This Critical Notice also points out that numerous of Caplan’s key claims, such as that individual voters have zero effect on election results, are empirically false.}}</ref>\n\n===''Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids''===\n''[[Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids]]'' is a 2011 book<ref>{{cite web|url=http://havemorekidsbook.com/|title = Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids (book website)|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-ebook/dp/B004OA64Q6/|title = Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids: Why Being a Great Parent is Less Work and More Fun Than You Think [Kindle Edition]|publisher = Amazon.com|accessdate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> arguing that people often work too hard in child-rearing, and as a result, they are scared of the idea of having kids.
