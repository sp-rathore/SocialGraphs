A book known as the ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', an influential collection of essays, is traditionally attributed to him. \n\nXunzi witnessed the chaos surrounding the fall of the [[Zhou dynasty]] and rise of the [[Qin state]] – which upheld [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalistic]] doctrines focusing on state control, by means of law and penalties.<ref name=sources>\n{{cite book\n\n| editor1-last = de Bary\n| editor1-first = William Theodore\n| editor2-last = Bloom\n| editor2-first = Irene\n| title = Sources of Chinese Tradition: From Earliest Times to 1600\n| volume = 1\n| location = New York\n| publisher = Columbia University Press\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = 978-0231109390\n| pages = 159–160\n}}</ref>  Xunzi's variety of Confucianism therefore has a darker, more pragmatic flavour than the optimistic Confucianism of [[Mencius]], who tended to view humans as innately [[Good and evil|good]]. Like [[Shang Yang]], Xunzi believed that humanity's inborn tendencies were evil and that ethical norms had been invented to rectify people. Xunzi was educated in the [[Qi (state)|state of Qi]] and taught proponents of legalism, including the Qin Chancellor [[Li Si]] and [[Han Fei]]zi. Because of this, he is sometimes associated with legalism. But like most Confucians, he believed that people could be refined through education and ritual.\n\nWhile Xunzi's doctrines were influential in forming the official state doctrines of the [[Han dynasty]], during the [[Tang dynasty]] his influence waned, relative to that of Mencius.<ref name=sources/> Xunzi mentioned Laozi as a figure for the first time in early Chinese history.<ref>Tae Hyun KIM 2010 p.18, Other Laozi Parallels in the Hanfeizi</ref>\n\n== Life ==\nXunzi was born Xun Kuang (荀況). Some texts recorded his surname as [[Sun (surname)|Sun]] (孫) instead of [[Xun (surname)|Xun]], either because the two surnames were homophones in antiquity or because Xun was a [[naming taboo]] during the reign of [[Emperor Xuan of Han]] (73–48 BC), whose given name was Xun. [[Herbert Giles]] and John Knoblock both consider the naming taboo theory more likely.<ref name=Giles>{{cite book\n| author = Giles, Herbert\n| title = A Chinese Biographical Dictionary\n| publisher = Bernard Quaritch (London)\n| year = 1898\n| page = 315\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BxH0PqdGTVUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=herbert+giles+chinese+biographical+dictionary&cad=2#v=onepage&q=hsun%20kuang&f=false\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Knoblock|first=John|title=Xunzi: a translation and study of the complete works|date=1988|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=0804714517|page=239}}</ref>\n\nThe early years of Xunzi's life are enshrouded in mystery. Nothing is known of his lineage. [[Sima Qian]] records that he was born in [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], and [[Anze County]] has erected a large memorial hall at his supposed birthplace. He was first known at the age of fifty, around 264 BC, when he went to the state of Qi to study and teach at the [[Jixia Academy]]. Xunzi was well respected in Qi; the [[King Xiang of Qi]] honoured him as a teacher and a libationer.\n\nIt was around this time that Xunzi visited the [[state of Qin]] and praised its governance, and debated military affairs with Lord Linwu (臨武君) in the court of [[King Xiaocheng of Zhao]]. Later, Xunzi was slandered in the Qi court, and he retreated south to the [[state of Chu]], where [[Lord Chunshen]], the prime minister, gave him a position as Magistrate of Lanling (蘭陵令). In 238 BC, Lord Chunshen was assassinated by a court rival and Xunzi subsequently lost his position. He remained in Lanling, a region in what is today's southern [[Shandong]] province, for the rest of his life and was buried there. The year of his death is unknown.<ref name=Xunzi>\n{{cite book\n| author = Watson, Burton\n| title = Xunzi: Basic Writings\n| publisher = Columbia University Press\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 2, 120, 132–133, 145–146, 148, 154, 163–165, 170, 174\n| isbn = 978-0231129657\n}}</ref>\n\nOf his disciples, the most notable are [[Li Si]] (prime minister to the [[First Emperor of Qin]]) and the [[Han (state)|Han]] state royal [[Han Feizi]], who developed the quasi-authoritarian aspects of his thought into the doctrine called the School of Law, or [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]]. Because of Li Si and Han Feizi's staunch anti-Confucian stances, Xunzi's reputation as a Confucian philosopher has often come into question.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Cua|first=A.S.|title=Ethical Argumentation: A Study in Hsün Tzu's Moral Epistemology|year=1985|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-8248-0942-4}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Knechtges | first1 = David R. | authorlink1=David R.
