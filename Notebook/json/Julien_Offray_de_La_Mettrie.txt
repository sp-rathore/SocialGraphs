Cf.: Birgit Christensen: Ironie und Skepsis, Würzburg 1996, p. 245, fn. 2</ref> – November 11, 1751) was a [[France|French]] [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], and one of the earliest of the [[French materialism|French materialists]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He is best known for his work ''[[Man a Machine|L'homme machine]]'' (\"Machine Man\"<ref>The 1748 English translation bore the title ''Man a machine'', but Ann Thomson, in her recent translation, chooses the title ''Machine man'' (Thomson 1996)</ref> or \"The Human Mechanism\").\n\n==Early life==\nLa Mettrie was born at [[Saint-Malo]] in Brittany on November 23, 1709, and was the son of a prosperous textile merchant. His initial schooling took place in the colleges of Coutances and Caen. After attending the [[Collège du Plessis]] in [[Paris]], he seemed to have acquired a vocational interest in becoming a clergyman, but after studying [[theology]] in the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] schools for some years, his interests turned away from the [[Catholic Church|Church]]. In 1725, La Mettrie entered the [[College d'Harcourt]] to study philosophy and natural science, probably graduating around 1728. At this time, D'Harcourt was pioneering the teaching of [[Cartesianism]] in France.<ref name =aram>Aram Vartanian, ''La Mettrie's ''L'Homme Machine'': A Study in the Origins of an Idea'' (Princeton University Press, 1960), p. 2-12</ref> In 1734, he went on to study under [[Hermann Boerhaave]], a renowned physician who, similarly, had originally intended on becoming a clergyman. It was under Boerhaave that La Mettrie was influenced to try to bring changes to medical education in France.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nyirubugara|first=Olivier|title=A Sociobibliographic Study of L'homme machine|url=http://www.olny.nl/Research_Recherche/Media_Studies/O_Nyirubugara_SOCIOBIBLIOGRAPHIC_STUDY_HOMME_MACHINE.pdf|pages=3, 4}}</ref>\n\n==Medical career==\nAfter his studies at D'Harcourt, La Mettrie decided to take up the profession of medicine. A friend of the La Mettrie family, [[François-Joseph Hunauld]], who was about to take the chair of anatomy at the [[Jardin des Plantes|Jardin du Roi]], seems to have influenced him in this decision. For five years, La Mettrie studied at faculty of medicine in Paris, and enjoyed the mentorship of Hunauld.<ref name=aram/>\n\n[[File:Herman Boerhaave - Project Gutenberg eText 15690.jpg|right|thumb|150px|In [[Leiden]], La Mettrie studied under the famous physician [[Herman Boerhaave]] (pictured above)]]\n\nIn 1733, however, he departed for [[Leiden]] to study under the famous [[Herman Boerhaave]]. His stay in Holland proved to be short but influential. In the following years, La Mettrie settled down to professional medical practice in his home region of Saint-Malo, disseminating the works and theories of Boerhaave through the publication and translation of several works. He married in 1739 but the marriage, which produced two children, proved an unhappy one. In 1742 La Mettrie left his family and travelled to Paris, where he obtained the appointment of surgeon to the [[Gardes Françaises]] regiment, taking part in several battles during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. This experience would instill in him a deep aversion to violence which is evident in his philosophical writings. Much of his time, however, was spent in Paris, and it is likely that during this time he made the acquaintance of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]] and the [[Émilie du Châtelet|Marquise de Châtelet]].<ref name=aram/>\n\nIt was in these years, during an attack of [[fever]], that he made observations on himself with reference to the action of quickened blood circulation upon thought, which led him to the conclusion that [[mental process]]es were to be accounted for as the effects of organic changes in the brain and nervous system. This conclusion he worked out in his earliest philosophical work, the ''Histoire naturelle de l'âme'' (1745). So great was the outcry caused by its publication that La Mettrie was forced to quit his position with the French Guards, taking refuge in [[Leiden]]. There he developed his doctrines still more boldly and completely in ''[[Man a Machine|L'Homme machine]]'', a hastily written treatise based upon consistently materialistic and quasi-atheistic principles.<ref name=aram/> La Mettrie's materialism was in many ways the product of his medical concerns, drawing on the work of 17th-century predecessors such as the Epicurean physician [[Guillaume Lamy]].<ref name=ann>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Ann|title=Machine Man and Other Writings|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PierreLouisMaupertuis.jpg|thumb|180px|left||[[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], also a native of [[Saint-Malo]], helped La Mettrie find refuge in Prussia.]]\n\nThe [[ethics|ethical implications]] of these principles would later be worked out in his ''Discours sur le bonheur''; La Mettrie considered it his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''.<ref>Julien Offray de La Mettrie: ''Discours sur le bonheur.'' Critical edition by John Falvey. Banbury: The Voltaire Foundation 1975. ''Introduction'' by John Falvey, p. 12: \"central and culminating part of his thinking\".</ref> Here he developed his ''theory of remorse'', i.e. his view about the inauspicious effects of the feelings of guilt acquired at early age during the process of [[enculturation]]. This was the idea which brought him the enmity of virtually all thinkers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]], and a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''<ref>Kathleen Wellman: ''La Mettrie – Medicine, Philosophy, and Enlightenment''. Durham: Duke University Press 1992, chap. 8, pp. 213-245, part. pp. 213, 220</ref> which was lifted only a century later by [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] in his ''[[History of Materialism and Critique of its Present Importance|Geschichte des Materialismus]]''.\n\n==Philosophy==\nJulien de La Mettrie is considered one of the most influential determinists of the eighteenth century. Along with aiding the furthering of determinism he considered himself a mechanistic [[Materialism|materialist]].\n\nHe believed that mental processes were caused by the body. He expressed these thoughts in his most important work ''Man a Machine''. There he also expressed his belief that humans worked like a machine. This theory can be considered to build off the work of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and his approach to the human body working as a machine.<ref name=king>{{cite book|last=King|first=D. Brett|title=A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-51213-5|page=169|edition=4|author2=Viney W. |author3=Woody W. }}</ref> La Mettrie believed that man, body and mind, worked like a machine. Interestingly, although he helped further Descartes' view of mechanization in explaining human bodily behavior, he argued against Descartes' dualistic view on the mind. His opinions were so strong that he stated that Descartes was actually a materialist in regards to the mind.<ref name=greenwood>{{cite book|last=Greenwood|first=John|title=A Conceptual History of Psychology|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-285862-4}}</ref>\n\n===Man and the animal===\nPrior to ''Man a Machine'' he published ''The Natural History of the Soul'' in 1745. He argued that humans were just complex animals.<ref name=greenwood/> A great deal of controversy emerged due to his belief that \"from animals to man there is no abrupt transition\".<ref name =offrey>{{cite web|last=Offray de la Mettrie|first=Julien|title=Man a Machine|url=http://bactra.org/LaMettrie/Machine/}}</ref> He later built of that idea claiming that humans and animals were composed of organized matter. He believed that humans and animals were only different in regards to the complexity that matter was organized. He compared the differences between man and animal to those of high quality pendulum clocks and watches stating: \"[Man] is to the ape, and to the most intelligent animals, as the planetary pendulum of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] is to a watch of [[Julien Le Roy]]\".<ref name=offrey/> The idea that essentially no real difference between humans and animals existed was based on his findings that sensory feelings were present in animals and plants.<ref name =bren>{{cite book|last=Brennan|first=James|title=History and Systems of Psychology|year=2003|publisher=Prentice Hill|location=Upper Saddle River|isbn=0-13-048119-X|page=169|edition=6}}</ref> While he did recognize that only humans spoke a language, he thought that animals were capable of learning a language. He used apes as an example, stating that if they were trained they would be \"perfect [men]\".<ref name=king/> He further expressed his ideas that man was not very different from animals by suggesting that we learn through imitation as do animals.\n\nHis beliefs about humans and animals were based on two types of continuity. The first being weak continuity, suggesting that humans and animals are made of the same things but are organized differently. His main emphasis however was on strong continuity, the idea that the psychology and behavior between humans and animals was not all that different.\n\n===''Man a Machine''===\nLa Mettrie believed that man worked like a machine due to mental thoughts depending on bodily actions. He then argued that the organization of matter at a high and complex level resulted in human thought. He did not believe in the existence of God. He rather chose to argue that the organization of humans was done to provide the best use of complex matter as possible.<ref name=greenwood/>\n\nLa Mettrie arrived at this belief after finding that his bodily and mental illnesses were associated with each other. After gathering enough evidence, in medical and psychological fields, he published the book.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Robert|title=The Great Psychologists|year=1968|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Company|location=Philadelphia|page=168}}</ref>\n\nSome of the evidence La Mettrie presented was disregarded due to the nature of it. He argued that events such as a beheaded chicken running around or a recently removed heart of an animal still working proved the connection between the brain and the body. While theories did build off La Mettrie's, his works were not necessarily scientific. Rather, his writings were controversial and defiant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Daniel|title=An Intellectual History of Psychology|year=1995|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0-299-14840-8|page=253|edition=3}}</ref>\n\n===Human nature===\nHe further expressed his radical beliefs by asserting himself as a determinist, dismissing the use of judges.<ref name=king/> He disagreed with Christian beliefs and emphasized the importance of going after sensual pleasure, a hedonistic approach to human behavior.<ref name=bren/> He further looked at human behavior by questioning the belief that humans have a higher sense of morality than animals. He noted that animals rarely tortured each other and argued that some animals were capable of some level of morality. He believed that as machines, humans would follow the law of nature and ignore their own interests for those of others.<ref name=greenwood/>\n\n===Influence===\nLa Mettrie most directly influenced [[Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis]], a prominent French physician. He worked off La Mettrie's materialistic views but modified them to not be as extreme. La Mettrie's extreme beliefs, were rejected strongly, but his work did help influence [[psychology]], specifically [[behaviorism]]. His influence is seen in the [[Reductionism|reductionist]] approach of behavioral psychologists.<ref name=bren/> However, the backlash he received was so strong that many behaviorists knew very little to nothing about La Mettrie and rather built off other materialists with similar arguments.<ref name=greenwood/>\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Flight to Prussia===\n[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The court of [[Frederick the Great]] provided La Mettrie with a refuge in which to write and publish his works]]\n{{Hedonism}} La Mettrie's [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] and materialistic principles caused outrage even in the relatively tolerant Netherlands. So strong was the feeling against him that in 1748 he was compelled to leave for [[Berlin]], where, thanks in part to the offices of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], the Prussian king [[Frederick the Great]] not only allowed him to practice as a physician, but appointed him court reader. There La Mettrie wrote the ''Discours sur le bonheur'' (1748), which appalled leading [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Baron d'Holbach|D'Holbach]] due to its explicitly [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] sensualist principles which prioritised the unbridled pursuit of pleasure above all other things.<ref name=ann/>\n\n===Death===\nLa Mettrie's celebration of sensual pleasure was said to have resulted in his early death. The French ambassador to Prussia, Tirconnel, grateful to La Mettrie for curing him of an illness, held a feast in his honour. It was claimed that La Mettrie wanted to show either his power of gluttony or his strong constitution by devouring a large quantity of ''pâté de faisan aux truffes''. As a result, he developed a [[gastric illness]] of some sort. Soon after he began suffering from a severe fever and eventually died.<ref name=aram/><ref name=king/>\n\n[[Frederick the Great]] gave the funeral oration, which remains the major biographical source on La Mettrie's life. He declared: \"La Mettrie died in the house of Milord Tirconnel, the French plenipotentiary, whom he had restored to life. It seems that the disease, knowing with whom it had to deal, was cunning enough to attack him first by the brain, in order to destroy him the more surely. A violent fever with fierce delirium came on. The invalid was obliged to have recourse to the science of his colleagues, but he failed to find the succor that his own skill had so often afforded as well to himself as to the public\".[http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Eulogy/]\" Frederick further described him as a good devil and medic but a very bad author.<ref name=pag>{{cite book|last=Pagden|first=Anthony|title=The Enlightenment: and why it still matters|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019966093X|page=112}}</ref>  He was survived by his wife and a 5-year-old daughter.\n\nLa Mettrie's collected ''Œuvres philosophiques'' appeared after his death in several editions, published in London, Berlin and Amsterdam.\n* {{EB1911}}\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Histoire Naturelle de l'Âme''. 1745 (anon.)\n* ''École de la Volupté''. 1746, 1747 (anon.)\n* ''Politique du Médecin de Machiavel''. 1746 (anon.)\n* ''L'Homme Machine''. 1748 (anon.)\n* ''L'Homme Plante''. 1748 (anon.)\n* ''Ouvrage de Pénélope ou Machiavel en Médecine''. 1748 (pseudonym: Aletheius Demetrius)\n* ''Discours sur le bonheur'' ou ''Anti-Sénèque'' [Traité de la vie heureuse, par Sénèque, avec un Discours du traducteur sur le même sujet]. 1748 (anon.)\n* ''L'Homme plus que Machine''. 1748 (anon.)\n* ''Système d'Épicure''. 1750 (anon.)\n* ''L'Art de Jouir''. 1751 (anon.)\n\n==Collected works==\n* ''Œuvres philosophiques'', 2 vols., Paris: Fayard 1984, 1987 ISBN 2-213-01839-1; ISBN 978-2-213-01983-3\n* [vol. 3] ''Ouvrage de Pénélope ou Machiavel en Médecine'', Paris: Fayard 2002 ISBN 2-213-61448-2\n* ''Œuvres philosophiques'', 1 vol., Paris: Coda 2004 ISBN 2-84967-002-2\n\n==Critical editions of his major works==\n* Aram Vartanian (ed.): ''La Mettrie's L'homme machine.''
