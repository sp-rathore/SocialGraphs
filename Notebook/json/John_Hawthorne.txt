His view is thus a variety of invariantism. However, whether a subject has knowledge depends to a surprising extent on features of the ''subject's'' context, including practical concerns. This position can be classed as a form of [[pragmatism]]. The American philosopher [[Jason Stanley]] holds a similar view.\n\nHawthorne has also written on philosophy of language and philosophical logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mind, and on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].\n\n==Education==\nHawthorne earned his Ph.D. from [[Syracuse University]], where he studied with [[William Alston]] and [[Jonathan F. Bennett]]. From 2006-2015, he was the [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] at the [[ University of Oxford]]. He has also taught at the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Arizona State University]], [[Syracuse University]], [[Rutgers University, New Brunswick]], and [[Princeton University]]. \n==Works==\n\n===Books===\n\n* ''The Reference Book'' (with David Manley, [[Oxford University Press]], 2012)\n* ''Relativism and Monadic Truth'' (with [[Herman Cappelen]], Oxford University Press 2010)\n* ''Metaphysical Essays'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2006)\n* ''Knowledge and Lotteries'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2004)\n* ''Substance and Individuation in Leibniz'' (with J.
