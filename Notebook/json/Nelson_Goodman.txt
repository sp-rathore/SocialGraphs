Roth, Christina J. Moose, Rowena Wildin (eds.), ''World Philosophers and Their Works: Freud, Sigmund - Oakeshott, Michael'', Salem Press, 2000, p. 735.</ref> He graduated from [[Harvard University]], [[A.B.]], [[magna cum laude]] (1928). During the 1930s, he ran an art gallery in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] while studying for a Harvard Ph.D. in [[philosophy]], which he completed in 1941.<ref name=\"Harvard Obituary\">{{cite web | url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1998/12.03/goodman.html | title=Goodman Dies | work=Harvard University Gazette | accessdate=18 January 2014}}</ref>  His experience as an art dealer helps explain his later turn towards [[aesthetics]], where he became better known than in [[logic]] and [[analytic philosophy]]. During [[World War II]], he served as a psychologist in the [[United States Army|US Army]].<ref>Gardner, Howard. 2000. ''Project Zero: Nelson Goodman's Legacy in Arts Education''. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (58)3, pp. 245–249.</ref>\n\nHe taught at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1946–1964, where his students included [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Sydney Morgenbesser]], [[Stephen Stich]], and [[Hilary Putnam]]. He was a research fellow at the Harvard Center for Cognitive Studies from 1962 to 1963 and was a professor at several universities from 1964 to 1967, before being appointed Professor of Philosophy at Harvard in 1968.\n\nIn 1967, at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, he was the founding director of Harvard Project Zero, a basic research project in artistic cognition and artistic education. He remained the director for four years and served as an informal adviser for many years thereafter.<ref>Gardner, H., and Perkins, D. \"The Mark of Zero: Project Zero’s Identity Revealed.\" HGSE Alumni Bulletin, December 1994, '''39'''(1), 2–6.</ref>\n\nGoodman died in [[Needham, Massachusetts]].\n\n===Induction and \"grue\"===\nIn his book ''[[Fact, Fiction, and Forecast]]'', Goodman introduced the \"[[new riddle of induction]]\", so-called by analogy with [[David Hume|Hume]]'s classical [[problem of induction]]. He accepted Hume's observation that [[inductive reasoning]] (i.e. inferring from past experience about events in the future) was based solely on human habit and regularities to which our day-to-day existence has accustomed us. Goodman argued, however, that Hume overlooked the fact that some regularities establish habits (a given piece of copper conducting electricity increases the credibility of statements asserting that other pieces of copper conduct electricity) while some do not (the fact that a given man in a room is a third son does not increase the credibility of statements asserting that other men in this room are third sons). How then can we differentiate between regularities or [[hypotheses]] that construe law-like statements from those that are [[contingent]] or based upon accidental generality?\n\n[[Carl Gustav Hempel|Hempel]]'s [[confirmation theory]] argued that the solution is to differentiate between hypotheses, which apply to all things of a certain class, and [[evidence]] statements, which apply to only one thing.  Goodman's famous counterargument was to introduce the predicate [[Grue and bleen|grue]], which applies to all things examined before a certain time ''t'' just in case they are green, but also to other things just in case they are blue and not examined before time ''t''. If we examine emeralds before time ''t'' and find that emerald ''a'' is green, emerald ''b'' is green, and so forth, each will confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are green. However, emeralds ''a, b, c,''..etc. also confirm the hypothesis that all emeralds are [[Grue and bleen|grue]].  Thus, before time ''t'', the apparently law-like statements \"All emeralds are green\" and \"All emeralds are grue\" are equally well confirmed by observation, but obviously \"All emeralds are grue\" is not a law-like statement.\n\nGoodman's example showed that the difficulty in determining what constitutes law-like statements is far greater than previously thought, and that once again we find ourselves facing the initial [[dilemma]] that \"anything can confirm anything\".\n\n===Nominalism and mereology===\nGoodman, along with [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]], is the founder of the contemporary variant of [[nominalism]], which argues that philosophy, logic, and mathematics should dispense with [[set theory]]. Goodman's nominalism was driven purely by [[ontology|ontological]] considerations. After a long and difficult 1947 paper coauthored with  [[W. V. O. Quine]], Goodman ceased to trouble himself with finding a way to reconstruct mathematics while dispensing with [[set theory]] – discredited as sole [[foundations of mathematics]] as of 1913 (Russell/Whitehead).\n\nThe program of [[David Hilbert]] to reconstruct it from logical axioms was proven futile in 1936 by Gödel.  Because of this and other failures of seemingly fruitful lines of research, \nQuine soon came to believe that such a reconstruction was impossible, but Goodman's Penn colleague [[Richard Milton Martin]] argued otherwise, writing a number of papers suggesting ways forward.\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Tymoczko]]'s ''afterword'' in ''New directions in the philosophy of mathematics'', Quine had \"urged that we abandon ad hoc devices distinguishing mathematics from science and just accept the resulting assimilation\", putting the \"key burden on the theories (networks of sentences) that we accept, not on the individual sentences whose significance can change dramatically depending on their theoretical context.\"  In so doing, Tymoczko claimed, [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science]] were merged into [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empiricism]]:  the emphasis of [[mathematical practice]] as effectively part of the [[scientific method]], an emphasis on method over result.\n\nThe Goodman–Leonard (1940) calculus of individuals is the starting point for the American variant of [[mereology]]. While the exposition in Goodman and Leonard invoked a bit of naive set theory, the variant of the calculus of individuals that grounds Goodman's 1951 ''The Structure of Appearance'', a revision and extension of his Ph.D. thesis, makes no mention of the notion of set (while his Ph.D. thesis still did).<ref>Cohnitz and Rossberg (2003), ch. 5</ref> Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) show that the calculus of individuals can be grounded in either a bit of set theory, or monadic predicates, schematically employed.  Mereology is accordingly \"ontologically neutral\" and retains some of Quine's pragmatism (which Tymoczko in 1998 carefully qualified as [[American Pragmatism]]).\n\n==Bibliography==\nClick [http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/%7Ejohn/GoodmanBib.html here] for information about translations of Goodman's books.\n* \"The Calculus of Individuals and Its Uses\" (with Henry S.
