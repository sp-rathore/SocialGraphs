Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path was to become a [[chemical engineer]]. This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]], after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious [[ETH Zurich]],{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=85–87}} which he passed in September 1923.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=97}} At the same time, von Neumann also entered [[Eötvös Loránd University|Pázmány Péter University]] in Budapest,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|authorlink=Ed Regis (author)|last=Regis |first=Ed|title=Johnny Jiggles the Planet|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D91239F93BA35752C1A964958260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 8, 1992|accessdate=February 4, 2008}}</ref> as a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidate in [[mathematics]].

[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets—the ''[[axiom of regularity|axiom of foundation]]'' and the notion of ''[[Class (set theory)|class]].''{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nThe axiom of foundation proposed that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel. If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the ''method of [[inner model]]s'', which later became an essential instrument in set theory.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nThe second approach to the problem of sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of [[Class (set theory)|class]], and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a ''proper class'' is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a ''proper class'' and not a set.{{sfn|Van Heijenoort|1967|pp=393–394}}\n\nWith this contribution of von Neumann, the axiomatic system of the theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms that could be used to prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of [[Königsberg]], in which [[Kurt Gödel]] announced his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|first theorem of incompleteness]]: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language.

Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of [[von Neumann algebra]]s with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions, and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the [[hyperfinite type II factor]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=140}}<ref>{{cite journal|first=John |last=von Neumann|doi=10.1007/BF01782352|title= Zur Algebra der Funktionaloperationen und Theorie der normalen Operatoren|language=German |journal= [[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=102 |issue=1 |year=1930|pages= 370–427|bibcode=1930MatAn.102..685E}}.

He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as [[linear operators]] acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}}\n\nThe ''physics'' of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the ''mathematics'' of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them. For example, the [[uncertainty principle]], according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa, is translated into the ''non-commutativity'' of the two corresponding operators. This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=139–141}} When Heisenberg was informed von Neumann had clarified the difference between an unbounded operator that was a [[self-adjoint operator]] and one that was merely symmetric, Heisenberg replied \"Eh? What is the difference?\"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=142}}\n\nVon Neumann's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non-determinism, and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined \"hidden variables,\" as in classical statistical mechanics. In 1966, [[John S. Bell]] published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid. However, in 2010, [[Jeffrey Bub]] argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, and pointed out that the proof, though not valid for all [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variable theories]], does rule out a well-defined and important subset. Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation, and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Von Neumann's 'No Hidden Variables' Proof: A Re-Appraisal|year=2010|last1=Bub|first1=Jeffrey|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]] | volume=40 | issue=9–10 | pages=1333–1340 |bibcode=2010FoPh...40.1333B |doi=10.1007/s10701-010-9480-9 |arxiv=1006.0499}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, the proof inaugurated a line of research that ultimately led, through the work of Bell in 1964 on [[Bell's theorem]], and the experiments of [[Alain Aspect]] in 1982, to the demonstration that quantum physics either requires a ''notion of reality'' substantially different from that of classical physics, or must include [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] in apparent violation of special relativity.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=37 |issue=4 |year=2006 |pages=577–616 |title=Philosophy enters the optics laboratory: Bell's theorem and its first experimental tests (1965–1982) |first=Olival Jr. |last=Freire |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2005.12.003 |bibcode=2006SHPMP..37..577F }}</ref>\n\nIn a chapter of ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', von Neumann deeply analyzed the so-called [[measurement problem]].

The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (''e.g.'', one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'', it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added ''in between'' the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the ''non-commutativity'' of conjunction <math>(A\\land B)\\ne (B\\land A)</math>. It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, <math>P\\lor(Q\\land R)=(P\\lor Q)\\land(P\\lor R)</math> and <math>P\\land (Q\\lor R)=(P\\land Q)\\lor(P\\land R)</math>, are not valid for quantum theory.<ref name=\"quantum logic\"/>\n\nThe reason for this is that a quantum disjunction, unlike the case for classical disjunction, can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is, in turn, attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case, in quantum mechanics, that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate, while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate. This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example. Suppose we are dealing with particles (such as electrons) of semi-integral spin (angular momentum) for which there are only two possible values: positive or negative. Then, a principle of indetermination establishes that the spin, relative to two different directions (e.g., ''x'' and ''y'') results in a pair of incompatible quantities. Suppose that the state '''ɸ''' of a certain electron verifies the proposition \"the spin of the electron in the ''x'' direction is positive.\" By the principle of indeterminacy, the value of the spin in the direction ''y'' will be completely indeterminate for '''ɸ'''. Hence, '''ɸ''' can verify neither the proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive\" nor\nthe proposition \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative.\" Nevertheless, the disjunction of the propositions \"the spin in the direction of ''y'' is positive or the spin in the direction of ''y'' is negative\" must be true for '''ɸ'''.\nIn the case of distribution, it is therefore possible to have a situation in which ''<math>A \\land (B\\lor C)= A\\land 1 = A</math>'', while <math>(A\\land B)\\lor (A\\land C)=0\\lor 0=0</math>.<ref name=\"quantum logic\">{{cite journal |title=The Logic of Quantum Mechanics |first=Garrett |last=Birkhoff |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |first2=John |last2=von Neumann |journal=Annals of Mathematics |volume=37 |issue=4 |date=October 1936 |pages=823–843 |doi=10.2307/1968621 |jstor=1968621 }}</ref>\n\nVon Neumann replaced classical logic with a logic constructed in [[orthomodular lattice]]s (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert space of a given physical system).<ref name=\"Putnam1985\">{{cite book|last=Putnam|first=Hilary |authorlink=Hilary Putnam|title=Philosophical Papers: Volume 3, Realism and Reason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAjfSA3ir3kC|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31394-0|page=263}}</ref>\n\n=== Game theory ===\nVon Neumann founded the field of [[game theory]] as a mathematical discipline.<ref name=\"KuhnTucker\">{{cite journal|last=Kuhn|first= H.

Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players, publishing this result in his 1944 ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' (written with [[Oskar Morgenstern]]). Morgenstern wrote a paper on game theory and thought he would show it to von Neumann because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then von Neumann became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a front-page story. In this book, von Neumann declared that economic theory needed to use [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods, especially [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed-point theorem]], rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the [[Maxima and minima|maximum]]-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.<ref name=\"KuhnTucker\"/>\n\nIndependently, [[Leonid Kantorovich]]'s functional analytic work on mathematical economics also focused attention on optimization theory, non-differentiability, and [[Riesz space|vector lattices]].

In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the \"intensity\" at which the production process would run. The unique solution ''λ'' represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy; the rate of growth equals the [[interest rate]].<ref>For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&nbsp;'''A''' and&nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue problem]]\n: '''A''' − λ '''I''' ''q'' = 0,\nwhere the nonnegative matrix''&nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]].

Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative [[least squares]] subproblem with a convexity constraint ([[Projection (linear algebra)#Orthogonal projections|projecting]] the zero-vector onto the [[convex hull]] of the active [[simplex]]). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first [[interior point method]] of linear programming.<ref name=\"George B 2003\"/>\n\n=== Mathematical statistics ===\nVon Neumann made fundamental contributions to [[mathematical statistics]]. In 1941, he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically [[Normal distribution|normally]] distributed variables.<ref>{{cite journal|author=von Neumann, John|year=1941|url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.aoms/1177731677|title=Distribution of the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance|journal=[[Annals of Mathematical Statistics]]|volume=12|pages=367–395|jstor=2235951|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177731677|issue=4}}</ref> This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the [[Durbin–Watson statistic]]<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|author=Durbin, J.|author2= Watson, G.

For example, with [[Robert D. Richtmyer]] he developed an algorithm defining ''artificial [[viscosity]]'' that improved the understanding of [[shock wave]]s. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of ''artificial viscosity'' smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A Method for the Numerical Calculation of Hydrodynamic Shocks |last=von Neumann |first=J. |last2=Richtmyer |first2=R.

For example, [[Norbert Wiener]] had mastered [[Fourier transform]]s. Some mathematicians have mastered two methods and might really impress someone who knows only one of them. John von Neumann had mastered three methods.\" He went on to explain that the three methods were:\n* A facility with the symbolic manipulation of linear operators;\n* An intuitive feeling for the logical structure of any new mathematical theory;\n* An intuitive feeling for the combinatorial superstructure of new theories.{{sfn|Ulam|1983|p=96}}\nEdward Teller wrote that \"Nobody knows all science, not even von Neumann did. But as for mathematics, he contributed to every part of it except number theory and topology. That is, I think, something unique.\"{{sfn|Dyson|1998|p=77}}\n\n== Nuclear weapons ==\n[[File:John von Neumann ID badge.png|thumb|250px|Von Neumann's wartime [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] ID badge photo]]\n\n=== Manhattan Project ===\nBeginning in the late 1930s, von Neumann developed an expertise in [[explosion]]s—phenomena that are difficult to model mathematically. During this period von Neumann was the leading authority of the mathematics of [[shaped charge]]s. This led him to a large number of military consultancies, primarily for the Navy, which in turn led to his involvement in the [[Manhattan Project]]. The involvement included frequent trips by train to the project's secret research facilities in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos, New Mexico]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nVon Neumann's principal contribution to the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] was in the concept and design of the [[nuclear weapon design|explosive lenses]] needed to compress the [[plutonium]] core of the [[Fat Man]] weapon that was later dropped on [[Nagasaki]]. While von Neumann did not originate the \"[[Nuclear weapon design#Implosion-type weapon|implosion]]\" concept, he was one of its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of \"assembly\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–133, 157–159}}\n\nWhen it turned out that there would not be enough [[uranium-235]] to make more than one bomb, the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann's idea was implemented. Implosion was the only method that could be used with the [[plutonium-239]] that was available from the [[Hanford Site]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=239–245}} He established the design of the [[explosive lens]]es required, but there remained concerns about \"edge effects\" and imperfections in the explosives.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=295}} His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5% from spherical symmetry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html |title=Section 8.0 The First Nuclear Weapons |publisher=Nuclear Weapons Frequently Asked Questions  |first=Carey |last=Sublette |accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref> After a series of failed attempts with models, this was achieved by [[George Kistiakowsky]], and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=320–327}}\n\nIn a visit to Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the pressure increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, it was determined that the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=209}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Implosion bomb animated.gif|thumb|left|Implosion mechanism]]\nAlong with four other scientists and various military personnel, von Neumann was included in the target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and Nagasaki as the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first targets of the atomic bomb]]. Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital [[Kyoto]], which had been spared the [[Air raids on Japan|bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities]], was von Neumann's first choice,{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=242–245}} a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General [[Leslie Groves]]. However, this target was dismissed by [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]].{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=268–276}}\n\nOn July 16, 1945, with numerous other Manhattan Project personnel, von Neumann was an eyewitness to the first atomic bomb blast, code named Trinity, conducted as a test of the implosion method device, at the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range|bombing range]] near [[Alamogordo Army Airfield]], {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. Based on his observation alone, von Neumann estimated the test had resulted in a blast equivalent to {{convert|5|ktonTNT|lk=on}} but [[Enrico Fermi]] produced a more accurate estimate of 10 kilotons by dropping scraps of torn-up paper as the shock wave passed his location and watching how far they scattered. The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=371–372}} It was in von Neumann's 1944 papers that the expression \"kilotons\" appeared for the first time.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=205}} After the war, [[Robert Oppenheimer]] remarked that the physicists involved in the Manhattan project had \"known sin\". Von Neumann's response was that \"sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it.\"{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=245}}\n\nVon Neumann continued unperturbed in his work and became, along with Edward Teller, one of those who sustained the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb project]]. He collaborated with [[Klaus Fuchs]] on further development of the bomb, and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on \"Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy\", which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate [[nuclear fusion]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pages=171, 374}} The Fuchs–von Neumann patent used [[radiation implosion]], but not in the same way as is used in what became the final hydrogen bomb design, the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Teller–Ulam design]]. Their work was, however, incorporated into the \"George\" shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], which was instructive in testing out concepts that went into the final design.<ref name=\"Bernstein2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jeremy|title=John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs: an Unlikely Collaboration|journal=Physics in Perspective|volume=12|pages=36–50|year=2010|doi=10.1007/s00016-009-0001-1|bibcode = 2010PhP....12...36B}}</ref> The Fuchs–von Neumann work was passed on to the Soviet Union by Fuchs as part of his [[nuclear espionage]], but it was not used in the Soviets' own, independent development of the Teller–Ulam design. The historian [[Jeremy Bernstein]] has pointed out that ironically, \"John von Neumann and Klaus Fuchs, produced a brilliant invention in 1946 that could have changed the whole course of the development of the hydrogen bomb, but was not fully understood until after the bomb had been successfully made.\"<ref name=\"Bernstein2010\"/>\n\nFor his wartime services, von Neumann was awarded the [[Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award]] in July 1946, and the [[Medal for Merit]] in October 1946.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|p=208}}\n\n=== Atomic Energy Commission ===\nIn 1950, von Neumann became a consultant to the [[Weapons Systems Evaluation Group]] (WSEG),{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=350–351}} whose function was to advise the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and the [[United States Secretary of Defense]] on the development and use of new technologies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weapons' Values to be Appraised|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wBIzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ufUDAAAAIBAJ&dq=weapons-systems-evaluation-group&pg=7379%2C6398588|date=December 15, 1948|newspaper=[[Spokane Daily Chronicle]]|accessdate=January 8, 2015 }}</ref> He also became an adviser to the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (AFSWP), which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons. Over the following two years, he became a consultant to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), a member of the influential [[General Advisory Committee]] of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]], a consultant to the newly established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], and a member of the [[Scientific Advisory Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=350–351}}\n\nIn 1955, von Neumann became a commissioner of the AEC. He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact [[hydrogen bomb]]s suitable for [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of [[tritium]] and [[lithium 6]] needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the intermediate range missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, which turned out to be the case.{{sfn|Heims|1980|p=276}}{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=367–369}} Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 [[Oppenheimer security hearing]], at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.<ref name=\"Halmos\"/>\n\nShortly before his death, when he was already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would sometimes meet in his home. Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The [[SM-65 Atlas]] passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=359–365}}\n\n=== Mutual assured destruction ===\n[[File:Redwing Mohawk 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Redwing]] nuclear test in July 1956]]\nVon Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of [[mutual assured destruction]], providing the deliberately humorous acronym, MAD. (Other humorous acronyms coined by von Neumann include his computer, the [[MANIAC I|Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator, and Computer]]—or MANIAC). He also \"moved heaven and earth\" to bring MAD about. His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR, and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the [[CIA]] interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany, and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA. The Russians considered that bombers would soon be vulnerable, and they shared von Neumann's view that an H-bomb in an ICBM was the [[ne plus ultra]] of weapons; they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world, without necessarily using them.{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=362–363}} He was afraid of a \"missile gap\" and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets:\n*He modified the ENIAC by making it programmable and then wrote programs for it to do the H-bomb calculations verifying that the Teller-Ulam design was feasible and to develop it further.\n*Through the Atomic Energy Commission, he promoted the development of a compact H-bomb that would fit in an ICBM.\n*He personally interceded to speed up the production of lithium-6 and tritium needed for the compact bombs.\n*He caused several separate missile projects to be started, because he felt that competition combined with collaboration got the best results.{{sfn|Heims|1980|pp=258–260}}\nVon Neumann's assessment that the Soviets had a lead in missile technology, considered pessimistic at the time, was soon proven correct in the [[Sputnik crisis]].{{sfn|Macrae|1992|pp=362–364}}\n\nVon Neumann entered government service (Manhattan Project) primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the US would triumph over totalitarianism from [[Nazism]], [[Fascism]] and [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communism]].<ref name=\"whitman\">{{cite web|url=http://256.com/gray/docs/misc/conversation_with_marina_whitman.shtml|title=Conversation with Marina Whitman|publisher=Gray Watson (256.com)|accessdate=January 30, 2011|ref=whiteman}}</ref> During a [[United States Senate|Senate]] committee hearing he described his political ideology as \"violently [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], and much more militaristic than the norm\".

At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles. When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: \"Oh, you must have heard the trick before!\" \"What trick?\" asked von Neumann, \"All I did was sum the geometric series.\"<ref name=\"Halmos\"/>}}\nEugene Wigner told a similar story, only with a swallow instead of a fly, and says it was [[Max Born]] who posed the question to von Neumann in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web|title=John von Neumann – A Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTS9O0CoVng&feature=youtu.be&t=1006|publisher=The Mathematical Association of American|accessdate=22 February 2016|pages=16m46s–19m04s|date=1966}}</ref>\n\n[[Herman Goldstine]] wrote: <blockquote>One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall.
