Curry is best known for his work in [[combinatory logic]]; while the initial concept of combinatory logic was based on a single paper by [[Moses Schönfinkel]],<ref>1924. \"Über die Bausteine der mathematischen Logik\", ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''92''', pp.&nbsp;305&ndash;316. Translated by Stefan Bauer-Mengelberg as \"On the building blocks of mathematical logic\" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], 1967. ''A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879&ndash;1931''. Harvard Univ. Press: 355&ndash;66.</ref> much of the development was done by Curry. Curry is also known for [[Curry's paradox]] and the [[Curry&ndash;Howard correspondence]]. There are three programming languages named after him, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Brook (programming language)|Brook]] and [[Curry (programming language)|Curry]], as well as the concept of ''[[currying]]'', a technique used for transforming functions in mathematics and computer science.\n\n== Life ==\n\nCurry was born on September 12, 1900, in [[Millis, Massachusetts]], to Samuel Silas Curry and Anna Baright Curry, who ran a school for [[elocution]]. He entered [[Harvard University]] in 1916 to study medicine but switched to mathematics before graduating in 1920.  After two years of graduate work in electrical engineering at MIT, he returned to Harvard to study physics, earning a MA in 1924. Curry's interest in mathematical logic started during this period when he was introduced to the [[Principia Mathematica]], the attempt by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] to ground mathematics in symbolic logic. Remaining at Harvard, Curry pursued a Ph.D. in mathematics. While he was directed by [[George Birkhoff]] to work on differential equations, his interests continued to shift to logic. In 1927, while an instructor at Princeton University, he discovered the work of [[Moses Schönfinkel]] in combinatory logic. Schönfinkel's work had anticipated much of Curry's own research, and as a consequence, he moved to [[Georg August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] where he could work with [[Heinrich Behmann]] and [[Paul Bernays]], who were familiar with Schönfinkel's work. Curry was supervised by [[David Hilbert]] and worked closely with Bernays, receiving a Ph.D. in 1930 with a dissertation on combinatory logic.<ref name=\"Seldin 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Seldin|first=Jonathan|title=The Logic of Curry and Church}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, before leaving for Göttingen, Curry married Mary Virginia Wheatley. The couple lived in Germany while Curry completed his dissertation, then, in 1929, moved to [[State College, Pennsylvania]] where Curry accepted a position at [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State College]]. They had two children, Anne Wright Curry (July 27, 1930) and Robert Wheatley Curry (July 6, 1934). Curry remained at Penn State for the next 37 years. He spent one year at [[University of Chicago]] in 1931&ndash;32 under a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Fellowship]] and one year in 1938&ndash;39 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton. In 1942 he took a leave of absence to do applied mathematics for the US government during [[World War II]]. Immediately after the war he worked on the [[ENIAC]] project, in 1945 and 1946. Under a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellowship]], he collaborated with [[Robert Feys]] in [[Leuven|Louvain]], Belgium. After retiring from Penn State in 1966, Curry accepted a position at the [[University of Amsterdam]]. In 1970, after finishing the second volume of his treatise on the combinatory logic, Curry retired from the University of Amsterdam and returned to State College, Pennsylvania.\n\nHaskell Curry died on September 1, 1982 in State College, Pennsylvania.\n\n== Work ==\n\nThe focus of Curry's work were attempts to show that [[combinatory logic]] could provide a foundation for mathematics. Towards the end of 1933, he learned of the [[Kleene&ndash;Rosser paradox]] from correspondence with [[John Barkley Rosser|John Rosser]]. The paradox, developed by Rosser and [[Stephen Kleene]] had proved the inconsistency of a number of related formal systems including one proposed by [[Alonzo Church]] (a system which had the lambda calculus as a consistent subsystem) and Curry's own system.<ref name=\"Seldin 2006\" />  However, unlike Church, Kleene, and Rosser, Curry did not give up on the foundational approach, saying that he did not want to \"run away from paradoxes.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Barendregt|first=H.P.|title=The Lambda Calculus: Its Syntax and Semantics|publisher=Elsevier|page=4}}</ref>\n\nBy working in the area of Combinatory Logic for his entire career, Curry essentially became the founder and biggest name in the field. Combinatory logic is the foundation for one style of [[functional programming language]]. The power and scope of combinatory logic is quite similar to that of the [[lambda calculus]] of [[Alonzo Church|Church]], and the latter formalism has tended to predominate in recent decades.\n\nIn 1947 Curry also described one of the first high-level programming languages and provided the first description of a procedure to convert a general arithmetic expression into a code for one-address computer.\n<ref>Knuth, Donald E.; Pardo, Luis Trabb (1976). \"Early development of programming languages\". Stanford University, Computer Science Department, p. 22</ref>\n\nHe taught at Harvard, [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and from 1929 to 1966, at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. In 1942, he published [[Curry's paradox]]. In 1966 he became professor of mathematics at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]].\n\nCurry also wrote and taught [[mathematical logic]] more generally; his teaching in this area culminated in his 1963 ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''. His preferred philosophy of mathematics was formalism (cf. his 1951 book), following his mentor Hilbert, but his writings betray substantial philosophical curiosity and a very open mind about [[intuitionistic logic]].\n\n== Major publications ==\n*{{cite journal |displayauthors=0 |last=Curry |first=Haskell Brooks |authorlink=Haskell Curry |date=1930 |title=Grundlagen der Kombinatorischen Logik  |trans_title=Foundations of combinatorial logic |journal=American Journal of Mathematics |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |language=German |doi=10.2307/2370619 |volume=52 |number=3 |pages=509–536 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2370619 |accessdate=23 July 2012}}\n*{{cite book |displayauthors=0 |last=Curry |first=Haskell B. |authorlink=Haskell Curry |date=1950 |title=A theory of formal deducibility |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press}}<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=D. |authorlink=Nels David Nelson |date=1952 |title=Review: ''A theory of formal deducibility'', by H.
