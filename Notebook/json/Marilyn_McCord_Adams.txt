Her work on the problem of evil largely focuses on what she calls \"horrendous evils\".<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Horrendous-Goodness-Cornell-Philosophy-Religion/dp/0801486866]</ref> She is an avowed [[universal reconciliation|Christian universalist]], believing that ultimately all will receive salvation and restoration in Christ:\n\n<blockquote>Traditional doctrines of [[hell]] err again by supposing either that God does not get what God wants with every human being (\"God wills all humans to be saved\" by God's antecedent will) or that God deliberately creates some for ruin. To be sure, many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons. Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven. Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us, to rear each and all of us up into the household of God. They conclude that God is left with the option of merely human penal systems &ndash; viz., liquidation or quarantine!<ref>Cited by Richard Beck: \"[http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2007/03/christ-and-horrors-part-3-horror-defeat.html Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation]\", ''Experimental Theology'', 19 March 2007.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n* Adams, Marilyn McCord.
