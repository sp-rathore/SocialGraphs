Educated at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]], he had strong interests and training in both the [[history of philosophy]] and contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at [[Princeton University]] in the 1960s.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/#1</ref>  He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a \"mirror of nature\") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at [[Princeton University]], Kenan Professor of Humanities at the [[University of Virginia]], and Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Stanford University]]. Among his most influential books are ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979), ''Consequences of Pragmatism'' (1982), and ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989).\n\nRorty saw the idea of knowledge as a \"mirror of nature\" as pervasive throughout the history of [[western philosophy]]. Against this approach, Rorty advocated for a novel form of [[American pragmatism]], sometimes called [[neopragmatism]], in which scientific and philosophical methods form merely a set of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] \"[[final vocabulary|vocabularies]]\" which people abandon or adopt over time according to social conventions and usefulness. Abandoning [[representationalist]] accounts of knowledge and language, Rorty believed, would lead to a state of mind he referred to as \"[[ironist|ironism]],\" in which people become completely aware of the contingency of their placement in history and of their philosophical vocabulary. Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of \"social hope\"; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation ([[Richard J. Bernstein|Bernstein]] 1971), constitutes the crucial concept of a \"[[postphilosophy|postphilosophical]]\" culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards [[liberalism]].\n\n==Biography==\nRichard Rorty was born on October 4, 1931, in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/309903.html |title=Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher |publisher=press.uchicago.edu |date=1931-10-04 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}</ref> His parents, James and Winifred Rorty, were activists, writers and social democrats.

July 22, 2007: p 27.</ref>\n\nRorty's doctoral dissertation, \"The Concept of Potentiality\" was an historical study of the concept, completed under the supervision of [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], but his first book (as editor), ''The Linguistic Turn'' (1967), was firmly in the prevailing [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] mode, collecting classic essays on the [[linguistic turn]] in analytic philosophy. However, he gradually became acquainted with the American philosophical movement known as [[pragmatism]], particularly the writings of [[John Dewey]]. The noteworthy work being done by analytic philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] caused significant shifts in his thinking, which were reflected in his next book, ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979).\n\n[[Pragmatists]] generally hold that the meaning of a proposition is determined by its use in linguistic practice. Rorty combined pragmatism about truth and other matters with a [[Philosophical Investigations|later]] [[Wittgenstein]]ian [[philosophy of language]] which declares that [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] is a social-linguistic product, and sentences do not 'link up' with the world in a correspondence relation. Rorty wrote in his ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989):\n\n<blockquote>\"Truth cannot be out there—cannot exist independently of the human mind—because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. The world is out there, but descriptions of the world are not. Only descriptions of the world can be true or false. The world on its own unaided by the describing activities of humans cannot.”(5)</blockquote>\n\nViews like this led Rorty to question many of philosophy's most basic assumptions—and have also led to him being apprehended as a postmodern/deconstructionist philosopher. Indeed, from the late 1980s through the 1990s, Rorty focused on the [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]], examining the works of [[Friederich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. His work from this period included ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity'', ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'' (1991) and ''Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers'' (1998). The latter two works attempt to bridge the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy by claiming that the two traditions complement rather than oppose each other.\n\nAccording to Rorty, analytic philosophy may not have lived up to its pretensions and may not have solved the puzzles it thought it had. Yet such philosophy, in the process of finding reasons for putting those pretensions and puzzles aside, helped earn itself an important place in the history of ideas. By giving up on the quest for [[apodictic]]ity and finality that [[Edmund Husserl]] shared with [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], and by finding new reasons for thinking that such quest will never succeed, analytic philosophy cleared a path that leads past [[scientism]], just as the [[idealism|German idealists]] cleared a path that led around [[empiricism]].\n\nIn the last fifteen years of his life, Rorty continued to publish his writings, including four volumes of his archived philosophical papers, ''[[Achieving Our Country]]'' (1998), a political manifesto partly based on readings of Dewey and [[Walt Whitman]] in which he defended the idea of a [[Progressivism|progressive]], pragmatic left against what he feels are defeatist, anti-liberal, anti-humanist positions espoused by the critical left and continental school. Rorty felt these anti-humanist positions were personified by figures like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault. Such theorists were also guilty of an \"inverted Platonism\" in which they attempted to craft overarching, metaphysical, \"sublime\" philosophies—which in fact contradicted their core claims to be ironist and contingent. Rorty's last works, after his move to Stanford University, focused on the place of [[religion]] in contemporary life, liberal communities, comparative literature and philosophy as \"cultural politics.\"\n\nShortly before his death, he wrote a piece called \"The Fire of Life,\" (published in the November 2007 issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine),<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180185 | title=The Fire of Life | author=Rorty, Richard | journal=Poetry magazine |date=November 2007}}</ref> in which he meditates on his diagnosis and the comfort of poetry. He concludes, \"I now wish that I had spent somewhat more of my life with verse. This is not because I fear having missed out on truths that are incapable of statement in prose. There are no such truths; there is nothing about death that [[Swinburne]] and [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]] knew but [[Epicurus]] and Heidegger failed to grasp. Rather, it is because I would have lived more fully if I had been able to rattle off more old chestnuts—just as I would have if I had made more close friends. Cultures with richer vocabularies are more fully human—farther removed from the beasts—than those with poorer ones; individual men and women are more fully human when their memories are amply stocked with verses.\"\n\nOn June 8, 2007, Rorty died in his home from [[pancreatic cancer]].<ref name=sa/><ref name=nyto/><ref>[http://www.telospress.com/main/index.php?main_page=news_article&article_id=188 \"Richard Rorty,\"] (short obituary), June 9, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Major works==\n\n===''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''===\n{{main|Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature}}\nIn ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' (1979), Rorty argues that the central problems of modern [[epistemology]] depend upon a picture of the mind as trying to faithfully represent (or \"mirror\") a mind-independent, external reality. If we give up this metaphor, then the entire enterprise of [[anti-foundationalism|foundationalist epistemology is misguided]]. A foundationalist believes that in order to avoid the regress inherent in claiming that all beliefs are justified by other beliefs, some beliefs must be self-justifying and form the foundations to all knowledge.\n\nThere were two senses of \"foundationalism\" criticized in ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''. In the epistemological sense, Rorty criticized the attempt to justify knowledge claims by tracing them to a set of foundations (e.g., self-evident premises or noninferential sensations); more broadly, he criticized the claim of philosophy to function foundationally within a culture. The former argument draws on Sellars's critique of the idea that there is a \"given\" in sensory perception, in combination with Quine's [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|critique]] of the distinction between analytic sentences (sentences which are true solely in virtue of what they mean) and synthetic sentences (sentences made true by the world). Each critique, taken alone, provides a problem for a conception of how philosophy ought to proceed, yet leaves enough of the tradition intact to proceed with its former aspirations. Combined, Rorty claimed, the two critiques are devastating. With no privileged insight into the structure of belief and no privileged realm of truths of meaning, we have, instead, knowledge as those beliefs that pay their way. The only worthwhile description of the actual process of inquiry, Rorty claimed, was a [[Thomas S. Kuhn|Kuhnian]] account of the standard phases of the progress of disciplines, oscillating through [[normal science|normal]] and abnormal periods, between routine problem-solving and intellectual crises.\n\nAfter rejecting foundationalism, Rorty argues that one of the few roles left for a philosopher is to act as an intellectual gadfly, attempting to induce a revolutionary break with previous practice, a role that Rorty was happy to take on himself. Rorty suggests that each generation tries to subject all disciplines to the model that the most successful discipline of the day employs. In Rorty's view, the success of modern science has led academics in philosophy and the humanities to mistakenly imitate scientific methods. ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' popularized and extended ideas of [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (the critique of the [[Myth of the given]]) and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (the critique of the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]) and others who advocate the Wittgensteinian doctrine of \"dissolving\" rather than solving philosophical problems.\n\n===''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''===\n{{main|Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity}}\nIn ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity'' (1989), Rorty abandons specifically analytic modes of explication in favor of narrative pastiche in order to develop an alternative conceptual vocabulary to that of the \"Platonists\" he rejects. This schema is based on the belief that there is no worthwhile theory of truth, aside from a boring, non-epistemic semantic one (as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] developed out of the work of [[Alfred Tarski]]). Rorty suggests that the task of philosophy should be distinguished along public and private lines. Private philosophers, who provide one with greater abilities to (re)create oneself, a view adapted from Nietzsche and which Rorty also identifies with the novels of [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], should not be expected to help with public problems. For a [[public philosophy]], one might turn to [[John Rawls|Rawls]] or [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]].\n\nThis book also marks his first attempt to specifically articulate a political vision consistent with his philosophy, the vision of a diverse community bound together by opposition to cruelty, and not by abstract ideas such as 'justice' or 'common humanity,' policed by the separation of the public and private realms of life.\n\nIn this book, Rorty introduces the terminology of [[Ironism]], which he uses to describe his mindset and his philosophy.\n\n===''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth''===\nAmongst the essays in ''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), is \"The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy,\" in which Rorty defends Rawls against communitarian critics. Rorty argues that liberalism can \"get along without philosophical presuppositions,\" while at the same time conceding to communitarians that \"a conception of the self that makes the community constitutive of the self does comport well with liberal democracy.\"<ref>Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), p 179</ref>  For Rorty, social institutions ought to be thought of as \"experiments in cooperation rather than as attempts to embody a universal and ahistorical order.\"<ref>Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), p 196</ref>\n\n===''Essays on Heidegger and Others''===\nIn this text, Rorty focuses primarily on the continental philosophers Heidegger and Derrida. He argues that these European \"post-Nietzscheans\" share much with American pragmatists, in that they critique metaphysics and reject the correspondence theory of truth. When discussing Derrida, Rorty claims that Derrida is most useful when viewed as a funny writer who attempted to circumvent the Western philosophical tradition, rather than the inventor of a philosophical (or literary) \"method.\" In this vein, Rorty criticizes Derrida's followers like [[Paul de Man]] for taking deconstructive literary theory too seriously.\n\n===''Achieving Our Country''===\n{{main|Achieving Our Country}}\nIn ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America'' (1997), Rorty differentiates between what he sees as the two sides of the Left, a cultural Left and a progressive Left. He criticizes the cultural Left, which is exemplified by post-structuralists such as Foucault and postmodernists such as Lyotard, for offering critiques of society, but no alternatives (or alternatives that are so vague and general as to be abdications). Although these intellectuals make insightful claims about the ills of society, Rorty suggests that they provide no alternatives and even occasionally deny the possibility of progress. On the other hand, the progressive Left, exemplified for Rorty by the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] Dewey, Whitman and James Baldwin, makes hope for a better future its priority. Without hope, Rorty argues, change is spiritually inconceivable and the cultural Left has begun to breed cynicism. Rorty sees the progressive Left as acting in the philosophical spirit of pragmatism.\n\n==On human rights==\nRorty's notion of [[human rights]] is grounded on the notion of [[sentimentality]]. He contended that throughout history humans have devised various means of construing certain groups of individuals as inhuman or subhuman. Thinking in rationalist (foundationalist) terms will not solve this problem, he claimed. Rorty advocated the creation of a culture of global human rights in order to stop violations from happening through a sentimental education. He argued that we should create a sense of [[empathy]] or teach empathy to others so as to understand others' suffering.<ref>See Barreto, José-Manuel.

American novelist [[David Foster Wallace]] titled a short story in his collection ''[[Oblivion: Stories]]'' \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature,\" and critics have accredited Rorty's influence to some of Wallace's writings on Irony.<ref>{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|title=The Afterlife of David Foster Wallace|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Afterlife-of-David-Foster/125823|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Susan Haack]] has been a fierce critic of Rorty's neopragmatism.

For Haack, the only link between Rorty's neopragmatism and the pragmatism of Peirce is the name.

These people would combine an ongoing attention to the particular as opposed to the transcendent ([[nominalism]]), with an awareness of their place in a continuum of contingent lived experience alongside other individuals ([[historicist]]), without necessarily having continual doubts about the resulting worldview as the ironist does. An ironist is someone who: 1) \"has radical and continuing doubts about their final vocabulary\"; 2) \"realizes that argument phrased in their vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts\"; and 3) \"does not think their vocabulary is closer to reality than others\" (all 73, ''Contingency, irony, and solidarity''). On the other hand, the Italian philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] alongside the Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism|Hermeneutic Communism: from Heidegger to Marx]]'' affirm that \"together with Richard Rorty we also consider it a flaw that `the main thing contemporary academic Marxists inherit from Marx and Engels is the conviction that the quest for the cooperative commonwealth should be scientific rather than [[utopian]], knowing rather than [[Romanticism|romantic]].′ As we will show hermeneutics contains all the utopian and romantic features that Rorty refers to because, contrary to the knowledge of science, it does not claim modern universality but rather postmodern particularism.”<ref>[[Gianni Vattimo]] and Santiago Zabala.
