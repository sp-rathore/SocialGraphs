An eclectic thinker, combining elements of [[German idealism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Western Marxism]], and [[Jewish mysticism]], Benjamin made enduring and influential contributions to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]], [[literary criticism]], and [[historical materialism]]. He was associated with the [[Frankfurt School]], and also maintained formative friendships with thinkers such as [[playwright]] [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kabbalah]] scholar [[Gershom Scholem]]. He was also related by law to [[Germans|German]] [[political theory|political theorist]] [[Hannah Arendt]] through her first marriage to his cousin, [[Günther Anders]].\n\nAmong Benjamin's best known works are the essays \"The Task of the Translator\" (1923), \"[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]\" (1936), and \"[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]\" (1940). His major work as a literary critic included essays on [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Kraus]], [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Robert Walser (writer)|Walser]], and [[translation theory]]. He also made major translations into German of the ''Tableaux Parisiens'' section of Baudelaire's ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' and parts of Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la recherche du temps perdu]]''. In 1940, at the age of 48, Benjamin committed suicide in [[Portbou]] at the French–Spanish border while attempting to escape from invading [[Nazism|Nazi forces]]. Though popular acclaim eluded him during his life, the decades following his death won his work posthumous renown.\n\n== Life ==\n{{Frankfurt School}}\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nBenjamin and his younger siblings, Georg (1895–1942) and Dora (1901–1946), were born to a wealthy business family of assimilated [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in the Berlin of the [[German Empire]] (1871–1918). The patriarch of Walter Benjamin's family, Emil Benjamin, was a banker in Paris who relocated from France to Germany, where he worked as an antiques trader in Berlin; he later married Pauline Schönflies. He owned a number of investments in Berlin, including ice skating rinks. Benjamin's uncle [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] (born Wilhelm Louis Stern; 1871-1938) was a prominent German [[child psychology|child psychologist]] who developed the concept of the [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ), and Benjamin's cousin [[Günther Anders]] (born Günther Siegmund Stern; 1902-1992) was a German philosopher and anti-nuclear activist who studied under [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1902, ten-year-old Walter was enrolled to the Kaiser Friedrich School in [[Charlottenburg]]; he completed his secondary school studies ten years later. Walter Benjamin was a boy of fragile health and so in 1905 the family sent him to Hermann-Lietz-Schule Haubinda, a [[boarding school]] in the [[Thuringia]]n countryside, for two years; in 1907, having returned to Berlin, he resumed his schooling at the Kaiser Friedrich School.<ref name=\"Witte\" />\n\nIn 1912, at the age of twenty, he enrolled at the [[University of Freiburg]], but, at summer semester's end, returned to Berlin, then matriculated into the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], to continue studying philosophy. Here Benjamin had his first exposure to the ideas of [[Zionism]], which had not been part of his liberal upbringing. This exposure gave him occasion to formulate his own ideas about the meaning of Judaism. Benjamin distanced himself from political and nationalist Zionism, instead developing in his own thinking what he called a kind of \"cultural Zionism\"—an attitude which recognized and promoted Judaism and Jewish values. In Benjamin's formulation his Jewishness meant a commitment to the furtherance of European culture. Benjamin expressed \"My life experience led me to this insight: the Jews represent an elite in the ranks of the spiritually active ... For Judaism is to me in no sense an end in itself, but the most distinguished bearer and representative of the spiritual.\" This was a position that Benjamin largely held lifelong.<ref>Witte, Bernd. (1996) ''Walter Benjamin: An Intellectual Biography''. New York: Verso. pp. 26–27</ref>\n\nElected president of the ''Freie Studentenschaft'' (Free Students Association), Benjamin wrote essays arguing for educational and general cultural change.<ref>'' Experience'', 1913</ref> When not re-elected as student association president, he returned to Freiburg University to study, with particular attention to the lectures of [[Heinrich Rickert]]; at that time he travelled to France and Italy.\n\nIn 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War (1914–1918), Benjamin began faithfully translating the works of the 19th-century French poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821–1867). The next year, 1915, he moved to Munich, and continued his schooling at the [[University of Munich]], where he met [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]; the latter became a friend. In that year, Benjamin wrote about the 18th-century  [[Romanticism|Romantic]] German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] (1770–1843).\n\nIn 1917 he transferred to the [[University of Bern]]; there, he met [[Ernst Bloch]], and Dora Sophie Pollak (née Kellner) (1890–1964) whom he later married. They had a son, Stefan Rafael (1918–1972). In 1919 Benjamin earned his [[Ph.D.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' with the dissertation ''Begriff der Kunstkritik in der Deutschen Romantik'' (''The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism''). Later, unable to support himself and family, he returned to Berlin and resided with his parents. In 1921 he  published the essay ''Kritik der Gewalt'' (The Critique of Violence). At this time Benjamin first became socially acquainted with [[Leo Strauss]], and would remain an admirer of Strauss and of his work throughout his life.<ref>''Jewish philosophy and the crisis of modernity'' (SUNY 1997), ''Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish thinker'', Kenneth Hart Green, Leo Strauss, page 55</ref><ref>Scholem, Gershom. 1981.

Harry Zohn, page 201</ref><ref>''The Correspondence of Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem, 1932–40'', New York 1989, page 155-58</ref>\n\n=== Career ===\nIn 1923, when the ''[[Institute for Social Research|Institut für Sozialforschung]]'' (Institute for Social Research) was founded, later to become home to the [[Frankfurt School]], Benjamin published ''Charles Baudelaire, Tableaux Parisiens''. At that time he became acquainted with [[Theodor Adorno]] and befriended [[Georg Lukács]], whose ''The Theory of the Novel'' (1920) much influenced him. Meanwhile, the [[inflation in the Weimar Republic]] consequent to the First World War made it difficult for the father Emil Benjamin to continue supporting his son's family. At the end of 1923 his best friend Gershom Scholem emigrated to Palestine, a country under the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]; despite repeated invitations, he failed to persuade Benjamin (and family) to leave the Continent for the Middle East.\n\nIn 1924 [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], in the ''Neue Deutsche Beiträge'' magazine, published ''Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften'' (''[[Elective Affinities Goethe's|Elective Affinities]]''), by Walter Benjamin, about Goethe's third novel, ''[[Elective Affinities|Die Wahlverwandtschaften]]'' (1809). Later that year Benjamin and Ernst Bloch resided on the Italian island of [[Capri]]; Benjamin wrote ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''), as a [[habilitation]] dissertation meant to qualify him as a tenured university professor in Germany. He also read, at Bloch's suggestion, ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) by Georg Lukács. He also met the Latvian Bolshevik and actress [[Asja Lācis]], then residing in Moscow; she became his lover and was a lasting intellectual influence upon him.\n\nA year later, in 1925, Benjamin withdrew the  ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as his possible qualification for the habilitation teaching credential at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] at Frankfurt am Main, fearing its possible rejection;<ref name=\"BL\">Jane O. Newman, ''Benjamin's Library: Modernity, Nation, and the Baroque'', Cornell University Press, 2011, p. 28: \"...university officials in Frankfurt recommended that Benjamin withdraw the work from consideration as his Habilitation.\"</ref> he was not to be an academic instructor. Working with [[Franz Hessel]] (1880–1941) he translated the first volumes of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' (In Search of Lost Time) by [[Marcel Proust]]. The next year, 1926, he began writing for the German newspapers ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' (The Frankfurt Times) and ''Die Literarische Welt'' (The Literary World); that paid enough for him to reside in Paris for some months. In December 1926 (the year his father, Emil Benjamin, died) Walter Benjamin went to Moscow to meet Asja Lācis and found her ill in a sanatorium.<ref>''Moscow Diary''</ref>\n\nIn 1927, he began ''[[The Arcades Project|Das Passagen-Werk]]'' (The Arcades Project), his uncompleted ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', a study of 19th-century Parisian life. The same year, he saw Gershom Scholem in Berlin, for the last time, and considered emigrating from Continental Europe (Germany) to Palestine. In 1928, he and Dora separated (they divorced two years later, in 1930); in the same year he published ''Einbahnstraße'' (One-Way Street), and a revision of his habilitation dissertation ''Ursprung des Deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''The Origin of German Tragic Drama''). In 1929 Berlin, Asja Lācis, then assistant to [[Bertolt Brecht]], socially presented the intellectuals to each other. In that time, he also briefly embarked upon an academic career, as an instructor at the [[University of Heidelberg]].\n\n=== Exile and death ===\n[[File:Benjamin's apartment in Paris (fot. Mateusz Palka).jpg|thumb|150px|Walter Benjamin's Paris apartment at 10 [[:fr:Rue Dombasle|rue Dombasle]] (1938–1940)]]\nIn 1932, during the turmoil preceding [[Adolf Hitler]]'s assumption of the office of Chancellor of Germany, Walter Benjamin left Germany for the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]] for some months; he then moved to [[Nice]], where he considered killing himself. Perceiving the socio-political and cultural significance of the [[Reichstag fire]] (27 February 1933) as the ''de facto'' Nazi assumption of full power in Germany, then manifest with the subsequent [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|persecution of the Jews]], he moved to Paris, but, before doing so, he sought shelter in [[Svendborg]], at Bertolt Brecht's house, and at [[Sanremo]], where his ex-wife Dora lived.\n\nAs he ran out of money, Benjamin collaborated with [[Max Horkheimer]], and received funds from the Institute for Social Research, later going permanently into exile. In Paris, he met other German artists and intellectuals, refugees there from Germany; he befriended [[Hannah Arendt]], novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], and composer [[Kurt Weill]]. In 1936, a first version of ''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'' (''L'œuvre d'art à l'époque de sa reproduction méchanisée'') was published, in French, by Max Horkheimer in the ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'' journal of the [[Institute for Social Research]].\n\nIn 1937 Benjamin worked on ''Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire'' (The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire), met [[Georges Bataille]] (to whom he later entrusted the ''Arcades Project'' manuscript), and joined the [[College of Sociology]]. In 1938 he paid a last visit to Bertolt Brecht, who was exiled to Denmark. Meanwhile, the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Régime]] stripped German Jews of their German citizenship; now a stateless man, Benjamin was arrested by the French government and incarcerated for three months in a prison camp near [[Nevers]], in central [[Burgundy (French region)|Burgundy]].\n\n[[File:Grab Walter Benjamin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Walter Benjamin's grave in Portbou. The epitaph in German, repeated in Catalan, quotes from Section 7 of ''Theses on the Philosophy of History'': \"There is no document of culture which is not at the same time a document of barbarism\"]]\nReturning to Paris in January 1940, he wrote ''Über den Begriff der Geschichte'' (''On the Concept of History'', later published as ''[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]''). As the [[Wehrmacht]] defeated the French defence, on 13 June, Benjamin and his sister fled Paris to the town of [[Lourdes]], a day before the Germans entered Paris (14 June 1940), with orders to arrest him at his flat. In August, he obtained a travel visa to the US that Max Horkheimer had negotiated for him. In eluding the [[Gestapo]], Benjamin planned to travel to the US from neutral Portugal, which he expected to reach via [[Francoist Spain|fascist Spain]], then ostensibly a neutral country.\n\nThe historical record indicates that he safely crossed the French–Spanish border and arrived at the coastal town of [[Portbou]], in [[Catalonia]]. The Franco government had cancelled all transit visas and ordered the Spanish police to return such persons to France, including the Jewish refugee group Benjamin had joined. It was told by the Spanish police{{when|date=November 2012}} that it would be deported back to France, which would have destroyed Benjamin's plans to travel to the United States. Expecting repatriation to Nazi hands, Walter Benjamin killed himself with an overdose of morphine tablets on the night of 25 September 1940 while staying in the ''Hotel de Francia''; the official Portbou register records 26 September 1940 as the official date of death.<ref name=\"Witte\"/><ref>Jay, Martin ''The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute of Social Research 1923–1950''.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Esther|title=Walter Benjamin: Overpowering Conformism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXUN34lH-jgC&pg=PA215|accessdate=August 28, 2009|series=Modern European Thinkers|year=2000|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-1568-3|page=215|chapter=Benjamin's Finale}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lester|first=David|title=Suicide and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1nkj-xSzYgC&pg=PA74|accessdate=August 28, 2009|year=2005|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-59454-427-9|page=74|chapter=Suicide to Escape Capture: Cases}}</ref> Benjamin's colleague [[Arthur Koestler]], also fleeing Europe, attempted suicide by taking some of the morphine tablets, but he survived.<ref>\"Afraid of being caught by the Gestapo while fleeing France, [Koestler] borrowed suicide pills from Walter Benjamin.

Despite his suicide, Benjamin was buried in the [[consecration|consecrated]] section of a Roman Catholic cemetery.\n\nThe others in his party were allowed passage the next day, and safely reached [[Lisbon]] on 30 September. [[Hannah Arendt]], who crossed the French-Spanish border at Portbou a few months later, passed the manuscript of ''Theses'' to [[Theodor W. Adorno|Adorno]]. Another completed manuscript, which Benjamin had carried in his suitcase, disappeared after his death and has not been recovered. Some critics speculate that it was his ''Arcades Project'' in a final form; this is very unlikely as the author's plans for the work had changed in the wake of Adorno's criticisms in 1938, and it seems clear that the work was flowing over its containing limits in his last years.\n\n== Thought ==\nWalter Benjamin corresponded much with [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]], and was occasionally funded by the [[Frankfurt School]] under the direction of Adorno and [[Horkheimer]], even from their New York City residence. The competing influences—Brecht's Marxism, Adorno's [[critical theory]], Gerschom Scholem's Jewish mysticism—were central to his work, although their philosophic differences remained unresolved. Moreover, the critic [[Paul de Man]] argued that the intellectual range of Benjamin's writings flows dynamically among those three intellectual traditions, deriving a critique via juxtaposition; the exemplary synthesis is ''Theses on the Philosophy of History''.\n\n=== ''Theses on the Philosophy of History''===\n[[File:Klee, Angelus novus.png|thumb|right|185px|[[Paul Klee]]'s 1920 painting ''[[Angelus Novus]]'', which Benjamin compared to \"the angel of history\"]]\n{{main article|Theses on the Philosophy of History}}\n''Theses on the Philosophy of History'' is often cited as Benjamin's last complete work, having been completed, according to Adorno, in the spring of 1940. The Institute for Social Research, which had relocated to New York, published ''Theses'' in Benjamin's memory in 1942. Margaret Cohen writes in the ''Cambridge Companion to Walter Benjamin'':\n{{Quotation|In the “Concept of History” Benjamin also turned to Jewish mysticism for a model of praxis in dark times, inspired by the kabbalistic precept that the work of the holy man is an activity known as tikkun. According to the kabbalah, God's attributes were once held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by the presence of evil and these vessels had consequently shattered, disseminating their contents to the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the process of collecting the scattered fragments in the hopes of once more piecing them together. Benjamin fused tikkun with the Surrealist notion that liberation would come through releasing repressed collective material, to produce his celebrated account of the revolutionary historiographer, who sought to grab hold of elided memories as they sparked to view at moments of present danger.}}\n\nIn the essay, Benjamin's famed ninth thesis struggles to reconcile the [[Idea of Progress]] in the present with the apparent chaos of the past:\n{{Quotation|A Klee painting named ''[[Angelus Novus]]'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.}}\n\nThe final paragraph about the Jewish quest for the [[Messiah]] provides a harrowing final point to Benjamin's work, with its themes of culture, destruction, Jewish heritage and the fight between humanity and nihilism. He brings up the interdiction, in some varieties of Judaism, to try to determine the year when the Messiah would come into the world, and points out that this did not make Jews indifferent to the future \"for every second of time was the strait gate through which the Messiah might enter.\"\n\n=== ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' ===\n{{main article|The Origin of German Tragic Drama}}\n\n''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928), is a critical study of German baroque drama, as well as the political and cultural climate of Germany during the [[Counter-Reformation]] (1545–1648). Benjamin presented the work to the University of Frankfurt in 1925 as the (post-doctoral) dissertation meant to earn him the ''[[Habilitation]]'' (qualification) to become a university instructor in Germany.\n\nProfessor Schultz of University of Frankfurt found ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' inappropriate for his ''Germanistik'' department (Department of German Language and Literature), and passed it to the Department of Aesthetics (philosophy of art), the readers of which likewise dismissed Benjamin's work. The university officials recommended that Benjamin withdraw ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' as a ''Habilitation'' dissertation to avoid formal rejection and public embarrassment.<ref name=\"BL\"/> He heeded the advice, and three years later, in 1928, he published ''The Origin of German Tragic Drama'' as a book.<ref>''Introducing Walter Benjamin'', Howard Cargill, Alex Coles, Andrey Klimowski, 1998, p. 112</ref>\n\n=== The Arcades Project ===\n{{Main article|Arcades Project}}\nThe ''[[Arcades Project|Passagenwerk]]'' (Arcades Project, 1927–40), was Walter Benjamin's final, incomplete book about Parisian city life in the 19th century, especially about the ''[[Passages couverts de Paris]]'' the covered passages that extended the culture of [[flâneur|''flânerie'']] (idling and people-watching) when inclement weather made ''flânerie'' infeasible in the boulevards and streets proper.\n\nThe Arcades Project, in its current form, brings together a massive collection of notes which Benjamin filed together over the course of thirteen years, from 1927 to 1940.<ref>Buck-Morss, Susan. ''The Dialectics of Seeing''. The MIT Press, 1991, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe Arcades Project was published for the first time in 1982, and is over a thousand pages long.\n\n=== Writing style ===\n[[Susan Sontag]] said that in Walter Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence \"had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes\", a \"freeze-frame baroque\" style of writing and cogitation. \"His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct\".<ref>Susan Sontag ''Under the Sign of Saturn,'' p. 129.</ref> The difficulty of Benjamin's writing style is essential to his philosophical project. Fascinated by notions of reference and constellation, his goal in later works was to use [[Intertextuality|intertexts]] to reveal aspects of the past that cannot, and should not, be understood within greater, monolithic constructs of historical understanding.\n\nWalter Benjamin's writings identify him as a [[Modernism|modernist]] for whom the philosophic merges with the literary: logical philosophic reasoning cannot account for all experience, especially not for self-representation via art. He presented his [[Style (visual arts)|stylistic]] concerns in \"The Task of the Translator\", wherein he posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational mortification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.\n\nHis work ''The Task of the Translator'' was later commented by the French translation scholar [[Antoine Berman]] (''[[L'âge de la traduction]]'').\n\n== Works ==\nAmong Walter Benjamin's works are:\n* ''Zur Kritik der Gewalt'' (''[[Critique of Violence]]'', 1921)\n* ''Goethes Wahlverwandtschaften'' (''[[Goethe's Elective Affinities]]'', 1922)\n* ''Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels'' (''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', 1928)\n* ''Einbahnstraße'' (''[[One Way Street (essay)|One Way Street]]'', 1928)\n* ''[[Karl Kraus (essay)|Karl Kraus]]'' (1931 in the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]])\n* ''Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit'' (''[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]'', 1936)\n* ''Berliner Kindheit um 1900'' (''[[Berlin Childhood around 1900]]'', 1950)\n* ''Über den Begriff der Geschichte'' (''[[On the Concept of History / Theses on the Philosophy of History]]''), 1940\n* ''Das Paris des Second Empire bei Baudelaire'' (''[[The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire]]'', 1938)\n\n== Legacy and reception==\nSince the publication of ''Schriften'' (Writings, 1955) fifteen years after his death, Benjamin's work—especially the essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" (1936)—has become of seminal importance to academics in the humanities disciplines. And after a further thirteen years, the first [[Internationale Walter Benjamin Gesellschaft]] was established by the [[Germany|German]] thinker, poet and artist [[Natias Neutert]], as a free association of philosophers, writers, artists, media theoreticians and editors. They did not take Benjamin's body of thought as a scholastic \"closed architecture [...], but as one in which all doors, windows and roof hatches are widely open\", as the founder Neutert put it—more poetically than politically—in his manifesto.<ref>Cf.

Its members come from 19 countries, both within and beyond Europe and represents an international forum for discourse.
