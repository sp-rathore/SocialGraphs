He accompanied his father to [[Edo]] in 1648, and was sent in 1649 to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] to  study Western science.  At his father's urging, he continued his studies in Nagasaki as a [[rōnin]] from 1650 through 1656.  He then re-entered service to [[Kuroda]], which led to his continuing studies in Kyoto.  After his father's death in 1665, he returned to Fukuoka.<ref name=\"y49\">Yonemoto, Marcia. (2003).

Book of botany written by Kaibara Ekken in 1709. Exhibit in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo, Japan.]]\nKaibara's science was confined to [[Botany]] and [[Materia medica]] and focused on the \"natural law\".  Kaibara became as famous in Japan as people such as [[Charles Darwin]] when it came to science. He advanced the study of botany in Japan when he wrote ''Yamato honzō,''(Medicinal herbs of Japan) which was a seminal study of Japanese [[plants]]. The 19th-century German Japanologist [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] called him the \"Aristotle of Japan.\"<ref name=\"y49\" />\n\nKaibara was known for his manuals of behavior, such as changing his Confucian ethical system based on the teachings of [[Zhu Xi]] (also known as [[Chu Hsi]]) into an easy \"self-help\" manuals. As an educator and philosopher, it appears that Kaibara's main goal in life was to further the process of weaving Neo-Confucianism into Japanese culture.  In this context, he is best known for such books as ''Precepts for Children'' and ''Greater Learning for Women'' (''Onna daigaku''); but modern scholarship argues that it was actually prepared by other hands.  Although the genesis of the work remains unchallenged, the oldest extant copy (1733) ends with the lines \"as related by our teacher Ekiken Kaibara\" and the publisher's colophon states that the text was written from lectures of our teacher Kaibara.\"<ref>Ko, Dorothy ''et al.''
