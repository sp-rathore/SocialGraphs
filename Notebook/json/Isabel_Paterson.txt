Along with [[Rose Wilder Lane]] and [[Ayn Rand]], who both acknowledged an intellectual debt to Paterson, she is one of the three founding mothers of American [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]]. Paterson's best-known work, her 1943 book ''[[The God of the Machine]]'', a treatise on [[political philosophy]], [[economics]], and [[history]], reached conclusions and espoused beliefs that many [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] credit as a foundation of their philosophy. Her biographer [[Stephen D. Cox]] (2004) believes Paterson was the \"earliest progenitor of libertarianism as we know it today.\"  In a letter of 1943, [[Ayn Rand]] wrote that ''The God of the Machine'' is a document that could literally save the world ... ''The God of the Machine'' does for [[capitalism]] what ''[[Das Kapital]]'' does for the [[Communism|Reds]] and what the [[Bible]] did for [[Christianity]].\"<ref>''Letters of Ayn Rand'', ed. Michael S. Berliner (New Yourk: Dutton, 1995), 102.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBorn '''Isabel Mary Bowler''' in rural [[Manitoulin Island]], [[Ontario]], she moved with her family to the west when she was very young.  She grew up on a cattle ranch in [[Alberta]]. Paterson's family was quite poor and she had eight siblings. A voracious reader who was largely self-educated, she had brief and informal public schooling during these years:  about three years in a country school, from the ages of 11 to 14.  In her late teen years, Bowler left the ranch for the city of [[Calgary]], where she took a clerical job with the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. As a teenager, she worked as a waitress, stenographer, and bookkeeper, working at one point as an assistant to future [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[R. B. Bennett]].\n\nThis hardscrabble youth probably led Paterson to attach great importance to productive \"self-starters\". Although she was articulate, well-read, and erudite, Paterson had extremely limited formal education, an experience she shared with [[Rose Wilder Lane]], who was also Paterson's friend and correspondent for many years.<ref name=Cox>{{cite book | last=Cox | first=Stephen | authorlink=Stephen D. Cox | title=The Woman and the Dynamo: Isabel Paterson and the Idea of America | publisher=Transaction Publishers | location=New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA | year=2004  | isbn=978-0-7658-0241-5 }}</ref>{{rp|216–8; 241–2}}\n\nIn 1910, at the age of 24, Bowler entered into a short-lived marriage with Canadian Kenneth B. Paterson. The marriage was not happy, and they parted in 1918.  It was during these years, in a foray south of the border, that Paterson landed a job with a newspaper, the ''[[Inland Herald]]'' in [[Spokane, Washington]].  Initially she worked in the business department of the paper, but later transferred to the editorial department.  There her journalistic career began.  Her next position was with a newspaper in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], where for two years she wrote drama reviews.\n\n===Writer and critic===\nIn 1914, Paterson started submitting her first two novels, ''The Magpie's Nest'' and ''The Shadow Riders,'' to publishers, without much success. It was not until 1916 that her second novel ''The Shadow Riders'' was accepted and published by John Lane Company, which also published ''The Magpie's Nest'' the following year in 1917.<ref name=Cox />{{rp|46}}\n\nAfter World War I, she moved to [[New York City]], where she worked for the sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]]. He was creating statues for the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]] and would later carve the memorial at [[Mount Rushmore]]. Paterson also wrote for the ''World'' and the ''American'' in New York.\n\nIn 1921, Paterson became an assistant to [[Burton Rascoe]], the new literary editor of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', later the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. For 25 years, from 1924 to 1949, she wrote a column (signed \"I.M.P.\") for the ''Herald Tribune's'' \"Books\" section. Paterson became one of the most influential literary critics of her time. She covered a time of great expansion in the United States literary world, with new work by the rising generation of [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and many others, African Americans of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], as well as the first American generation of the great waves of European immigrants. Her friends during this period included the famous humorist [[Will Cuppy]].<ref name=Cox />{{rp|92–5}} In 1928 she became an American citizen, at the age of 42.\n\nShe was notorious for demonstrating her sharp wit and goring of sacred cows in her column, where she also first articulated many of the political ideas that reached their final form in ''The God of the Machine''.  Her thinking, especially on [[free trade]], was also foreshadowed in her [[historical novel]]s of the 1920s and 1930s. Paterson opposed most of the economic program known as the [[New Deal]], which American president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] put into effect during the [[Great Depression]]. She advocated less government involvement in both social and [[finance|fiscal]] issues.\n\n===Paterson and Ayn Rand===\nBy the late 1930s, Paterson led a group of younger writers, many of them other ''Herald Tribune'' employees, who shared her views. One was future ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent and editor Sam Welles.<ref name=Cox />{{rp|339–40}}\n\nAnother was the young [[Ayn Rand]]. From their many discussions, Paterson is credited with adding to Rand's knowledge of American history and government, and Rand with contributing ideas to ''The God of the Machine''.<ref>Jennifer Burns, ''Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right'', Oxford Univ. Press, 2009, pp. 77, 81, 94, 130.</ref> Paterson believed Rand's [[ethics]] to be a unique contribution, writing to Rand in the 1940s, \"You still don't seem to know yourself that your idea is ''new''.  It is not [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] or [[Max Stirner]]... Their supposed [[ethical egoism|Ego]] was composed of whirling words – your concept of the Ego is an entity, a person, a living creature functioning in concrete reality.\"<ref>Michael Berliner, ''Letters of Ayn Rand'', Dutton, 1995, p.176.</ref>\n\nPaterson and Rand promoted each other's books and conducted an extensive correspondence over the years, in which they often touched on religion and philosophy. An [[atheist]], Rand was critical of the [[deism|deist]] Paterson's attempts to link [[capitalism]] with religion.  Rand believed the two to be incompatible, and the two argued at length. Their correspondence ended after they quarreled in 1948. During a visit to Rand at her home in California, Paterson's remarks about writer [[Morrie Ryskind]] and abrasive behavior toward businessman [[William C. Mullendore]], other guests of Rand, resulted in Rand's disillusionment with \"Pat.\"<ref>See generally, ''Atlas Shrugged''; Jennifer Burns, ''[[Goddess of the Market]]: Ayn Rand and the American Right'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2009, pp. 129–132, 138.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Paterson had broken with another friend and political ally, [[Rose Wilder Lane]], in 1946.<ref name=Cox />{{rp|313}}\n\nAs a sign of the political tenor of the times, ''The God of the Machine'' was published in the same year as [[Ayn Rand|Rand]]'s [[novel]] ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and [[Rose Wilder Lane]]'s ''The Discovery of Freedom''. Writer [[Albert Jay Nock]] wrote that Lane's and Paterson's nonfiction books were \"the only intelligible books on the philosophy of [[individualism]] that have been written in America this century.\"  The two women had \"shown the male world of this period how to think fundamentally... They don't fumble and fiddle around – every shot goes straight to the centre.\" Journalist [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]] credits Paterson, Lane and Rand with his final \"conversion\" from [[socialism]] to what he called \"an older American philosophy\" of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] ideas.<ref>Nock quoted in [[Brian Doherty (journalist)|Brian Doherty]], ''[[Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement]]'' (Public Affairs, 2007; and [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]], ''A Life with the Printed Word'', Regnery, 1982, p.136.</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nPaterson further influenced the post-WWII rise of lettered American [[conservatism]] through her correspondence with the young [[Russell Kirk]] in the 1940s, and with the young [[William F. Buckley]] in the 1950s. Buckley and Kirk went on to found the ''[[National Review]],'' to which Paterson contributed for a brief time.  However, she sometimes sharply differed from Buckley, for example by disagreeing with the magazine's review of Rand's novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.<ref name=Cox />{{rp|351}}\n\nIn her retirement, Paterson declined to enroll in [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and kept her Social Security card in an envelope with words \"'Social Security' Swindle\" written on it.<ref name=Cox />{{rp|325}}\n\nPaterson died on January 10, 1960, and was interred in the Welles family plot at [[Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard, Burlington|Saint Mary's Episcopal Churchyard]] in [[Burlington, New Jersey]].<ref name=Cox />{{rp|362–363}}\n\n==Quotations==\n*\"Most of the harm in the world is done by good people, and not by accident, lapse, or omission. It is the result of their deliberate actions, long persevered in, which they hold to be motivated by high ideals toward virtuous ends... when millions are slaughtered, when torture is practiced, starvation enforced, oppression made a policy, as at present over a large part of the world, and as it has often been in the past, it must be at the behest of very many good people, and even by their direct action, for what they consider a worthy object.\" (''[[The God of the Machine]]'')\n\n==Bibliography==\n*1916.
