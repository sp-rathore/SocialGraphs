These were his formative philosophical years; he initially developed an interest in [[existential philosophy]], [[transcendental philosophy]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. In particular, he undertook an epistemological critique of Husserl's transcendental idealism]<ref>\"The 'A priori' Moment of the Subject-Object-Dialectic in Transcendental Phenomenology: The Relationship between 'A priori' and 'Ideality',\" in: ''Analecta Husserliana'', Vol. 3 (1974), pp. 183-198.</ref>  and interpreted Heidegger's philosophy of Being in the sense of social critique,<ref>''Skepsis und Gesellschaftskritik im Denken Martin Heideggers''.

In the years following his graduation he expanded his scholarly interest to philosophy of law and later political philosophy.<ref>''Philosophie - Recht - Politik''. Vienna/New York: Springer, 1985. ISBN 0-387-81899-5</ref> Since the early 1970s he has been promoting the idea of inter-cultural dialogue which—since the last decade—has become known under the slogan of ''dialogue of civilizations''. Köchler first outlined his hermeneutical [[philosophy of dialogue]] and his concept of ''cultural self-comprehension'' in lectures at the University of Innsbruck (1972)<ref>''Kulturelles Selbstverständnis und Koexistenz: Voraussetzungen für einen fundamentalen Dialog'' (Cultural Self-comprehension and Co-existence: Preconditions of Fundamental Dialogue), in: ''Philosophie und Politik.

From 1990 until 2008 he has served as Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Innsbruck (Austria). At his University, Professor Köchler also has acted as Chairperson of the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik'' (Working Group for Sciences and Politics) since 1971; he was a member of the Doctoral Grants Committee of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (2000–2006) and is Life Fellow—since 2010 Co-President—of the International Academy for Philosophy.

Reflections on the Systematic Approach of Karol Wojtyla,\" in: ''Analecta Husserliana'', Vol. 6 (1977), pp. 75-80.</ref> During the 1980s he engaged in a critique of legal positivism (''Philosophie—Recht—Politik'', 1985) and developed a theory according to which human rights are the basis of the validity of international law (''Die Prinzipien des Völkerrechts und die Menschenrechte'', 1981). He also dealt with the applicability of democracy in inter-state relations (''Democracy in International Relations'', 1986). Legal theory led him to questions of political philosophy, and in particular a critique of the representative paradigm of democracy.  During the 1990s Köchler got increasingly involved in questions of [[New world order (politics)|world order]]—including the role and philosophical foundations of civilizational dialogue—and in what he has called the dialectic relationship between [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[law]]. On the basis of these reflections, he made major proposals for the reform of the United Nations Organization, in particular the Security Council, and for a comprehensive system of international criminal justice.\n\nKöchler's bibliography contains more than 380 books, reports and scholarly articles in several languages (Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Spanish, Serbo-Croat, Turkish). His publications deal with issues of phenomenology, existential philosophy, anthropology, human rights, philosophy of law, theory of international law, international criminal law, United Nations reform, theory of democracy, etc. He acts as editor of the series ''Studies in International Relations'' (Vienna), ''Veröffentlichungen der Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Wissenschaft und Politik'' (Innsbruck), and as member of the Editorial Board of the international academic journal ''Hekmat va Falsafeh'' (Wisdom and Philosophy), published by the Philosophy Department of [[Allameh Tabatabaii University]], [[Iran]].\n\nKöchler has served in several committees and expert groups dealing with issues of international democracy, [[human rights and development]] such as the Research Network on Transnational Democracy sponsored by the [[European Commission]]; the [[Council of Europe]]'s Expert Group on Democratic Citizenship (1998–2000); and the [[Asia-Europe Foundation]]’s expert meeting on Cultural, Religious and Social Conceptions of Justice in Asia & Europe ([[Singapore]], 2004).\n\nKöchler calls in his research paper \"The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations \" presented during the International Roundtable Conference at the University of Sains Malaysia, Centre for Policy Research and International Studies (CenPRIS) Penang, Malaysia, during 13–14 December 2007, the \"official narrative\" of 9/11, told by the American authorities, an \"official conspiracy theory\".<ref>The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations\", p.21</ref> Moreover, he claims that the Western establishment refuses to investigate what really happened on 9/11 and this is part of a collective denial process.<ref>The “Global War on Terror” and its Implications for Muslim-Western Relations\", p.6</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)==\n\nKöchler is the Founder and President (since 1972) of the [[International Progress Organization]] (I.P.O.), an international non-governmental organization (NGO) in consultative status with the [[United Nations]] and with a membership in over 70 countries, representing all continents. He was the founder and Secretary-General (1973-1977) of Euregio Alpina (Study Group for the Alpine Region), a transnational planning structure for the Alpine region and predecessor of the new concept of the \"Euro Regions\" in the framework of the [[European Union]]. During the 1970s and 1980s Köchler participated in the international phenomenological movement and organized several conferences and colloquia on the phenomenology of the life-world; he was the organizer of the Eighth International Phenomenological Conference in Salzburg (1980) and is the co-founder of the Austrian Society of Phenomenology.\nOther activities or functions:<ref>Source: ''Hans Köchler Bibliography and Reader''.

This was acknowledged by international figures such as the German Foreign Minister [[Klaus Kinkel]] in 1993. In 1985, he organized the first colloquium on \"Democracy in International Relations\" on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations in New York. With Irish Nobel Laureate [[Sean MacBride|Seán MacBride]] he initiated the Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War, which set in motion an international campaign that eventually led to a General Assembly resolution and the issuing of an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice. As President of the I.P.O. he dealt with the humanitarian issues of the exchange of prisoners of war between Iran and Iraq and with the issue of Kuwaiti POWs and missing people in Iraq.
