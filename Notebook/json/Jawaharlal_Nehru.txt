He emerged as the paramount leader of the [[Indian independence movement]] under the tutelage of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and ruled India from its establishment as an independent nation in 1947 until his death in 1964. He is considered to be the architect of the modern Indian nation-state: a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. He was also known as '''Pandit Nehru''' due to his roots with the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community while many Indian children knew him as \"Uncle Nehru\" (''Chacha'' Nehru).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inc.in/organization/2-Pandit%20Jawaharlal%20Nehru/profile|title=Indian National Congress|work=inc.in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Nation pays tribute to Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru on his 124th birth anniversary|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-nation-pays-tribute-to-pandit-jawaharlal-nehru-on-his-124th-birth-anniversary-1918978|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe son of [[Motilal Nehru]], a prominent lawyer and nationalist statesman and Swaroop Rani, Nehru was a graduate of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and the [[Inner Temple]], where he trained to be a [[barrister]]. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the [[Allahabad High Court]], and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. A committed nationalist since his teenage years, he became a rising figure in Indian politics during the upheavals of the 1910s. He became the prominent leader of the left-wing factions of the [[Indian National Congress]] during the 1920s, and eventually of the entire Congress, with the tacit approval of his mentor, Gandhi. As [[Congress President]] in 1929, Nehru called for [[Purna Swaraj|complete independence]] from the [[British Raj]] and instigated the Congress's decisive shift towards the left.\n\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s as the country moved towards independence. His idea of a secular nation-state was seemingly validated when the Congress, under his leadership, swept the [[Indian provincial elections, 1937|1937 provincial elections]] and formed the government in several provinces; on the other hand, the separatist [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] fared much poorer. But these achievements were seriously compromised in the aftermath of the [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942, which saw the British effectively crush the Congress as a political organisation. Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, for he had desired to support the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort during the [[Second World War]], came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League under his old Congress colleague and now ''bête noire'', [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], had come to dominate Muslim politics in India. Negotiations between Nehru and Jinnah for power sharing failed and gave way to the independence and bloody [[partition of India]] in 1947.\n\nNehru was elected by the Congress to assume office as independent India's first Prime Minister, although the question of leadership had been settled as far back as 1941, when Gandhi acknowledged Nehru as his political heir and successor. As Prime Minister, he set out to realise his vision of India. The [[Constitution of India]] was enacted in 1950, after which he embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social and political reforms. Chiefly, he oversaw India's transition from a colony to a republic, while nurturing a plural, [[multi-party democracy]]. In foreign policy, he took a leading role in [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Alignment]] while projecting India as a regional hegemon in South Asia.\n\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a catch-all party, dominating national and state-level politics and winning consecutive elections in [[Indian general election, 1951|1951]], [[Indian general election, 1957|1957]], and [[Indian general election, 1962|1962]]. He remained popular with the people of India in spite of political troubles in his final years and failure of leadership during the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]. In India, his birthday is celebrated as ''[[Children's Day (India)|Children's Day]]''.\n\n==Early life and career (1889–1912)==\n[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru Khaki Shorts.jpg|thumb|Nehru in [[khaki]] uniform as a member of [[Seva Dal]].]]\n\nJawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in [[Allahabad]] in [[British Raj|British India]]. His father, [[Motilal Nehru]] (1861–1931), a wealthy barrister who belonged to the [[Kashmiri Pandit]] community,{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=4}} served twice as [[President of the Indian National Congress]] during the [[Indian Independence Movement|Independence Struggle]]. His mother, Swaruprani Thussu (1868–1938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in [[Lahore]],<ref>Zakaria, Rafiq ''A Study of Nehru'', Times of India Press, 1960, p. 22</ref> was Motilal's second wife, the first having died in child birth. Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children, two of whom were girls.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|}} The elder sister, [[Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit|Vijaya Lakshmi]], later became the first female president of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].<ref>Bonnie G. Smith; The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History. Oxford University Press. 2008. ISBN 978-0195148909. pg 406–407.</ref> The youngest sister, [[Krishna Hutheesing]], became a noted writer and authored several books on her brother.\n\n[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru as a young child with his parents.png|thumb|left|175px|The Nehru family ca. 1890s]]\n\nNehru described his childhood as a \"sheltered and uneventful one\". He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege at wealthy homes including a large palatial estate called the [[Anand Bhawan]]. His father had him educated at home by private governesses and tutors.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=22}} Under the influence of a tutor, Ferdinand T. Brooks, he became interested in science and theosophy.<ref name=\"OPM\">Om Prakash Misra; Economic Thought of Gandhi and Nehru: A Comparative Analysis. M.D. Publications. 1995. ISBN 978-8185880716. pg 49–65.</ref> He was subsequently initiated into the [[Theosophical Society]] at age thirteen by family friend [[Annie Besant]]. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=23}} He wrote: \"for nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways he influenced me greatly\".<ref name=\"OPM\"/>\n\nNehru's theosophical interests had induced him to the study of the [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] [[scriptures]].<ref name=\"BRN\">Bal Ram Nanda; The Nehrus. Oxford University Press. 1962. ISBN 978-0195693430. pg 65.</ref> According to [[Bal Ram Nanda|B.R. Nanda]], these scriptures were Nehru's \"first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]....[they] provided Nehru the initial impulse for [his] long intellectual quest which culminated...in ''[[The Discovery of India]]''.\"<ref name=\"BRN\"/>\n\nNehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth. The [[Boer War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] intensified his feelings. About the latter he wrote, \"[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm&nbsp;... Nationalistic ideas filled my mind&nbsp;... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe.\"<ref name=\"OPM\"/> Later when he had begun his institutional schooling in 1905 at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], a leading school in England, he was greatly influenced by [[George Macaulay Trevelyan|G.M. Trevelyan]]'s [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=36}} He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: \"Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind India and Italy got strangely mixed together.\"<ref name=\"OPM\"/>\n\n[[File:Nehru at Harrow.png|thumb|left|175px|Nehru dressed in cadet uniform at Harrow School in England]]\n\nNehru went to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in October 1907 and graduated with an honours degree in [[natural science tripos|natural science]] in 1910.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=43}} During this period, he also studied politics, economics, history and literature desultorily. Writings of [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], [[Herbert George Wells|H.G Wells]], [[John Maynard Keynes|J.M. Keynes]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson|Lowes Dickinson]] and [[Meredith Townsend]] moulded much of his political and economic thinking.<ref name=\"OPM\"/>\n\n[[File:Nehru barrister.png|thumb|175px|Nehru at the Allahabad High Court]]\n\nAfter completing his degree in 1910, Nehru went to London and stayed there for two years for law studies at the [[Inns of Court School of Law]] ([[Inner Temple]]).{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=47}} During this time, he continued to study the scholars of the [[Fabian Society]] including [[Beatrice Webb]].<ref name=\"OPM\"/> He passed his bar examinations in 1912 and was admitted to the English bar.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=47}}\n\nAfter returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled himself as an advocate of the [[Allahabad High Court]] and tried to settle down as a barrister. But, unlike his father, he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the company of lawyers. He wrote: \"Decidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually stimulating and a sense of the utter insipidity of life grew upon me.\"<ref name=\"OPM\"/> His involvement in nationalist politics would gradually replace his legal practice in the coming years.<ref name=\"OPM\"/>\n\n==Struggle for Indian Independence (1912–47)==\nNehru had developed an interest in Indian politics during his time in Britain.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=37}} Within months of his return to India in 1912 he had attended an annual session of the Indian National Congress in [[Patna]].{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} He was disconcerted with what he saw as a \"very much an English-knowing upper class affair\".{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=49}} The Congress in 1912 had been the party of moderates and elites.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru harboured doubts regarding the ineffectualness of the Congress but agreed to work for the party in support of the Indian civil rights movement in South Africa.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=50}} He collected funds for the civil rights campaigners led by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] in 1913.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Later, he campaigned against\nthe indentured labour and other such discriminations faced by Indians in the British colonies.<ref name=\"auto\">In Jawaharlal Nehru's autobiography, ''An Autobiography'' (1936) p. 33.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] broke out in August 1914, sympathy in India was divided. Although educated Indians \"by and large took a vicarious pleasure\" in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the [[Triple Entente|Allies]]. Nehru confessed that he viewed the war with mixed feelings. [[Frank Moraes]] wrote: \"If [Nehru's] sympathy was with any country it was with France, whose culture he greatly admired.\"{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=52}} During the war, Nehru volunteered for the [[St John Ambulance]] and worked as one of the provincial secretaries of the organisation in Allahabad.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} He also spoke out against the censorship acts passed by the British government in India.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=53}}\n\n[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru and his family in 1918.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nehru in 1918 with wife [[Kamala Nehru|Kamala]] and daughter [[Indira Gandhi|Indira]]]]\n\nNehru emerged from the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. Although the political discourse had been dominated at this time by [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]],{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=50}} a moderate who said that it was \"madness to think of independence\",{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru had spoken \"openly of the politics of non-cooperation, of the need of resigning from honorary positions under the government and of not continuing the futile politics of representation\".{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=26}} He ridiculed the [[British India Civil Service|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) for its support of British policies. He noted that someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, \"with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in this country, as neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service\".<ref name=\"ics\">Nehru, Jawaharlal ''Glimpses of world history: being further letters to his daughter'' (Lindsay Drummond Ltd., 1949), p. 94</ref> Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader, acknowledged the limits of constitutional agitation, but counselled his son that there was no other \"practical alternative\" to it. Nehru, however, was not satisfied with the pace of the national movement. He became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders who were demanding [[Home Rule]] for Indians.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=56}}\n\nThe influence of the moderates on Congress politics began to wane after Gokhale died in 1915.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Anti-moderate leaders such as Annie Beasant and [[Lokmanya Tilak]] took the opportunity to call for a [[Indian Home Rule Movement|national movement for Home Rule]]. But, in 1915, the proposal was rejected because of the reluctance of the moderates to commit to such a radical course of action. Besant nevertheless formed a league for advocating Home Rule in 1916; and Tilak, on his release from a prison term, had in April 1916 formed his own league.{{sfn|Ghose|1993|p=25}} Nehru joined both leagues but worked especially for the former.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}} He remarked later: \"[Besant] had a very powerful influence on me in my childhood... even later when I entered political life her influence continued.\"{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}} Another development which brought about a radical change in Indian politics was the espousal of Hindu-Muslim unity with the [[Lucknow pact]] at the annual meeting of the Congress in December 1916. The pact had been initiated earlier in the year at Allahabad at a meeting of the [[All-India Congress Committee]] which was held at the Nehru residence at Anand Bhawan. Nehru welcomed and encouraged the rapprochement between the two Indian communities.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}}\n\n===Home rule movement===\nSeveral nationalist leaders banded together in 1916 under the leadership of Annie Besant to voice a demand for [[self-government]], and to obtain the status of a [[Dominion]] within the [[British Empire]] as enjoyed by Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Newfoundland at the time. Nehru joined the movement and rose to become secretary of Besant's [[All India Home Rule League]].{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=55}}<ref name=\"JNACA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jnmf.in/chrono.html|title=Jawaharlal Nehru – a chronological account |accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref> In June 1917 Besant was arrested and interned by the British government. The Congress and various other Indian organisation threatened to launch protests if she were not set free. The British government was subsequently forced to release Besant and make [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|significant concessions]] after a period of intense protest.\n\n===Non-cooperation===\nThe first big national involvement of Nehru came at the onset of the [[non-co-operation movement]] in 1920. He led the movement in the United Provinces (now [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Nehru was arrested on charges of anti-governmental activities in 1921, and was released a few months later. In the rift that formed within the Congress following the sudden closure of the non-co-operation movement after the [[Chauri Chaura incident]], Nehru remained loyal to Gandhi and did not join the [[Swaraj Party]] formed by his father [[Motilal Nehru]] and [[Chittaranjan Das|CR Das]].\n\n===Internationalising the struggle===\n[[File:Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Indira Gandhi]], Jawaharlal Nehru, [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and [[Sanjay Gandhi]]]]\n[[File:Nehru and Indira.png|thumb|Nehru and his daughter Indira in Britain, 1930s]]\nNehru played a leading role in the development of the internationalist outlook of the Indian independence struggle. He sought foreign allies for India and forged links with movements for independence and democracy all over the world. In 1927, his efforts paid off and the Congress was invited to attend the congress of oppressed nationalities in Brussels in Belgium. The meeting was called to co-ordinate and plan a common struggle against imperialism. Nehru represented India and was elected to the Executive Council of the League against Imperialism that was born at this meeting.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=115}}\n\nDuring the mid-1930s, Nehru was much concerned with developments in Europe, which seemed to be drifting toward another world war. He was in Europe in early 1936, visiting his ailing wife, shortly before she died in a sanitarium in Switzerland. Even at this time, he emphasised that, in the event of war, India's place was alongside the democracies, though he insisted that India could only fight in support of Great Britain and France as a free country.\n\nNehru closely worked with [[Subhas Chandra Bose|Subhash Bose]] in developing good relations with governments of free countries all over the world. However, the two split in the late 1930s, when Bose agreed to seek the help of fascists in driving the British out of India. At the same time, Nehru had supported the Republicans who were fighting against [[Francisco Franco]]'s forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Nehru along with his aide [[V.K. Krishna Menon]] visited Spain and declared support for the Republicans. HE refused to meet [[Benito Mussolini]], the dictator of Italy when the latter expressed his desire to meet him.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=77}}{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=266}}\n\n===Republicanism===\nNehru was one of the first nationalist leaders to realise the sufferings of the people in the states ruled by Indian Princes. He suffered imprisonment in [[Nabha State|Nabha]], a [[princely state]], when he went there to see the struggle that was being waged by the Sikhs against the corrupt Mahants. The nationalist movement had been confined to the territories under direct British rule. He helped to make the struggle of the people in the princely states a part of the nationalist movement for independence. The All India states people's conference was formed in 1927. Nehru who had been supporting the cause of the people of the princely states for many years was made the President of the conference in 1935. He opened up its ranks to membership from across the political spectrum. The body would play an important role during the political integration of India, helping Indian leaders [[Vallabhbhai Patel]] and [[V.P. Menon]] (to whom Nehru had delegated the task of integrating the princely states into India) negotiate with hundreds of princes.\n\nIn July 1946, Nehru pointedly observed that no princely state could prevail militarily against the army of independent India.<ref>Copland, Ian (1997), The Princes of India in the Endgame of Empire, 1917–1947, Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-57179-0 p. 258.</ref> In January 1947, he said that independent India would not accept the [[Divine Right of Kings]],<ref>Lumby, E.W.R. (1954), The Transfer of Power in India, 1945–1947, London: George Allen and Unwin p. 228</ref> and in May 1947, he declared that any princely state which refused to join the Constituent Assembly would be treated as an enemy state. During the drafting of the Indian constitution, many Indian leaders (except Nehru) of that time were in favour of allowing each Princely state or Covenanting State to be independent as a federal state along the lines suggested originally by the Government of India act (1935). But as the drafting of the constitution progressed and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape (because of the efforts of Nehru), it was decided that all the Princely states/Covenanting States would merge with the Indian republic. Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]], de-recognised all the rulers by a presidential order in 1969. But this was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. Eventually, the government by the 26th Amendment to the constitution was successful in abolishing the Princely states of India. The process began by Nehru was finally completed by his daughter by the end of 1971.\n\n===Declaration of Independence===\nNehru was one of the first leaders to demand that the Congress Party should resolve to make a complete and explicit break from all ties with the British Empire. He introduced a resolution demanding \"complete national independence\" in 1927, which was rejected because of Gandhi's opposition.<ref>[[Rajmohan Gandhi]], ''Patel: A Life'', pp. 171, ASIN: B0006EYQ0A</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Gandhi agreed to Nehru's demands and proposed a resolution that called for the British to grant dominion status to India within two years. If the British failed to meet the deadline, the Congress would call upon all Indians to fight for complete independence. Nehru was one of the leaders who objected to the time given to the British – he pressed Gandhi to demand immediate actions from the British. Gandhi brokered a further compromise by reducing the time given from two years to one.  Nehru agreed to vote for the new resolution.\n\nDemands for dominion status was rejected by the British in 1929. Nehru assumed the presidency of the Congress party during the Lahore session on 29 December 1929 and introduced a successful resolution calling for complete independence.\n\nNehru drafted the Indian declaration of independence, which stated:\n\n<blockquote>We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraj or complete independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/kandathi/swaraj.txt |title=Declaration of independence |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517214940/http://cs.nyu.edu/kandathi/swaraj.txt |archivedate=17 May 2013 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt midnight on New Year's Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] in Lahore. A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The massive gathering of public attending the ceremony was asked if they agreed with it, and the vast majority of people were witnessed to raise their hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26 January as Independence Day. The flag of India was hoisted publicly across India by Congress volunteers, nationalists and the public. Plans for a mass civil disobedience were also underway.\n\nAfter the Lahore session of the Congress in 1929, Nehru gradually emerged as the paramount leader of the Indian independence movement. Gandhi stepped back into a more spiritual role. Although Gandhi did not officially designate Nehru his political heir until 1942, the country as early as the mid-1930s saw in Nehru the natural successor to Gandhi.\n\n===Civil disobedience===\nNehru and most of the Congress leaders were initially ambivalent about Gandhi's plan to begin civil disobedience with a [[satyagraha]] aimed at the British salt tax. After the protest gathered steam, they realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released\".<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\">Gandhi, Gopalkrishna. [http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article388858.ece \"The Great Dandi March — eighty years after\"], ''[[The Hindu]]'', 5 April 2010</ref> He was arrested on 14 April 1930 while entraining from [[Allahabad]] for [[Raipur]]. He had earlier, after addressing a huge meeting and leading a vast procession, ceremoniously manufactured some contraband salt. He was charged with breach of the salt law, tried summarily behind prison walls and sentenced to six months of imprisonment. He nominated Gandhi to succeed him as Congress President during his absence in jail, but Gandhi declined, and Nehru then nominated his father as his successor. With Nehru's arrest the civil disobedience acquired a new tempo, and arrests, firing on crowds and lathi charges grew to be ordinary occurrences.\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of the claims by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] for independence. Nehru considered the salt satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,<ref>Fisher, Margaret W. (June 1967). \"India's Jawaharlal Nehru\" p. 368.</ref> and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\n\n<blockquote>Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.&nbsp;... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.&nbsp;... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.&nbsp;... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.<ref>Johnson, Richard L. (2005). Gandhi's Experiments With Truth: Essential Writings By And About Mahatma Gandhi, Lexington Books, ISBN 0739111426 p. 37</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Architect of India===\n[[File:Gandhi and Nehru 1942.jpg|thumb|Gandhi and Nehru in 1942]]\nNehru elaborated the policies of the Congress and a future Indian nation under his leadership in 1929. He declared that the aims of the congress were freedom of religion, right to form associations, freedom of expression of thought, equality before law for every individual without distinction of caste, colour, creed or religion, protection to regional languages and cultures, safeguarding the interests of the peasants and labour, abolition of untouchability, introduction of adult franchise, imposition of prohibition, nationalisation of industries, socialism, and establishment of a secular India. All these aims formed the core of the \"Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy\" resolution drafted by Nehru in 1929–31 and were ratified by the All India Congress Committee under Gandhi's leadership.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=196}} However, some Congress leaders objected to the resolution and decided to oppose Nehru.\n\nThe espousal of socialism as the Congress goal was most difficult to achieve. Nehru was opposed in this by the right-wing Congressmen [[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Patel]], [[Dr. Rajendra Prasad]] and [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]]. He had the support of the left-wing Congressmen [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The trio combined to oust Dr. Prasad as Congress President in 1936. Nehru was elected in his place and held the presidency for two years (1936–37).{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=234-238}} He was then succeeded by his socialist colleagues Bose (1938–39) and Azad (1940–46). After the fall of Bose from the mainstream of Indian politics (because of his support of violence in driving the British out of India), the power struggle between the socialists and conservatives balanced out. However, Sardar Patel died in 1950, leaving Nehru as the sole remaining iconic national leader, and soon the situation became such that Nehru was able to implement many of his basic policies without hindrance. The conservative right-wing of the Congress (composed of India's upper class elites) would continue opposing the socialists until the great schism in 1969. Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]], was able to fulfill her father's dream by the 42nd amendment (1976) of the Indian constitution by which India officially became \"socialist\" and \"secular\".<ref name=\"42_amend\">{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend42.htm |title=Forty-Second Amendment to the Constitution |accessdate=16 June 2012 |publisher=Ministry of Law and Justice of India |date=28 August 1976}}</ref>\n\nDuring Nehru's second term as general secretary of the Congress, he proposed certain resolutions concerning the foreign policy of India.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=129}} From that time onwards, he was given carte blanche in framing the foreign policy of any future Indian nation. He developed good relations with governments all over the world. He firmly placed India on the side of democracy and freedom during a time when the world was under the threat of fascism.{{sfn|Moraes|2008|p=266}} He was also given the responsibility of planning the economy of a future India. He appointed the National Planning Commission in 1938 to help in framing such policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=3rd Five Year Plan (Chapter 1)|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/3rd/3planch1.html|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> However, many of the plans framed by Nehru and his colleagues would come undone with the unexpected partition of India in 1947.\n\n===Electoral politics===\n[[File:NehruTagore.jpg|thumb|Jawaharlal Nehru and [[Rabindranath Tagore]]]]\nNehru visit to Europe in 1936 proved to be the watershed in his political and economic thinking. Nehru's real interest in Marxism and his socialist pattern of thought stem from that tour. His subsequent sojourns in prison enabled him to study Marxism in more depth. Interested in its ideas but repelled by some of its methods, he could never bring himself to accept Karl Marx's writings as revealed scripture. Yet from then on, the yardstick of his economic thinking remained Marxist, adjusted, where necessary, to Indian conditions.\n\nWhen the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] under Nehru chose to contest elections and accept power under the Federation scheme, Gandhi resigned from party membership. Gandhi did not disagree with Nehru's move, but felt that if he resigned, his popularity with Indians would cease to stifle the party's membership. When the elections following the introduction of provincial autonomy (under the government of India act 1935) brought the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] to power in a majority of the provinces, Nehru's popularity and power was unmatched. The Muslim League under [[Mohammed Ali Jinnah]] (who was to become the creator of Pakistan) had fared badly at the polls. Nehru declared that the only two parties that mattered in India were the British Raj and Congress. Jinnah statements that the Muslim League was the third and \"equal partner\" within Indian politics was widely rejected. Nehru had hoped to elevate [[Abul Kalam Azad|Maulana Azad]] as the pre-eminent leaders of Indian Muslims, but in this, he was undermined by Gandhi, who continued to treat Jinnah as the voice of Indian Muslims.\n\n===World War II and Quit India movement===\nWhen World war II started, Viceroy Linlithgow had unilaterally declared India a belligerent on the side of the Britain, without consulting the elected Indian representatives. Nehru hurried back from a visit to China, announcing that, in a conflict between democracy and Fascism, \"our sympathies must inevitably be on the side of democracy.... I should like India to play its full part and throw all her resources into the struggle for a new order.\"\n\nAfter much deliberation the Congress under Nehru informed the government that it would co-operate with the British but on certain conditions. First, Britain must give an assurance of full independence for India after the war and allow the election of a constituent assembly to frame a new constitution; second, although the Indian armed forces would remain under the British Commander-in-Chief, Indians must be included immediately in the central government and given a chance to share power and responsibility. When Nehru presented Lord Linlithgow with the demands, he chose to reject them. A deadlock was reached. \"The same old game is played again\", Nehru wrote bitterly to Gandhi, \"the background is the same, the various epithets are the same and the actors are the same and the results must be the same\".\n\nOn 23 October 1939, the Congress condemned the Viceroy's attitude and called upon the Congress ministries in the various provinces to resign in protest. Before this crucial announcement, Nehru urged Jinnah and the Muslim League to join the protest but the latter declined.\n\nIn March 1940 Jinnah passed what would come to be known as the \"Pakistan Resolution\", declaring \"Muslims are a nation according to any definition of a nation, and they must have their homelands, their territory and their State.\"  This state was to be known as Pakistan, meaning \"Land of the Pure\". Nehru angrily declared that \"all the old problems ... pale into insignificance before the latest stand taken by the Muslim League leader in Lahore\". Linlithgow made Nehru an offer on 8 October 1940. It stated that Dominion status for India was the objective of the British government. However, it referred neither to a date nor method of accomplishment. Only Jinnah got something more precise. \"The British would not contemplate transferring power to a Congress-dominated national government the authority of which was \"denied by large and powerful elements in India's national life\".\n\nIn October 1940, Gandhi and Nehru, abandoning their original stand of supporting Britain, decided to launch a limited civil disobedience campaign in which leading advocates of Indian independence were selected to participate one by one. Nehru was arrested and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. After spending a little more than a year in jail, he was released, along with other Congress prisoners, three days before the bombing of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.\n\n[[File:Nehrujinnah.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Nehru and Jinnah walk together at Simla, 1946]]\nWhen the Japanese carried their attack through Burma (now [[Myanmar]]) to the borders of India in the spring of 1942, the British government, faced by this new military threat, decided to make some overtures to India, as Nehru had originally desired. Prime Minister Winston Churchill dispatched Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the war Cabinet who was known to be politically close to Nehru and also knew Jinnah, with proposals for a settlement of the constitutional problem. As soon as he arrived he discovered that India was more deeply divided than he had imagined. Nehru, eager for a compromise, was hopeful. Gandhi was not. Jinnah had continued opposing the Congress. \"Pakistan is our only demand\", declared the Muslim League newspaper \"Dawn\" and by God we will have it.\"\n\nCripps's mission failed as Gandhi would accept nothing less than independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: <blockquote>Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than difference of opinion to estrange us. We had differences from the time we became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and say so now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Science & culture, Volume 30|publisher=Indian Science News Association|year=1964}}</ref></blockquote>Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.\n\nDuring the period where all of the Congress leadership were in jail, the Muslim League under Jinnah grew in power. In April 1943, the League captured the governments of Bengal and, a month later, that of the North West Frontier Province. In none of these provinces had the League previously had a majority – only the arrest of Congress members made it possible. With all the Muslim dominated provinces except the Punjab under Jinnah's control, the artificial concept of a separate Muslim State was turning into a reality. However, by 1944, Jinnah's power and prestige were on the wane. A general sympathy towards the jailed Congress leaders was developing among Muslims, and much of the blame for the disastrous Bengal famine of 1943–44 during which two million died, had been laid on the shoulders of the province's Muslim League government. The numbers at Jinnah's meetings, once counted in thousands soon numbered only a few hundreds. In despair, Jinnah left the political scene for a stay in Kashmir.\nHis prestige was restored unwittingly by Gandhi, who had been released from prison on medical grounds in May 1944 and had met Jinnah in Bombay in September. There he offered the Muslim leader a plebiscite in the Muslim areas after the war to see whether they wanted to separate from the rest of India. Essentially, it was an acceptance of the principle of Pakistan – but not in so many words. Jinnah demanded that the exact words be said; Gandhi refused and the talks broke down.\nJinnah however had greatly strengthened his own position and that of the League. The most influential member of Congress had been seen to negotiate with him on equal terms. Other Muslim League leaders, opposed both to Jinnah and to the partition of India, lost strength.\n\n==Prime Minister of India (1947–64)==\n[[File:Nehrucon.jpg|thumbnail|Nehru signing the [[Indian Constitution]] c.1950]]\n[[File:Lord Mountbatten swears in Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of free India on Aug 15, 1947.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] swears in Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of free India at the ceremony held at 8:30&nbsp;am [[Indian Standard Time|IST]] on 15 August 1947]]\n[[File:Teen Murti Bhavan in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|[[Teen Murti Bhavan]], Nehru's residence as Prime Minister, now a museum in his memory.]]\n\nNehru and his colleagues had been released as the [[British Cabinet Mission]] arrived to propose plans for transfer of power.\n\nOnce elected, Nehru headed an interim government, which was impaired by outbreaks of communal violence and political disorder, and the opposition of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who were demanding a separate Muslim state of [[Pakistan]]. After failed bids to form coalitions, Nehru reluctantly supported the [[partition of India]], according to a plan released by the British on 3 June 1947. He took office as the [[Prime Minister of India]] on 15 August, and delivered his inaugural address titled \"[[Tryst with Destiny]]\".\n\n<blockquote>\"Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.\"<ref name=\"Tryst\">[[Wikisource:A Tryst With Destiny]]</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 30 January 1948, Gandhi was shot while he was walking to a platform from which he was to address a prayer meeting. The assassin, [[Nathuram Godse]], was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha, who held Gandhi responsible for weakening India by insisting upon a payment to Pakistan. Nehru addressed the nation through radio:\n\n<blockquote>[[the light has gone out of our lives|Friends and comrades, the light has gone out of our lives]], and there is darkness everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.<ref name=\"Jai1996\">{{cite book|author=Janak Raj Jai|title=1947–1980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Wrc1K0uJTgC&pg=PA45|year=1996|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=978-81-86030-23-3|pages=45–47}}</ref><ref>[[s:The Light Has Gone Out|Nehru's address on\nGandhi's death]].

The Congress tightly controlled the epic public displays of grief over a two-week period—the funeral, mortuary rituals and distribution of the martyr's ashes—as millions participated and hundreds of millions watched. The goal was to assert the power of the government, legitimise the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]]'s control and suppress all religious para-military groups. Nehru and Patel suppressed the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]], the Muslim National Guards, and the [[Khaksars]], with some 200,000 arrests.

A successful land reform was introduced that abolished giant landholdings, but efforts to redistribute land by placing limits on landownership failed. Attempts to introduce large-scale cooperative farming were frustrated by landowning rural elites, who formed the core of the powerful right-wing of the Congress and had considerable political support in opposing the efforts of Nehru. Agricultural production expanded until the early 1960s, as additional land was brought under cultivation and some irrigation projects began to have an effect. The establishment of agricultural universities, modelled after land-grant colleges in the United States, contributed to the development of the economy. These universities worked with high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, initially developed in Mexico and the Philippines, that in the 1960s began the Green Revolution, an effort to diversify and increase crop production. At the same time a series of failed monsoons would cause serious food shortages despite the steady progress and increase in agricultural production.<ref name=\"Farmer 1993 120\">{{Cite book|publisher = Routledge|page = 120|last = Farmer|first = B.

Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union under Nehru and Sardar Patel. Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Bilaspur, became separate provinces. The [[Government of India Act 1935]] remained the constitutional law of India pending adoption of a new Constitution.\n\nThe new Constitution of India, which came into force on 26 January 1950, made India a sovereign democratic republic. Nehru declared the new republic to be a \"Union of States\". The constitution of 1950 distinguished between three main types of states: Part A states, which were the former governors' provinces of British India, were ruled by an elected governor and state legislature. The Part B states were former princely states or groups of princely states, governed by a rajpramukh, who was usually the ruler of a constituent state, and an elected legislature. The rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India. The Part C states included both the former chief commissioners' provinces and some princely states, and each was governed by a chief commissioner appointed by the President of India. The sole Part D state was the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which were administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the central government.\n\nIn December 1953, Nehru appointed the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] to prepare for the creation of states on linguistic lines. This was headed by Justice [[Fazal Ali]] and the commission itself was also known as the Fazal Ali Commission. The efforts of this commission were overseen by [[Govind Ballabh Pant]], who served as Nehru's Home Minister from December 1954. The commission created a report in 1955 recommending the reorganisation of India's states. Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction between Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as \"states\". A new type of entity, the union territory, replaced the classification as a Part C or Part D state. Nehru stressed commonality among Indians and promoted pan-Indianism. He refused to reorganise states on either religious or ethnic lines. Western scholars have mostly praised Nehru for the integration of the states into a modern republic but the act was not accepted universally in India.\n\n===Social policies===\n[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru with school children at Durgapur copy.jpg|thumb|right|Nehru with schoolchildren at the [[Durgapur Steel Plant]].  Durgapur along with [[Rourkela Steel Plant|Rourkela]] and [[Bhilai Steel Plant|Bhilai]] were the three integrated steel plants set up under India's [[Five-Year Plans of India#Second Five-Year Plan (1956–1961)|Second Five-Year Plan]] in the late 1950s.]]\nJawaharlal Nehru was a passionate advocate of education for India's children and youth, believing it essential for India's future progress. His government oversaw the establishment of many institutions of higher learning, including the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]], the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], the [[Indian Institutes of Management]] and the [[National Institutes of Technology]]. Nehru also outlined a commitment in his five-year plans to guarantee free and compulsory primary education to all of India's children. For this purpose, Nehru oversaw the creation of mass village enrolment programmes and the construction of thousands of schools. Nehru also launched initiatives such as the provision of free milk and meals to children to fight malnutrition. Adult education centres, vocational and technical schools were also organised for adults, especially in the rural areas.\n\nUnder Nehru, the Indian Parliament enacted many changes to Hindu law to criminalise caste discrimination and increase the legal rights and social freedoms of women.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| volume = 28\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 165–194\n| last = Som\n| first = Reba\n| title = Jawaharlal Nehru and the Hindu Code: A Victory of Symbol over Substance?\n| journal = Modern Asian Studies\n| date = February 1994\n| doi = 10.1017/S0026749X00011732\n| jstor = 312925\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = SUNY Press\n| page = 3|isbn=81-86706-49-6\n| quote = The Hindu Code Bill was visualised by Ambedkar and Nehru as the flagship of modernisation and a radical revision of Hindu law...it is widely regarded as dramatic benchmark legislation giving Hindu women equitable if not superior entitlements as legal subjects.\n| last = Basu\n| first = Srimati\n| title = She Comes to Take Her Rights: Indian Women, Property, and Propriety\n| year = 2005|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mXgX8rrW6JsC&pg=PA3\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Routledge\n| page = 328\n| quote = One subject that particularly interested Nehru was the reform of Hindu law, particularly with regard to the rights of Hindu women...\n| last = Kulke\n| first = Hermann\n|author2=Dietmar Rothermund\n| title = A History of India|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C&pg=PA328\n| year = 2004|isbn=0-415-32919-1\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n| page = 115\n| url=https://books.google.com/?id=hjilIrVt9hUC&pg=PA115|isbn=0-521-65377-0\n| last = Forbes\n| quote = It is our birthright to demand equitable adjustment of Hindu law....\n| first = Geraldine\n|author2=Geraldine Hancock Forbes |author3=Gordon Johnson\n | title = Women in Modern India\n| year = 1999\n}}</ref>\nA system of reservations in government services and educational institutions was created to eradicate the social inequalities and disadvantages faced by peoples of the [[scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]]. Nehru also championed secularism and religious harmony, increasing the representation of minorities in government.\n\nNehru specifically wrote Article 44 of the Indian constitution under the Directive Principles of State Policy which states : 'The State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India.' The article has formed the basis of secularism in India.<ref>Erckel, Sebastian (2011). ''India and the European Union – Two Models of Integration'', GRIN Verlag, ISBN 365601048X, p. 128</ref> However, Nehru has been criticised for the inconsistent application of the law. Most notably, Nehru allowed Muslims to keep their personal law in matters relating to marriage and inheritance. Also in the small state of Goa, a civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws was allowed to continue, and Muslim Personal law was prohibited by Nehru. This was the result of the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when Nehru promised the people that their laws would be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective secularism.\n\nWhile Nehru exempted Muslim law from legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind this act was to give everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could not be found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.\n\nNehru led the faction of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress party]] which promoted Hindi as the lingua-franca of the Indian nation. After an exhaustive and divisive debate with the non-Hindi speakers, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India in 1950 with English continuing as an associate official language for a period of fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations. The issue was resolved during the premiership of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], who under great pressure from Nehru's daughter, [[Indira Gandhi]], was made to give assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by [[Indira Gandhi]] to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current \"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism\" of the Indian Republic.\n\n===Foreign policies===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-61849-0001, Indien, Otto Grotewohl bei Ministerpräsident Nehru.jpg|thumb|Nehru with [[Otto Grotewohl]], the [[Prime Minister of East Germany]]]]\n[[File:Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru with Girja Shankar Bajpai.jpg|thumb| Nehru with the Indian Minister of External Affairs [[Girija Shankar Bajpai]] in the  first [[1948 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|meeting of Commonwealth]] Prime Ministers in 1948 in [[London]].]]\n{{See also|Role of India in Non-Aligned Movement}}\nNehru led newly independent India from 1947 to 1964, during its first years of independence from British rule. Both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] competed to make India an ally throughout the [[Cold War]]. Nehru also maintained good relations with the British Empire. Under the [[London Declaration]], India agreed that, when it became a republic in January 1950, it would join the Commonwealth of Nations and accept the British monarch as a \"symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth.\" The other nations of the Commonwealth recognised India's continuing membership of the association. The reaction back home was favourable; only the far-left and the far-right criticised Nehru's decision.\n\nOn the international scene, Nehru was a champion of [[pacifism]] and a strong supporter of the United Nations. He pioneered the policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]] and co-founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] of nations professing neutrality between the rival blocs of nations led by the US and the USSR. Recognising the People's Republic of China soon after its founding (while most of the Western bloc continued relations with the [[Republic of China]]), Nehru argued for its inclusion in the United Nations and refused to brand the Chinese as the aggressors in their conflict with Korea.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Robert Sherrod |title=Nehru:The Great Awakening| journal=The Saturday Evening Post|volume=236 |date=19 January 1963 |pages=60–67 |issue=2}}</ref> He sought to establish warm and friendly relations with China in 1950, and hoped to act as an intermediary to bridge the gulf and tensions between the communist states and the Western bloc.\n\nNehru had promised in 1948 to hold a [[plebiscite]] in [[Kashmir]] under the auspices of the UN. Kashmir was a disputed territory between India and Pakistan, the two having [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|gone to war]] with each other over the state in 1948. However, as Pakistan failed to pull back troops in accordance with the UN resolution and as Nehru grew increasingly wary of the UN, he declined to hold a plebiscite in 1953. His policies on Kashmir and the integration of the state into India was frequently defended in front of the United Nations by his aide, [[Krishna Menon]], a brilliant diplomat who earned a reputation in India for his passionate speeches.\n[[File:Indo US.jpg|thumb|Nehru receiving US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at Parliament House, 1959]]\n\nNehru, while a pacifist, was not blind to the political and geostrategic reality of India in 1947. While laying the foundation stone of the [[National Defence Academy]] (India) in 1949, he stated: \"We, who for generations had talked about and attempted in everything a peaceful way and practised non-violence, should now be, in a sense, glorifying our army, navy and air force. It means a lot. Though it is odd, yet it simply reflects the oddness of life. Though life is logical, we have to face all contingencies, and unless we are prepared to face them, we will go under.\nThere was no greater prince of peace and apostle of non-violence than [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Father of the Nation, whom we have lost, but yet, he said it was better to take the sword than to surrender, fail or run away.\nWe cannot live carefree assuming that we are safe. Human nature is such. We cannot take the risks and risk our hard-won freedom.

Their first formal codification in treaty form was in an agreement between China and India in 1954. They were enunciated in the preamble to the \"Agreement (with exchange of notes) on trade and intercourse between Tibet Region of China and India\", which was signed at Peking on 29 April 1954. Negotiations took place in Delhi from December 1953 to April 1954 between the Delegation of the PRC Government and the Delegation of the Indian Government on the relations between the two countries with respect to the disputed territories of [[Aksai Chin]] and South Tibet. The treaty was disregarded in the 1960s, but in the 1970s, the Five Principles again came to be seen as important in [[Sino-Indian relations]], and more generally as norms of relations between states. They became widely recognised and accepted throughout the region during the [[premiership of Indira Gandhi]] and the 3-year rule of the [[Janata Party]] (1977–1980).<ref>The full text of this agreement (which entered into force on 3 June 1954): {{cite web |work=[[United Nations Treaty Series]] |volume=299 |publisher=United Nations |location=New York |year=1958 |pages=57–81 |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/publication/unts/volume%20299/v299.pdf |format=PDF |title=Treaties and international agreements registered or filed and recorded with the Secretariat of the United Nations |deadurl=no |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Nehru had criticised the joint invasion of the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal]] by the British, French and Israelis. The role of Nehru, both as Indian Prime Minister and a leader of the [[Non Aligned Movement]] was significant; he tried to be even-handed between the two sides, while denouncing Eden and co-sponsors of the invasion vigorously. Nehru had a powerful ally in the US president Dwight Eisenhower who, if relatively silent publicly, went to the extent of using America's clout in the [[IMF]] to make Britain and France back down. The episode greatly raised the prestige of Nehru and India amongst the third world nations. During the [[Suez crisis]], Nehru's right-hand man, Menon attempted to persuade a recalcitrant [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Nasser]] to compromise with the West, and was instrumental in moving Western powers towards an awareness that Nasser might prove willing to compromise.\n\nIn 1957, Menon was instructed to deliver an unprecedented eight-hour speech defending India's stand on Kashmir; to date, the speech is the longest ever delivered in the [[United Nations Security Council]], covering five hours of the 762nd meeting on 23 January, and two hours and forty-eight minutes on the 24th, reportedly concluding with Menon's collapse on the Security Council floor. During the [[filibuster]], Nehru moved swiftly and successfully to consolidate Indian power in Kashmir (then under great unrest). Menon's passionate defence of Indian sovereignty in Kashmir enlarged his base of support in India, and led to the Indian press temporarily dubbing him the \"Hero of Kashmir\". Nehru was then at the peak of his popularity in India; the only (minor) criticism came from the far-right.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/8272473.stm|title=A short history of long speeches|publisher=BBC News|date=25 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Majid, Amir A. |url=http://www.ier.ro/documente/rjea_vol7_no3/RJEA_Vol7_No3_Can_Self_Determination_Solve_the_Kashmir_Dispute.pdf |title=Can Self Determination Solve the Kashmir Dispute? |journal=Romanian Journal of European Affairs |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=2007 |page=38 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316211935/http://www.ier.ro/documente/rjea_vol7_no3/RJEA_Vol7_No3_Can_Self_Determination_Solve_the_Kashmir_Dispute.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe US had hoped to court Nehru after its intervention in favour of Nasser during the Suez crisis. However, [[Cold War]] suspicions and the American distrust of Nehruvian socialism cooled relations between India and the US, which suspected Nehru of tacitly supporting the Soviet Union. Nehru maintained good relations with Britain even after the Suez Crisis. Nehru accepted the arbitration of the UK and World Bank, signing the [[Indus Water Treaty]] in 1960 with Pakistani ruler [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] to resolve long-standing disputes about sharing the resources of the major rivers of the Punjab region.\n\nAlthough the [[Pancha Sila]] (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence) was the basis of the 1954 Sino-Indian border treaty, in later years, Nehru's foreign policy suffered through increasing Chinese assertiveness over border disputes and Nehru's decision to grant [[political asylum]] to the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. After years of failed negotiations, Nehru authorised the [[Indian Army]] to [[Invasion of Goa|invade]] Portuguese controlled [[Portuguese India|Goa]] in 1961, and then he formally annexed it to India. It increased his popularity in India, but he was criticised by the communist opposition in India for the use of military force. The use of military force against Portugal earned him goodwill amongst the right-wing and far-right groups.\n\n==Sino-Indian War of 1962==\n[[File:Carlos Nehru.jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister Nehru talks with United Nations General Assembly President Romulo (October 1949).]]\nFrom 1959, in a process that accelerated in 1961, Nehru adopted the \"Forward Policy\" of setting up military outposts in disputed areas of the Sino-Indian border, including in 43 outposts in territory not previously controlled by India.<ref>Noorani, A.G. [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2017/stories/20030829001604900.htm \"Perseverance in peace process\"], ''Frontline'', 29 August 2003.</ref> China attacked some of these outposts, and thus the [[Sino-Indian War]] began, which India lost, and China withdrew to pre-war lines in eastern zone at Tawang but retained Aksai Chin which was within British India and was handed over to India after independence. Later, Pakistan handed over some portion of Kashmir near Siachen controlled by Pakistan since 1948 to China. The war exposed the unpreparedness of India's military which could send only 14,000 troops to the war zone in opposition to the many times larger Chinese army, and Nehru was widely criticised for his government's insufficient attention to defence. In response, Nehru sacked the defence minister [[Krishna Menon]] and sought US military aid. Nehru's improved relations with the US under [[John F. Kennedy]] proved useful during the war, as in 1962, President of Pakistan (then closely aligned with the Americans) [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] was made to guarantee his neutrality in regards to India, who was threatened by \"communist aggression from Red China\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842104-10,00.html | work=Time | title=Asia: Ending the Suspense | date=17 September 1965}}</ref> The Indian relationship with the Soviet Union, criticised by right-wing groups supporting free-market policies was also seemingly validated. Nehru would continue to maintain his commitment to the non-aligned movement despite calls from some to settle down on one permanent ally.\n\nThe aftermath of the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the future, and placed pressure on Nehru, who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese attack on India. Under American advice (by American envoy John Kenneth Galbraith who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis) Nehru refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the Indian air force to beat back the Chinese advances. The CIA later revealed that at that time the Chinese had neither the fuel nor runways long enough for using their air force effectively in Tibet. Indians in general became highly sceptical of China and its military. Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question Nehru's usage of the term \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\"). The war also put an end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers.<ref name=\"Garver\">{{cite web|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/garver.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326032121/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~johnston/garver.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009 |title=China's Decision for War with India in 1962 by John W.

India's policy of weaponisation via indigenous sources and self-sufficiency began in earnest under Nehru, completed by his daughter Indira Gandhi, who later led India to a crushing military victory over rival Pakistan in 1971. Toward the end of the war India had increased her support for Tibetan refugees and revolutionaries, some of them having settled in India, as they were fighting the same common enemy in the region. Nehru ordered the raising of an elite Indian-trained \"Tibetan Armed Force\" composed of Tibetan refugees, which served with distinction in future wars against Pakistan in 1965 and 1971.<ref>Gangdruk, Chushi. \"[http://www.chushigangdruk.org/history/history11.html Chushi Gangdruk: History]\", ChushiGangdruk.Org</ref>\n\nDuring the conflict, Nehru wrote two desperate letters to US President John F. Kennedy, requesting 12 squadrons of fighter jets and a modern radar system. These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis during most of the Sino-Indian War), leading to a cool down in Indo-US relations. According to former Indian diplomat G Parthasarathy, \"only after we got nothing from the US did arms supplies from the Soviet Union to India commence\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jawaharlal-Nehru-pleaded-for-US-help-against-China-in-1962/articleshow/6931810.cms |work=The Times of India | title=Jawaharlal Nehru pleaded for US help against China in 1962 | date=16 November 2010}}</ref> Per ''Time'' Magazine's 1962 editorial on the war, however, this may not have been the case. The editorial states, 'When Washington finally turned its attention to India, it honoured the ambassador's pledge, loaded 60 US planes with $5,000,000 worth of automatic weapons, heavy mortars and land mines. Twelve huge C-130 Hercules transports, complete with US crews and maintenance teams, took off for New Delhi to fly Indian troops and equipment to the battle zone. Britain weighed in with Bren and Sten guns, and airlifted 150 tons of arms to India. Canada prepared to ship six transport planes.

This proved particularly important as post-Independence differences surfaced since British withdrawal from the subcontinent prompted regional leaders to no longer relate to one another as allies against a common adversary. While differences of culture and, especially, language threatened the unity of the new nation, Nehru established programs such as the National Book Trust and the National Literary Academy which promoted the translation of regional literatures between languages and also organised the transfer of materials between regions.

His birthday, 14 November is celebrated in India as ''Bal Divas'' (\"[[Children's Day in India|Children's Day]]\") in recognition of his lifelong passion and work for the welfare, education and development of children and young people. Children across India remember him as ''Chacha Nehru'' (Uncle Nehru). Nehru remains a popular symbol of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] which frequently celebrates his memory. Congress leaders and activists often emulate his style of clothing, especially the ''[[Gandhi cap]]'' and the \"[[Nehru jacket]]\", and his mannerisms. Nehru's ideals and policies continue to shape the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]]'s [[manifesto]] and core political philosophy. An emotional attachment to his legacy was instrumental in the rise of his daughter Indira to leadership of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] and the national government.\n\nNehru's personal preference for the [[sherwani]] ensured that it continues to be considered formal wear in North India today; aside from lending his name to a kind of cap, the [[Nehru jacket]] is named in his honour because of his preference for that style.\n\nNumerous public institutions and memorials across India are dedicated to Nehru's memory. The [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru University]] in Delhi is among the most prestigious universities in India. The [[Jawaharlal Nehru Port]] near the city of Mumbai is a modern port and [[dock (maritime)|dock]] designed to handle a huge cargo and traffic load. Nehru's residence in Delhi is preserved as the [[Teen Murti House]] now has [[Nehru Memorial Museum and Library]], and one of five [[Nehru Planetarium]]s that were set in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Allahabad and Pune.  The complex also houses the offices of the 'Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund', established in 1964 under the Chairmanship of Dr [[S. Radhakrishnan]], then President of India. The foundation also gives away the prestigious 'Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fellowship', established in 1968.<ref>[http://www.jnmf.in/history.html History] Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, Official website.</ref> The Nehru family homes at [[Anand Bhavan]] and [[Swaraj Bhavan]] are also preserved to commemorate Nehru and his family's legacy.\n\n===In popular culture===\n\nMany documentaries about Nehru's life have been produced. He has also been portrayed in fictionalised films. The canonical performance is probably that of [[Roshan Seth]], who played him three times: in [[Richard Attenborough]]'s 1982 film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', [[Shyam Benegal]]'s 1988 television series ''[[Bharat Ek Khoj]]'', based on Nehru's ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', and in a 2007 TV film entitled ''The Last Days of the Raj''.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0986237/ The Last Days of the Raj (2007) (TV)]. imdb.com</ref> In [[Ketan Mehta]]'s film ''[[Sardar (1993 film)|Sardar]]'', Nehru was portrayed by [[Benjamin Gilani]]. [[Girish Karnad]]'s historical play, ''Tughlaq'' (1962) is an allegory about the Nehruvian era. It was staged by [[Ebrahim Alkazi]] with [[National School of Drama]] Repertory at [[Purana Qila]], Delhi in the 1970s and later at the Festival of India, London in 1982.<ref name=hin>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1603/16031170.htm AWARDS: The multi-faceted playwright] ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'', Vol. 16, No. 3, 30 January – 12 February 1999.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Authors speak|chapter= Girish Karnad|author=Sachindananda|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2006|isbn=81-260-1945-X |page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGWa7v08JikC&pg=PT82}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Writings==\nNehru was a prolific writer in English and wrote a number of books, such as ''[[The Discovery of India]]'', ''[[Glimpses of World History]]'', and his autobiography, ''[[An Autobiography (Nehru)|Toward Freedom]].''
