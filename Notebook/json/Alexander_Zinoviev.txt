Alternative transliterations: Alexandr, Alexandre, Alexander, Zinoviev, Zinov’yev, Zinov’ev</ref> (October 29, 1922 – May 10, 2006) was a Russian [[logic]]ian and [[Russian literature|writer]] of social critique.\n\nBorn to a poor provincial family, he distinguished himself in World War II and later in the scholarship of [[logic]]. In the 1970s he criticized [[Politics of the Soviet Union|the Soviet political system]], sacrificing his high academic station in Moscow. Eventually Zinoviev faced [[exile]] in 1978, after his novels ''[[Yawning Heights]]'' and ''The Radiant Future'' were published in Europe. He continued to develop his socio-philosophical ideas in subsequent publications, at times employing his original genre of the ''sociological novel''.\n\nAfter the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union]], Zinovyev wrote a book ''A Russian Tragedy'' (Русская Трагедия) about the USSR's collapse, calling it a catastrophe. In his later life, he championed the Soviet system and regarded post-Soviet Russia with disdain. He considered Stalin as one of the greatest personalities in history.<ref>http://gtmarket.ru/laboratory/publicdoc/2006/2658</ref>\n\n==Youth==\nAleksandr Aleksandrovich Zinovyev was born in the village of [[Chuchlomsky District|Pakhtino]], [[Chukhlomsky District]], [[Kostroma Oblast]] as the sixth child to Aleksandr Yakovlevich and Appolinariya Vasilyevna. A few years later they moved to Moscow, seeking better quality of life.\n\nZinovyev excelled at school, and in 1939 entered the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History. He was soon expelled for a negative attitude to forced [[collectivisation]], and forbidden to enroll with any other institute. He alleged that he was involved in a plot to assassinate [[Joseph Stalin]] during a school parade, but that the plan was called off; also, that he got arrested, but evaded prosecution. He joined the [[Red Army]] in 1940 and fought in the [[Great Patriotic War]], even as [[fighter pilot]], receiving honours and awards for a distinguished service.\n\n==Scientific work in Moscow==\nIn 1946 Alexander Zinoviev entered [[Moscow State University]]; he since told that his ban from higher education was overlooked for a bribe – a box of [[confectionery|sweets]]. He graduated in 1951 ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' with a thesis<ref>''Voskhozhdenie ot abstraktnogo k konkretnomu : na materiale \"Kapitala\" K. Marksa'' Kafedra filosofii RAN, ISBN 5-201-02089-5</ref> on the logical structure of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]’ ''[[Das Kapital]]''. During the following decades he became one of the most important logicians of the USSR.\n\nAs professor and head of Logic department at MSU, Zinoviev accumulated a subtly [[dissident]] reputation, having refused to expel politically discriminated staff, and, in a gesture of protest against [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev]]’s cult of personality, resigned from the editorial board of “Problems of Philosophy”, the leading Soviet journal on philosophy at that time.\n\n==The sociological novel==\nZinoviev’s diverse satirical stories agglomerated into his first major non-academic work, ''[[Yawning Heights]]''. After the release of the book in Switzerland in 1976, Zinovyev was demoted from his lecturer’s position, evicted from the Academy of Sciences, stripped of all awards including his war medals, and offered the liberty to [[exile|leave]] the Soviet Union after his second novel of similar satirical style, ''The Radiant Future'', was published in the West in 1978. With his family he settled in [[Munich]] where they lived until 1999.\n\n''Yawning Heights'' was a success, soon translated into most major European languages and read aloud in Russian via Western radio broadcasts.\n\n===Sociological work in exile===\nAmong Zinovyev’s non-fictional works from that time are ''Without Illusions'' (1979), ''The Reality of Communism'' (1980), ''We and the West'' (1981), ''Communism as a Reality'' (1981), ''Gorbachevism'' (1987). The latter was first published in French, 1987 (Lausanne, ''L'Âge d'homme''). ''Without Illusions'' is a collection of essays, lectures, and broadcasts by Zinovyev published in various sources, including Polish exile journal [[Kultura]] printed in Paris. He explained thereby his way of interpretation of the Communist society, while expressing loyalty to the [[scientific method]]. Zinovyev postulated that the Western powers had underestimated the threat of Communism, and especially the peaceful infiltration of Communist traits into Western society. He claimed that Communism did not destroy, and principally could not have destroyed the social differences among the people, changing only the outward manifestations of inequality. In 1989 in an interview with [[Kultura]] he said that it's completely unrealistic to expect that [[USSR]] [[satellite state]]s (mentioning [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]) would ever leave the [[Soviet sphere of influence]], arguing that his opinion is based on \"solid sociological theory built on top of [[formal logic]]\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://static.kulturaparyska.com/attachments/be/f9/5896a979337f8045cb4dc11aaf68b0b6c8ac2e38.pdf#page=31 | trans_title=Interview with Alexander Zinoview | title=Rozmowa z Aleksandrem Zinowiewem | publisher=Kultura | date=September 1981 | accessdate=2014-09-18 |language=Polish}}</ref>\n\nZinovyev emphasized his view that the Soviet regime’s main peculiarities were not irrational in essence, nor the result of some incidental circumstances. Rather, he asserted, they followed from the inherent “laws of society”, the systematic outcome of the combined actions of its participants. However, Zinovyev was one of the most outspoken critics of the Soviet regime until the era of [[Perestroyka]].<ref>''[[Without Illusions]]'' – (Без иллюзий), 1979. The text in Russian: http://antisoviet.imwerden.de/zinoviev_a_bez_illuz.html.zip</ref> Unlike [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]], who sought a kind of revival of pre-1917 Russia, Zinovyev denied all credit to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and to [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] doctrines.\n\nIn his book ''The West: phenomenon of Westernism'' (1995) Zinoviev presented a detailed analysis of the modern capitalist society which he called \"Westernism\". In the introduction to the book Zinoviev wrote that he came to the conclusion that can be summarized as follows. In economic terms Westernism strives to create jobs and revenue streams for those who do not produce products and services, and to strengthen private enterprise as the most effective means of forcing people to work. In social and political terms Westernism seeks to strengthen undemocratic aspect of the society, and transform democracy into a camouflage for the totalitarian state rule.\n\n==After the ''“Catastroika”''==\nZinovyev ceased to criticise Communism at the very dawn of [[Perestroika]], years before the upsurge of crime and socio-economic problems that Russia faced in the 1990s. He spoke in defense of some aspects of the Soviet regime, and most radically condemned the reforms initiated by [[Boris Yeltsin]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} He argues that the West was the key influence in the Union's downfall: “Headed by the United States (a global ''supersociety'' based in the USA), the West has purposely implemented a program for destroying Russia”.<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4659.html Johnson's Russia List # 4659<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1996, he appealed to the public to support [[Gennady Zyuganov]], a [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist]] candidate who eventually lost [[Russian presidential election, 1996|the presidential election]] to Yeltsin. According to [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], Zinovyev spoke of [[collectivisation in the USSR]] as of a “long-awaited gift to the Russian peasantry”.<ref>Александр Солженицын, Россия в обвале, 1998 (гл. 25. Болезни русского национализма) [http://antisoviet.imwerden.de/Solzh/v_obvale_toc.html]</ref>\n\nIn a 1999 [http://russia-insider.com/en/history/russian-thinker-1999the-end-communism-russai-signalized-end-democracy-west-alexander interview], Zinovyev said:\n\n{{bquote|Once I was an unwitting accomplice of this action that I found shameful. The West wanted and programmed the Russian catastrophe. I read documents and participated in the research, which under the guise of ideological struggle worked towards the destruction of Russia. This became so unbearable for me that I could no longer stay in the camp of those who destroy my people and my country. The West is not a stranger to me, but I consider it an enemy empire.}}\n\n===Return to Russia===\nAfter 21 years of exile, Aleksandr Zinovyev returned to Russia in 1999, declaring that he could no longer live “in the camp of those who are destroying my country and my people”.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=&xml=/news/2006/05/12/db1202.xml Alexander Zinoviev – Telegraph]</ref> He visited and approved of [[Yugoslavia]]’s leader [[Slobodan Milošević]], who was [[Trial of Slobodan Milošević|tried for war crimes]]. Regarding Joseph Stalin, Zinovyev declared: “I consider him one of the greatest persons in the history of mankind. In the history of Russia he was, in my opinion, even greater than [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]. Until Stalin’s death I was anti-Stalinist, but I always regarded him as an outstanding personality.”<ref>[http://www.peoples.ru/art/literature/prose/roman/alexander_zinoviev/ Независимая Газета]</ref>\n\nIn his online interview, Zinovyev maintained that all the accusations brought against Milošević were mere slander; he also declared that he admired [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Ratko Mladić]], whom he regards as significant persons of the 20th century.[http://newsfromrussia.com/politics/2002/03/16/27023.html] Zinovyev was a co-chairman of the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milosevic.<ref>[http://www.icdsm.org/]</ref> He likened the process of [[globalisation]] to a [[World War III|Third World War]], whose first, completed phase was the [[Cold War]].<ref>[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/7119a.cfm]</ref>\n\nOn May 10, 2006, Aleksandr Zinovyev died in Moscow of brain cancer.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4760109.stm Soviet-era satirist Zinovyev dies]</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n(beside Soviet scientific degrees and War medals)\n*member of Finnish Academy of Science, 1974 \n*member of Italian Academy of Science, 1978\n*member of Bavarian Academy of Arts, 1984\n*''Prix Europeén de l'essai'' laureate, 1977\n*award Best European Novel, 1978\n*''Prix Médicis Étranger'' laureate, 1978\n*''[[Prix Alexis de Tocqueville]]'' laureate, 1982\n*honorary citizen of [[Ravenna]], [[Avignon]], [[Orange, Vaucluse|Orange]] and [[Kostroma]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Scientific works===\n*The Philosophical Problems of the [[Many-valued logic|Polyvalential Logic]] (Философские проблемы многозначной логики, 1960)\n*Логика высказываний и теория вывода (1962)\n*The Principles of the Scientific Theory of Scientific Knowledge (Основы научной теории научных знаний, 1967)\n*Complex Logics (Комплексная логика), 1970)\n*The Logics of Science (Логика науки), 1972\n*Logical Physics (Логическая физика), 1972\n\n===Fiction and sociological works===\n*[[Yawning Heights|The Yawning Heights]] (Зияющие высоты) 1976 \n*[[The Radiant Future]] ({{lang|ru|Светлое будущее}}) 1978\n*[[On the Threshold of Paradise]] ({{lang|ru|В преддверии рая}}) 1979\n*[[Without Illusions]]  ({{lang|ru|[http://antisoviet.imwerden.de/zinoviev_a_bez_illuz.html.zip Без иллюзий]}}) 1979\n*[[Notes of the Nightwatchman]] ({{lang|ru|В преддверии рая}}) 1979\n*Communism as a Reality ({{lang|ru|Коммунизм как реальность}}) 1980\n*The Yellow House (Желтый дом) 1980\n*We and the West  ({{lang|ru|Мы и Запад}}) 1981\n*[[Homo Sovieticus|Homo Soveticus]] (Гомо советикус) (1982) ISBN 0-87113-080-7\n*No Liberty, No Equality, No Fraternity  (Ни свободы, ни равенства, ни братства) 1983\n*[[Para Bellum]] ({{lang|ru|Пара беллум}}) 1982\n*My Home my Exile ({{lang|ru|Мой дом – моя чужбина}}) 1982\n*The Wings of Our Youth ({{lang|ru|[http://moshkow.perm.ru/win/PROZA/ZINOWXEW/polet.txt Нашей юности полёт]}}) 1983\n*Gospels for Ivan ({{lang|ru|Евангелие для Ивана}}) 1982\n*Go to Golgatha ([http://moshkow.perm.ru/win/PROZA/ZINOWXEW/golgofa.txt Иди на Голгофу]) 1985\n*[[Gorbachevism]] (Горбачевизм) 1988\n*Catastroika ([http://moshkow.perm.ru/win/PROZA/ZINOWXEW/ktastrojka.txt Катастройка]) 1988\n*Live!
