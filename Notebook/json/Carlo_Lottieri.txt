Following Raimondo Cubeddu and Alberto Mingardi, in his work Lottieri \"argues for the legitimacy of many so-called 'monopolistic practices' (cartels, monopolization, mergers,  predatory pricing…), and for the legitimacy of conglomerates, and big business at large,  vis-à-vis those governmental agencies built to thoroughly implement 'competition' from top to bottom\".<ref>Raimondo Cubeddu - Alberto Mingardi, \"Preface\", ''Ethics & Politics'', 2003, 2, p. 2.</ref>\nHis last book emphasizes the historic features of the modern State, suggesting to libertarian scholars to understand the cultural and even theological implications of the struggle between the rulers and the ruled.<ref>Partially, this topic had been examined in a previous paper written in cooperation with an Italian colleague: Luigi Marco Bassani - Carlo Lottieri, \"The Problem of Security; Historicity of the State and \"European Realism\", in Hans-Hermann Hoppe, ''The Myth of National Defense'', Auburn AL, The Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2003.</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Single-authored books===\n* ''[https://www.amazon.com/Every-New-Right-Freedom-Lost-ebook/dp/B01ID08BCW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1468501833&sr=1-1&keywords=Lottieri Every New Right Is A Freedom Lost]''. e-book, translated by Chiara Brown, 2016.\n* ''Credere nello Stato?
