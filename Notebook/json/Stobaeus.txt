The work was originally divided into two volumes containing two books each. The two volumes became separated in the manuscript tradition, and the first volume became known as the ''Extracts'' (also ''Eclogues'') and the second volume became known as the ''Anthology'' (also ''Florilegium''). Modern editions now refer to both volumes as the ''Anthology''. The ''Anthology'' contains extracts from hundreds of writers, especially poets, historians, orators, philosophers and physicians. The subjects covered range from [[natural philosophy]], [[dialectics]], and [[ethics]], to [[politics]], [[economics]], and maxims of practical wisdom. The work preserves fragments of many authors and works who otherwise might be unknown today.\n\n==Life==\nOf his life nothing is known.<ref name=\"eb1911\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Stobaeus, Joannes}}</ref> He derived his surname apparently from being a native of [[Stobi]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia Salutaris]].<ref name=\"mason\"/> The age in which he lived cannot be fixed with accuracy.<ref name=\"mason\">Mason 1870, pp. 914–5</ref> He quotes no writer later than the early 5th century, and he probably lived around this time.<ref name=\"mason\"/> From his silence in regard to [[Christianity|Christian]] authors, it has been inferred that he was not a Christian.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> His name, though, would rather indicate a Christian, or at least the son of Christian parents.<ref name=\"mason\"/>\n\n==Work==\nHis anthology is a very valuable collection of extracts from earlier Greek writers, which he collected and arranged, in the order of subjects, as a repertory of valuable and instructive sayings.<ref name=\"mason\"/> In most of the manuscripts there is a division into three books, forming two distinct works; the first and second books forming one work under the title ''Physical and Moral Extracts'' (also ''Eclogues''; Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἐκλογαὶ φυσικαὶ καὶ ἠθικαί}}), the third book forming another work, called ''[[Florilegium]]'' or ''Sermones'' (or ''Anthology''; {{lang|grc|Ἀνθολόγιον}}).<ref name=\"mason\"/> The extracts were intended by Stobaeus for his son Septimius, and were preceded by a letter briefly explaining the purpose of the work and giving a summary of the contents. It is evident from this summary, preserved in [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]'s ''Bibliotheca''<ref>Photius, ''Cod.'' 167</ref> (9th century), that the work was originally divided into four books and two volumes,<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> and that surviving manuscripts of the third book consist of two books which have been merged.<ref name=\"mason\"/>\n\nAs each of the four books is sometimes called ''Anthologion'', it is probable that this name originally belonged to the entire work.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> The full title, according to Photius, was ''Four Books of Extracts, Sayings and Precepts'' (Ἐκλογῶν, ἀποφθεγμάτων, ὑποθηκῶν βιβλία τέσσαρα<!--ἐν τεύχεσι δυσί--> [''Eklogon, apophthegmaton, hypothekon biblia tessara'']).<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> At some time subsequent to Photius the two volumes were separated, and the two volumes became known to Latin Europe as the ''Eclogae'' and the ''Florilegium'' respectively.<ref name=\"scottferguson\">Scott & Ferguson 1936, pp. 82–5</ref> Modern editions have dropped these two titles and have reverted to calling the entire work the ''Anthology'' ({{lang-la|Anthologium}}).<ref name=\"scottferguson\"/>\n\nThe introduction to the whole work, treating of the value of philosophy and of philosophical sects, is lost, with the exception of the concluding portion; the second book is little more than a fragment, and the third and fourth have been amalgamated by altering the original sections.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> Each chapter of the four books is headed by a title describing its matter.<ref name=\"mason\"/> Stobaeus quoted more than five hundred writers, generally beginning with the poets, and then proceeding to the historians, orators, philosophers, and physicians.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> The works of the greater part of these have perished.<ref name=\"mason\"/> It is to him that we owe many of our most important fragments of the dramatists.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> He has quoted over 500 passages from [[Euripides]], 150 from [[Sophocles]], and over 200 from [[Menander]].<ref name=\"mason\"/>\n\n===Books 1 and 2===\nThe first two books (\"Eclogues\") consist for the most part of extracts conveying the views of earlier poets and prose writers on points of physics, dialectics, and ethics.<ref name=\"mason\"/> We learn from Photius that the first book was preceded by a dissertation on the advantages of philosophy, an account of the different schools of philosophy, and a collection of the opinions of ancient writers on geometry, music, and arithmetic.<ref name=\"mason\"/> The greater part of this introduction is lost. The close of it only, where arithmetic is spoken of, is still extant. The first book was divided into sixty chapters, the second into forty-six, of which the manuscripts preserve only the first nine.<ref name=\"mason\"/> Some of the missing parts of the second book (chapters 15, 31, 33, and 46) have, however, been recovered from a 14th-century [[wikt:gnomology|gnomology]].<ref name=\"scottferguson\"/> His knowledge of physics — in the wide sense which the Greeks assigned to this term — is often untrustworthy.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> Stobaeus betrays a tendency to confound the dogmas of the early [[Ionian philosophy|Ionian philosophers]], and he occasionally mixes up [[Platonism]] with [[Pythagoreanism]].<ref name=\"eb1911\"/> For part of the first book and much of the second, it is clear that he depended on the (lost) works of the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] philosopher [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] and the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Arius Didymus]].<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\n===Books 3 and 4===\nThe third and fourth books (\"Florilegium\") are devoted to subjects of a moral, political, and economic kind, and maxims of practical wisdom.<ref name=\"mason\"/> The third book originally consisted of forty-two chapters, and the fourth of fifty-eight.<ref name=\"mason\"/> These two books, like the larger part of the second, treat of ethics; the third, of virtues and vices, in pairs; the fourth, of more general ethical and political subjects, frequently citing extracts to illustrate the pros and cons of a question in two successive chapters.<ref name=\"eb1911\"/>\n\n===Editions===\nThe first edition of books 1 and 2 was that by [[Wilhelm Canter|G. Canter]] (Antwerp, 1575).<ref name=\"mason\"/> There were subsequent editions made by [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren|A. H. L. Heeren]] (Göttingen, 1792–1801, in 4 vols. 8vo.), and [[Thomas Gaisford]] (Oxford, 1850).<ref name=\"mason\"/> The first edition of books 3 and 4 was that edited by [[Vettore Trincavelli|Trincavelli]] (Venice, 4to. 1536).<ref name=\"mason\"/> Three editions were published by [[Conrad Gessner]] (Zurich, 1543; Basle, 1549; Zurich; 1559), and another by Gaisford (Oxford, 1822, 4 vols. 8vo.).<ref name=\"mason\"/> The first edition of the whole of Stobaeus together was one published at Geneva in 1609.<ref name=\"mason\"/> The next major edition of the whole corpus was that by [[Augustus Meineke]] (Leipzig, 1855–1864). The modern edition is that by [[Curt Wachsmuth]] and [[Otto Hense]] (Berlin, 1884–1912, 5 volumes). Wachsmuth and Hense's edition attempts, as far as possible, to restore the text of the ''Anthology'' as it was written by Stobaeus.<ref name=\"scottferguson\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Thomas Gaisford]] (1822), [http://books.google.gr/books?id=whTgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ad+manuscriptorum+fidem+emendavit&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ioannis Stobaei Florilegium, ad manuscriptorum fidem emendavit et supplevit Thomas Gaisford'', Volume 3], Oxford: [[Clarendon Press|Clarendon]].\n*Thomas Gaisford (1822), [http://books.google.gr/books?id=OAbgAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Ioannis Stobaei Florilegium, ad manuscriptorum fidem emendavit et supplevit Thomas Gaisford'', Volume 4], Oxford: Clarendon.
