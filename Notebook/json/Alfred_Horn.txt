His 1951 paper \"On sentences which are true of direct unions of algebras\" described [[Horn clause]]s and [[Horn sentence]]s, which later would form the foundation of [[logic programming]].\n\nHorn was born on [[Lower East Side, Manhattan]]. His parents were both [[deaf]], and his father died when Horn was three years old. At this point, the children moved in with their grandparents on the mother's side. They would later move to [[Brooklyn]] where Horn spent most of his childhood, raised by his extended family.\n\nHorn attended the [[City College of New York]], and later, [[New York University]] where he earned a [[Master's degree]] in [[mathematics]]. He went on to earn his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1946. A year later, he started work at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1988. \n\nHe died in 2001 in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles]] after eight years of battling [[prostate cancer]].\n\n== References ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130905163259/http://www.math.ucla.edu/info/horn.html Alfred Horn, Palisadian Since 1954 and Noted UCLA Math Professor] &ndash; [[obituary]] from UCLA\n* [http://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/fmi/logic/skordev/ln/lp/ahornpbl.htm Publications of Alfred Horn] &ndash; a list compiled by [[Dimiter Skordev]]\n* [http://www.genealogy.ams.org/id.php?id=31660 Alfred Horn] &ndash; the information about him in the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horn, Alfred}}\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American logicians]]\n[[Category:Lattice theorists]]\n[[Category:1918 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:City University of New York alumni]]\n[[Category:New York University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Alfred Horn"}}}}
