He served as the President of the Brazilian Association of Logic and the Director of the Institute of Mathematics at the [[University of Sao Paulo]]. He received many awards and held numerous visiting scholarships at universities and centers of research in all continents.<ref name=\"KM\"/>\n\nDa Costa and physicist [[Francisco Antônio Dória]] axiomatized large portions of [[classical physics]] with the help of [[Patrick Suppes]]' predicates. They used that technique to show that for the axiomatized version of  [[dynamical systems theory]], chaotic properties of those systems are undecidable and Gödel-incomplete, that is, a sentence like ''X is chaotic'' is undecidable within that axiomatics. They later exhibited similar results for systems in other areas, such as mathematical economics.\n\nDa Costa believes that the significant progress in the field of logic will give rise to new fundamental developments in computing and technology, especially in connection with non-classical logics and their applications.\n\n===Variable-binding term operators===\nDa Costa is co-discoverer of the truth-set principle and co-creator of the classical logic of variable-binding term operators—both with [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. He is also co-author with Chris Mortensen of the definitive pre-1980 history of variable-binding term operators in classical first order logic: “Notes on the theory of variable-binding term operators”, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol.4 (1983) 63–72.\n\n===P = NP===\nTogether with [[Francisco Antônio Dória]], Da Costa has published two papers with conditional relative proofs of the consistency of [[P = NP]] with the usual \nset-theoretic axioms [[ZFC]]. The results they obtain are similar to the results of DeMillo and Lipton (consistency of P = NP with fragments of arithmetic) and those of Sazonov and Maté (conditional proofs of the consistency of P = NP with strong systems).\n\nBasically da Costa and Doria define a formal sentence [P = NP]' which is the same as P = NP in the standard model for arithmetic; however, because [P = NP]' by its very definition includes a disjunct that is not refutable in ZFC, [P = NP]' is not refutable in ZFC, so ZFC + [P = NP]' is [[consistent]] (assuming that ZFC is).  The paper then continues by an informal proof of the implication \n: If  ZFC + [P = NP]' is consistent, then so is ZFC + [P = NP].\nHowever, a review by [[Ralf Schindler]]<ref>\n[http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1001/1001-007.ps Schindler's review of the P = NP paper] (Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, v. 10 no. 1, March 2004, p. 118f)</ref> points out that this last step is too short and contains a gap. A recently published (2006) clarification by the authors shows that their intent was to exhibit a conditional result that was dependent on what they call   a \"naïvely plausible condition\". The 2003 conditional result can be reformulated, according to da Costa and Doria 2006 (in press), as\n: If ZFC + [P = NP]' is omega-consistent, then ZFC + [P = NP] is consistent.\nSo far no formal argument has been constructed to show that ZFC + [P = NP]' is omega-consistent.\n\nIn his reviews for [[Mathematical Reviews]] of the da Costa/Doria  papers on P=NP, logician [[Andreas Blass]] states that \"the absence of rigor led to numerous errors (and ambiguities)\"; he also rejects  da Costa's \"naïvely plausible condition\", as this assumption is \"based partly on the possible non-totality of [a certain function] F and partly on an axiom equivalent to the totality of F\".\n\n==Selected publications==\n\n===Articles and lectures===\n*N.C.A. da Costa, ''Sistemas Formais Inconsistentes''.
