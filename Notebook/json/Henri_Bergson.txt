Before he was nine, his parents settled in France, Henri becoming a naturalized French citizen.\n\nHenri Bergson married Louise Neuberger, a cousin of [[Marcel Proust]] (1871–1922), in 1891. (The novelist served as [[groomsman#best man|best man]] at Bergson's wedding.)<ref>Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2007, p. 9.</ref> Henri and Louise Bergson had a daughter, Jeanne, born deaf in 1896. Bergson's sister, Mina Bergson (also known as [[Moina Mathers]]), married the English [[occult]] author [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], a founder of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the couple later relocated to Paris as well.\n\nBergson lived the quiet life of a French professor, marked by the publication of his four principal works:\n\n# in 1889, ''[[Time and Free Will]]'' (''Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience'')\n# in 1896, ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (''Matière et mémoire'')\n# in 1907, ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (''L'Évolution créatrice'')\n# in 1932, ''The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'' (''Les deux sources de la morale et de la religion'')\n\nIn 1900 the [[College of France]] selected Bergson to a Chair of Greek and Latin Philosophy, which he held until 1904. He then replaced [[Gabriel Tarde]] in the Chair of Modern Philosophy, which he held until 1920. The public attended his open courses in large numbers.\n\n===Education and career===\n[[File:Bergson1889Diss2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience'' (Dissertation, 1889)]]\n[[File:Bergson1889Diss1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit'' (Dissertation, 1889)]]\nBergson attended the Lycée Fontanes (known as the [[Lycée Condorcet]] 1870–1874 and 1883–present) in Paris from 1868 to 1878.  He had previously received a Jewish religious education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Between 14 and 16, however, he lost his faith. According to Hude (1990), this moral crisis is tied to his discovery of the theory of [[evolution]], according to which humanity shares common ancestry with modern primates, a process generally construed as not needing a creative deity.<ref>Henri Hude, ''Bergson'', Paris, Editions universitaires, 1990, 2 volumes, quoted by Anne Fagot-Largeau in her [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/cours_3.jsp 21 December 2006 course] at the College of France</ref>\n\nWhile at the lycée Bergson won a prize for his scientific work and another, in 1877  when he was eighteen, for the solution of a mathematical problem. His solution was published the following year in ''[[Annales de Mathématiques]].'' It was his first published work. After some hesitation as to whether his career should lie in the sphere of the sciences or that of the [[humanities]], he decided in favour of the latter, to the dismay of his teachers.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau>[[Anne Fagot-Largeau]], [http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/phi_sci/p1184676830986.htm 21 December 2006 course] at the [[College of France]] (audio file of the course)</ref> When he was nineteen, he entered the famous [[École Normale Supérieure]]. During this period, he read [[Herbert Spencer]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He obtained there the degree of ''[[licence ès lettres]]'', and this was followed by that of ''[[Agrégation|agrégation de philosophie]]'' in 1881.\n\nThe same year he received a teaching appointment at the [[lycée]] in [[Angers]], the ancient capital of [[Anjou]]. Two years later he settled at the {{ill|fr|Lycée Blaise-Pascal (Clermont-Ferrand)}} in [[Clermont-Ferrand]], capital of the [[Puy-de-Dôme]] [[département]].\n\nThe year after his arrival at Clermont-Ferrand Bergson displayed his ability in the humanities by the publication of an edition of extracts from [[Lucretius]], with a critical study of the text and of the [[materialism|materialist]] [[cosmology]] of the poet (1884), a work whose repeated editions{{Which|date=November 2009}} give sufficient evidence of its useful place in the promotion of classical study among the youth of France. While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country (the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region), Bergson found time for private study and original work. He crafted his dissertation ''Time and Free Will'', which was submitted, along with a short [[Latin]] thesis on [[Aristotle]] (''Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit'', \"On the Concept of Place in Aristotle\"), for his doctoral degree which was awarded by the [[University of Paris]] in 1889. The work was published in the same year by [[Félix Alcan]]. He also gave courses in Clermont-Ferrand on the [[Pre-Socratic Philosophy|Pre-Socratics]], in particular on [[Heraclitus]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nBergson dedicated ''Time and Free Will'' to [[Jules Lachelier]] (1832–1918), then [[Minister of National Education (France)|public education minister]], a disciple of [[Félix Ravaisson]] (1813–1900) and the author of a philosophical work ''On the Founding of [[inductive reasoning|Induction]]'' (''Du fondement de l'induction'', 1871). Lachelier endeavoured \"to substitute everywhere force for inertia, life for death, and liberty for fatalism\". (Bergson owed much to both of these teachers of the ''École Normale Supérieure''. Compare his memorial address on Ravaisson, who died in 1900.)\n\nBergson settled again in Paris in 1888,<ref>''Henri Bergson: Key Writings'', ed. Keith Ansell Pearson and John Mullarkey. London: Continuum, 2002, p. ix.</ref> and after teaching for some months at the [[municipal college]], known as the ''College Rollin'', he received an appointment at the [[Lycée Henri-Quatre]], where he remained for eight years. There, he read [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and gave a course on his theories.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>  Although Bergson had previously endorsed [[Lamarckism]] and its theory of the [[inheritance of acquired characters|heritability of acquired characteristics]], he came to prefer Darwin's hypothesis of gradual variations, which were more compatible with his continuist vision of life.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nIn 1896 he published his second major work, entitled ''Matter and Memory''. This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of [[perception]] and [[memory]], leading up to a careful consideration of the problems of the relation of body and mind. Bergson had spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works. This is especially obvious in ''Matter and Memory'', where he showed a thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations which had been carried out during the period.\n\nIn 1898 Bergson became ''[[maître de conférences]]'' at his [[alma mater]], École Normale Supérieure, and later in the same year received promotion to a Professorship. The year 1900 saw him installed as Professor at the [[Collège de France]], where he accepted the Chair of [[Greek philosophy|Greek and Latin Philosophy]] in succession to {{ill|fr|Charles Lévêque}}.\n\nAt the first [[International Congress of Philosophy]], held in Paris during the first five days of August, 1900, Bergson read a short, but important, paper, \"Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality\" (''Sur les origines psychologiques de notre croyance à la loi de causalité''). In 1900 [[Felix Alcan]] published a work which had previously appeared in the ''[[Revue de Paris]]'', entitled ''[[Laughter (book)|Laughter]]'' (''Le rire''), one of the most important of Bergson's minor productions. This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in the Auvergne. The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson's views of life, and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable. The main thesis of the work is that [[laughter]] is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings. We laugh at people who fail to adapt to the demands of society, if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism. [[Comedy|Comic]] authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways, and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in there being \"something mechanical encrusted on the living\".<ref>p. 39</ref><ref>Seth Benedict Graham ''[http://etd.library.pitt.edu/ETD/available/etd-11032003-192424/unrestricted/grahamsethb_etd2003.pdf A CULTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE RUSSO-SOVIET ANEKDOT]'', 2003, p. 2</ref>\n\nIn 1901 the [[Académie des sciences morales et politiques]] elected Bergson as a member, and he became a member of the Institute. In 1903  he contributed to the ''[[Revue de métaphysique et de morale]]'' a very important essay entitled ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Bergson)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'' (''Introduction à la metaphysique''), which is useful as a preface to the study of his three large books. He detailed in this essay his philosophical program, realized in the ''Creative Evolution''.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\nOn the death of [[Gabriel Tarde]], the sociologist and philosopher, in 1904, Bergson succeeded him in the Chair of Modern Philosophy. From 4 to 8 September of that year he visited [[Geneva]], attending the Second International Congress of Philosophy, when he lectured on ''The Mind and Thought: A Philosophical Illusion'' (Le cerveau et la pensée: une illusion philosophique). An illness prevented his visiting Germany to attend the Third Congress held at [[Heidelberg]].\n\nHis third major work, ''Creative Evolution'', the most widely known and most discussed of his books, appeared in 1907. Pierre Imbart de la Tour remarked that ''Creative Evolution'' was a milestone of new direction in thought.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} By 1918, [[Alcan]], the publisher, had issued twenty-one editions, making an average of two editions ''per annum'' for ten years. Following the appearance of this book, Bergson's popularity increased enormously, not only in academic circles, but among the general reading public.\n\nAt that time, Bergson had already made an extensive study of [[biology]], knowing of the theory of [[fecundation]] (as shown by the first chapter of the ''Creative Evolution''), which had only recently emerged, ca. 1885 — no small feat for a philosopher specializing in the [[history of philosophy]], in particular of Greek and Latin philosophy.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He also most certainly had read, apart from Darwin, [[Haeckel]], from whom he retained his idea of a unity of life and of the ecological solidarity between all living beings,<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> as well as [[Hugo de Vries]], from whom he quoted his [[mutation theory]] of evolution (which he opposed, preferring Darwin's gradualism).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He also quoted [[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]], the successor of [[Claude Bernard]] at the Chair of Experimental Medicine in the Collège de France, etc.\n\nBergson served as a juror with [[Florence Meyer Blumenthal]] in awarding the [[Prix Blumenthal]], a grant given between 1919–1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.<ref name=\"FMBlumenthal\">{{Cite web\n  | title = Florence Meyer Blumenthal\n  | publisher = Jewish Women's Archive, Michele Siegel\n  | url = http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/blumenthal-florence-meyer}}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with James and Pragmatism===\nBergson travelled to London in 1908 and met there with [[William James]], the [[Harvard]] philosopher who was Bergson's senior by seventeen years, and who was instrumental in calling the attention of the Anglo-American public to the work of the French professor. The two became great friends. James's impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under date of 4 October 1908:\n<blockquote>\"So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually! I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus, will end by prevailing, and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy.\"</blockquote>\n\nAs early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical ''La Critique philosophique'', of Renouvier and Pillon, entitled ''[[Le Sentiment de l'Effort]]''. Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal ''Mind'': \"What is an Emotion?\" and \"On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology\". Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work, ''Time and Free Will''. In the following years 1890–91 appeared the two volumes of James's monumental work, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson. Some writers, taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking the fact that James's investigations had been proceeding since 1870 (registered from time to time by various articles which culminated in \"The Principles\"), have mistakenly dated Bergson's ideas as earlier than James's.\n\nIt has been suggested{{By whom|date=September 2009}} that Bergson owes the root ideas of his first book to the 1884 article by James, \"On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology,\" which he neither refers to nor quotes. This article deals with the conception of thought as a [[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], which [[intellect]] distorts by framing into concepts. Bergson replied to this insinuation by denying that he had any knowledge of the article by James when he wrote ''Les données immédiates de la conscience''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The two thinkers appear to have developed independently until almost the close of the century. They are further apart in their intellectual position than is frequently supposed. Both have succeeded in appealing to audiences far beyond the purely academic sphere, but only in their mutual rejection of \"intellectualism\" as final is there real unanimity. Although James was slightly ahead in the development and enunciation of his ideas, he confessed that he was baffled by many of Bergson's notions. James certainly neglected many of the deeper metaphysical aspects of Bergson's thought, which did not harmonize with his own, and are even in direct contradiction. In addition to this, Bergson can hardly be considered a pragmatist. For him, \"utility,\" far from being a test of truth, was in fact the reverse: a synonym for error.\n\nNevertheless, William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903, he wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI have been re-reading Bergson's books, and nothing that I have read since years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that that philosophy has a great future, it breaks through old cadres and brings things into a solution from which new crystals can be got.<ref>\n[http://www.ibiblio.org/HTMLTexts/John_Alexander_Gunn/Bergson_And_His_Philosophy/chapter1.html Bergson and his philosophy] Chapter 1: Life of Bergson\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe most noteworthy tributes James paid to Bergson come in the [[Hibbert Lectures]] (A Pluralistic Universe), which James gave at [[Manchester College, Oxford]], shortly after meeting Bergson in London. He remarks on the encouragement he has received from Bergson's thought, and refers to the confidence he has in being \"able to lean on Bergson's authority.\" (Also see James's reservations about Bergson below.)\n\nThe influence of Bergson had led James \"to renounce the intellectualist method and the current notion that [[logic]] is an adequate measure of what can or cannot be\". It had induced him, he continued, \"to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably\" as a method, for he found that \"reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it\".\n\nThese remarks, which appeared in James's book ''A Pluralistic Universe'' in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to an investigation of Bergson's philosophy for themselves, but no English translations of Bergson's  major work had yet appeared. James, however, encouraged and assisted Dr. [[Arthur Mitchell (physician)|Arthur Mitchell]] in his preparation of the English translation of ''Creative Evolution''. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the completion of the translation, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled ''Truth and Reality'' for the French translation of James's book, ''Pragmatism''. In it he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, coupled with certain important reservations.\n\nFrom April 5 to 11, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at [[Bologna]], in Italy, where he gave an address on \"Philosophical Intuition\". In response to invitations he visited England in May of that year, and on several subsequent occasions. These visits were well received.{{By whom|date=September 2009}} His speeches offered new perspectives{{Which|date=November 2009}} and elucidated many passages in his three major works: ''Time and Free Will'', ''Matter and Memory'', and ''Creative Evolution''. Although necessarily brief statements, they developed and enriched the ideas in his books and clarified for English audiences the fundamental principles of his philosophy.\n\n===Lectures on change===\nIn May 1911 Bergson gave two lectures entitled ''The Perception of Change'' (''La perception du changement'') at the [[University of Oxford]].The [[Clarendon Press]] published these in French in the same year.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n|last= Bergson\n|first= Henri\n|title= La perception du changement; conférences faites à l'Université d'Oxford les 26 et 27 mai 1911\n|trans_title= The perception of change: lectures delivered at the University of Oxford on 26 and 27 May 1911\n|year= 1911\n|publisher= Clarendon\n|location= Oxford\n|language= French\n|page= 37}}\n</ref>\nHis talks were concise and lucid, leading students and the general reader to his other longer writings. Oxford later conferred on him the degree of [[Doctor of Science]].\n\nTwo days later he delivered the [[Huxley Lecture]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], taking for his subject ''Life and Consciousness''. This subsequently appeared in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (October, 1911), and since revised, forms the first essay in the collected volume ''Mind-Energy'' (''L'Énergie spirituelle''). In October he again travelled to England, where he had an enthusiastic reception, and delivered at [[University College London]] four lectures on ''La Nature de l'Âme'' [The nature of the soul].\n\nIn 1913 Bergson visited the United States of America at the invitation of [[Columbia University]], New York, and lectured in several American cities, where very large audiences welcomed him. In February, at Columbia University, he lectured both in French and English, taking as his subjects: ''Spirituality and Freedom'' and ''The Method of Philosophy''. Being again in England in May of the same year, he accepted the Presidency of the British [[Society for Psychical Research]], and delivered to the Society an impressive address: ''Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research'' (Fantômes des vivants et recherche psychique).\n\nMeanwhile, his popularity increased, and translations of his works began to appear in a number of languages: English, German, Italian, Danish, Swedish, Hungarian, Polish and Russian. In 1914 Bergson's fellow-countrymen honoured him by his election as a member of the [[Académie française]]. He was also made President of the Académie des Sciences morales et politiques, and in addition he became Officier de la [[Légion d'honneur]], and Officier de l'Instruction publique.\n\nBergson found disciples of many varied types, and in France movements such as [[neo-Catholicism]] or [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]] on the one hand and [[syndicalism]] on the other, endeavoured to absorb and to appropriate for their own immediate use and propaganda some of the central ideas of his teaching.

It was claimed that there is harmony between the flute of personal philosophical meditation and the trumpet of social revolution.\n\nWhile social revolutionaries endeavoured to make the most out of Bergson, many [[leadership|leader]]s of religious thought, particularly the more liberal-minded theologians of all creeds, e.g., the Modernists and Neo-Catholic Party in his own country, showed a keen interest in his writings, and many of them endeavoured to find encouragement and stimulus in his work. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] however took the step of banning Bergson's three books, accused of [[pantheism]] (that is, of conceiving of God as immanent to his Creation and of being himself created in the process of the Creation)<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> by placing them upon the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]] (Decree of 1 June 1914).\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1914 the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous [[Gifford Lectures]], planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn. Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of ''The Problem of Personality'', at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in the spring of that year. The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war. Bergson was not, however, silent during the conflict, and he gave some inspiring addresses. As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article entitled ''Wearing and Nonwearing forces'' (La force qui s'use et celle qui ne s'use pas), which appeared in that unique and interesting periodical of the ''[[poilu]]s'', ''Le Bulletin des Armées de la République Française''. A presidential address, ''The Meaning of the War'', was delivered in December, 1914, to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques.\n\nBergson contributed also to the publication arranged by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in honour of King [[Albert I of Belgium|Albert I of the Belgians]], ''King Albert's Book'' (Christmas, 1914).<ref>\n{{Cite book\n|title= King Albert’s book : a tribute to the Belgian king and people from representative men and women throughout the world\n|year= 1914\n|month=\n|publisher= The Daily Telegraph\n|location= London\n|page= 187\n}}\n</ref>\nIn 1915 he was succeeded in the office of President of the ''Académie des Sciences morales et politiques'' by [[Alexandre Ribot]], and then delivered a discourse on \"The Evolution of German [[Imperialism]]\". Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy. Bergson did a large amount of travelling and lecturing in America during the war. He participated to the negotiations which led to the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry of the United States]] in the war. He was there when the French Mission under [[René Viviani]] paid a visit in April and May 1917, following upon America's entry into the conflict. Viviani's book ''La Mission française en Amérique'' (1917), contains a preface by Bergson.\n\nEarly in 1918 the ''[[Académie française]]'' received Bergson officially when he took his seat among \"The Select Forty\" as successor to [[Emile Ollivier]] (the author of the historical work ''L'Empire libéral''). A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier. In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows us the central idea of his own philosophy in action. To no other philosopher has it fallen, during his lifetime, to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested.\n\nAs many of Bergson's contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he agreed to the request of his friends{{Which|date=November 2009}} to have such works collected and published in two volumes. The first of these was being planned when war broke out. The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919. It bears the title ''Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures'' (reprinted as ''Mind-Energy'' – ''L'Énergie spirituelle: essais et conférences''). The advocate of Bergson's philosophy in England, Dr. [[Wildon Carr]], prepared an English translation under the title ''Mind-Energy''. The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, \"Life and Consciousness\", in a revised and developed form under the title \"Consciousness and Life\". Signs of Bergson's growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested. The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, ''L'Âme et le Corps'', which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul. The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson's famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, ''The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism'' (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as ''Le cerveau et la pensée: une illusion philosophique''. Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort. The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of \"tension\" and \"detension\" as applied to the relation of matter and mind.\n\nIn June 1920, the [[University of Cambridge]] honoured him with the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]]. In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Collège de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there. He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher [[Édouard Le Roy]], who supported a [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] stance on the [[foundations of mathematics]], which was adopted by Bergson.<ref name=TheCreativeEvolution>See Chapter III of [https://archive.org/stream/creativeevolu1st00berguoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Creative Evolution'']</ref>  Le Roy, who also succeeded to Bergson at the ''Académie française'' and was a fervent Catholic, extended to [[Revelation|revealed truth]] his conventionalism, leading him to privilege faith, heart and sentiment to [[dogma]]s, speculative [[theology]] and abstract reasoning. Like Bergson's, his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican.\n\n===Debate with Albert Einstein===\nBergson published ''Duration and Simultaneity: Bergson and the Einsteinian Universe'' (''Durée et simultanéité''), a book on [[physics]], which he followed with a polemical conversation with [[Albert Einstein]] at the French Society of Philosophy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RvFnBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22The+physicist+and+the+Philosopher%22+%22Jimena+Canales%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAGoVChMIm6682qTMyAIVyDI-Ch2Fjgxa#v=onepage&q=%22The%20physicist%20and%20the%20Philosopher%22%20%22Jimena%20Canales%22&f=false ''The Physicist and the Philosopher: Einstein, Bergson and the Debate That Changed Our Understanding of Time''] Princeton, Princeton Press, 2015.</ref>  The latter book has been often considered as one of his worst, many alleging that his knowledge of physics was insufficient, and that the book did not follow up contemporary developments on physics.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>  (But in \"Einstein and the Crisis of Reason,\" a leading French philosopher, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, accused Einstein of failing to grasp Bergson's argument. This argument, Merleau-Ponty claims, which concerns not the physics of special relativity but its philosophical foundations, addresses paradoxes caused by popular interpretations and misconceptions about the theory, including Einstein's own.<ref>Signs, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, trans. Richard C. McCleary, Northwestern Univ. Press, 1964.</ref>) It was not published in the 1951 ''Edition du Centenaire'' in French, which contained all of his other works, and was only published later in a work gathering different essays, titled ''Mélanges''. ''Duration and simultaneity'' took advantage of Bergson's experience at the [[League of Nations]], where he presided starting in 1920 the [[International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation]] (the ancestor of the [[UNESCO]], which included Einstein, [[Marie Curie]], etc.).<ref>[http://www.jimenacanales.org/pdf-files/canales-Einstein,%20Bergson%20and%20the%20Experiment%20that%20Failed.pdf ''Einstein, Bergson and the Experiment that Failed: Intellectual Cooperation at the League of Nations'']</ref>\n\nWhile living with his wife and daughter in a modest house in a quiet street near the Porte d'Auteuil in Paris, Bergson won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1927 for having written ''The Creative Evolution''. Because of serious [[rheumatology|rheumatics ailments]], he could not travel to Stockholm, and sent instead a text subsequently published in ''La Pensée et le mouvant''.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1928.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter his retirement from the Collège, Bergson began to fade into obscurity: he suffered from a degenerative illness (rheumatism, which left him half paralyzed<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>). He completed his new work, ''The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', which extended his philosophical theories to the realms of morality, religion and art, in 1935. It was respectfully received by the public and the philosophical community, but all by that time realized that Bergson's days as a philosophical luminary were past. He was, however, able to reiterate his core beliefs near the end of his life, by renouncing all of the posts and honours previously awarded him, rather than accept exemption from the [[Statute on Jews|antisemitic laws]] imposed by the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government.\n\nBergson inclined to convert to Catholicism, writing in his will on February 8, 1937: ''My thinking has always brought me nearer to Catholicism, in which I saw the perfect complement to Judaism.''<ref>Quoted in: {{Cite book\n|last= Zolli\n|first= Eugenio\n|authorlink= Israel Zolli\n|title= Before the Dawn\n|trans_title=\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bq_Qp53ksMAC&pg=PA81&lr=&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=Bergson&f=false\n|origyear= 1954\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= Ignatius Press\n|isbn= 978-1-58617-287-9\n|page= 89\n|chapterurl= \n}}\n</ref>\nThough wishing to convert to Catholicism, as stated in his will, he did not convert in view of the travails inflicted on the Jewish people by the rise of [[Nazism]] and [[anti-Semitism]] in Europe in the 1930s; he did not want to appear to want to leave the persecuted. On 3 January 1941 Bergson died in occupied Paris from bronchitis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/library/henri-bergson/biography/ |title=Henri Bergson – Philosopher – Biography |work=www.egs.edu |date=1941-01-03 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref>\nA Roman Catholic priest said prayers at his funeral per his request. Bergson is buried in the Cimetière de Garches, [[Hauts-de-Seine]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nBergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality (as expressed in, say, [[finalism]]). He argued that we must allow space for free will to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion. While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality. Seeing Duration as a mobile and fluid concept, Bergson argued that one cannot understand Duration through \"immobile\" analysis, but only through experiential, first-person [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]].\n\n===Creativity===\nBergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation, instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces. His philosophy emphasises pure mobility, unforeseeable novelty, creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a [[process philosophy]]. It touches upon such topics as time and identity, [[free will]], perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the [[foundation of mathematics]] and the limits of reason.<ref>Bergson explores these topics in ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', in ''Matter and Memory'', in ''Creative Evolution'', and in ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics''.\n</ref>\n\nCriticizing [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of knowledge exposed in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and his conception of truth — which he compares to [[Plato]]'s conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion (order of nature/order of thought) — Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics, intelligence and [[intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], and insisted on the necessity of increasing thought's possibility through the use of intuition, which, according to him, alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life, understood as pure [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]. Because of his (relative) criticism of intelligence, he makes a frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of [[concept]]s, which (he considers) fail to touch the whole of reality, being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things. For instance, he says in ''The Creative Evolution'' (chap. III) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking. For swimming to be possible, man must throw itself in water, and only then can thought consider swimming as possible. Intelligence, for Bergson, is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty, a product of evolution used by man to survive. If metaphysics is to avoid \"false problems\", it should not extend to pure speculation the abstract concepts of intelligence, but rather use intuition.<ref>Elie During, ''[http://ciepfc.rhapsodyk.net/article.php3?id_article=63 « Fantômes de problèmes »]'', published by the ''[[Centre International d'Etudes de la Philosophie Française Contemporaine]]'' (short version first published in ''[[Le magazine littéraire]]'', n°386, April 2000 (issue dedicated to Bergson)</ref>\n\n''The Creative Evolution'' in particular attempted to think through the continuous creation of life, and explicitly pitted itself against [[Herbert Spencer]]'s evolutionary philosophy. Spencer had attempted to transpose [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] in philosophy and to construct a [[cosmology]] based on this theory (Spencer also coined the expression \"[[survival of the fittest]]\"). Bergson disputed what he saw as Spencer's mechanistic philosophy.<ref>''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 14</ref>\n\nBergson's ''[[Lebensphilosophie]]'' ([[philosophy of life]]) can be seen as a response to the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic philosophies]] of his time,<ref name=\"Creative_Mind\">Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 11 to 13.</ref>  but also to the failure of [[finalism]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>  Indeed, he considers that finalism is unable to explain \"duration\" and the \"continuous creation of life\", as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program — a notion which remains, for example, in the expression of a \"[[genetics|genetic]] program\";<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>  such a description of finalism was adopted, for instance, by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> It clearly announces [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s.\n\nBergson regarded planning beforehand for the future as impossible, since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities. Indeed, one could always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility. But, in the introduction to the ''Pensée et le mouvant'', he explains that such an event created retrospectively its causes, taking the example of the creation of a work of art, for example a symphony: it was impossible to predict what would be the symphony of the future, as if the musician knew what symphony would be the best for his time, he would realize it. In his words, the effect created its cause. Henceforth, he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism, through the notion of an original impulse, the ''élan vital'', in life, which dispersed itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies (he substituted to the finalist notion of a [[teleological]] aim a notion of an original impulse).\n\n===Duration===\n{{See also|Duration (philosophy)}}\nThe foundation of Henri Bergson’s philosophy, his theory of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], he discovered when trying to improve the inadequacies of [[Herbert Spencer]]’s philosophy.<ref name=\"Creative_Mind\"/> Bergson introduced Duration as a theory of [[time]] and [[consciousness]] in his doctoral thesis ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'' as a response to another of his influences: [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name=\"Stanford_Kant\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], \"Henri Bergson\": \"'Time and Free Will' has to be seen as an attack on Kant, for whom freedom belongs to a realm outside of space and time.\"</ref>\n\nKant believed that free will could only exist outside of time and space, that we could therefore not know whether or not it exists, and that it is nothing but a pragmatic faith.<ref name=\"Stanford_Kant\"/> Bergson responded that Kant, along with many other philosophers, had confused time with its spatial representation.<ref>Henri Bergson, ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', Author's Preface.</ref> In reality, Bergson argued, Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous, and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts, with one causing the other. Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility, which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''], \"Henri Bergson\": \"For Bergson — and perhaps this is his greatest insight — freedom is mobility.\"</ref>\n\n===Intuition===\n{{See also|Intuition (Bergson)}}\nDuration, as defined by Bergson, then is a unity and a multiplicity, but, being mobile, it cannot be grasped through immobile concepts. Bergson hence argues that one can grasp it only through his method of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]]. Two images from Henri Bergson’s ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'' may help one to grasp Bergson's term intuition, the limits of concepts, and the ability of intuition to grasp the absolute. The first image is that of a city. Analysis, or the creation of concepts through the divisions of points of view, can only ever give us a model of the city through a construction of photographs taken from every possible point of view, yet it can never give us the dimensional value of walking in the city itself. One can only grasp this through intuition; likewise the experience of reading a line of [[Homer]]. One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary, but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself. The method of intuition, then, is that of getting back to the things themselves.<ref>Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 160 to 161. For a Whiteheadian use of Bergsonian intuition, see [[Michel Weber]]'s ''[http://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead’s Pancreativism. The Basics]''. Foreword by [[Nicholas Rescher]], Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006.\n</ref>\n\n===''Élan vital''===\n{{See also|Élan vital}}\n\nÉlan vital ranks as Bergson's third essential concept, after Duration and intuition. An idea with the goal of explaining evolution, the Élan vital first appeared in 1907’s ''Creative Evolution''. Bergson portrays Élan vital as a kind of vital impetus which explains evolution in a less mechanical and more lively manner, as well as accounting for the creative impulse of mankind. This concept led several authors to characterize Bergson as a supporter of [[vitalism]]—although he criticized it explicitly in ''The Creative Evolution'', as he thought, against [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch|Driesch]] and [[Johannes Reinke]] (whom he cited) that there is neither \"purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality in nature\":<ref>''L'Évolution créatrice'', pp. 42–44; pp. 226–227</ref>\n<blockquote>Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories (...) It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being. If there is finality in the world of life, it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace.<ref>''L'Évolution créatrice'', pp. 42–43</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Laughter===\nIn ''[[Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic]]'', Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked (see his objection to Delage, published in the 23rd edition of the essay).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> He describes the process of laughter (refusing to give a conceptual definition which would not approach its reality<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>), used in particular by comics and [[clown]]s, as caricature of the mechanistic nature of humans (habits, automatic acts, etc.), one of the two tendencies of life (degradation towards inert matter and mechanism, and continual creation of new forms).<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> However, Bergson warns us that laughter’s criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a person’s [[self-esteem]].<ref>[http://www.timoroso.com/philosophy/writings/sketches/2006-04-09-henri-bergsons-theory-of-laughter Henri Bergson's theory of laughter]. A brief summary.</ref> This essay made his opposition to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] theory of the animal-machine obvious.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/>\n\n==Reception==\nFrom his first publications, Bergson's philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters, although he also became very popular and durably influenced [[French philosophy]].  The mathematician [[Édouard Le Roy]] became Bergson's main disciple. Nonetheless, Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Collège de France, delivering lectures to a general audience, may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought: \"Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context, often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas.  But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought.  Thus Bergson's philosophy—in principle open and nonsystematic—was easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers\".<ref>Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[Alfred North Whitehead]] acknowledged Bergson's influence on his [[process philosophy]] in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]].'' <ref>Cf.

Rogers), [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Roger Fry]] (see his letters), [[Julian Huxley]] (in ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'') and [[Virginia Woolf]] (for the latter, see [[Ann Banfield]], ''The Phantom Table'').{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]] accused Bergson of [[pantheism]], while [[freethought|free-thinkers]]{{Who|date=September 2009}} (who formed a large part of the teachers and professors of the [[French Third Republic]]) accused him of [[spiritualism]]. Still others have characterized his philosophy as a [[emergent materialism|materialist emergentism]] — [[Samuel Alexander]] and [[C. Lloyd Morgan]] explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear.<ref name=Fagot-Largeau/> According to Henri Hude (1990, II, p.&nbsp;142), who supports himself on the whole of Bergson's works as well as his now published courses, accusing him of pantheism is a \"counter-sense\". Hude alleges that a [[mysticism|mystical experience]], roughly outlined at the end of ''Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion'', is the inner principle of his whole philosophy, although this has been contested by other commentators.\n\n[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson. In response to a letter comparing his work with that of Bergson he wrote, “a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions.” [[William James]]’s students resisted the assimilation of his work to that of Bergson. See, for example, [[Horace Kallen]]’s book on the subject ''James and Bergson''. As [[Jean Wahl]] described the “ultimate disagreement” between James and Bergson in his ''System of Metaphysics'': “for James, the consideration of action is necessary for the definition of truth, according to Bergson, action...must be kept from our mind if we want to see the truth”{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}. Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergson’s influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for “the spirit of the age”.\n\nAs early as the 1890s, Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergson’s philosophy, above all his view of the New and the indeterminate:\n<blockquote>\nthe possibility of a new and unaccountable fact appearing at any time,” he writes in his book on [[Hermann Lotze]], “does not practically affect the method of investigation;...the only thing given up is the hope that these hypotheses may ever be adequate to the reality and cover the process of nature without leaving a remainder. This is no great renunciation; for that consummation of science...is by no one really expected.\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Santayana and Russell, Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method, claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom. Russell takes particular exception to Bergson’s understanding of number in chapter two of ''Time and Free-will''. According to Russell, Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor (“extended images”) to describe the nature of mathematics as well as [[logic]] in general. “Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number possible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms, and this again with number in general”, writes Russell (see ''The Philosophy of Bergson''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and ''A History of Western Philosophy''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}).\n\nFurthermore, writers such as Russell, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and James saw ''élan vital'' as a projection of subjectivity onto the world. The external world, according to certain{{Which|date=November 2009}} theories of [[probability]], provides less and less indeterminism with further refinement of scientific method. In brief, one should not confuse the moral, psychological, subjective demand for the new, the underivable and the unexplained with the universe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} One's subjective sense of duration differs the (non-human) world, a difference which, according to the ancient materialist [[Lucretius]] should not be characterized as either one of becoming or being, creation or destruction (''[[De Rerum Natura]]'').\n\n[[Suzanne Guerlac]] has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower [[Deleuze]] within [[continental philosophy]]: \"If there is a return to Bergson today, then, it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson.  This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuze's own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor, even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned.\"<ref>Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p. 175.</ref> [[Leonard Lawlor]] and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that \"the recent revitalization of Bergsonism [...] is almost entirely due to Deleuze.\"  They explain that Bergson's concept of multiplicity \"is at the very heart of Deleuze's thought, and [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]] is the model for all of Deleuze's 'becomings.'  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson's criticism of the concept of negation in Creative Evolution. [...] Thus Bergson became a resource in the criticism of the [[Hegel]]ian [[Dialectic#Hegelian dialectic|dialectic]], the negative.\"<ref name=LawlorMoulard2011>{{citation |author=Leonard Lawlor and Valentine Moulard |chapter=The revitalization of Bergsonism |title=Henri Bergson |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date= May 18, 2004; revised Jul 12, 2011 |chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/#7 |accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bergson, H.; ''[[Time and Free Will|Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness]]'' (''Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience'', 1889).
