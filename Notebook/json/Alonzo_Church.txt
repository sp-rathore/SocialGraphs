He is best known for the [[lambda calculus]], [[Church–Turing thesis]], proving the undecidability of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]], [[Frege–Church ontology]], and the [[Church–Rosser theorem]].\n\n==Life==\nAlonzo Church was born on June 14, 1903, in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his father, Samuel Robbins Church, was the judge of the Municipal Court for the District of Columbia. The family later moved to Virginia after his father lost this position because of failing eyesight. With help from his uncle, also named Alonzo Church, he was able to attend the Ridgefield School for Boys in [[Ridgefield, Connecticut]].<ref>The Ridgefield School for Boys, also known as the Ridgefield School, was a private school that existed from 1907 to 1938. See [http://jackfsanders.tripod.com/rschool2.htm The Ridgefield School].</ref> After graduating from Ridgefield in 1920, Church attended [[Princeton University]] where he was an exceptional student, publishing his first paper, on [[Lorentz transformation]]s, and graduating in 1924 with a degree in mathematics. He stayed at Princeton, earning a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics in three years under [[Oswald Veblen]].\n\nHe married Mary Julia Kuczinski in 1925 and the couple had three children, Alonzo Church, Jr. (1929), Mary Ann (1933) and Mildred (1938).\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D. he taught briefly as an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]] and then received a two-year [[United States National Research Council|National Research Fellowship]]. This allowed him to attend [[Harvard University]] in 1927–1928 and then both [[University of Göttingen]] and [[University of Amsterdam]] the following year. He taught philosophy and mathematics at Princeton, 1929–1967, and at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], 1967–1990. He was a Plenary Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1962 in Stockholm.<ref>Church, Alonzo.

This is known as [[Church's theorem]].\n*His proof that [[Peano arithmetic]] is undecidable.  \n*His articulation of what has come to be known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].\n*He was the founding editor of the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'', editing its reviews section until 1979.\n*His creation of the [[lambda calculus]].\n\nThe lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem.  This result preceded [[Alan Turing]]'s work on the [[halting problem]], which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means. Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the [[Turing machine]] used in Turing's halting problem were equivalent in capabilities, and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative \"mechanical processes for computation.\" This resulted in the Church–Turing thesis.\n\nThe lambda calculus influenced the design of the [[LISP programming language]] and [[functional programming]] languages in general. The [[Church encoding]] is named in his honor.\n\n==Students==\nMany of Church's doctoral students have led distinguished careers, including [[C. Anthony Anderson]], [[Peter B. Andrews (mathematician)|Peter B. Andrews]], [[George Alfred Barnard|George A. Barnard]], [[David Berlinski]], [[William Boone (mathematician)|William W. Boone]], [[Martin Davis]], [[Alfred L.
