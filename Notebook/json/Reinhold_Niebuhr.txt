It is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. The family spoke German at home. His brother [[H. Richard Niebuhr]] also became a famous theological ethicist, and his sister Hulda Niebuhr became a divinity professor in Chicago. The Niebuhr family moved to [[Lincoln, Illinois]], in 1902 when Gustav Niebuhr became pastor of Lincoln's St. John's [[German Evangelical Synod]] church. Reinhold Niebuhr first served as pastor of a church when he served from April to September 1913 as interim minister of St. John's following his father's death.<ref name=\"Reinhold Niebuhr A Biography\">{{cite book|last=Fox|first=Richard|title=Reinhold Niebuhr|year=1985|publisher=Harper & Row|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-06-250343-X |pages=5–24}}</ref>\n\nNiebuhr attended [[Elmhurst College]] in [[Illinois]] and graduated in 1910.<ref>Elmhurst College has erected a statue in his honor.</ref> He studied at [[Eden Theological Seminary]] in [[Webster Groves, Missouri]], where, as he admitted, he was deeply influenced by Dr. Samuel D.

He always regretted not taking a doctorate. He said that Yale gave him intellectual liberation from the localism of his German-American upbringing.<ref>{{cite book |author=Richard Fox |title=Reinhold Niebuhr: A Biography |year=1985}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1931 Niebuhr married [[Ursula Keppel-Compton]]. She was a member of the Church of England and was educated at Oxford University in theology and history. She met Niebuhr while studying for her master's degree at Union Theological Seminary. For many years, she was on faculty at [[Barnard College]] (the women's college of [[Columbia University]]) where she helped establish and then chaired the religious studies department. The Niebuhrs had two children, Christopher Niebuhr and Elisabeth Sifton Niebuhr. Ursula Niebuhr left evidence in her professional papers at the Library of Congress showing that she co-authored some of her husband's later writings.<ref>Rebekah Miles, \"Uncredited: Was Ursula Niebuhr Reinhold's Coauthor?\" ''The Christian Century'', January 25.</ref>\n\n==Detroit==\nIn 1915, Niebuhr was ordained a pastor. The German Evangelical mission board sent him to serve at Bethel Evangelical Church in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The congregation numbered sixty-six on his arrival and grew to nearly 700 by the time he left in 1928. The increase reflected his ability to reach people outside the [[German American]] community and among the growing population attracted to jobs in the booming automobile industry. In the early 1900s Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the country, attracting many black and white migrants from the rural South, as well as Jewish and Catholic ethnics from eastern and southern Europe. They competed for jobs and limited housing, and the city's rapid changes and rise in social tensions contributed to the growth in numbers of [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the city, which reached its peak in 1925, and to the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]]. During that year's city election campaign, in which the Klan publicly supported several candidates, including for the office of mayor, Niebuhr spoke out publicly against the Klan to his congregation,<ref>{{cite book |author=Kenneth T. Jackson |title=The Ku Klux Klan in the City, 1915–1930 |origyear=1967 |year=1992 |page=142}}</ref> describing them as \"one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride of a people has ever developed\". Only one of their several candidates gained a seat on the city council, and [[Charles Bowles]], the mayoral candidate, was defeated.{{sfn|Jackson|1967/1992|p=142}}\n\n===World War I===\nAs America entered the World War in 1917, Niebuhr was the unknown pastor of a small German-speaking congregation in Detroit (it stopped using German in 1919). All [[German American]] culture in the United States and nearby Canada came under attack for suspicion of having dual loyalties. Niebuhr repeatedly stressed the need to be loyal to America, and won an audience in national magazines for his appeals to the German Americans to be patriotic.<ref>Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 3</ref> Theologically, he went beyond the issue of national loyalty as he endeavored to fashion a realistic ethical perspective of patriotism and pacifism. He endeavored to work out a realistic approach to the moral danger posed by aggressive powers, which many idealists and pacifists failed to recognize. During the war, he also served his denomination as Executive Secretary of the War Welfare Commission, while maintaining his pastorate in Detroit. A pacifist at heart, he saw compromise as a necessity and was willing to support war in order to find peace—compromising for the sake of righteousness.<ref>William G. Chrystal, \"Reinhold Niebuhr and the First World War\", ''Journal of Presbyterian History'' 1977 55(3): 285–298. 0022-3883</ref>\n\n===Origins of Niebuhr's working class and labor class sympathy===\nSeveral attempts have been made to explicate the origins of Niebuhr's sympathies from the 1920s to working class and labor class issues as documented by his biographer Richard W. Fox.<ref name=\"Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4\">Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 4</ref> One supportive example has concerned his interest in the plight of auto workers in Detroit. This one interest among others can be briefly summarized below.\n \nAfter seminary, Niebuhr preached the [[Social Gospel]], and then initiated the engagement of what he considered the insecurity of Ford workers.<ref>See Reinhold Niebuhr, \"Detroit\" (radio interview [http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/niebuhr-rediscovered/b8.shtml online]).</ref> Niebuhr had moved to the left and was troubled by the demoralizing effects of industrialism on workers. He became an outspoken critic of [[Henry Ford]] and allowed union organizers to use his pulpit to expound their message of workers' rights. Niebuhr attacked poor conditions created by the assembly lines and erratic employment practices.<ref name=\"Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4-5\">Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' ch 4–5</ref>\n\nBecause of his opinion about factory work, Niebuhr rejected liberal optimism. He wrote in his diary:\n<blockquote>We went through one of the big automobile factories to-day.... The foundry interested me particularly. The heat was terrific. The men seemed weary. Here manual labour is a drudgery and toil is slavery. The men cannot possibly find any satisfaction in their work. They simply work to make a living. Their sweat and their dull pain are part of the price paid for the fine cars we all run. And most of us run the cars without knowing what price is being paid for them.... We are all responsible. We all want the things which the factory produces and none of us is sensitive enough to care how much in human values the efficiency of the modern factory costs.<ref>Niebuhr, ''Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic'' pp. 79–80)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe historian Ronald H. Stone thinks that Niebuhr never talked to the assembly line workers (many of his parishioners were skilled craftsmen) but projected feelings onto them after discussions with Rev. Samuel Marquis.<ref>Ronald H. Stone, ''Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century'' (1992) pp 29–32</ref> Niebuhr's criticism of Ford and capitalism resonated with progressives and helped make him nationally prominent.<ref name=\"Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr ch 4-5\"/> His serious commitment to [[Marxism]] developed after he moved to New York in 1928.<ref>Stone, ''Professor Reinhold Niebuhr'' p. 32</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Niebuhr visited Europe to meet with intellectuals and theologians. The conditions he saw in Germany under the French [[occupation of the Rhineland]] dismayed him. They reinforced the [[pacifism|pacifist]] views that he had adopted throughout the 1920s after [[World War I]].\n\n==1930s: Growing influence in New York==\nNiebuhr captured his personal experiences in Detroit in his book ''Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic''. He continued to write and publish throughout his career, and also served as editor of the magazine ''Christianity and Crisis'' from 1941 through 1966.\n\nIn 1928, Niebuhr left Detroit to become Professor of Practical Theology at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in New York. He spent the rest of his career there, until retirement in 1960. While teaching theology at Union Theological Seminary, Niebuhr influenced many generations of students and thinkers, including the German minister [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] of the anti-[[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Confessing Church]].\n\nThe Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by Niebuhr and others with similar views.\nLater it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.\nThe main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included [[Eduard Heimann]], [[Sherwood Eddy]], [[Paul Tillich]] and [[Rose Terlin]]. \nIn its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.\nAlthough not Communist, the group acknowledged [[Karl Marx]]'s social philosophy.<ref>{{citation|page=115 |last=Stone|first=Ronald H.|title=Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypy5Uz4qm5YC&pg=PA115|accessdate=2016-03-14 |date=1992-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25390-5}}</ref>\nNiebuhr was among the group of 51 prominent Americans who formed the International Relief Association (IRA) that is today known as the [[International Rescue Committee]] (IRC).<ref>Some others included philosopher [[John Dewey]] and writer [[John Dos Passos]].</ref> The committee mission was to assist Germans suffering from the policies of the Hitler regime.<ref>{{cite news |title=New German Relief Unit: American Branch Formed to Aid Work Headed by Einstein |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 24, 1933 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A00E7DD163DE333A25757C2A9619C946294D6CF |page=11 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Niebuhr and Dewey===\nIn the 1930s Niebuhr was often seen as an intellectual opponent of [[John Dewey]]. Both men were professional polemicists and their ideas often clashed, although they contributed to the same realms of liberal intellectual schools of thought. Niebuhr was a strong proponent of the \"Jerusalem\" religious tradition as a corrective to the secular \"Athens\" tradition insisted upon by Dewey.<ref>Rice ''Reinhold Niebuhr and John Dewey: An American Odyssey'', (1993), page 146</ref> In the book ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'' (1932), Niebuhr strongly criticized Dewey's philosophy, although his own ideas were still intellectually inchoate.<ref name=\"Rice, pages 43-58\">Rice, ''Reinhold Niebuhr and John Dewey'' pages 43–58</ref> Two years later, in a review of Dewey's book ''A Common Faith'' (1934), Niebuhr was calm and respectful towards Dewey's \"religious footnote\" on his then large body of educational and pragmatic philosophy.<ref name=\"Rice, pages 43-58\"/>\n\n==Neo-orthodox theology==\nIn 1939 Niebuhr explained his theological odyssey:<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Niebuhr |first=Reinhold | title = Ten Years That Shook My World | journal = The Christian Century | date = April 26, 1939}} in {{Cite book | title = Sources of the American Mind | volume = II |editor-first=Loren | editor-last = Baritz | year = 1960 | pages = 542–46}}</ref>\n{{cquote |... About midway in my ministry which extends roughly from the peace of Versailles [1919] to the peace of Munich [1938], measured in terms of Western history, I underwent a fairly complete conversion of thought which involved rejection of almost all the liberal theological ideals and ideas with which I ventured forth in 1915. I wrote a book [''Does Civilization need Religion?''], my first, in 1927 which ... contains almost all the theological windmills against which today I tilt my sword. These windmills must have tumbled shortly thereafter for every succeeding volume expresses a more and more explicit revolt against what is usually known as liberal culture.}}\n\nIn the 1930s Niebuhr worked out many of his ideas about sin and grace, love and justice, faith and reason, realism and idealism, and the irony and tragedy of history, which established his leadership of the [[Neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] movement in theology. Influenced strongly by [[Karl Barth]] and other dialectical theologians of Europe, he began to emphasize the Bible as a human record of divine self-revelation; it offered for Niebuhr a critical but redemptive reorientation of the understanding of humanity's nature and destiny.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Fox | title = Reinhold Niebuhr | chapter = 7–8}}</ref>\n\nNiebuhr couched his ideas in Christ-centered principles such as the [[Great Commandment]] and the doctrine of original sin. His major contribution was his view of sin as a social event—as pride—with selfish self-centeredness as the root of evil. The sin of pride was apparent not just in criminals, but more dangerously in people who felt good about their deeds—rather like Henry Ford (whom he did not mention by name). The human tendency to corrupt the good was the great insight he saw manifested in governments, business, democracies, utopian societies, and churches. This position is laid out profoundly in one of his most influential books, ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' (1932). He was a debunker of hypocrisy and pretense and made the avoidance of self-righteous illusions the center of his thoughts.<ref name=\"Hussain\"/><ref name=\"Dorrien\" />\n\nNiebuhr argued that to approach religion as the individualistic attempt to fulfill biblical commandments in a moralistic sense is not only an impossibility but also a demonstration of man's original sin, which Niebuhr interpreted as self-love. Through self-love man becomes focused on his own goodness and leaps to the false conclusion—one he called the \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] illusion\"—that he can achieve goodness on his own. Thus man mistakes his partial ability to transcend himself for the ability to prove his absolute authority over his own life and world. Constantly frustrated by natural limitations, man develops a lust for power which destroys him and his whole world. History is the record of these crises and judgments which man brings on himself; it is also proof that God does not allow man to overstep his possibilities. In radical contrast to the Promethean illusion, God reveals himself in history, especially personified in Jesus Christ, as sacrificial love which overcomes the human temptation to self-deification and makes possible constructive human history.<ref name=\"Hussain\">Khurram Hussain, \"Tragedy and History in Reinhold Niebuhr's Thought\", ''American Journal of Theology and Philosophy'', Volume 31, Number 2, May 2010, pp. 147–159 {{doi|10.1353/ajt.0.0017}}</ref><ref name=\"Dorrien\">Gary Dorrien, ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity 1900–1950'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{Quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=#ACE1AF |align=right |quote=The whole art of politics consists in directing rationally the irrationalities of men.|salign=right |source=—Reinhold Niebuhr<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|last=Whitman|first=Alden|title=Reinhold Niebuhr Is Dead; Protestant Theologian, 78|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/niebuhr.pdf|accessdate=August 20, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 2, 1971}}</ref> }}\n\n===Domestic===\nDuring the 1930s, Niebuhr was a prominent leader of the militant faction of the [[Socialist Party of America]], although he disliked die-hard Marxists.

Niebuhr began to distance himself from the pacifism of his more liberal colleagues and became a staunch advocate for the war. Niebuhr soon left the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]], a peace-oriented group of theologians and ministers, and became one of their harshest critics.\n\nThis departure from his peers evolved into a movement known as [[Christian Realism]]. Niebuhr is widely considered to have been its primary advocate.<ref>Donald Meyer, ''The Protestant Search for Political Realism, 1919–1941''(1988), ch 13</ref> Niebuhr supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during World War II and argued for the engagement of the United States in the war. As a writer popular in both the secular and the religious arena and a professor at the Union Theological Seminary, he was very influential both in the United States and abroad. While many clergy proclaimed themselves pacifists because of their World War&nbsp;I experiences, Niebuhr declared that a victory by Germany and Japan would threaten Christianity. He renounced his socialist connections and beliefs and resigned from the pacifist Fellowship of Reconciliation. He based his arguments on the Protestant beliefs that sin is part of the world, that justice must take precedence over love, and that pacifism is a symbolic portrayal of absolute love but cannot prevent sin. Although his opponents did not portray him favorably, Niebuhr's exchanges with them on the issue helped him mature intellectually.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Doenecke | first1 = Justus D. | authorlink = Justus Drew Doenecke| year = 1995 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr and his Critics: The Interventionist Controversy in World War II | url = | journal = Anglican and Episcopal History | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 459–481 }}</ref>\n\nNiebuhr debated [[Charles Clayton Morrison]], editor of ''[[The Christian Century]]'' magazine, about America's entry into World War II. Morrison and his pacifistic followers maintained that America's role should be strictly neutral and part of a negotiated peace only, while Niebuhr claimed himself to be a realist, who opposed the use of political power to attain moral ends. Morrison and his followers strongly supported the movement to outlaw war that began after [[World War I]] and the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The pact was severely challenged by the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931. With his publication of ''Moral Man and Immoral Society'' (1932), Niebuhr broke ranks with ''The Christian Century'' and supported interventionism and power politics. He supported the reelection of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] [[United States presidential election, 1940|in 1940]] and published his own magazine, ''Christianity and Crisis''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bullert | first1 = Gary B. | year = 2002 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr and the Christian Century: World War&nbsp;II and the Eclipse of the Social Gospel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Church and State]] | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 271–290 | doi=10.1093/jcs/44.2.271}}</ref> In 1945, however, Niebuhr charged that use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was \"morally indefensible\".\n\n[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]]<ref name=\"Arthur\" /> explained Niebuhr's influence:\n<blockquote>Traditionally, the idea of the frailty of man led to the demand for obedience to ordained authority. But Niebuhr rejected that ancient conservative argument. Ordained authority, he showed, is all the more subject to the temptations of self-interest, self-deception and self-righteousness. Power must be balanced by power. He persuaded me and many of my contemporaries that original sin provides a far stronger foundation for freedom and self-government than illusions about human perfectibility. Niebuhr's analysis was grounded in the Christianity of Augustine and Calvin, but he had, nonetheless, a special affinity with secular circles. His warnings against utopianism, messianism and perfectionism strike a chord today.... We cannot play the role of God to history, and we must strive as best we can to attain decency, clarity and proximate justice in an ambiguous world.<ref name=\"Arthur\"/></blockquote>\n\nNiebuhr's defense of Roosevelt made him popular among liberals, as the historian [[Morton White]] noted:\n<blockquote>The contemporary liberal's fascination with Niebuhr, I suggest, comes less from Niebuhr's dark theory of human nature and more from his actual political pronouncements, from the fact that he is a shrewd, courageous, and right-minded man on many political questions. Those who applaud his politics are too liable to turn then to his theory of human nature and praise it as the philosophical instrument of Niebuhr's political agreement with themselves. But very few of those whom I have called \"atheists for Niebuhr\" follow this inverted logic to its conclusion: they don't move from praise of Niebuhr's theory of human nature to praise of its theological ground. We may admire them for drawing the line somewhere, but certainly not for their consistency.<ref>[[Morton White]], ''Religion, Politics, and the Higher Learning'', (1959) pp. 117–118</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]] signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] with [[Adolf Hitler]] in August 1939, Niebuhr severed his past ties with any [[fellow-traveler]] organization having any known Communist leanings. In 1947, Niebuhr helped found the liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA). His ideas influenced [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] and other realists during the [[Cold War]] on the need to [[contain Communist expansion]].\n\nIn his last cover story for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (March 1948), [[Whittaker Chambers]] said of Niebuhr:\n\n<blockquote>Most U.S. liberals think of Niebuhr as a solid socialist who has some obscure connection with Union Theological Seminary that does not interfere with his political work. Unlike most clergymen in politics, Dr. Niebuhr is a pragmatist. Says James Loeb, secretary of Americans for Democratic Action: \"Most so-called liberals are idealists. They let their hearts run away with their heads. Niebuhr never does. For example, he has always been the leading liberal opponent of pacifism. In that period before we got into the war when pacifism was popular, he held out against it steadfastly. He is also an opponent of Marxism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853293,00.html|work=Time|title=Religion: Faith for a Lenten Age|date=March 8, 1948}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the 1950s, Niebuhr described Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] as a force of evil, not so much for attacking civil liberties, as for being ineffective in rooting out Communists and their sympathizers.<ref name=\"Fox, 1985 p 252\">Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr'' (1985) p. 252</ref> In 1953, he supported the execution of the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]], saying, \"Traitors are never ordinary criminals and the Rosenbergs are quite obviously fiercely loyal Communists... Stealing atomic secrets is an unprecedented crime.\"<ref name=\"Fox, 1985 p 252\"/>\n\n==Views on race, ethnicity and other religious affiliations==\nHis views developed during his pastoral tenure in Detroit, which had become a place of immigration, migration, competition and development as a major industrial city. During the 1920s, Niebuhr spoke out against the rise of the Ku Klux Klan in Detroit, which had recruited many members threatened by the rapid social changes. The Klan proposed positions that were anti-black, anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic. Niebuhr's preaching against the Klan, especially in relation to the 1925 mayoral election, gained him national attention.<ref>Jackson (1992), ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City''</ref>\n\nNiebuhr's thoughts on racial justice developed slowly after he abandoned socialism. Niebuhr attributed the injustices of society to human pride and self-love and believed that this innate propensity for evil could not be controlled by humanity. But, he believed that a representative democracy could improve society's ills. Like [[Edmund Burke]], Niebuhr endorsed natural evolution over imposed change and emphasized experience over theory. Niebuhr's Burkean ideology, however, often conflicted with his liberal principles, particularly regarding his perspective on racial justice. Though vehemently opposed to racial inequality, Niebuhr adopted a conservative position on [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]].<ref name=\"Robinson\"/>\n\nWhile after World War&nbsp;II most liberals endorsed integration, Niebuhr focused on achieving equal opportunity. He warned against imposing changes that could result in violence. The violence that followed peaceful demonstrations in the 1960s forced Niebuhr to reverse his position against imposed equality; witnessing the problems of the Northern [[ghettos]] later caused him to doubt that equality was attainable.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Greg | year = 2000 | title = Reinhold Niebuhr: The Racial Liberal as Burkean | url = | journal = Prospects | volume = 25 | issue = 641–661| pages = 0361–2333 }}</ref>\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Anti-Catholicism]] surged in Detroit in the 1920s in reaction to the rise in the number of Catholic immigrants from southern Europe since the early 20th century. It was exacerbated by the revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], which recruited many members in Detroit. Niebuhr defended pluralism by attacking the Klan. During the Detroit mayoral election of 1925, Niebuhr's sermon, \"We fair-minded [[Protestants]] cannot deny\", was published on the front pages of both the ''Detroit Times'' and the ''Free Press''.\n\nThis sermon urged people to vote against mayoral candidate [[Charles Bowles]], who was being openly endorsed by the Klan. The Catholic incumbent, [[John W. Smith (Detroit mayor)|John W. Smith]], won by a narrow 30,000 votes. Niebuhr preached against the Klan and helped to influence its decline in political power in Detroit.<ref>Kenneth T. Jackson, ''The Ku Klux Klan in the City'', 1915–1930'' (1992), pp. 129, 134</ref> Niebuhr preached:\n{{cquote|that it was Protestantism that gave birth to the Ku Klux Klan, one of the worst specific social phenomena which the religious pride and prejudice of peoples has ever developed.... I do not deny that all religions are periodically corrupted by bigotry. But I hit Protestant bigotry the hardest at this time because it happens to be our sin and there is no use repenting for other people's sins. Let us repent of our own.... We are admonished in Scripture to judge men by their fruits, not by their roots; and their fruits are their character, their deeds and accomplishments.<ref>Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr\" (1985) p. 91</ref> }}\n\n===Martin Luther King, Jr.===\nIn the \"[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]\" [[Martin Luther King]] wrote, \"Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\" King valued Niebuhr's social and ethical ideals. King attributed his own [[nonviolent]] posture more to the influence of Niebuhr and [[Paul Tillich]] than to the example of [[Gandhi]].<ref>[http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/niebuhr-rediscovered/d72.shtml April 13, 1970 Letter to Niebuhr]</ref> King invited Niebuhr to participate in the third [[Selma to Montgomery March]] in 1965, and Niebuhr responded by telegram: \"Only a severe stroke prevents me from accepting ... I hope there will be a massive demonstration of all the citizens with conscience in favor of the elemental human rights of voting and freedom of assembly\" (Niebuhr, March 19, 1965). Two years later, Niebuhr defended King's decision to speak out against the [[Vietnam War]], calling him \"one of the greatest religious leaders of our time\". Niebuhr asserted: \"Dr. King has the right and a duty, as both a religious and a civil rights leader, to express his concern in these days about such a major human problem as the Vietnam War.\"<ref>Ansbro, 261</ref> Of his country's intervention in Vietnam, Niebuhr admitted: \"For the first time I fear I am ashamed of our beloved nation.\"<ref>Fox, 285</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\nAs a young pastor in Detroit, he favored conversion of Jews to Christianity, scolding evangelical Christians who were [[anti-Semitic]] or ignoring them. He spoke out against \"the unchristlike attitude of Christians\" and what he described as his fellow Christians' \"Jewish bigotry\".<ref name=\"Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr 1985\">Fox, ''Reinhold Niebuhr\" (1985)</ref> His 1933 article in the ''[[Christian Century]]'' was an attempt to sound the alarm within the Christian community over Hitler's \"cultural annihilation of the Jews\".<ref name=\"Fox, Reinhold Niebuhr 1985\"/> Eventually his theology evolved to the point where he was the first prominent Christian theologian to argue it was inappropriate for Christians to seek to convert Jews to their faith.<ref>He wrote several articles regarding the pre- and post-World War II plight of European Jews: \"Jews After the War\" (in 2 parts ''Nation'' February 21 and February 28, 1942, pages 214–216 and 253–255), \"It Might Have Been\" (''Evangelical Herald'' March 29, 1923, page 202), \"The Rapprochement Between Jews and Christians\" (''Christian Century'' January 7, 1926, pages 9–11), \"Germany Must Be Told\" (''Christian Century'' August 9, 1933, pages 1014–1015, follow-up ''Letter to the Editor'' in to this article same journal May 27, 1936, p. 771).</ref>\n\nAs a preacher, writer, leader, and adviser to political figures, Niebuhr supported [[Zionism]] and the development of [[Israel]]. His solution to anti-Semitism was a combination of a Jewish homeland, greater tolerance, and assimilation in other countries. As early as 1942, he advocated the expulsion of Arabs from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and their resettlement in other Arab countries. His position may have related to his religious conviction that life on earth is imperfect, and his concern about German anti-Semitism.<ref>Eyal Naveh, \"Unconventional 'Christian Zionist': The Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and his Attitude toward the Jewish National Movement\". ''Studies in Zionism'' 1990 11(2): 183–196; 1991 12(1): 85–88.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1952, Niebuhr published ''The Irony of American History'', in which he interpreted the meaning of the United States' past. Niebuhr questioned whether a humane, \"ironical\" interpretation of American history was credible on its own merits, or only in the context of a Christian view of history. Niebuhr's concept of irony referred to situations in which \"the consequences of an act are diametrically opposed to the original intention\", and \"the fundamental cause of the disparity lies in the actor himself, and his original purpose.\" His reading of American history based on this notion, though from the Christian perspective, is so rooted in historical events that readers who do not share his religious views can be led to the same conclusion. Niebuhr's great foe was idealism. American idealism, he believed, comes in two forms: the idealism of the antiwar non-interventionists, who are embarrassed by power; and the idealism of pro-war imperialists, who disguise power as virtue. He said the non-interventionists, without mentioning [[Harry Emerson Fosdick]] by name, seek to preserve the purity of their souls, either by denouncing military actions or by demanding that every action taken be unequivocally virtuous. They exaggerate the sins committed by their own country, excuse the malevolence of its enemies and, as later polemicists have put it, inevitably blame America first. Niebuhr argued this approach was a pious way to refuse to face real problems.<ref>Martin E.

That influence began to wane and then drop toward the end of his life.\n\nThe historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], in the late twentieth century described the legacy of Niebuhr as being contested between American liberals and conservatives, both of whom wanted to claim him.<ref>Matthew Berke, [http://www.firstthings.com/article.php3?id_article=6188 \"The Disputed Legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr\"], ''First Things'' (November 1992).</ref> Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], gave credit to Niebuhr's influence.

Both major-party candidates in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] cited Niebuhr as an influence: Senator [[John McCain]], in his book ''[[Hard Call]]'', \"celebrated Niebuhr as a paragon of clarity about the costs of a good war\".<ref>Elie, Paul. \"A Man for All Reasons\", ''[[The Atlantic]]'', November 2007.</ref> President [[Barack Obama]] said that Niebuhr was his \"favorite philosopher\"<ref>Paul Allen, [http://www.thestar.com/News/USElection/article/443383 \"The Obama Niebuhr connection\"], ''The Toronto Star'' (June 14, 2008).</ref> and \"favorite theologian\".<ref>[http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1268/reinhold-neihbuhr-obama-favorite-theologian \"Obama's Favorite Theologian?
