He made contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]] and [[philosophy of science|science]], and the [[philosophy of art]], also publishing studies of the work of philosophers such as [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]]. His translation (with [[Peter Geach]]) of Frege's published philosophical writing is a classic text.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Baku]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Azerbaijan]]) of [[Jewish]] descent,<ref>''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', 2nd ed.</ref> Black grew up in [[London]], where his family had moved in 1912. He studied mathematics at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] where he developed an interest in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[G. E. Moore]], and [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] were all at Cambridge at that time, and their influence on Black may have been considerable. He graduated in 1930 and was awarded a fellowship to study at [[Göttingen]] for a year.\n\nFrom 1931–36, he was mathematics master at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle]].\n\nHis first book was ''The Nature of Mathematics'' (1933), an exposition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' and of current developments in the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nBlack had made notable contributions to the metaphysics of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]]. In his \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\", Black presents an objection to [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz' Law]] by means of a hypothetical scenario in which he conceives two distinct spheres having exactly the same properties, thereby contradicting Leibniz' second principle in his formulation of \"The Identity of Indiscernibles\". By virtue of there being two objects, albeit with identical properties, the existence of two objects, even in a void, denies their identicality.\n\nHe lectured in mathematics at the [[Institute of Education]] in London from 1936 to 1940. In 1940 he moved to the [[United States]] and joined the Philosophy Department at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1946 he accepted a professorship in philosophy at [[Cornell University]]. In 1948, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. Black advised the philosophy dissertation of American novelist [[William H. Gass]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}</ref> Black died in [[Ithaca, New York]] age 79.
