Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike Linear Logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to [[linear logic]] by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic.  This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nJaparidze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to [[intuitionistic logic]],<ref>G.Japaridze, “[http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-9374-6_11 In the beginning was game semantics]”.
