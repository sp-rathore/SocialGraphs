In particular, this argument is based on the point that [[Zermelo]] and [[von Neumann]] give distinct, and completely adequate, identifications of natural numbers with sets.\n\nIn \"Mathematical Truth\", he argues that no interpretation of mathematics offers a satisfactory package of epistemology and semantics; it is possible to explain mathematical truth in a way that is consistent with our syntactico-semantical treatment of truth in non-mathematical language, and it is possible to explain our knowledge of mathematics in terms consistent with a causal account of epistemology, but it is in general not possible to accomplish both of these objectives simultaneously. He argues for this on the grounds that an adequate account of truth in mathematics implies the existence of abstract mathematical objects, but that such objects are epistemologically inaccessible because they are causally inert and beyond the reach of sense perception. On the other hand, an adequate epistemology of mathematics, say one that ties truth-conditions to proof in some way, precludes understanding how and why the truth-conditions have any bearing on truth.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== Works ===\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1960) ''Logicism, Some Considerations'', Princeton, Ph.D. Dissertation, University Microfilms.\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1965) ''What Numbers Could Not Be'', The Philosophical Review, 74:47-73.\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1967) [http://www.univ.trieste.it/~etica/2003_1/3_monographica.htm ''God, the Devil, and Gödel''], The Monist, 5l: 9-33.\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1973) ''Mathematical Truth'', The Journal of Philosophy, 70: 661-679.\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1981) ''Frege: The Last Logicist'', The Foundations of Analytic Philosophy, Midwest Studies in Philosophy, 6: l7-35.\n*Benacerraf, Paul (1985) ''Skolem and the Skeptic'', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volume 56: 85-ll5.\n*Benacerraf, Paul and Putnam, Hilary (eds.)
