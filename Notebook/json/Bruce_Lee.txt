Lee's given name '''Jun-fan''' was originally written in Chinese as 震藩, however, the ''Jun'' (震) [[Chinese character]] was identical to part of his grandfather's name, Lee Jun-biu (李震彪). Hence, the Chinese character for ''Jun'' in Lee's name was changed to the [[homonym]] 振 instead, to avoid [[naming taboo]] in Chinese tradition.\n\n===Family===\nLee's father, [[Lee Hoi-chuen]], was one of the leading [[Cantonese opera]] and film actors at the time, and was embarking on a year-long opera tour with his family on the eve of the [[Battle of Hong Kong|Japanese invasion of Hong Kong]]. Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing at numerous Chinese communities there.\n\nAlthough many of his peers decided to stay in the US, Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce's birth. Within months, Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong|Japanese occupation]]. After the war ended, Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong's rebuilding years.\n\nLee's mother, Grace Ho, was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong, the Ho-tungs.

As such, the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment. Despite the advantage of his family's status, the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded, dangerous, and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing [[China|communist China]] for Hong Kong, at that time a British [[Crown colony]].<ref name=\"Bruce Lee 2002\">Bruce Lee: the immortal Dragon, January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref>\n\nAfter Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts.

Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher [[Yip Man]] in 1957, after losing several fights with rival gang members. Yip's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice, ''chi sao'' (sticking hands) drills, [[Muk Yan Jong|wooden dummy]] techniques, and free-sparring.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993</ref> There was no set pattern to the classes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions.<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'' Summer 1993, p. 18</ref>\n\nAfter a year into his Wing Chun training, most of Yip Man's other students refused to train with Lee after they learned of his mixed ancestry, as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=26}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sharif|2009|p=56}}</ref> Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung states, \"Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Yip Man\".<ref>Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition Summer 1993 p. 19</ref> However, Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun, and continued to train privately with [[Yip Man]] and [[Wong Shun Leung]] in 1955.<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2006|p=172}}</ref> [[Wan Kam Leung]], a student of Wong's, witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee, and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks.

In around 1956, due to poor academic performance (or possibly poor conduct as well), he was transferred to [[St. Francis Xavier's College]] (high school) where he would be mentored by Brother Edward, a teacher and coach of the school boxing team.\n\n[[File:Bruce Lee in 1958.jpg|thumb|Lee in 1958, dancing Cha-cha.]]\nIn the spring of 1959, Lee got into yet another street fight and the police were called.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Burrows|first =Alyssa|title = Bruce Lee|publisher=HistoryLink |year=2002|url = http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=3999|accessdate=May 30, 2008}}</ref>\nUntil his late teens, Lee's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] family.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Eventually, Lee's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States.

Lee's elder brother Peter Lee (李忠琛) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to [[Minnesota]] to attend college. In December 1960, Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School (now [[Seattle Central Community College]], located on [[Capitol Hill (Seattle)|Capitol Hill]] in Seattle).\n\nIn March 1961, Lee enrolled at the [[University of Washington]], majoring in drama according to a 1999 article in the university's alumni magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/dec99/j_o.html |title=U. of Washington alumni records |publisher=Washington.edu |accessdate=January 22, 2010}}</ref> not in philosophy as stated by Lee himself and many others.

He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu (literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu).

James Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well known Chinese martial artist in the area. Together, they founded the second Jun Fan martial art studio in Oakland. James Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to [[Ed Parker]], American martial artist, and organizer of the [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]] at which Bruce Lee was later \"discovered\" by Hollywood.\n\n===Long Beach International Karate Championships===\nAt the invitation of [[Ed Parker]], Lee appeared in the 1964 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships]]<ref name=\"ikc\">{{cite web|accessdate=May 30, 2008|url=http://www.longbeachikc.com/|title=2007 Long Beach International Karate Championship|publisher=Long Beach International Karate Championship}}</ref> and performed repetitions of two-finger push-ups (using the thumb and the index finger of one hand) with feet at approximately a shoulder-width apart.

Lee's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately {{convert|1|in|cm|spell=in}} away from the partner's chest. Without retracting his right arm, Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to his partner while largely maintaining his posture, sending the partner backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind the partner to prevent injury, though his partner's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor. His volunteer was Bob Baker of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California. \"I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again\", Baker recalled. \"When he punched me that last time, I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable\".<ref>{{harvnb|Vaughn|1986|p=21}}</ref>\n\nIt was at the 1964 championships where Lee first met [[Taekwondo]] master [[Jhoon Goo Rhee]].

Moore claims that Lee never successfully struck Moore but Moore was able to strike Lee after trying on his own; Moore further claims that Bruce Lee said he was the fastest American he's ever seen and that Lee's media crew repeatedly played the one punch towards Moore's face that did not come within striking range, allegedly in an attempt to preserve Lee's superstar image.<ref>Vic Moore as interviewed in {{citeweb|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nik8VQAcuGE|title=GrandMaster Vic Moore: The Man That Fought 'Em ALL!!!|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Fight with Wong Jack Man===\nIn [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California in 1964 at [[Chinatown, Oakland|Chinatown]], Lee had a controversial private match with [[Wong Jack Man]], a direct student of Ma Kin Fung known for his mastery of [[Xingyiquan]], [[Northern Shaolin (martial art)|Northern Shaolin]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan]]. According to Lee, the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese. When he refused to comply, he was challenged to a combat match with Wong. The arrangement was that if Lee lost, he would have to shut down his school; while if he won, then Lee would be free to teach [[White people|Caucasians]] or anyone else.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Bruce Lee: The Immortal Dragon'', January 29, 2002, A&E Television Networks</ref> Wong denied this, stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco, and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Caucasians or other non-Chinese.<ref name=\"Dorgan\">{{harvnb|Dorgan|1980|p=}}</ref> Lee commented, \"That paper had all the names of the [[sifu]] from Chinatown, but they don't scare me\".<ref>''Black Belt: Bruce Lee Collector's Edition'', Summer 1993 Rainbow Publications Inc, p. 117</ref>\n\nIndividuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.<ref name=\"Dorgan\"/> Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight from the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditional handshake offer by pretending to accept the handshake, but instead turning that hand into a spear aimed at Wong's eyes. Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's \"unusually winded\" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.<ref name=\"Dorgan\"/> According to Bruce Lee, [[Linda Lee Cadwell]], and [[James Yimm Lee]] however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, \"The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'Do you give up?' and the man said he gave up\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMental Floss magazine's Jack Rossen said author Rick Wing, a dedicated student of Wong's, presented a somewhat different account after Wing interviewed Wong and several eyewitnesses to the fight for ''Showdown in Oakland: The Story Behind the Wong Jack Man - Bruce Lee Fight'', Wing's book on the bout:\n\n{{quote|Lee began by lashing out immediately after a handshake, cutting Wong’s forehead, and then proceeded to launch a series of groin kicks and high-volume punches, most of which Wong absorbed in the chest.\n\nWong moved laterally, and was not as aggressive as the temperamental Lee; he [Wong] had told his friends he wouldn’t be using kicks, which he considered his most dangerous weapon, because he didn’t want to permanently injure Lee. He did, however, sport a pair of leather bracelets he wore over his wrists, and one of his strikes caught Lee near his neck, staggering him. Wong followed up with a headlock, but chose not to strike while Lee was doubled over.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of Lee pressing the action and Wong picking his spots, Wong lost his footing and fell to the ground, where Lee tried to pounce on him. Observers told Wing they feared Lee was getting too heated and stepped in to break up the bout.\"<ref name=\"Mental Floss\">{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/67108/time-bruce-lee-was-challenged-real-fight|title=Bruce Lee: The Time Bruce Lee Was Challenged to a Real Fight|last=Rossen|first=Jake|date=August 10, 2015|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=July 10, 2016|location=New York, NY}}</ref>}}\n\nA couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.<ref name = \"Dorgan\"/> In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese ''Pacific Weekly'', a [[Chinese-language]] newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation,<ref name = \"Dorgan\"/> and there were no further public announcements by either, though Lee continued to teach Caucasians.\n\n===Jeet Kune Do===\n[[File:JeetKuneDo.svg|thumb|The [[Jeet Kune Do]] emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate.

The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee's philosophy about martial arts. Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his [[Wing Chun]] techniques. He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalistic to be practical in scenarios of chaotic [[street fighting]]. Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on \"practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency\". He started to use different methods of training such as [[weight training]] for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques.\n\nLee emphasised what he called \"the style of no style\". This consisted of getting rid of the formalised approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles. Lee felt the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was even too restrictive, and eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call ''Jeet Kune Do'' or the ''Way of the Intercepting Fist.'' It is a term he would later regret, because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote; whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1994|p=81}}</ref>\n\n===Fitness and nutrition===\nAt {{convert|173|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}},<ref>{{cite web|title=Bruce Lee|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/chinese_celebrities_vote/2012-08/28/content_26356156.htm|website=china.org.cn|accessdate=July 2, 2014}}</ref> Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor, achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible. After his match with [[Wong Jack Man]] in 1965, Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training. Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning. Lee included all elements of total fitness—muscular strength, muscular endurance, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility. He used traditional [[bodybuilding]] techniques to build some muscle mass, not overdone as that could decrease speed or flexibility. At the same time in balance, Lee was careful to admonish that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills. In ''[[Tao of Jeet Kune Do]]'' he wrote,\n\n{{quote|Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics. Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation.&nbsp;...

He later concluded that in order to achieve a high-performance body, one could not fuel it with a diet of junk food, and with \"the wrong fuel\" one's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=162}}</ref> Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour, describing them as providing calories which did nothing for his body.<ref>{{harvnb|Little|1998|p=163}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\n{{main|Bruce Lee filmography}}\n[[Image:Bruce Lee 1950.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Bruce Lee in ''[[The Kid (1950 film)|The Kid]]''.]]\nLee's father [[Lee Hoi-chuen]] was a famous [[Cantonese opera]] star. Because of this, Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film ''[[Golden Gate Girl]]''. By the time he was 18, he had appeared in twenty films.<ref name=\"bruceleefoundation biography\"/>\n\nWhile in the United States from 1959 to 1964, Lee abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts. However, a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by [[William Dozier]] for an audition for a part in the pilot for \"Number One Son\". The show never aired, but Lee was invited for the role of [[Kato (The Green Hornet)|Kato]] alongside [[Van Williams]] in the TV series ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]''. The show lasted just one season, from 1966 to 1967. Lee also played Kato in three crossover episodes of ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''. This was followed by guest appearances in three television series: ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' (1967), ''[[Here Come the Brides]]'' (1969), and ''Blondie'' (1969).\n\nAt the time, two of Lee's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer [[Stirling Silliphant]] and actor [[James Coburn]]. In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called ''The Silent Flute'', and went together on a location hunt to [[India]]. The project was not realised at the time; but the 1978 film ''[[Circle of Iron]]'', starring David Carradine, was based on the same plot. In 2010, producer Paul Maslansky was reported to plan and receive fundings for a film based on the original script for ''The Silent Flute''.<ref>{{cite news|last=McNary |first=Dave |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118017805.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Bruce Lee's 'Flute' heads to bigscreen&nbsp;– Entertainment News, Film News, Media |publisher=Variety |date=April 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> In 1969, Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant-penned film ''[[Marlowe (film)|Marlowe]]'' where he played a henchman hired to intimidate private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], (played by [[James Garner]]), by smashing up his office with leaping kicks and flashing punches, only to later accidentally jump off a tall building while trying to kick Marlowe off. The same year he also choreographed fight scenes for ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1969 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' starring [[Dean Martin]], [[Sharon Tate]], and featuring [[Chuck Norris]] in his first role. In 1970, he was responsible for fight choreography for ''[[A Walk in the Spring Rain]]'' starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Anthony Quinn]], again written by Silliphant. In 1971, Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series ''[[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]'', written by Silliphant. Lee played the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet (played by [[James Franciscus]]), and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script.\n\n[[File:Van Williams Bruce Lee Green Hornet 1966.JPG|thumb|right|Publicity photo of Williams and Lee for ''The Green Hornet''.]]\nAccording to statements made by Lee, and also by [[Linda Lee Cadwell]] after Lee's death, in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled ''The Warrior'', discussions which were also confirmed by [[Warner Bros.]] In a December 9, 1971 television interview on ''[[The Pierre Berton Show]]'', Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him \"to be in a modernized type of a thing, and that they think the Western idea is out, whereas I want to do the Western\".<ref>From {{YouTube|hN8PfMdBIjw|The Pierre Berton Show}} December 9, 1971 (comments at 7:10 of part 2)</ref> According to Cadwell, however, Lee's concept was retooled and renamed ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'', but [[Warner Bros.]] gave Lee no credit.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1975a|p=}}</ref> Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept,<ref>Bleecker, Tom (1996).

Unaware that ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as \"The Kato Show\", he was surprised to be recognised on the street as the star of the show. After negotiating with both [[Shaw Brothers Studio]] and [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]], Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest. \n\nLee played his first leading role in ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971) which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom. He soon followed up with ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (1972) which broke the box office records set previously by ''The Big Boss''. Having finished his initial two-year contract, Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest. Lee later formed his own company, ''[[Concord Production Inc.|Concord Production Inc. (協和電影公司)]]'', with Chow. For his third film, ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' (1972), he was given complete control of the film's production as the writer, director, star, and [[Stage combat|choreographer]] of the fight scenes. In 1964, at a demonstration in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], California, Lee had met [[Karate]] champion Chuck Norris. In ''Way of the Dragon'' Lee introduced Norris to movie-goers as his opponent in the final death fight at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, today considered one of Lee's most legendary fight scenes and one of the most memorable fight scenes in [[martial arts film]] history.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|1989|}}</ref> The role was originally offered to American Karate champion [[Joe Lewis (martial artist)|Joe Lewis]].<ref>Thomas, B.

Production was stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', the first film to be produced jointly by Golden Harvest and Warner Bros. Filming began in Hong Kong in January 1973. One month into the filming, another production company, Starseas Motion Pictures, promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in ''Fist of Unicorn'', although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long-time friend [[Unicorn Chan]].

He was well-read and had an extensive library. His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions, both inside and outside of martial arts circles. His [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs, though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings. He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self-knowledge, and said that his chosen method of self-expression was martial arts.<ref name=\"warriorwithin122\"/> His influences include [[Taoism]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], and [[Buddhism]].<ref>[[Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey]] at 31m45s</ref> On the other hand, Lee's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by [[Confucianism]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bolelli|2008|p=161}}</ref> John Little states that Lee was an [[Atheism|atheist]].
