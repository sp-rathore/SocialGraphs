He is an enigmatic figure known chiefly through the accounts of classical writers, especially the writings of his students [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] and the plays of his contemporary [[Aristophanes]]. [[Plato#Dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] are among the most comprehensive accounts of Socrates to survive from antiquity, though it is unclear the degree to which Socrates himself is \"hidden behind his 'best disciple', Plato\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Kofman |first=Sarah |title=Socrates: Fictions of a Philosopher |year=1998 |ISBN=0-8014-3551-X |page=34}}</ref>\n\nThrough his portrayal in Plato's dialogues, Socrates has become renowned for his contribution to the field of [[ethics]], and it is this Platonic Socrates who lends his name to the concepts of [[Irony#Socratic irony|Socratic irony]] and the [[Socratic method]], or ''elenchus''. The latter remains a commonly used tool in a wide range of discussions, and is a type of [[pedagogy]] in which a series of questions is asked not only to draw individual answers, but also to encourage fundamental insight into the issue at hand. Plato's Socrates also made important and lasting contributions to the field of [[epistemology]], and his ideologies and approach have proven a strong foundation for much Western philosophy that has followed.\n\n== Socratic problem ==\n{{Main|Socratic problem}}\nNothing written by Socrates remains extant. As a result, information about him and his philosophies depends upon secondary sources. Furthermore, close comparison between the contents of these sources reveals contradictions, thus creating concerns about the [[Wikt:actuality|possibility]] of knowing in-depth the real Socrates. This issue is known as the [[Socratic problem]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberson |first=C. |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uJDLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false 24] |title=Ethics for Criminal Justice Professionals |publisher=CRC Press |date=8 December 2009 |isbn=1420086723}}</ref> or ''the Socratic question''.<ref>{{cite book |first=A. |last=Rubel |first2=M. |last2=Vickers |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SmJ_BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA147 147] |title=Fear and Loathing in Ancient Athens: Religion and Politics During the Peloponnesian War |publisher=Routledge |date=11 September 2014 |isbn=1317544803}}</ref><ref name=\"Louis-André Dorion\">{{cite book |last=Dorion |first=Louis-André |url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/companions/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511780257&cid=CBO9780511780257A004 |title=The Rise and Fall of the Socratic Problem (pp. 1–23) (The Cambridge Companion to Socrates) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ISBN=9780521833424 |accessdate=2015-05-07 |doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521833424.001}}</ref>\n\nTo understand Socrates and his thought, one must turn primarily to the works of [[Plato]], whose dialogues are thought the most informative source about Socrates' life and philosophy,<ref>\n{{cite book |last=May |first=H. |title=On Socrates |publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, |year=2000 |page=20}}</ref> and also [[Xenophon]].<ref>[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674996953 catalogue of Harvard University Press - Xenophon Volume IV].

In addition to Plato and [[Xenophon]], each of the following is credited by some source as having added to the genre: [[Aeschines of Sphettus]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Aristippus]], Bryson, Cebes, [[Crito]], [[Euclid of Megara]], and Phaedo. It is unlikely Plato was the first in this field (Vlastos, p. 52).</ref>\n\nAs for discovering the real-life Socrates, the difficulty is that ancient sources are mostly philosophical or dramatic texts, apart from Xenophon. There are no straightforward histories, contemporary with Socrates, that dealt with his own time and place. A corollary of this is that sources that do mention Socrates do not necessarily claim to be historically accurate, and are often partisan. For instance, those who prosecuted and convicted Socrates have left no testament. Historians therefore face the challenge of reconciling the various evidence from the extant texts in order to attempt an accurate and consistent account of Socrates' life and work. The result of such an effort is not necessarily realistic, even if consistent.\n\nAmid all the disagreement resulting from differences within sources, two factors emerge from all sources pertaining to Socrates. It would seem, therefore, that he was ugly, and that Socrates had a brilliant intellect.<ref name=\"D.R. Morrison (Professor of Philosophy and Classical Studies at Rice University (c.2011).

Also, Xenophon, being an historian, is a more reliable witness to the historical Socrates. It is a matter of much debate over which Socrates it is whom Plato is describing at any given point—the historical figure, or Plato's fictionalization. As British philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has put it, \"Plato, the idealist, offers an idol, a master figure, for philosophy. A Saint, a prophet of 'the Sun-God', a teacher condemned for his teachings as a heretic.\"<ref>Cohen, M., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yhUg7xHDggIC&dq=Martin+Cohen%2C+Philosophical+Tales&q=an+idol#v=snippet&q=an%20idol&f=false ''Philosophical Tales: Being an Alternative History Revealing the Characters, the Plots, and the Hidden Scenes That Make Up the True Story of Philosophy''], John Wiley & Sons, 2008, p. 5, ISBN 1-4051-4037-2.</ref>\n\nIt is also clear from other writings and historical artefacts, that Socrates was not simply a character, nor an invention, of Plato. The testimony of Xenophon and [[Aristotle]], alongside some of Aristophanes' work (especially ''[[The Clouds]]''), is useful in fleshing out a perception of Socrates beyond Plato's work.\n\n=== Socrates as a philosopher ===\nThe problem with discerning Socrates' philosophical views stems from the perception of contradictions in statements made by the ''Socrates'' in the different dialogues of Plato. These contradictions produce doubt as to the actual philosophical doctrines of Socrates, within his milieu and as recorded by other individuals.<ref>[http://www.philosophy.msu.edu/people/faculty/debra-nails/ D Nails], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fWzD1JxPLn4C&pg=PA9&dq=Socrates+problem+philosophical+Socrates&hl=en&sa=X&ei=O7svVfHAIM-Waqj5gcgJ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Socrates%20problem%20philosophical%20Socrates&f=false Agora, Academy, and the Conduct of Philosophy (p. 9)], Springer, 1995, ISBN 0792335430.</ref> Aristotle, in his ''Magna Moralia'', refers to Socrates in words which make it patent that the doctrine ''virtue is knowledge'' was held by Socrates. Within the ''Metaphysics'', he states Socrates was occupied with the search for moral virtues, being the ' ''first to search for universal definitions for them'' '.<ref>Ahbel-Rappe, S., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&pg=PA2&dq=the+%E2%80%9Creal%E2%80%9D+Socrates&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0v0vVc6KGsjtaJGEgLgP&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20%E2%80%9Creal%E2%80%9D%20Socrates&f=false Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed (p. 2 and footnote 10 on pp. 157–8)], A&C Black, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe problem of understanding Socrates as a philosopher is shown in the following: In Xenophon's ''[[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]]'', Socrates is reported as saying he devotes himself only to what he regards as the most important art or occupation, that of discussing philosophy. However, in ''The Clouds'', Aristophanes portrays Socrates as accepting payment for teaching and running a [[Sophism|sophist]] school with [[Chaerephon]]. Also, in Plato's ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', as well as in Xenophon's accounts, Socrates explicitly denies accepting payment for teaching. More specifically, in the ''Apology'', Socrates cites his poverty as proof that he is not a teacher.\n[[File:Regnault Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure.jpg|thumb|300px|Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] (1791)]]\n\nTwo fragments are extant of the writings by [[Timon of Phlius]] pertaining to Socrates,<ref name=\"R Bett (S Ahbel-Rappe - Associate Professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Michigan, R Kamtekar - Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of Arizona) \">{{cite book |last=Bett |first=R. |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&pg=PA299&dq=Timon+of+Phlius+Socrates&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2vYwVdDOGsfKaLOogZAK&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Timon%20of%20Phlius%20Socrates&f=false |title=A Companion to Socrates (pp. 299-30) |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, 2009, ISBN 1405192607 |accessdate=2015-04-17}} (A translation of one fragment reads: \"But from them the sculptor, blatherer on the lawful, turned away.

The advocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected.\"</ref> He praises Sparta, archrival to Athens, directly and indirectly in various dialogues. One of Socrates' purported offenses to the city was his position as a social and moral critic. Rather than upholding a status quo and accepting the development of what he perceived as immorality within his region, Socrates questioned the collective notion of \"might makes right\" that he felt was common in Greece during this period. Plato refers to Socrates as the \"[[Social gadfly|gadfly]]\" of the state (as the gadfly stings the horse into action, so Socrates stung various Athenians), insofar as he irritated some people with considerations of justice and the pursuit of goodness.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Waterfield |first=Robin |title=Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |year=2009}}</ref> His attempts to improve the Athenians' sense of justice may have been the cause of his execution.\n\nAccording to Plato's ''Apology'', Socrates' life as the \"gadfly\" of Athens began when his friend Chaerephon asked the [[Pythia|oracle at Delphi]] if anyone were wiser than Socrates; the [[Oracle]] responded that no-one was wiser. Socrates believed the Oracle's response was not correct, because he believed he possessed no wisdom whatsoever. He proceeded to test the riddle by approaching men considered wise by the people of Athens—statesmen, poets, and artisans—in order to refute the Oracle's pronouncement. Questioning them, however, Socrates concluded: while each man thought he knew a great deal and was wise, in fact they knew very little and were not wise at all. Socrates realized the Oracle was correct; while so-called wise men thought themselves wise and yet were not, he himself knew he was not wise at all, which, paradoxically, made him the wiser one since he was the only person aware of his own ignorance. Socrates' paradoxical wisdom made the prominent Athenians he publicly questioned look foolish, turning them against him and leading to accusations of wrongdoing. Socrates defended his role as a gadfly until the end: at his trial, when Socrates was asked to propose his own punishment, he suggested a wage paid by the government and free dinners for the rest of his life instead, to finance the time he spent as Athens' benefactor.<ref>Brun (1978).</ref> He was, nevertheless, found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of [[impiety]] (\"not believing in the gods of the state\"),<ref>Plato.

There have been several suggestions offered as reasons why he chose to stay:\n#He believed such a flight would indicate a fear of death, which he believed no true philosopher has.\n#If he fled Athens his teaching would fare no better in another country, as he would continue questioning all he met and undoubtedly incur their displeasure.\n#Having knowingly agreed to live under the city's laws, he implicitly subjected himself to the possibility of being accused of crimes by its citizens and judged guilty by its jury. To do otherwise would have caused him to break his \"[[social contract]]\" with the state, and so harm the state, an unprincipled act.\n#If he escaped at the instigation of his friends, then his friends would become liable in law.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allen |first=R.E. |title=Socrates and Legal Obligation |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |pages=65–96}}</ref>\n\nThe full reasoning behind his refusal to flee is the main subject of the ''[[Crito]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Weiss |first=R. |title=Socrates Dissatisfied: An Analysis of Plato's Crito |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |page=85}}</ref>\n\nSocrates' death is described at the end of Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]''. Socrates turned down Crito's pleas to attempt an escape from prison. After drinking the poison, he was instructed to walk around until his legs felt numb. After he lay down, the man who administered the poison pinched his foot; Socrates could no longer feel his legs. The numbness slowly crept up his body until it reached his heart. Shortly before his death, Socrates speaks his last words to Crito: \"Crito, we owe a [[rooster]] to [[Asclepius]]. Please, don't forget to pay the debt.\"\n\nAsclepius was the Greek god for curing illness, and it is likely Socrates' last words meant that death is the cure—and freedom, of the soul from the body. Additionally, in ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'', Robin Waterfield adds another interpretation of Socrates' last words. He suggests that Socrates was a voluntary scapegoat; his death was the purifying remedy for Athens' misfortunes. In this view, the token of appreciation for Asclepius would represent a cure for Athens' ailments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n{{Platonism}}\n\n=== Socratic method ===\n\n{{Main|Socratic method}}\nPerhaps his most important contribution to [[Western culture|Western]] thought is his [[dialectic]] method of inquiry, known as the Socratic method or method of \"elenchus\", which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and [[Justice]]. It was first described by Plato in the ''Socratic Dialogues''. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The influence of this approach is most strongly felt today in the use of the [[scientific method]], in which [[hypothesis]] is the first stage. The development and practice of this method is one of Socrates' most enduring contributions, and is a key factor in earning his mantle as the father of [[political philosophy]], [[ethics]] or moral philosophy, and as a figurehead of all the central themes in [[Western philosophy]].\n\nTo illustrate the use of the Socratic method, a series of [[question]]s are posed to help a person or group to determine their underlying [[belief]]s and the extent of their knowledge. The Socratic method is a ''negative'' method of [[hypothesis]] elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to [[contradiction]]s. It was designed to force one to examine one's own beliefs and the validity of such beliefs.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the dialectic is that it is a method for direct perception of the Form of the Good. Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] describes the dialectic as \"the art of intellectual intuition, of visualising the divine originals, the Forms or Ideas, of unveiling the Great Mystery behind the common man's everyday world of appearances.\"<ref>Popper, K. (1962) The Open Society and its Enemies, Volume 1 Plato, London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, p133.</ref> In a similar vein, French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] suggests that the dialogues are a type of spiritual exercise. Hadot writes that \"in Plato's view, every dialectical exercise, precisely because it is an exercise of pure thought, subject to the demands of the [[Logos]], turns the soul away from the sensible world, and allows it to convert itself towards the Good.\"<ref>Hadot, P. (1995) Philosophy as a Way of Life, Oxford, Blackwells, p. 93.</ref>\n\n=== Philosophical beliefs ===\nThe beliefs of Socrates, as distinct from those of Plato, are difficult to discern. Little in the way of concrete evidence exists to demarcate the two. The lengthy presentation of ideas given in most of the dialogues may be the ideas of Socrates himself, but which have been subsequently deformed or changed by Plato, and some scholars think Plato so adapted the Socratic style as to make the literary character and the philosopher himself impossible to distinguish. Others argue that he did have his own theories and beliefs.<ref name=\"Cohn2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Cohn |first1=Dorrit |title=Does Socrates Speak for Plato? Reflections on an Open Question |journal=New Literary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=2001 |pages=485–500 |issn=1080-661X |doi=10.1353/nlh.2001.0030}}</ref> There is a degree of controversy inherent in the identifying of what these might have been, owing to the difficulty of separating Socrates from Plato and the difficulty of interpreting even the dramatic writings concerning Socrates. Consequently, distinguishing the philosophical beliefs of Socrates from those of Plato and Xenophon has not proven easy, so it must be remembered that what is attributed to Socrates might actually be more the specific concerns of these two thinkers instead.\n\nThe matter is complicated because the historical Socrates seems to have been notorious for asking questions but not answering, claiming to lack wisdom concerning the subjects about which he questioned others.<ref>Plato, ''Republic'' 336c and 337a, ''Theaetetus'' 150c, ''Apology'' 23a; Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' 4.4.9; Aristotle, ''Sophistical Refutations'' 183b7.</ref>\n\nIf anything in general can be said about the philosophical beliefs of Socrates, it is that he was morally, intellectually, and politically at odds with many of his fellow Athenians. When he is on trial for heresy and corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens, he uses his method of ''elenchos'' to demonstrate to the jurors that their moral values are wrong-headed. He tells them they are concerned with their families, careers, and political responsibilities when they ought to be worried about the \"welfare of their souls\". Socrates' assertion that the gods had singled him out as a divine emissary seemed to provoke irritation, if not outright ridicule. Socrates also questioned the Sophistic doctrine that arete (virtue) can be taught. He liked to observe that successful fathers (such as the prominent military general [[Pericles]]) did not produce sons of their own quality. Socrates argued that moral excellence was more a matter of divine bequest than parental nurture. This belief may have contributed to his lack of anxiety about the future of his own sons.\n\nAlso, according to A. A. Long, \"There should be no doubt that, despite his claim to know only that he knew nothing, Socrates had strong beliefs about the divine\", and, citing Xenophon's ''Memorabilia'', 1.4, 4.3,:\n<blockquote> According to Xenophon, he was a [[Teleology|teleologist]] who held that god arranges everything for the best.<ref>Long, AA., in {{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=companion+socrates+teleologist&source=bl&ots=xMZIH23Qs9&sig=5QVLDTLvtq9AIIcC3Fn3IcFZXSY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wfzAU8b1McajPeqXgOgN&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=companion%20socrates%20teleologist&f=false}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nSocrates frequently says his ideas are not his own, but his teachers'. He mentions several influences: [[Prodicus]] the [[rhetor]] and [[Anaxagoras]] the philosopher. Perhaps surprisingly, Socrates claims to have been deeply influenced by two women besides his mother: he says that [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] (cf. Plato's ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]''), a witch and priestess from [[Mantinea]], taught him all he knows about ''[[eros (love)|eros]]'', or [[love]]; and that [[Aspasia]], the mistress of [[Pericles]], taught him the art of rhetoric.<ref>Plato, ''Menexenus 235e''</ref> [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]] argued that his principal teacher was the Anaxagorean [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]] but his ideas were as Plato described them; [[Eric A. Havelock]], on the other hand, considered Socrates' association with the Anaxagoreans to be evidence of Plato's philosophical separation from Socrates.\n\n=== Socratic paradoxes ===<!--Linked from 'I know that I know nothing'-->\nMany of the beliefs traditionally attributed to the historical Socrates have been characterized as \"paradoxical\" because they seem to conflict with common sense. The following are among the so-called Socratic paradoxes:<ref>p. 14, [[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007; p. 147, Gerasimos Santas, \"The Socratic Paradoxes\", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.</ref>\n* No one desires evil.\n* No one errs or does wrong willingly or knowingly.\n* Virtue—all virtue—is knowledge.\n* Virtue is sufficient for happiness.\n\nThe term, \"[[Socratic paradox]]\" can also refer to a self-referential [[paradox]], originating in Socrates' utterance, \"what I do not know I do not think I know\",<ref>[[Apology (Plato)|''Apology of Socrates'']] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DApol.%3Asection%3D21d 21d].</ref> often paraphrased as \"[[I know that I know nothing]].\"\n\n=== Knowledge ===\n\nThe statement \"[[I know that I know nothing]]\" is often attributed to Socrates, based on a statement in Plato's ''Apology''.<ref>Plato, ''Apology'' 21d; A.

On the one hand, he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's ''Symposium'' (Diotima's Speech) and ''Republic'' (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom.\n\nIn Plato's ''Theaetetus'' (150a), Socrates compares his treatment of the young people who come to him for philosophical advice to the way midwives treat their patients, and the way matrimonial matchmakers act. He says that he himself is a true matchmaker (προμνηστικός ''promnestikós'') in that he matches the young man to the best philosopher for his particular mind. However, he carefully distinguishes himself from a [[panderer]] (προᾰγωγός ''proagogos'') or procurer. This distinction is echoed in Xenophon's ''Symposium'' (3.20), when Socrates jokes about his certainty of being able to make a fortune, if he chose to practice the art of pandering. For his part as a philosophical interlocutor, he leads his respondent to a clearer conception of wisdom, although he claims he is not himself a teacher (''Apology''). His role, he claims, is more properly to be understood as analogous to a ''[[midwife]]'' (μαῖα ''maia'').<ref>Boys-Stones, G., Rowe, C., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ec9NAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA173&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Circle of Socrates: Readings in the First-Generation Socratics], Hackett Publishing, 2013, pp. 173-175.</ref><ref>Vander Waerdt, PA., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Etrz2pkeZvwC&pg=PA201&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+matchmaker&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KY8VbqiBMbbate_gAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=Theaetetus%20Socrates%20matchmaker&f=false The Socratic Movement], Cornell University Press, 1994, pp. 200-202.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Theaetetus'', Socrates explains that he is himself barren of theories, but knows how to bring the theories of others to birth and determine whether they are worthy or mere \"[[cock egg|wind eggs]]\" (ἀνεμιαῖον ''anemiaion''). Perhaps significantly, he points out that midwives are barren due to age, and women who have never given birth are unable to become midwives; they would have no experience or knowledge of birth and would be unable to separate the worthy infants from those that should be left on the hillside to be exposed. To judge this, the midwife must have experience and knowledge of what she is judging.<ref>Plato, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g74pOFTqwcYC&dq=Theaetetus+Socrates+wind+egg&q=%22barren+midwife%22#v=snippet&q=%22barren%20midwife%22&f=false ''Theaetetus''].</ref><ref>Guthrie, WKC., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&dq=socrates+midwives&q=%22other+midwives%22#v=onepage&q=%22wind-egg%22&f=false Socrates], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 126.</ref>\n\n=== Virtue ===\n[[File:Palermsoc.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Bust of Socrates in the Palermo Archaeological Museum.]]\nSocrates believed the best way for people to live was to focus on the pursuit of virtue rather than the pursuit, for instance, of material wealth.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brickhouse |first=TC. |last2=Smith |first2=N.D. |title=Socrates on Trial |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1990 |page=165}}</ref> He always invited others to try to concentrate more on friendships and a sense of true community, for Socrates felt this was the best way for people to grow together as a populace.<ref>{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=M.P. |title=Socrates and the Political Community: An Ancient Debate |publisher=SUNY Press |year=1987 |page=67}}</ref> His actions lived up to this standard: in the end, Socrates accepted his death sentence when most thought he would simply leave Athens, as he felt he could not run away from or go against the will of his community; as mentioned above, his reputation for valor on the battlefield was without reproach.\n\nThe idea that there are certain virtues formed a common thread in Socrates' teachings. These virtues represented the most important qualities for a person to have, foremost of which were the philosophical or intellectual virtues. Socrates stressed that \"[[the unexamined life is not worth living]] [and] ethical virtue is the only thing that matters.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Duignan |first=B. |title=The 100 Most Influential Philosophers of All Time |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |year=2009 |page=33}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nIt is argued that Socrates believed \"ideals belong in a world only the wise man can understand\",<ref>Attributed to \"Solomon\" in {{cite book| title = 100 Most Influential People of All Times for Smartphones and Mobile Devices | publisher = Mobile Reference| year = 2007}}</ref> making the philosopher the only type of person suitable to govern others. In Plato's dialogue the ''Republic'', Socrates openly objected to the [[democracy]] that ran Athens during his adult life. It was not only Athenian democracy: Socrates found short of ideal any government that did not conform to his presentation of a perfect regime led by philosophers, and Athenian government was far from that. It is, however, possible that the Socrates of Plato's ''Republic'' is colored by Plato's own views. During the last years of Socrates' life, Athens was in continual flux due to political upheaval. Democracy was at last overthrown by a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] known as the [[Thirty Tyrants]], led by Plato's relative, [[Critias]], who had once been a student and friend of Socrates. The Tyrants ruled for about a year before the Athenian democracy was reinstated, at which point it declared an [[amnesty]] for all recent events.\n\nSocrates' opposition to democracy is often denied, and the question is one of the biggest philosophical debates when trying to determine exactly what Socrates believed. The strongest argument of those who claim Socrates did not actually believe in the idea of philosopher kings is that the view is expressed no earlier than Plato's ''Republic'', which is widely considered one of Plato's \"Middle\" dialogues and not representative of the historical Socrates' views. Furthermore, according to Plato's ''Apology of Socrates'', an \"early\" dialogue, Socrates refused to pursue conventional politics; he often stated he could not look into other's matters or tell people how to live their lives when he did not yet understand how to live his own. He believed he was a philosopher engaged in the pursuit of Truth, and did not claim to know it fully. Socrates' acceptance of his death sentence after his conviction can also be seen to support this view. It is often claimed much of the anti-democratic leanings are from Plato, who was never able to overcome his disgust at what was done to his teacher. In any case, it is clear Socrates thought the rule of the Thirty Tyrants was also objectionable; when called before them to assist in the arrest of a fellow Athenian, Socrates refused and narrowly escaped death before the Tyrants were overthrown. He did, however, fulfill his duty to serve as ''[[Prytanis]]'' when a trial of a group of Generals who presided over a disastrous naval campaign were judged; even then, he maintained an uncompromising attitude, being one of those who refused to proceed in a manner not supported by the laws, despite intense pressure.<ref>Kagen (1978).</ref> Judging by his actions, he considered the rule of the Thirty Tyrants less legitimate than the Democratic Senate that sentenced him to death.\n\nSocrates' apparent respect for democracy is one of the themes emphasized in the 2008 play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' by [[Andrew David Irvine]]. Irvine argues that it was because of his loyalty to Athenian democracy that Socrates was willing to accept the verdict of his fellow citizens. As Irvine puts it, \"During a time of war and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that in a democracy the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city—even during times of war—is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.\"<ref>Irvine, Andrew D. \"Introduction,\" ''Socrates on Trial,'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.</ref>\n\n=== Covertness ===\nIn the Dialogues of Plato, though Socrates sometimes seems to support a [[mystical]] side, discussing [[reincarnation]] and the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery religions]], this is generally attributed to Plato.<ref>{{cite book |last=McPherran |first=M.L. |title=The Religion of Socrates |publisher=Penn State Press |year=1998 |page=268}}</ref> Regardless, this view of Socrates cannot be dismissed out of hand, as we cannot be sure of the differences between the views of Plato and Socrates; in addition, there seem to be some corollaries in the works of Xenophon. In the culmination of the philosophic path as discussed in Plato's ''Symposium'', one comes to the [[Sea of Beauty]] or to the sight of \"the beautiful itself\" (211C); only then can one become wise. (In the ''Symposium'', Socrates credits his speech on the philosophic path to his teacher, the priestess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], who is not even sure if Socrates is capable of reaching the highest mysteries.) In the ''Meno'', he refers to the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], telling Meno he would understand Socrates' answers better if only he could stay for the initiations next week. Further confusions result from the nature of these sources, insofar as the Platonic Dialogues are arguably the work of an artist-philosopher, whose meaning does not volunteer itself to the passive reader nor again the lifelong scholar. According to [[Olympiodorus the Younger]] in his ''Life of Plato'',<ref>Olympiodorus the Younger, ''Life of Plato'', in ''The Works of Plato: A New and Literal Version Chiefly from the Text of Stallbaum'', p. 234, Bohm, 1854.</ref> Plato himself \"received instruction from the writers of tragedy\" before taking up the study of philosophy. His works are, indeed, dialogues; Plato's choice of this, the medium of Sophocles, Euripides, and the fictions of theatre, may reflect the ever-interpretable nature of his writings, as he has been called a \"dramatist of reason\". What is more, the first word of nearly all Plato's works is a significant term for that respective dialogue, and is used with its many connotations in mind. Finally, the ''Phaedrus'' and the ''Symposium'' each allude to Socrates' coy delivery of philosophic truths in conversation; the Socrates of the ''Phaedrus'' goes so far as to demand such dissembling and mystery in all writing. The covertness we often find in Plato, appearing here and there couched in some enigmatic use of symbol and/or irony, may be at odds with the mysticism Plato's Socrates expounds in some other dialogues. These indirect methods may fail to satisfy some readers.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting facet of this is Socrates' reliance on what the Greeks called his \"[[Daemon (classical mythology)#Socrates|daimōnic]] sign\", an averting (ἀποτρεπτικός ''apotreptikos'') inner voice Socrates heard only when he was about to make a mistake. It was this ''sign'' that prevented Socrates from entering into politics. In the ''Phaedrus'', we are told Socrates considered this to be a form of \"divine madness\", the sort of [[insanity]] that is a gift from the gods and gives us [[poetry]], [[mysticism]], [[love]], and even [[philosophy]] itself. Alternately, the ''sign'' is often taken to be what we would call \"intuition\"; however, Socrates' characterization of the phenomenon as ''daimōnic'' may suggest that its origin is divine, mysterious, and independent of his own thoughts. Today, such a voice would be classified under the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' as a [[Hallucinations#Command hallucinations|command hallucination]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Leudar |first=I. |last2=Thomas |first2=P. |title=Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity: Studies of Verbal Hallucinations |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n== Satirical playwrights ==\nHe was prominently lampooned in [[Aristophanes]]' [[comedy]] ''[[The Clouds]]'', produced when Socrates was in his mid-forties; he said at his trial (according to Plato) that the laughter of the [[theater]] was a harder task to answer than the arguments of his accusers. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] believed this play was a more accurate representation of Socrates than those of his students. In the play, Socrates is ridiculed for his dirtiness, which is associated with the [[Laconophile|Laconizing]] fad; also in plays by [[Callias (Comic Poet)|Callias]], [[Eupolis]], and [[Telecleides]]. Other comic poets who lampooned Socrates include [[Mnesimachus]] and [[Ameipsias]]. In all of these, Socrates and the [[Sophist]]s were criticized for \"the moral dangers inherent in contemporary thought and literature\".\n\n== Prose sources ==\nPlato, Xenophon, and Aristotle are the main sources for the historical Socrates; however, Xenophon and Plato were students of Socrates, and they may idealize him; however, they wrote the only continuous descriptions of Socrates that have come down to us in their complete form. Aristotle refers frequently, but in passing, to Socrates in his writings. Almost all of Plato's works center on Socrates. However, Plato's later works appear to be more his own philosophy put into the mouth of his mentor.\n\n=== The Socratic dialogues ===\n{{Main|Socratic dialogue}}\nThe ''Socratic Dialogues'' are a series of [[dialogue]]s written by Plato and Xenophon in the form of discussions between Socrates and other persons of his time, or as discussions between Socrates' followers over his concepts. Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' is an example of this latter category. Although his ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'' is a monologue delivered by Socrates, it is usually grouped with the Dialogues.\n\nThe ''Apology'' professes to be a record of the actual speech Socrates delivered in his own defense at the trial. In the Athenian jury system, an \"apology\" is composed of three parts: a speech, followed by a counter-assessment, then some final words. \"Apology\" is a [[transliteration]], not a [[translation]], of the Greek ''apologia'', meaning \"defense\"; in this sense it is not apologetic according to our contemporary use of the term.\n\nPlato generally does not place his own ideas in the mouth of a specific speaker; he lets ideas emerge via the [[Socratic Method]], under the guidance of Socrates. Most of the dialogues present Socrates applying this method to some extent, but nowhere as completely as in the ''[[Euthyphro]]''. In this dialogue, Socrates and [[Euthyphro (prophet)|Euthyphro]] go through several iterations of refining the answer to Socrates' question, \"...What is the pious, and what the impious?\"\n\nIn Plato's Dialogues, learning appears as a process of remembering. The [[soul]], before its incarnation in the body, was in the realm of [[Idea]]s (very similar to the Platonic \"Forms\"). There, it saw things the way they truly are, rather than the pale shadows or copies we experience on earth. By a process of questioning, the soul can be brought to remember the ideas in their pure form, thus bringing [[wisdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Khan |first=C.H. |title=Plato and the Socratic Dialogue: The Philosophical Use of a Literary Form |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998}}</ref>\n\nEspecially for Plato's writings referring to Socrates, it is not always clear which ideas brought forward by Socrates (or his friends) actually belonged to Socrates and which of these may have been new additions or elaborations by Plato—this is known as the [[Socratic Problem]]. Generally, the early works of Plato are considered to be close to the spirit of Socrates, whereas the later works—including ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''—are considered to be possibly products of Plato's elaborations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=D.R. |title=The Cambridge Companion to Socrates |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |chapter=1}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Immediate influence ===\n[[File:Σωκράτης, Ακαδημία Αθηνών 6616.jpg|thumb|Statue of Socrates in front of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)]]]]\n\nImmediately, the students of Socrates set to work both on exercising their perceptions of his teachings in politics and also on developing many new philosophical schools of thought. Some of Athens' controversial and anti-democratic [[tyrant]]s were contemporary or posthumous students of Socrates including [[Alcibiades]] and [[Critias]]. Critias' cousin Plato would go on to found the [[Academy]] in 385 BC, which gained so much renown that \"Academy\" became the standard word for educational institutions in later European languages such as [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |pages=306–309}}</ref> Plato's protege, another important figure of the Classical era, [[Aristotle]] went on to tutor [[Alexander the Great]] and also to found his own school in 335 BC—the [[Lyceum]]—whose name also now means an educational institution.<ref>{{cite book |last=Magee |first=B |title=The Great Philosophers: An Introduction to Western Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=34}}</ref>\n\nWhile \"Socrates dealt with moral matters and took no notice at all of nature in general\",<ref>{{cite book |last=Carruccio |first=E. |title=Mathematics And Logic in History And in Contemporary Thought |publisher=Transaction Publishers |year=2006 |page=44}}</ref> in his Dialogues, Plato would emphasize mathematics with metaphysical overtones mirroring that of [[Pythagoras]]&nbsp;– the former who would dominate Western thought well into the [[Renaissance]]. Aristotle himself was as much of a philosopher as he was a scientist with extensive work in the fields of [[biology]] and [[physics]].\n\nSocratic thought which challenged conventions, especially in stressing a simplistic way of living, became divorced from Plato's more detached and philosophical pursuits. This idea was inherited by one of Socrates' older students, [[Antisthenes]], who became the originator of another philosophy in the years after Socrates' death: [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]].\n\nThe idea of [[asceticism]] being hand in hand with an ethical life or one with piety, ignored by Plato and Aristotle and somewhat dealt with by the Cynics, formed the core of another philosophy in 281 BC—[[Stoicism]] when [[Zeno of Citium]] would discover Socrates' works and then learn from [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], a Cynic philosopher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Long |first=A.A. |title=Stoic Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=31–32}}</ref>\n\n=== Later historical influence ===\n[[File:Sughrat.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of Socrates by 13th century [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]] illustrator ]]\n\nWhile some of the later contributions of Socrates to [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Era]] culture and philosophy as well as the [[Roman Era]] have been lost to time, his teachings began a resurgence in both [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] and the [[Muslim history#Early Caliphate|Islamic Middle East]] alongside those of Aristotle and Stoicism. Socrates is mentioned in the dialogue [[Kuzari]] by Jewish philosopher and rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]] in which a Jew instructs the [[Khazar]] king about Judaism.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=The Hemlock Cup: Socrates, Athens and the Search for the Good Life |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2011}}</ref> [[Al-Kindi]], a well-known Arabic philosopher, introduced and tried to reconcile Socrates and Hellenistic philosophy to an Islamic audience,<ref>\n{{cite book |last=von Dehsen |first=C. |title=Philosophers and Religious Leaders |publisher=Routledge |year=2013}}</ref> referring to him by the name 'Suqrat'.\n\nSocrates' stature in Western philosophy returned in full force with the Renaissance and the Age of Reason in Europe when political theory began to resurface under those like [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[Hobbes]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ahbel-Rappe |first=S. |last2=Kamtekar |first2=R. |title=A Companion to Socrates |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |pages=xix–xx}}</ref> [[Voltaire]] even went so far as to write a [[Voltaire's Socrates (play)|satirical play]] about the [[Trial of Socrates]]. There were a number of paintings about his life including ''Socrates Tears Alcibiades from the Embrace of Sensual Pleasure'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]] and ''The Death of Socrates'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in the later 18th century.\n\nTo this day, the [[Socratic Method]] is still used in classroom and law school discourse to expose underlying issues in both subject and the speaker. He has been recognized with accolades ranging from frequent mentions in pop culture (such as the movie ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' and a Greek rock band called [[Socrates Drank the Conium]]) to numerous busts in academic institutions in recognition of his contribution to education.\n\nOver the past century, numerous plays about Socrates have also focused on Socrates' life and influence. One of the most recent has been ''[[Socrates on Trial]]'', a play based on Aristophanes' ''Clouds'' and Plato's ''Apology'', ''Crito,'' and ''Phaedo,'' all adapted for modern performance.\n\n=== Criticism ===\nEvaluation of and reaction to Socrates has been undertaken by both historians and philosophers from the time of his death to the present day with a multitude of conclusions and perspectives. Although he was not directly prosecuted for his connection to Critias, leader of the Spartan-backed [[Thirty Tyrants]], and \"showed considerable personal courage in refusing to submit to [them]\", he was seen by some as a figure who mentored oligarchs who became abusive tyrants, and undermined Athenian democracy. The Sophistic movement that he railed at in life survived him, but by the 3rd century BC, was rapidly overtaken by the many philosophical schools of thought that Socrates influenced.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wilson |first=E.R. |title=The Death of Socrates: Hero, Villain, Chatterbox, Saint |publisher=Profile Books |year=2007 |pages=61–62}}</ref>\n\nSocrates' death is considered iconic and his status as a martyr of philosophy overshadows most contemporary and posthumous criticism. However, Xenophon mentions Socrates' \"arrogance\" and that he was \"an expert in the art of pimping\" or \"self-presentation\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Danzig |first=G. |title=Apologizing for Socrates: How Plato and Xenophon Created Our Socrates |publisher=Lexington Books |year=2010 |pages=66–67}}</ref> Direct criticism of Socrates the man almost disappears after this time, but there is a noticeable preference for Plato or Aristotle over the elements of Socratic philosophy distinct from those of his students, even into the Middle Ages.\n\nSome modern scholarship holds that, with so much of his own thought obscured and possibly altered by Plato, it is impossible to gain a clear picture of Socrates amid all the contradictory evidence. That both [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]] and [[Stoicism]], which carried heavy influence from Socratic thought, were unlike or even contrary to [[Platonism]] further illustrates this. The ambiguity and lack of reliability serves as the modern basis of criticism—that it is nearly impossible to know the real Socrates. Some controversy also exists about Socrates' attitude towards [[homosexuality]]<ref>[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=a-h35nyFR7IC&dq= ''Socrates''], Cambridge University Press, 1971, p. 70.</ref> and as to whether or not he believed in the [[Olympian gods]], was monotheistic, or held some other religious viewpoint.<ref>A.A.
