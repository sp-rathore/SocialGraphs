She is currently the Kenan Professor of Philosophy Emerita at the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n==Work==\nOne of Diamond's most famous articles, ''What Nonsense Might Be'', criticizes the way that the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] think about nonsense on [[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]] grounds (See [[category mistake]]). Another well-known article, ''Eating Meat and Eating People'', examines the rhetorical and philosophical nature of contemporary attitudes towards [[animal rights]]. Diamond's writings on both \"early\" (''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' era) and \"late\" (''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' era) Wittgenstein have made her a leading influence in the [[New Wittgenstein|New Wittgenstinian]] approach advanced by [[Alice Crary]], [[James F. Conant]], and others.\n\nDiamond has published a collection of essays titled ''The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind.'' She is the editor of ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics: Cambridge 1939,'' a collection of lectures assembled from the notes of Wittgenstein's students [[Norman Malcolm]], [[Rush Rhees]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and R.G. Bosanquet.\n\n''Wittgenstein and the Moral Life: Essays in Honor of Cora Diamond'' (edited by [[Alice Crary]]<ref>http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/wittgenstein-and-moral-life</ref>) features essays by [[Alice Crary|Crary]], [[John McDowell]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], [[Stanley Cavell]], and [[James F. Conant]], among others.\n\nDiamond received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1957 and her [[Bachelor of Philosophy|BPhil]] from [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] in 1961.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American philosophy]]\n* [[List of American philosophers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://philosophy.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/cad2m Diamond's home page at UVa]\n*[http://hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/2000/Diamond.pdf An interview with Diamond from 2000] (pdf)\n*[http://www.laurentillinghast.com/DiamondEatingMeat.pdf Eating Meat and Eating People] (pdf)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diamond, Cora}}\n[[Category:Analytic philosophers]]\n[[Category:Wittgensteinian philosophers]]\n[[Category:American philosophers]]\n[[Category:Swarthmore College alumni]]\n[[Category:Alumni of St Hugh's College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:University of Virginia faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Cora Diamond"}}}}
