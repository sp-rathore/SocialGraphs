Hugh's father died when he was still an infant, and Hugh was educated largely thanks to the efforts of his elder brother [[Malcolm MacColl]], an [[Scottish Episcopalian|Episcopalian]] clergyman and friend and political ally of [[William Ewart Gladstone]].<ref>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=MacColl, Malcolm|volume= 2|page=508}}</ref> Early in his acquaintanceship with Gladstone, Malcolm MacColl persuaded the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician to provide funds for Hugh's education at Oxford. It was proposed to send him to Oxford University's [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St. Edmund Hall]], but Gladstone made this conditional on Hugh MacColl agreeing to take orders in the [[Church of England]].{{clarify|date=July 2014}} Hugh MacColl refused this condition and, as a result, never obtained a university education, which may have limited his contribution to philosophy, and certainly prevented him from ever obtaining a formal academic position.<ref>Source: Gladstone-MacColl Correspondence, British Library</ref>\n\nAfter a few years working in different areas of Great Britain, MacColl relocated to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], in France on the Channel, where he developed the greater part of his work and became a [[French citizen]]. MacColl was not obscure during his time. He was a lifelong regular contributor to the ''Educational Times''. His correspondents included the logicians [[William Stanley Jevons]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. He also corresponded, and argued in print, with the young [[Bertrand Russell]], and reviewed [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s 1898 ''Universal Algebra'' for ''Mind'' magazine.\n\n==Works==\nHe is known for three main accomplishments:\n\n* During 1877-79, while working out a problem involving [[integral|integration]], he published a four-part article establishing the first known variant of the [[propositional calculus]], terming it the \"calculus of equivalent statements\", preceding [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''Begriffschrifft''. He subsequently published 11 articles in ''Mind'' magazine, 1880..1908, and a text,<ref>''Symbolic Logic and Its Applications'', 1906.

While described by a recent critic as \"best left unread\",<ref>Stein Haugom Olsen, \"Why Hugh MacColl is not, and will never be, part of any literary canon\" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=veLr_ux9LAUC ''The Quality of Literature: Linguistic Studies in Literary Evaluation''], ed. Willie van Peer, [[John Benjamins Publishing Company]], 2008.</ref> the novels reveal social and moral values to which the author gave full expression in his 1909 publication ''Man's Origin, Destiny, and Duty'', an apology for [[Christianity]].\n\n==Legacy==\nThere is presently a long-term MacColl Project, a joint venture of [[Greifswald University]] in Germany and the [[University of Oslo]], which intends to publish a critical edition of his work. Furthermore, the group of logic and [[epistemology]] at the [[Université Lille Nord de France|University of Lille]] (France) develop MacColl's suggestions for a dynamic [[free logic]]. The December 1999 issue of the magazine ''[[Nordic Journal of Philosophical Logic]]'' published the proceedings of a 1998 conference devoted to MacColl's work.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Rahman, S. & Redmond, J., 2008. \"Hugh MacColl and the Birth of Logical Pluralism\".
