He published in [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], having belonged to the [[Finland Swedish|Swedish-speaking]] minority of Finland. Von Wright was of both Finnish and 17th-century [[Scottish people|Scottish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iraEl56V-WEJ:suvut.genealogia.fi/wrights/JohanPetterWrightinjaNilsWrightinjalkelaisia.pdf+Georg+Henrik+von+Wright+skotlanti&cd=5&hl=fi&ct=clnk&gl=fi&client=firefox-a|title=Georg Wrightin jälkeläisiä|publisher=suvut.genealogia.fi|accessdate=April 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Work==\nVon Wright's writings come under two broad categories. The first is [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophical logic]] in the Anglo-American vein. His 1951 books, ''An Essay in Modal Logic'' and ''Deontic Logic'', were landmarks in the postwar rise of formal modal logic and its [[deontic logic|deontic]] version. He was an authority on Wittgenstein, editing his later works. He was the leading figure in the Finnish philosophy of his time, specializing in [[philosophical logic]], [[philosophical analysis]], [[philosophy of action]], [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]], and the close study of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].\n\nThe other vein in von Wright's writings is moralist and [[pessimism|pessimist]]. During the last twenty years of his life, under the influence of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Jürgen Habermas]] and the [[Frankfurt School]]'s reflections about modern [[Rationality]], he wrote prolifically. His best known article from this period is entitled ''The Myth of Progress'', and it questions whether our apparent material and technological progress can really be considered \"progress\".\n\nIn the last year of his life, among his other honorary degrees, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Bergen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Nytt om navn|last=|first=|date=17 January 2002|work=Aftenposten|page=14|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n[[Image:Georg Henrik von Wright home 1.jpg|thumb|180px|Von Wright's home on Laivurinkatu street, Helsinki: a commemorative plaque marking his long-term residence in the house was fixed to the outer wall in 2006.]] \n*''The Logical Problem of Induction'', PhD thesis, 31 May 1941<ref>von Wright Georg Henrik.
