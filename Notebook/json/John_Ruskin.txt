He wrote on subjects as varied as geology, architecture, myth, ornithology, literature, education, botany and political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin also penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art was later superseded by a preference for plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, and architectural structures and ornamentation.\n\nHe was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century, and up to the [[First World War]]. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in [[environmentalism]], sustainability and craft.\n\nRuskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of [[J. M. W. Turner]] in which he argued that the principal role of the artist is \"truth to nature\". From the 1850s he championed the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. ''[[Unto This Last]]'' (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], where he established the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art|Ruskin School of Drawing]]. In 1871, he began his monthly \"letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\", published under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. As a result, he founded the [[Guild of St George]], an organisation that endures today.\n\n==Early life (1819–1846)==\n\n===Genealogy===\nRuskin was the only child of first cousins.<ref name=\"Intro\">''ODNB'' (2004) \"Introduction\"</ref> His father, John James Ruskin (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer<ref name=\"Intro\"/> founding partner and ''de facto'' business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see [[Allied Domecq]]).

John James Ruskin helped to develop his son’s [[Romanticism]]. They shared a passion for the works of [[Byron]], [[Shakespeare]] and especially [[Walter Scott]]. They visited Scott's home, [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]] in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20031012/ai_n12585843/ \"For Scott, home is where the art is\"]</ref> Margaret Ruskin, an [[Evangelical]] Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the [[King James Bible]] from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and stories had a profound and lasting effect on his writing.\n\nRuskin’s childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 [[Herne Hill]] (demolished c. 1912), near the village of [[Camberwell]] in [[South London]].<ref>J. S. Dearden, John Ruskin's Camberwell (Brentham Press for Guild of St George, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.</ref> It was not the friendless and toyless experience he later claimed in his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89).<ref name=\"Childhood\"/> He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, and from 1834 to 1835 attended the school in [[Peckham]] run by the progressive [[Evangelical]], Thomas Dale (1797–1870).<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/articles/individuals/dale_thomas.htm See Thomas Dale at the Bloomsbury Project]</ref> Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at [[King's College London]], where he was the first professor of English Literature.<ref name=\"Childhood\"/>\n\n===Travel===\n[[File:Rose Terrace, Perth.JPG|thumb|upright|10 Rose Terrace, Perth (on the right), where Ruskin spent boyhood holidays with Scottish relatives]]\nRuskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. It helped establish his taste and augmented his education. His father visited business clients in Britain's country houses, exposing him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Tours took them to the [[Lake District]] (his first long poem, ''Iteriad'', was an account of his 1830 tour)<ref>John Ruskin, ''Iteriad, or Three Weeks Among the Lakes'', ed. James S. Dearden (Frank Graham, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> and to relations in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope, so that in 1833 they visited [[Strasbourg]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Milan]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]], places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed his lifelong love of the [[Alps]], and in 1835 he first visited [[Venice]],<ref>[[Robert Hewison]], ''Ruskin and Venice: The Paradise of Cities'' (Yale University Press, 2009) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> that 'Paradise of cities' that formed both the symbol in and the subject of much of his later work.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.453n2}}\n\nThe tours provided Ruskin with the opportunity to observe and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, some of which was published in ''Friendship’s Offering''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=Introduction}} His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of [[Samuel Rogers]]’s poem, ''Italy'' (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and [[Samuel Prout]] whose ''Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany'' (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, [[Copley Fielding]] and [[James Duffield Harding]]. Gradually, he abandoned his picturesque style in favour of naturalism.\n\n===First publications===\nRuskin's journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem \"On Skiddaw and Derwent Water\" (originally entitled ''Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater'' and published in the ''Spiritual Times'') (August 1829).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=2.265-8}} In 1834 three short articles for [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]]'s ''Magazine of Natural History'' were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close \"scientific\" observer of nature, especially its geology.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.191-6}}\n\nFrom September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin’s ''The Poetry of Architecture'' was serialised in Loudon's ''Architectural Magazine'', under the pen name \"Kata Physin\" (Greek for \"According to Nature\").{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.4-188}} It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings which centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials and anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin’s ‘Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science’ was published in ''Transactions of the Meteorological Society''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.206-10}}\n\n===Oxford===\nIn [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas]] 1836, Ruskin [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[University of Oxford]], taking up residence at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] in January of the following year.<ref>[http://www.artmagick.com/poetry/poem.aspx?id=11553&name=john-ruskin-christ-church-oxford \"Christ Church, Oxford\" (poem) by John Ruskin]</ref>  Enrolled as a \"gentleman-commoner\", he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. His study of classical \"Greats\" might, his parents hoped, lead him to take Holy Orders and become a bishop, perhaps even the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the keenest advantage of his time in residence was found in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, was always encouraging, as was a young senior tutor, [[Henry Liddell]] (later the father of [[Alice Liddell]]) and a private tutor, the Rev [[Osborne Gordon]].<ref>Cynthia Gamble, ''John Ruskin, Henry James and the Shropshire Lads'' (New European Publications, 2008) chapters 3–4.</ref> He became close to the geologist and natural theologian, [[William Buckland]]. Among Ruskin’s fellow undergraduates, the most important friends were [[Charles Thomas Newton]] and [[Henry Acland]].\n\nHis biggest success came in 1839 when at the third attempt he won the prestigious [[Newdigate Prize]] for poetry ([[Arthur Hugh Clough]] came second).<ref>For his winning poem, \"Salsette and Elephanata\", Cook and Wedderburn 2.90–100.</ref> He met [[William Wordsworth]], who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony. But Ruskin never achieved independence at Oxford. His mother lodged on High Street and his father joined them at weekends. His health was poor and he was devastated to hear his first love, Adèle Domecq, second daughter of his father’s business partner, was engaged to a French nobleman. In the midst of exam revision, in April 1840, he coughed blood, raising fears of consumption, and leading to a long break from Oxford.<ref>[[Derrick Leon]], ''Ruskin: The Great Victorian'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1949), pp. 54–56.</ref>\n\nBefore he returned, he answered a challenge set down by [[Effie Gray]], whom he later married. The twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at [[Leamington Spa]] to undergo Dr. Jephson's (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fairy tale, ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' (published in December 1850 (but imprinted 1851) with illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]]).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=1.VI.305-54}} A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works.<ref>James S. Dearden, \"The King of the Golden River: A Bio-Bibliographival Study\" in Robert E. Rhodes and Del Ivan Janik, ''Studies in Ruskin: Essays in Honor of Van Akin Burd'' (Ohio University Press, 1982), pp. 32–59.</ref> At Oxford, he sat for a pass degree in 1842, and was awarded with an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.\n\n===''Modern Painters I'' (1843)===\nMuch of the period, from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin spent abroad with his parents, principally in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], to whom the Ruskins were introduced by [[Joseph Severn]], a friend of [[Keats]] (whose son, Arthur Severn, married Ruskin's cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner's pictures exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]]. It recalled an attack by critic, Rev [[John Eagles]], in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.<ref>[[Dinah Birch]] (ed.) ''Ruskin on Turner'' (Cassell, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore Ruskin began ''[[Modern Painters]]'', John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by [[Samuel Prout]] and, from 1839, Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 [[Denmark Hill]] (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.\n\nWhat became the first volume of ''[[Modern Painters]]'' (1843), published by [[Smith, Elder & Co.]] under the anonymous but authoritative title, \"A Graduate of Oxford,\" was Ruskin’s response to [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]’s critics. An electronic edition is available online.<ref>[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/index.htm Modern Painters I Electronic Edition eds. Lawrence Wood, Roger Garside, Ray Haslam]</ref> Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called \"[[Old Masters]]\" of the post-[[Renaissance]] period. Ruskin maintained that Old Masters such as [[Gaspard Dughet]] (Gaspar Poussin), [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], and [[Salvator Rosa]], unlike Turner, favoured pictorial convention, and not \"truth to nature\". He explained that he meant \"moral as well as material truth\".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=3.104}} The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studio—to render what he has seen and understood imaginatively on canvas, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the \"truths\" of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] with extraordinary verbal felicity.\n\nAlthough critics were slow to react and reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man’s work, notably [[Charlotte Brontë]] and [[Elizabeth Gaskell]].<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Early Years'' (Yale University Press, 1985) p. 73.</ref> Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin’s relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued the nearly 20,000 sketches Turner gave to the British nation.\n\n===1845 tour and ''Modern Painters II'' (1846)===\nRuskin toured the continent again with his parents in 1844, visiting [[Chamonix]] and [[Paris]], studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of [[Titian]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Perugino]] among others at the [[Louvre]]. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In [[Lucca]] he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by [[Jacopo della Quercia]] which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, [[Rose La Touche]]). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]], and in [[Florence]]. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Fra Angelico]] and [[Giotto]] in [[San Marco]], and [[Tintoretto]] in the [[Scuola di San Rocco]] but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on [[Venice]]: \"Venice is lost to me,\" he wrote.<ref>Q. in Harold I. Shapiro (ed.), ''Ruskin in Italy: Letters to His Parents 1845'' (Clarendon Press, 1972), pp.200–201.</ref> It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only true course was preservation and conservation.\n\nDrawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of ''Modern Painters'' (published April 1846).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.25-218}} The volume concentrated more on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: \"the Beautiful as a gift of God\".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=4.47 (''Modern Painters II'')}}  In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively through symbols. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] difficult to take.<ref>See J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1984),  pp. 88–95.</ref> In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father who still hoped his son might become a poet, even [[poet laureate]] just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.\n\n==Middle life (1847–1869)==\n[[File:Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais by Thomas Richmond.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Effie Gray painted by [[Thomas Richmond]]. She thought the portrait made her look like \"a graceful Doll\".<ref>[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait.php?LinkID=mp07473&rNo=0&role=art Euphemia ('Effie') Chalmers (née Gray), Lady Millais, National Portrait Gallery]</ref>]]\n\n===Marriage to Effie Gray===\nDuring 1847 Ruskin became closer to [[Effie Gray]], the daughter of family friends. It was for Effie that Ruskin had written ''[[The King of the Golden River]]''. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], once the residence of the Ruskin family.<ref>[http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day0507.html On Effie Gray in Perth]</ref> It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin’s grandfather). Largely owing to this association, Ruskin’s parents did not attend. The European [[Revolutions of 1848]] meant that the newlyweds’ earliest travelling together was limited, but they were able to visit [[Normandy]], where Ruskin admired the [[Gothic architecture]].\n\nTheir early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, [[Mayfair]] (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill) secured for them by Ruskin’s father. Effie was too ill to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the [[Alps]] with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of ''[[Modern Painters]]''. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring the social conscience that became increasingly sensitive.\n\nThe marriage, not consummated, later dissolved under discord and eventual annulment.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Phyllis |year=2010 |title=Parallel lives five Victorian marriages |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0307761509 }}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nRuskin’s developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the [[Gothic revival]], led to the first work to bear his name, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'' (1849).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=8.3-274}} It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his work.\n\n''Seven Lamps'' promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of [[A. W. N. Pugin]]. Ruskin argued that restoration is destruction; ancient buildings should be preserved, but no attempt should be made to erase the accumulated history encoded in their decay.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nIn August 1850 Ruskin and Effie were at Wenlock Abbey where Ruskin sketched some of the arcading in the Norman Chapter House, which was used in The Stones of Venice.<ref>Gamble, Cynthia, October 2013, Ruskin Lost in Shades of Gray, Shropshire Magazine, pp74-76</ref>\n\n===''The Stones of Venice''===\nIn November 1849, Effie and John Ruskin visited [[Venice]], staying at the Hotel Danieli.<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Effie in Venice'' (John Murray, 1965); reprinted as ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice: Unpublished Letters of Mrs. John Ruskin written from Venice, between 1849–1852'' (Vanguard Press, 1967; new edition: Pallas Athene, 2001).</ref> Their different personalities are thrown into sharp relief by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the [[Ca' d'Oro]] and the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge’s Palace, or Palazzo Ducale]], because he feared they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, made friends with Effie, apparently with no objection from Ruskin. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work, [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] (1851–53).<ref>[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/ruskinlib/eSoV/index.html View Ruskin's Venetian Notebooks, 1849–50, Electronic Edition eds.

Lancaster University]</ref><ref>For [[The Stones of Venice (book)|''The Stones of Venice'']] see Cook and Wedderburn vols. 9-11.</ref> Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture, from the Romanesque to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, ''Stones'' also reflected Ruskin’s view of contemporary England. It acted as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had slowly deteriorated. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.\n\nThe chapter, ‘The Nature of Gothic’ appeared in the second volume of ''Stones''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=10.180–269}} Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan’s joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, not machinery.\n\n{{Quote|text=We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense.

Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.|author=John Ruskin|source=Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.}}\n\nThis was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of the [[division of labour]] in particular, and [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]] in general. This chapter had a profound impact, and was reprinted both by the [[Christian socialist]] founders of the [[Working Men's College]] and later by the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] pioneer and [[socialist]], [[William Morris]].<ref>Fiona MacCarthy, ''William Morris'' (Faber and Faber, 1994) pp. 69–70, 87.</ref>\n\n===The Pre-Raphaelites===\n[[File:Millais Ruskin.jpg|thumb|''[[John Ruskin (painting)|John Ruskin]]'' painted by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[John Everett Millais]] standing at [[Glenfinlas]], Scotland, (1853–54).<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/886970 Ruskin and Millais at Glenfinlas], ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 138, No. 1117, pages 228–234, April 1996.

Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and seeking solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already fatally undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.\n\nIn April 1854, Effie filed her [[annulment|suit of nullity]], on grounds of \"non-consummation\" owing to his \"incurable [[impotence|impotency]],\"<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 236.</ref><ref>Sir William James, ''The Order of Release, the story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais'', 1946, p.237</ref> a charge Ruskin later disputed.<ref>Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, p. 87</ref> Ruskin wrote, \"I can prove my virility at once.\"<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (John Murray, 1968) p. 192.</ref> The annulment was granted in July.

The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of continued speculation and debate.\n\nRuskin continued to support [[William Holman Hunt|Hunt]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]]. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–57 to [[Elizabeth Siddal]], Rossetti's wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of [[Henry Acland]] for her medical care).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''ODNB'': \"Critic of Contemporary Art\".</ref> Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial support from Ruskin, including [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[John William Inchbold]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] who became a good friend (he called him \"Brother Ned\").<ref>W. G. Collingwood, ''Life and Work of John Ruskin'' (Methuen, 1900) p. 402.</ref> His father's disapproval of such friends was a further cause of considerable tension between them.\n\nDuring this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] under the title ''Academy Notes'' (1855–59, 1875).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=vol. 14}} They were highly influential, capable of making and breaking reputations.

He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations.<ref>The relation between Ruskin, his art and criticism, was explored in the exhibition [http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites (Tate Britain, 2000)] curated by Robert Hewison, Stephen Wildman and Ian Warrell.</ref> Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of [[Wallington Hall]] in Northumberland, home of his friend [[Pauline Trevelyan]].

Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive \"Ruskinian Gothic\".<ref>J. Mordaunt Crook, \"Ruskinian Gothic\" in ''The Ruskin Polygon: Essays on the Imagination of John Ruskin'' ed. John Dixon Hunt and Faith M. Holland (Manchester University Press, 1982), pp. 65–93.</ref> Through his friendship with [[Sir Henry Acland]], from 1854 Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] (designed by [[Benjamin Woodward]]) which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed completely to satisfy Ruskin. The many twists and turns in the Museum’s development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities’ less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.<ref>Michael Brooks, ''John Ruskin and Victorian Architecture'' (Thames and Hudson, 1991), p. 127.</ref>\n\n===Ruskin and education===\nThe [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History|Museum]] was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. The mid-1850s saw Ruskin’s first direct involvement in education,<ref>[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/john_ruskin.htm Ruskin and education by Sara Atwood]</ref> when he taught drawing classes (assisted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]) at the [[Working Men's College]], established by the [[Christian socialists]], [[Frederick James Furnivall]] and [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].<ref>[http://www.infed.org/walking/wa-wmenc.htm Working Men's College]</ref> Although he did not share the founders’ politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.553}} One result of this involvement was Ruskin’s ''Elements of Drawing'' (1857).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=15.23-232}} He had taught several women drawing by letter, and his book was both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals.<ref>''ODNB''.</ref> It was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, [[George Allen (publisher)|George Allen]].<ref>Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 226.</ref>\n\nFrom 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at [[Winnington Hall]] in [[Cheshire]]. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing embraced by its principal, Miss Bell.<ref>''The Winnington Letters: John Ruskin’s correspondence with Margaret Alexis Bell and the children at Winnington Hall'' ed. Van Akin Burd (Harvard University Press, 1969) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> The association led to Ruskin’s sub-Socratic work, ''The Ethics of the Dust'' (published December 1865, imprinted 1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington girls in which he cast himself as the \"Old Lecturer\".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.197–372}} On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, [[Whitelands College]], a training college for teachers, where he instituted a [[May Queen]] festival that endures today.<ref>Malcolm Cole, ''\"Be Like Daisies\": John Ruskin and the Cultivation of Beauty at Whitelands College (Guild of St George Ruskin Lecture 1992)'' (Brentham Press for The Guild of St George, 1992).</ref> (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] High School for Girls.)\n\n===''Modern Painters III'' and ''IV''===\nBoth volumes III and IV of ''Modern Painters'' were published in 1856.<ref>Respectively, Cook and Wedderburn vols. 5 and 6.</ref> In ''MP'' III Ruskin argued that all great art is \"the expression of the spirits of great men\".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.69}} Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence.

His first were in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. Lectures at the [[Art Treasures Exhibition]], [[Manchester]] in 1857, were collected as ''The Political Economy of Art'' and later under [[Keats]]’s phrase, ''A Joy For Ever''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=16.9-174}} He spoke about how to acquire, and how to use art, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation’s well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin’s intervention outraged his father and the [[Manchester School of economics|\"Manchester School\" of economists]], as represented by a hostile review in the ''Manchester Examiner and Times''.<ref>J. L. Bradley (ed.), ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 202–05.</ref> As the Ruskin scholar, Helen Gill Viljoen, notes Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.<ref>Most of Viljoen's work remains unpublished, but has been explored by Van Akin Burd and James L.

The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, to [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].\n\n===Turner Bequest===\nRuskin had been in Venice when he heard about [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner’s]] death in 1851. Named an executor to Turner’s will, it was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. In 1856 Ruskin’s book in celebration of the sea, ''The Harbours of England'', revolving around Turner’s drawings, was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.9–80}} In January 1857, Ruskin's ''Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856'' was published.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=13.95–186}} He persuaded the [[National Gallery]] to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual art-works left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858: cataloguing, framing and conserving.<ref>For the catalogues, Cook and Wedderburn 19.187–230 and 351–538. For letters, see 13.329-50 and further notes, 539–646.</ref> 400 watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin’s design.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner’s erotic drawings,<ref>Ian Warrell \"Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica\", ''British Art Journal'', vol.

The tour took him from [[Switzerland]] to [[Turin]] where he saw [[Paolo Veronese]]'s ''Presentation of the Queen of Sheba''. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon, led to his \"unconversion\" from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]].{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.89}} But in reality he had doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, threatened by Biblical and geological scholarship that had undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the [[Bible]]:<ref>Michael Wheeler, ''Ruskin's God'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}.</ref> \"those dreadful hammers!\" he wrote to [[Henry Acland]], \"I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses.\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.115}} This \"loss of faith\" precipitated a considerable crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/4.2.html Ruskin's loss of belief]</ref>\n\n===Social critic and reformer: ''Unto This Last''===\n{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote=Whenever I look or travel in England or abroad, I see that men, wherever they can reach, destroy all beauty. |source=<small>Cook and Wedderburn, 7.V.422–3 (1860).</small> }}\n\nAlthough Ruskin said in 1877 that in 1860, \"I gave up my art work and wrote ''[[Unto This Last]]'' ... the central work of my life\" the break was not so dramatic or final.<ref>E. T. Cook, ''The Life of John Ruskin'' (2 vols., 2nd edn., George Allen, 1912), vol. 2, p. 2.</ref> Following his crisis of faith, and influenced in part by his friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (whom he had first met in 1850), Ruskin’s emphasis shifted from art towards social issues from the end the 1850s. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a dazzlingly wide range of subjects including art and, among many others, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (''The Cestus of Aglaia''), botany and mythology (''Proserpina'', ''The Queen of the Air''). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel widely across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to [[Abbeville]], and in the following year he was in [[Verona]] (studying tombs for the [[Arundel Society]]) and [[Venice]] (where he was joined by [[William Holman Hunt]]). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking [[capitalism|industrial capitalism]], and the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theories of [[political economy]] underpinning it. He repudiated his eloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly.<ref>On the importance of words and language: Cook and Wedderburn  18.65, 18.64, and 20.75.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote=There is no wealth but life.

Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by [[John Stuart Mill]], based on theories of [[laissez-faire]] and competition drawn from the work of [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus]]. In his four essays, ''[[Unto This Last]]'', Ruskin rejected the [[division of labour]] as dehumanising (separating labourer from his product), and argued that the \"science\" of [[political economy]] failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. Ruskin articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on [[Plato]] and [[Xenophon]] to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics.<ref>For the sources of Ruskin's social and political analysis: James Clark Sherburne, ''John Ruskin or The Ambiguities of Abundance: A Study in Social and Economic Criticism'' (Harvard University Press, 1972 {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> For Ruskin, all economies, and all societies are ideally underwritten by a politics of [[social justice]]. Ruskin's ideas influenced the concept of the \"[[social economy]]\" characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]].\n\nThe essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new ''[[Cornhill Magazine]]'' between August and November 1860 and was published in a single volume in 1862.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.15–118}} However, its editor, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of its largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher ([[Smith, Elder & Co.]]). The press reaction was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, \"reprobated in a violent manner\".<ref>Cook and Wedderburn  4.122n. For the press reaction: J. L. Bradley (ed.) ''Ruskin: The Critical Heritage'' (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1984), pp. 273–289.</ref> His father also strongly disapproved.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=36.415}} Others were enthusiastic, including Ruskin’s friend, [[Thomas Carlyle]], who wrote, \"I have read your paper with exhilaration... such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads... will do a great deal of good.\"<ref>Q. in James S.

In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.\n\nRuskin’s sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father’s death in 1864, Ruskin inherited a considerable fortune of between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed).<ref>Francis O’ Gorman gives the figure as £120,000, in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 62 as does James S. Dearden (who adds that property, including paintings, was valued at £3000), in idem, ''John Ruskin'' (Shire Publications Ltd., 2004), p. 37. Robert Hewison’s ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' entry for Ruskin, however, states £157,000 plus £10,000 in pictures (section: \"A Mid-Life Crisis\").</ref> This considerable inheritance from the father he described on his tombstone as \"an entirely honest merchant\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=17.lxxvii}} gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of [[Octavia Hill]] (originally one of his art pupils), by buying property in [[Marylebone]] for her philanthropic housing scheme.<ref>Gillian Darley, ''Octavia Hill: A Life'' (Constable, 1990) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref> But Ruskin’s endeavours extended to a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, [[Paddington]] (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the [[British Museum]] clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.\n\n===Lectures in the 1860s===\nRuskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the [[Rede lecture]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1867, for example.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=19.163-94}} He spoke at the [[British Institution]] on 'Modern Art', the Working Men’s Institute, [[Camberwell]] on \"Work\" and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]] on 'War'. Ruskin’s widely admired lecture, ''Traffic'', on the relations of taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at [[Bradford]] Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/block1.html Moral Taste in Ruskin’s \"Traffic\" (Victorian Web)]</ref> \"I do not care about this Exchange,\" Ruskin told his audience, \"because ''you'' don’t!\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.433}} These last three lectures were published in ''The Crown of Wild Olive'' (1866).{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.383–533}}\n\n[[File:Library Walk 29.JPG|thumb|\"For all books are divisible into two classes: the books of the hour, and the books of all time\" – ''Sesame and Lilies'']]\nThe lectures that comprised ''Sesame and Lilies'' (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at [[Rusholme]] and [[Manchester]], are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. \"Of King's Treasuries\" (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. \"Of Queens' Gardens\" (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin’s most popular books, and was regularly awarded as a [[Sunday School]] prize.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=18.19-187}} The book's reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at \"Of Queens' Gardens\" particularly as an effort to \"subvert the new heresy\" of [[women's rights]] by confining women to the domestic sphere.<ref>Kate Millett, Sexual Politics.

He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) with which to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government schools (the \"South Kensington System\").<ref name=\"See Robert Hewison 1996\">See Robert Hewison, ''Ruskin and Oxford: The Art of Education'' (Clarendon Press, 1996) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Bibliography). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of \"Art\" encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (''Ariadne Florentina''), the relation of science to art (''The Eagle’s Nest'') and sculpture (''Aratra Pentelici''). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. \"The teaching of Art...,\" Ruskin wrote, \"is the teaching of all things.\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.86}} Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised [[Michelangelo]] in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist’s work in the [[Ashmolean Museum]].<ref>Francis O’ Gorman,  ''John Ruskin'' (Pocket Biographies) (Sutton Publishing Ltd., 1999) p. 78.</ref>\n\nMost controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on [[Ferry Hinksey Road]] at [[North Hinksey]], near [[Oxford]], instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme.<ref>[http://openplaques.org/plaques/3780 See Ruskin Cottage memorial green plaque]</ref> Motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour, some of the diggers, which included [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Alfred Milner]] and Ruskin’s future secretary and biographer, [[W. G. Collingwood]], were profoundly influenced by the experience—notably [[Arnold Toynbee]], Leonard Montefiore and [[Alexander Robertson MacEwen]]. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the [[settlement movement|university settlements]],<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 103–09.</ref> and was keenly celebrated by the founders of [[Ruskin College|Ruskin Hall, Oxford]].<ref>Stuart Eagles, \"Ruskin the Worker: Hinksey and the Origins of Ruskin Hall, Oxford\" in ''Ruskin Review and Bulletin'', vol.4, no.3 (Autumn 2008), pp. 19–29.</ref>\n\nIn 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, resigning again in 1884.<ref>Tim Hilton, ''John Ruskin: The Latter Years'' (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 399–400, 509–10.</ref> He gave his reason as opposition to [[vivisection]],<ref>Jed Mayer, \"Ruskin, Vivisection, and Scientific Knowledge\" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol.35, no. 1 (Spring 2008) (Guest Editor, Sharon Aronofsky Weltman), pp. 200–222.</ref> but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his [[Ruskin School of Drawing|Drawing School]].<ref name=\"See Robert Hewison 1996\"/> He was also suffering increasingly poor health.\n\n===''Fors Clavigera'' and the Whistler Libel Case===\nIn January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at [[Oxford University]], he began his (originally) monthly \"letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\" under the title ''[[Fors Clavigera]]'' (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his oeuvre, and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances, in many ways anticipating a modern-day blog, albeit a highly literary, complex and allusive one. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see [[Allen & Unwin]]).\n\nIn the July 1877 letter of ''Fors Clavigera'', Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by [[James McNeill Whistler]] exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]. He found particular fault with [[Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket|''Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket'']], and accused Whistler of \"ask[ing] two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face\".{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=29.160}}<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n1_v81/ai_13295552 Linda Merrill, ''A Pot of Paint: Aesthetics on Trial in Whistler v.

Whistler won the case, which went to trial in Ruskin’s absence in 1878 (he was ill), but the jury awarded damages of only one [[British farthing coin|farthing]] to the artist. Court costs were split between both parties. Ruskin’s were paid by public subscription, but Whistler was bankrupted within six months. The episode tarnished Ruskin's reputation, however, and may have accelerated his mental decline.<ref>For an exploration of Ruskin’s rejection of dominant artistic trends in his later life, see Clive Wilmer, \"Ruskin and the Challenge of Modernity\" in ''Nineteenth-Century Prose'', vol. 38, no. 2 (Fall 2011), pp. 13–34.</ref> It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin’s consistently exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.<ref>Cook and Wedderburn  29.469, the passage in ''Sesame and Lilies'' printed in \"blood-red\".</ref>\n\n===The Guild of St George===\nRuskin founded his utopian society, the [[Guild of St George]], in 1871 (although originally it was called St George’s Fund, and then St George’s Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in ''[[Fors Clavigera]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27–29}} A communitarian venture, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called \"Companions\" whose first loyalty was nearly always to Ruskin personally.<ref>For the Guild's constitution and articles of association: Cook and Wedderburn  30.3–12</ref> Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed traditionally, with minimal mechanical assistance.<ref>[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1940&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF Margaret Spence, \"THE GUILD OF ST.

Donations of land from wealthy and committed Companions eventually placed land and properties in the Guild’s care: [[Wyre Forest]], near [[Bewdley]], [[Worcestershire]];<ref>See Peter Wardle and Cedric Quayle, ''Ruskin and Bewdley'' (Brentham Press, 2007).</ref> [[Barmouth]], in [[Gwynedd]], north-west [[Wales]]; [[Cloughton]], in [[North Yorkshire]]; and [[Westmill]] in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref>[http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ruskinland.htm Ruskinland]</ref>\n\nIn principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of \"Companion\", wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild’s own coins.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=28.417–38 and 28.13–29}} Ruskin wished to see St George’s Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his ''Bibliotheca Pastorum'' or ''Shepherd’s Library''), but the schools themselves were never established.<ref>Sara Atwood, ''Ruskin’s Educational Ideals'' (Ashgate, 2011), pp. 151–64.</ref> (In the 1880s, loosely related to the ''Bibliotheca'', he supported [[Francesca Alexander]], publishing some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable organisation, has only ever operated on a small scale.<ref>For a short, illustrated history of the Guild: James S. Dearden, ''John Ruskin’s Guild of St George'' (Guild of St George, 2010).</ref>\n\nRuskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George’s Mill was established at [[Laxey]], on the [[Isle of Man]] producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent, but allied, efforts in spinning and weaving at [[Langdale]], in other parts of the [[Lake District]] and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] and similar organisations.<ref>Sara E. Haslam, ''John Ruskin and the Lakeland Arts Revival, 1880–1920'' (Merton Priory Press Ltd., 2004) {{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Sheffield]], in 1875, Ruskin established a museum for the working men of that city, and surrounding areas. Originally situated in [[Walkley]] and curated by Henry Swan, St. George’s Museum housed a large collection of art works (original pencil sketches, architectural drawings, watercolours, copies of Old Masters and so on), minerals, geological specimens, manuscripts (many of them medieval in origin) and a multitude of other beautiful and precious items.<ref>Janet Barnes, ''Ruskin and Sheffield'' (Sheffield City Council, 1985).</ref> Ruskin had written in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' III (1856) that, \"the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to ''see'' something, and to tell what it ''saw'' in a plain way.\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=5.333}} Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise confined to the wealthy who could afford to travel through Europe. The original Museum has been virtually recreated online.<ref>[http://www.ruskinatwalkley.org/ St. George’s Museum Online (ed. Marcus Waithe)]</ref> In 1890, the Museum relocated to [[Meersbrook Park]]. The collection is currently (2011) on display at [[Sheffield]]’s [[Millennium Galleries]].<ref>[http://www.museums-sheffield.org.uk/collections/ruskin-collection Ruskin Gallery, Sheffield]</ref>\n\n===Rose La Touche===\n[[File:Portrait of Rose La Touche 1861 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rose La Touche, as sketched by Ruskin]]\nRuskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by [[Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford]]. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. [[Rose La Touche]] was ten, Ruskin nearly 39. Ruskin gradually fell in love with her. Their first meeting came at a time when Ruskin’s own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting.<ref>Robert Dunlop, ''Plantation of Renown: The Story of the La Touche Family of Harristown and the Baptist Church at Brannockstown in Co. Kildar''e [1970]. Revised and enlarged edition, 1982; \"Ruskin‟s \"Wild Rose of Kildare\", pp. 29–41.</ref> Ruskin’s love for Rose was a cause alternately of great joy and deep depression for him, and always a source of anxiety.<ref>See Van Akin Burd, ''John Ruskin and Rose La Touche: Her unpublished Diaries of 1861 and 1867'' (Clarendon Press, 1979).</ref> Ruskin proposed to her on or near her eighteenth birthday in 1867, but she asked him to wait three years for an answer, until she was 21. A chance meeting at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact thereafter. She finally rejected him in 1872, but they still occasionally met, for the final time on 15 February 1875. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving a number of breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at [[Matlock, Derbyshire]], a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature. Ruskin turned to [[spiritualism]] and was by turns comforted and disturbed by what he believed was his ability to communicate with the dead Rose.\n\n===Travel guides===\nRuskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired [[Vittore Carpaccio|Carpaccio]]’s ''St Ursula'' in [[Venice]], a vision of which, associated with [[Rose La Touche]] would haunt him, described in the pages of ''[[Fors Clavigera|Fors]]''.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=27.344}} In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited [[Sicily]], the furthest he ever travelled.\n\nRuskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones \"to give,\" he said, \"what guidance I may to travallers...\"<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 23.293. For further study, see Keith Hanley and John K. Walton, ''Constructing Cultural Tourism: John Ruskin and the Tourist Gaze'' (Channel View Publications, 2010).</ref> ''The Stones of Venice'' was revised, edited and issued in a new \"Travellers’ Edition\" in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of [[France]] and [[Italy]]: ''Mornings in Florence'' (1875–77), ''The Bible of Amiens'' (1880–85) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), ''St Mark’s Rest'' (1877–84) and ''A Guide to the Principal Pictures in ... Venice'' (1877).\n\n===Final writings===\n[[File:John Ruskin, 1882.jpg|thumb|John Ruskin in 1882]]\nIn the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about [[Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] in ''Fiction, Fair and Foul'' (1880){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.265–397}} and returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, ''The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century'' (1884),{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=34.7–80}} describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin’s ''Storm-Cloud'' has been seen as foreshadowing [[environmentalism]] and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries.<ref>Michael Wheeler (ed.), ''Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century'' (Manchester University Press, 1995).</ref> Ruskin’s prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.\n\nHis last great work was his autobiography, ''Praeterita'' (1885–89){{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn||loc=35.5-562}} (meaning, ‘Of Past Things’), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at [[Herne Hill]].\n\nThe period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete collapse on his final tour, which included [[Beauvais]], [[Sallanches]] and [[Venice]], in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the [[Aesthetic movement]] and [[Impressionism]] distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the \"l’art pour l’art\" or \"art for art’s sake\" that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as [[Kate Greenaway]] than in modern art. He also attacked [[Darwinism|Darwinian theory]] with increasing violence, although he knew and respected [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] personally.\n\n===Brantwood===\nIn August 1871, Ruskin purchased from [[W. J. Linton]] the then somewhat dilapidated [[Brantwood]], on the shores of [[Coniston Water]], in the English [[Lake District]], paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today.<ref>[http://www.brantwood.org.uk/ Brantwood’s website.]</ref> It was Ruskin’s main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the ''Jumping Jenny''), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.<ref>For an illustrated history of Brantwood, see James S. Dearden, ''Brantwood: The Story of John Ruskin's Coniston Home'' (Ruskin Foundation, 2009).</ref>\n\nAlthough Ruskin’s 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with a congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it.<ref>[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1674&datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF James S.

Rachel Dickinson (Legenda, 2008).</ref>\n\nJoan Severn, together with Ruskin’s secretary, [[W. G. Collingwood]], and his eminent American friend, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], were executors to his Will. [[E. T. Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume ''Library Edition'' of Ruskin’s ''Works'', the last volume of which, an index, attempts to articulate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin’s thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin’s public and personal reputation.<ref>James Spates has written about the effects of this, based on the research work of Helen Viljoen. See James L. Spates, ‘John Ruskin‟s Dark Star: New Lights on His Life Based on the Unpublished Biographical Materials and Research of Helen Gill Viljoen’, ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', vol. 82, no.1, Spring 2000 [published 2001], 135–191.</ref>\n\nThe centenary of Ruskin’s birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed.<ref>Stuart Eagles, ''After Ruskin: The Social and Political Legacies of a Victorian Prophet, 1870–1920'' (Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 246–48.</ref> The contents of Ruskin’s home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and [[Brantwood]] itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, [[John Howard Whitehouse]].<ref>See James S.

She wrote in her journal, \"Mr Ruskin was one of the most ridiculous figures I have seen. A very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not particularly clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been.\"<ref>Leslie Linder, ed.

After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume \"Library Edition\", completed in 1912 by his friends [[Edward Tyas Cook]] and Alexander Wedderburn.<ref>[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/fass/ruskin/empi/notes/hcookwed01.htm A brief history of the ''Library Edition'']</ref> The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, causes certain difficulties. In 1898, [[John A. Hobson]] observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, \"the spell of his eloquence is broken\".<ref>[[John A. Hobson|J. A. Hobson]], ''John Ruskin: Social Reformer'' (J. Nisbet & Co., 1898), p. viii.</ref> [[Clive Wilmer]] has written, further, that \"the anthologizing of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts\" is \"something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start\".<ref>[[Clive Wilmer]] (ed.), ''Unto This Last and Other Writings'' (Penguin, 1985; and Kindle), pp. 36–7.</ref> Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin's theory and criticism require further consideration.\n\n===Art and design criticism===\nRuskin's early work defended the reputation of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. As such, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in ''[[Modern Painters]]'' I to: \"go to Nature in all singleness of heart... rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing.\"{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=3.624}} By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites whose members, he said, had formed \"a new and noble school\" of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/ruskin-turner-and-pre-raphaelites Ruskin's Pre-Raphaelites at the Tate]</ref> For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, This could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist's whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of [[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nRuskin's strong rejection of [[Classicism|Classical tradition]] in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: \"Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age... an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified.\"<ref>Ruskin, ''The Stones of Venice'', iii, ch. iv,§35;  Cook and Wedderburn 11.227.</ref> Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin's theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century, to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts which he had helped to inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.\n\nFor Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the 'meaning' of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the [[wikt:sublime|sublime]] effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved [[grotesque]]s and [[gargoyle]]s. Even its crude and \"savage\" aspects were proof of \"the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure.\"<ref>John Unrau, Ruskin, the Workman and the Savageness of Gothic, in New Approaches to Ruskin, ed [[Robert Hewison]], 1981, pp. 33–50</ref> [[Classical architecture]], in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the [[industrial revolution]], resulting in buildings such as the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]], which he criticised.<ref>Cook and Wedderburn 12.417-32. Cynthia J. Gamble, \"John Ruskin: conflicting responses to Crystal Palace\" in Françoise Dassy and Catherine Hajdenko-Marshall (eds.), ''Sociétés et conflit: enjeux et représentation'' (L‟Harmattan et l‟Université de Cergy-Pontoise, 2006), pp. 135–149.</ref> Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay \"The Nature of Gothic\" from the second volume of ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.\n\nRuskin's theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced ''faux'' Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]], a building designed with Ruskin's collaboration, met with his disapproval. The [[O'Shea and Whelan|O'Shea brothers]], freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative \"freedom of thought\" of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.\n\nRuskin's distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works attacking ''[[Laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] which he considered to be at the root of it. His ideas provided inspiration for the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], the founders of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[National Art Collections Fund]], and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]].\n[[File:Study of Gneiss Rock.jpg|200px|thumb|John Ruskin's ''Study of Gneiss Rock, Glenfinlas'', 1853.

Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanizing as economic man.\n# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognized for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.\n# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.\n# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.\n# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, 'the appearance of felicitous fulfillment of function.'\n# This fulfillment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and cooperating. This was what he called the 'Law of Help,' one of Ruskin's fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.\n# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.\n# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.<ref>Kenneth Clark, \"A Note on Ruskin's Writings on Art and Architecture,\" in idem, ''Ruskin Today'' (John Murray, 1964) (reissued as ''Selected Writings'', Penguin, 1991), pp. 133–34.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Historic preservation===\nRuskin's belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. Ruskin was a strong proponent of the former, while his contemporary, [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], promoted the latter. In ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]],'' (1849) Ruskin wrote:\n\n{{Quote|text=Neither by the public, nor by those who have the care of public monuments, is the true meaning of the word ''restoration'' understood. It means the most total destruction which a building can suffer: a destruction out of which no remnants can be gathered: a destruction accompanied with false description of the thing destroyed. Do not let us deceive ourselves in this important matter; it is ''impossible'', as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture.|source=<small>''Seven Lamps'' (\"The Lamp of Memory\") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.242.</small>}}\n\nThis abhorrence of restoration is in marked contrast to Viollet-le-Duc, who wrote that restoration is a \"means to reestablish [a building] to a finished state, which may in fact never have actually existed at any given time.\"<ref>Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc. ([1854] 1990). ''The foundations of architecture''. New York: George Braziller. P. 195. (Translated by Kenneth D. Whitehead from the original French.)</ref>\n\nFor Ruskin, the \"age\" of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: \"For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity.\"<ref>''Seven Lamps'' (\"The Lamp of Memory\") c. 6; Cook and Wedderburn 8.233-34.</ref>\n\n===Social theory===\nRuskin attacked orthodox, 19th-century [[political economy]] principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, \"social affections\"). He began to express such ideas in ''The Stones of Venice'', and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as ''The Political Economy of Art'' (''A Joy For Ever''), but he gave them full expression in the influential essays, ''Unto This Last''.\n\n{{Quote box |width=380px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n|quote=Nay, but I choose my physician and my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work. By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman, to be \"chosen.\" The natural and right system respecting all labour is, that it should be paid at a fixed rate, but the good workman employed, and the bad workman unemployed. The false, unnatural, and destructive system is when the bad workman is allowed to offer his work at half-price, and either take the place of the good, or force him by his competition to work for an inadequate sum.|source=<small>Cook and Wedderburn, 17.V.34 (1860).</small> }}\n\nAt the root of his theory, was Ruskin's dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern [[capitalism|industrial capitalist]] society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of [[Adam Smith]], expressed in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' had led, through the [[division of labour]] to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment. (See section, \"Stones of Venice\", above.)\n\nHe argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.\n\nIn the preface to ''Unto This Last'' (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and ‘gentleness and justice’; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame.{{sfn|Cook and Wedderburn|loc=17.17–24}} Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the [[welfare state]].<ref>Jose Harris, \"Ruskin and Social Reform\" in Dinah Birch (ed.), ''Ruskin and the Dawn of the Modern'' (Clarendon Press, 1999), pp. 7–33, specifically p. 8.</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Turner's erotic drawings===\nUntil 2005, biographies of both [[J. M. W. Turner]] and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner's posthumous reputation. Ruskin's friend [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]], who was Keeper of the National Gallery, was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner's works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at Tate Britain, were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum did not destroy them.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1381143,00.html ''The Guardian'' report on the discovery of Turner's drawings.] Also see Warrell \"Exploring the 'Dark Side': Ruskin and the Problem of Turner's Erotica\", ''British Art Journal'', vol.

Turner's Erotica\"]  13 January 2005</ref>\n\n===Sexuality===\nRuskin's sexuality has led to much speculation and critical comment. His one marriage, to [[Effie Gray]], was annulled after six years because of non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that he found her \"person\" repugnant.\n\n<blockquote>\nHe alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848].\n</blockquote>\n\nRuskin confirmed this in his statement to his lawyer during the annulment proceedings.\n\n<blockquote>It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.<ref>Mary Lutyens, ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p.191</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe cause of Ruskin's \"disgust\" has led to much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, [[Mary Lutyens]], suggested that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking.<ref>Lutyens, M., ''Millais and the Ruskins'', p.156</ref> However, [[Peter Fuller]] in his book ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' writes, \"It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood.\"<ref>Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'', Chatto & Windus, 1988, p.11-12</ref> Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; [[William Ewart Gladstone]] said to his daughter, Mary, \"should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.\".<ref>Q. in J. Howard Whitehouse, Vindication of Ruskin (George Allen & Unwin Ltd, 1950), p. 53.</ref>\n\nRuskin's later relationship with [[Rose La Touche]] has led to claims that he was a paedophile, on the grounds that he stated that he fell in love with her when he met her at the age of nine.<ref>Current evidence suggests that she was ten when they met, but Ruskin states in his autobiography that she was only nine. Hewison, R, John Ruskin, ''The Argument of the Eye'', p.160; [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,6121,132930,00.html#article_continue The Guardian, review of Batchelor, J., John Ruskin: ''No Wealth but Life'', 2000]</ref> In fact, he did not approach her as a suitor until on or near her eighteenth birthday. She asked him to wait for her until she was 21. Receiving no answer, he repeated his proposal. Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose's spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time.<ref>Hilton, T. ''John Ruskin: The Later Years'', p. 553, \"absolutely under her [Rose's] orders I have asked Tenny Watson to marry me and come abroad with her father.\"</ref> It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to [[Kate Greenaway]] he asked her to draw her \"girlies\" (as he called her child figures) without clothing:\n\n<blockquote>\nWill you – (it’s all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills?  And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.<ref>Lurie, Alison ''Don't Tell the Grown-Ups: The Subversive Power of Children's Literature''</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they’re not in love with anybody but me.—I’ve got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3362/is_4_86/ai_n31641126/ \" Ruskin on his sexuality: a lost source\"] ''Philological Quarterly'', Fall, 2007 by Van Akin Burd</ref><ref>Pigwiggina is a nickname Ruskin used for the girl as she looked after (lambs and) piglets; c.f. {{cite book |title=Letters to M.

Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, boldly asserts that Ruskin \"was a paedophile\" but leaves the claim unexplained, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin's behaviour does not \"fit the profile\".<ref>Hilton, T., ''John Ruskin: A Life'', vol. 1, pp. 253–4; Batchelor, J, ''John Ruskin: No Wealth but Life'', p. 202.</ref> Abse concluded that \"the older girls became, the more their attractions diminished in his eyes.

According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was (supposedly in common with his contemporary, [[Lewis Carroll]]) their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully developed sexual beings is what attracted him.<ref>''John Ruskin. The Last Visionary'', tx. 13 March 2000 (BBC1).</ref>\n\n===Supposed authorship of common law of business balance===\nRuskin is frequently identified as the originator of the \"[[common law of business balance]]\"—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarized as:  \"The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot.\" This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin's authorship is disputed.

XII, \"Of the Paethetic Fallacy\") see ''Works'' 5.201–220.</ref>\n* [[Fors Clavigera]]: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote \"to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain\" (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers which go to fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: ''Force'', symbolised by the club (''clava'') of [[Hercules]]; ''For''titude, symbolised by the key (''clavis'') of Ulysses; and ''For''tune, symbolised by the nail (''clavus'') of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. These three powers (the \"fors\") together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from [[Shakespeare]]'s phrase \"There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune\" (Brutus in ''Julius Caesar''). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.<ref>See ''Works'' 27.27–44 and 28.106-7.</ref><ref>For a full and concise introduction to the work, see Dinah Birch, \"Introduction\", in John Ruskin, ''Fors Clavigera'', ed. Dinah Birch (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), pp. xxxiii–xlix.</ref>\n* Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world.<ref>[http://fortnightlyreview.co.uk/2011/04/ruskin-crown/ Ruskin and the distinction between Aesthesis and Theoria], in The [[Fortnightly Review]].</ref> For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see [[Peter Fuller]].<ref>Peter Fuller, ''Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace'' (Chatto and Windus, 1988).</ref>\n* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to ''the unfortunate persistence of the clergy in teaching children what they cannot understand, and in employing young consecrate persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.''\n* [[Illth]]: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is ‘well-being’, illth is \"ill-being\".\n* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an \"excrescence\" as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonize well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain [[gothic revival|Gothic Revival]] features<ref>{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 210}}</ref> also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Seven Lamps of Architecture|author = Ruskin, John|publisher = Dover Publications|year = 1989|page = 396}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional portrayals==\n* Ruskin figures as Mr Herbert in ''[[The New Republic (novel)|The New Republic]]'' (1878), a novel by one of his Oxford undergraduates, [[William Hurrell Mallock|William Mallock]] (1849–1923).\n* ''The Love of John Ruskin'' (1912) a [[Silent film|silent movie]] about Ruskin, Effie and Millais.<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0226096/ ''The Love of John Ruskin'' in [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]].]</ref>\n* [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''False Dawn'' novella, the first in the 1924 Old New York series has the protagonist meet John Ruskin.\n* Ruskin was the inspiration for the Drawling Master in [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]\n* ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) Ken Russell's biopic for television of Rossetti, in which Ruskin is played by Clive Goodwin\n* ''[[The Love School]]'' (1975) a [[BBC Television|BBC TV]] series about the Pre-Raphaelites, starring [[David Collings]] (Ruskin), Anne Kidd (Effie), [[Peter Egan]] (Millais).\n* {{cite book |last=McDonald |first=Eva |year=1979 |title=John Ruskin's Wife |publisher=Chivers |isbn=978-0745113005 }}  A novel about the marriage of John Ruskin.\n*''Dear Countess'' (1983) a radio play by [[Elizabeth Morgan (actress)|Elizabeth Morgan]], with [[Derek Jacobi]] (Ruskin), Bridget McCann (Gray), [[Timothy West]] (Old Mr Ruskin) [[Michael Fenner]] (Millais).
