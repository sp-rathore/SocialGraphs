In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.<ref name=\"Gallery\"/><ref name=\"calicut\"/>\n\nThe countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: \"I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong\".) Her favourite Bible verse, 'Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.\n\nRussell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.<ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}</ref> He was educated at home by a series of tutors.<ref name=\"nobel prize\">The Nobel Foundation (1950).

The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the [[Formulario mathematico]]. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=6: Principia Mathemtica|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}</ref>\n\nIn 1905 he wrote the essay \"[[On Denoting]]\", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.

This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.\n\nIn 1910 he became a lecturer in the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.<ref name=\"Wittgenstein\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm|title=Russell on Wittgenstein|publisher=Rbjones.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of the [[First World War]].

H. Hardy on the Trinity Controversy and Russell's personal life===\nIn 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity''—published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]]—in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.\n\nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an 'unusual application' and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the 'world of learning' knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H. Hardy|pages=57–8|year=1970}}</ref> In the preface to this pamphlet, Hardy wrote:\n\n{{quotation|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet...I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it.

On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia (\"Peter\") Spence]], who had been his children's governess since 1930.

He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare, \"Relative Political Pacifism\": War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.<ref>Russell, Bertrand, \"The Future of Pacifism\", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13</ref><ref>{{cite book|quote=I found the Nazis utterly revolting – cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him \"morally unfit\" to teach at the college due to his opinions—notably those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929).

By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.<ref name=\"letters\">{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|author=Griffin, Nicholas (ed.)|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26012-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=512|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}</ref> ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on [[Dialectical Materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', saying, \"I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense – Marx´s claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]´s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.\"<ref>Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, July–August 1942, p. 52</ref> \nIn 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: \"I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to [[Jews]] to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture\".<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html Bertrand Russell on Zionism]</ref>\n\nIn a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582|work=The Economist|title=A philosopher's letters&nbsp;– Love, Bertie | date=21 July 2001}}</ref> At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in [[Eastern Europe]] which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"letters\" />\nHowever, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the USA possessed them and before the USSR did. After the USSR carried out [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union|its nuclear bomb tests]], Russell changed his position and advocated for the total abolition of atomic weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bertrand-Russell-Ronald-William-Clark/dp/0394490592/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=undefined&sr=1-3&keywords=clark+life+bertrand+russell|title=The life of Bertrand Russell: Ronald William Clark: 9780394490595: Amazon.com: Books|work=amazon.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural [[Reith Lectures]]<ref>{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC.

Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.<ref>T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).</ref>\n\nIn the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38628|supp=yes|startpage=2796|date=3 June 1949|accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref> and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=\"Gallery\"/><ref name=\"nobel prize\"/> When he was given the Order of Merit, [[George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, \"You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted\".<ref>Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p. 94. (1981) ISBN 0-500-13070-1</ref> Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply \"That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]\" immediately came to mind.  In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).\n\nRussell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora. John's wife Susan was also mentally ill, and eventually Russell and Edith became the legal guardians of their three daughters, one of whom was later diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]].{{Citation needed|reason= in the article on Bertrand's son, John, it is stated that there were only two daughters|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London, for \"breach of peace\".

Kennedy assassination|assassination]], Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a ''Who Killed Kennedy Committee'' in June 1964, members of which included [[Michael Foot]] MP, [[Caroline Benn]], the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], the writers [[John Arden]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], and the Oxford history professor [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]. Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the [[Warren Commission]] Report was published, setting forth ''16 Questions on the Assassination'' and equating the Oswald case with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.<ref>Peter Knight, ''The Kennedy Assassination'', Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p. 77.

The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.<ref name=\"Manifesto\">{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|author2=[[Albert Einstein]] |date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008}}</ref> In 1966–67, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam.  He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.\n\nIn 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to what he viewed as European imperialism in the [[Middle East]]. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of what he saw as a pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.<ref>''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)</ref>\n\nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.<ref name=ref1>''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212–213)</ref>\n\nRussell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He suggested that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in [[Central Europe]], consisting at the minimum of Germany, [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard [[Israel]]'s frontiers to ensure that Israel was protected from aggression and prevented from committing it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].<ref name=ref1/>\n\nHe was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.<ref name=\"jerusalem prize\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref> In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to [[Israel]] and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref> In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Gallery\"/>\n\n===Final years and death===\n[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]]]]\nRussell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film ''Aman'' which was released in India in 1967.

The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the [[United Nations]] to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the [[United States]] in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].\n\nOn 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning \"[[Israel]]'s aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.<ref name='Last Message'>[http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm Bertrand Russell's Last Message].</ref>\n\nRussell died of [[influenza]] on 2 February 1970 at his home, [[Plas Penrhyn]], in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], [[Merionethshire]], Wales.

He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".<ref>Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p. 88, quoting a private letter from Russell.</ref>\n\nOn ethics, Russell considered himself a [[utilitarian]].<ref>''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p. 39 (\"It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise.

On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist...\"</ref> For most of his adult life, Russell maintained that religion is little more than [[superstition]] and, despite any positive effects that religion might have, it is largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and are responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.<ref>'Humanist News', March 1970</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{Main article|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}\nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life.
