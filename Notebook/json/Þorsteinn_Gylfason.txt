Þorsteinn distinguished himself in Icelandic public life with his writings in newspapers, journals and publications.\n\n== His life and accomplishments ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nÞorsteinn was born and raised in [[Reykjavík]], the capital of Iceland. His parents were Guðrún Vilmundardóttir and [[Gylfi Þorsteinsson Gíslason]], a university professor and government minister. He was the brother of [[Vilmundur Gylfason]], a politician, and [[Þorvaldur Gylfason]], an economist.\n\nÞorsteinn graduated from the [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík]] gymnasium in 1961 and subsequently received a grant to study at [[Harvard University]]. He left Harvard with a B.A. degree in [[philosophy]], having studied under the tutelage of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. He returned home for graduate studies in Icelandic, and later attended the University of Munich and Magdalen College, Oxford from 1965 to 1971. At Oxford, he studied under [[Gilbert Ryle]] and befriended well-known characters from philosophical circles, such as [[Alfred Jules Ayer]]. This influence affected his work in philosophy to a considerable extent.\n\n=== Career ===\nÞorsteinn worked as an assistant professor at the [[University of Iceland]] from 1971, and was made full professor in 1989. He was visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[London School of Economics]].\n\nÞorsteinn received a number of awards and acknowledgements for his works, amongst them the [[Þórbergur Þórðarson]] and National Icelandic Literature Prizes in 1997. In 1994, he was awarded the [[Knights Cross of the Icelandic Falcon]] by Icelandic president [[Vigdís Finnbogadóttir]] for his contributions to Icelandic culture and academia.\n\n=== Works ===\nÞorsteinn wrote 12 books on philosophy and philology, including ''An Essay on Man'' (1970), ''An Essay on the World'' (1992), ''Thinking in Icelandic'' (1996) and ''Justice and Injustice'' (1998). He also published over 37 academic papers in various philosophical journals and composed poetry and lyrics, either with musical composer [[Atli Heimir Sveinsson]] or to the music of [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Richard Wagner]].\n\nHis translations to Icelandic included ''[[On Liberty]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s ''Repetitions'', [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', [[Descartes]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', all of whom were published by the [[Icelandic Literature Society]], for which he served as a series chief editor for almost two decades.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nÞorsteinn's philosophical work was mostly in the philosophy of language and mind and political philosophy. His method and style of philosophy was very much rooted in the [[analytic tradition]], through influence from men such as [[W.V.O. Quine]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]]. He also found inspiration in the continental philosophers, especially from [[existentialism]] in the style of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], whose works he translated into Icelandic. Later on, his focus was on contemporary work by [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[John Rawls]], [[Philippa Foot]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[Richard Rorty]].\n\nÞorsteinn's early works (''An Essay on Man'' in particular) are in the style of 20th century [[logical positivism]]—highly suspicious of esoteric Hegelian metaphysics. He later turned away from comprehensive theories to focus on specific problems. He considered himself an analytic philosopher insofar as \"the ideas that have proven to be the most fruitful and inspiring, have been those of scholars generally considered to be 'analytic philosophers'. He usually said he was not much of a utilitarian neither in personal thinking nor politics and favoured deontology and virtue ethics.\n\nHis final words when describing himself as a philosopher were: \"I believe that no philosophical theory can avoid paying the utmost heed to the natural sciences.\"\n\n=== Death ===\nÞorsteinn was diagnosed with terminal cancer of the stomach on 12 August 2005 and died four days later. His funeral took place in [[Reykjavík Cathedral]].\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''Tilraun um manninn'' [An Essay on Man], Reykjavík 1970.\n* ''Þrætubókarkorn'' [Dialectic] (with P.T.
