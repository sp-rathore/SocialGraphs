He corresponded with [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], and took a close interest in the paradoxes related to [[Russell's paradox]], formulating the [[card paradox]] version of the [[liar paradox]].<ref name=turn>[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Jourdain.html Turnbull archive] accessed 7 December 2007</ref> He corresponded with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], meeting with him in Cambridge to discuss Frege's book [[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]], of parts of which Jourdain had prepared a translation. He also worked on [[algebraic logic]], and the history of science with [[Isaac Newton]] as a particular study. He was London editor for ''[[The Monist]]''. Near the end of his life he became increasingly obsessed by trying to prove the [[axiom of choice]], and published several incorrect proofs of it. \n\nHis sister [[Eleanor Jourdain]] was an English academic and author.\n\n==Works==\nThe following works of Philip Jourdain are available from [[Internet Archive]]:\n* 1908: [https://archive.org/details/jstor-27900104 Some Points in the Foundation of Mathematical Physics] in [[The Monist]] v 18\n* 1911: [https://archive.org/details/jstor-27900347 Some Modern Advances in Logic] in ''The Monist'' v 21\n* 1913: [https://archive.org/details/thenatureofmath00jouruoft The Nature of Mathematics]\n* 1913: [https://archive.org/details/jstor-27900429 The Nature  and Validity of the Principle of Least Action] in ''The Monist'' v 23\n* 1914: [https://archive.org/details/jstor-27900477 The Economy of Thought] in ''The Monist'' v 24\n* 1918: [https://archive.org/details/philosophyrussel00jouruoft The Philosophy of B*rtr*nd R*ss*ll with an appendix of leading passages from certain other works]\n* 1919: [https://archive.org/details/jstor-27900767 Indefinables and Indemonstrables in Mathematics and Theology] in ''The Monist'' v 29\nJordain acted as editor for\n*1914:  [[Augustus De Morgan]]:  [https://archive.org/details/cu31924012316901 Essays on the Life and Work of Newton]\nJourdain made the following translations:\n* 1911: [[Ernst Mach]] [https://archive.org/details/historyandrootp00machgoog History and Root of the Principle of Conservation of Energy]\n* 1915: Ernst Mach [https://archive.org/details/scienceofmechani00machrich The Science of Mechanics]\n* 1915: [[Georg Cantor]] [https://archive.org/details/contributionstof00cantrich Contributions to the Foundation of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (1977) ''Dear Russell—Dear Jourdain: a Commentary on Russell's Logic, Based on His Correspondence with Philip Jourdain''.
