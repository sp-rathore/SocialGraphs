Educated there and at the [[University of Jena]], he became a ''[[privatdozent]]'' at [[Jena]] in 1802. In 1805 he became professor of [[classical literature]] in the [[University of Landshut]], where he remained until 1826, when it was transferred to [[Munich]]. He lived there until his death in 1841. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn recognition of his work, the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences]] made him a member and aulic councillor. He is known principally for his work during the last twenty-five years of his life on the dialogues of [[Plato]]. His ''Plato's Leben and Schriften'' (1816)—which originated in the ''Introductions'' of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and the historical scepticism of [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Niebuhr]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf|Wolf]]—was the first of those critical inquiries into the life and works of Plato.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDistrusting tradition, he took a few of the finest dialogues as his standard, and from internal evidence denounced as spurious not only those  generally admitted to be so (''[[Epinomis]], [[Minos]], [[Theages]], [[Rival Lovers|Rivales]], [[Clitophon (dialogue)|Clitophon]], [[Hipparchus (dialogue)|Hipparchus]], [[Eryxias]]'', ''Letters and Definitions''), but also the ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]], [[Euthydemus (dialogue)|Euthydemus]], [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]], [[Lysis (dialogue)|Lysis]], [[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'', ''First'' and ''Second Alcibiades'', ''[[Hippias Major]]'' and ''Minor'', ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]], [[Euthyphro]], [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]], [[Crito]]'', and even (against [[Aristotle]]'s explicit assertion) ''[[Laws (dialogue)|The Laws]]''. The genuine dialogues he divides into three series:\n\n# the earliest, marked chiefly by the poetical and dramatic element, i.e. ''Protagoras, Phaedrus, Gorgias, Phaedo'';\n# the second, marked by [[dialectic]] subtlety, i.e. ''Theaetetus, Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides, Cratylus''; and\n# the third group, combining both qualities harmoniously, i.e., the ''Philebus, Symposium, Republic, Timaeus, Critias''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe work was followed by a complete edition of Plato's works (2 vols., 1819–1832) with a [[Latin language|Latin]] translation and commentary. His last work was the ''Lexicon Platonicum ''(3 vols., 1834–1839), which is both valuable and comprehensive. In his works on [[aesthetics]] he combined the views of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]] with those of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], [[Schiller]] and others. His histories of philosophy are marked more by critical scholarship than by originality of thought, though they are interesting as asserting the now familiar principle that the [[history of philosophy]] is not the history of opinions, but of [[reason]] as a whole; he was among the first to attempt to formulate a principle of the development of [[thought]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBeside his works on Plato, he wrote, on aesthetics, ''System der Kunstlehre'' (1805) and ''Grundriß der Aesthetik''<!--[sic]--> (1807); on the history of philosophy, ''Grundlinien der Philosophie'' (1807, republished 1809, but soon forgotten), ''Grundriß einer Geschichte der Philosophie'' (1807 and 1825), and ''Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie'' (1829); in philology, ''Grundlinien der Philologie'' (1808), and ''Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik und Kritik'' (1808).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hermeneutics]]<ref name=\"Hermen\">Friedrich Schleiermacher, \"Ueber<!--[sic]--> den Begriff der Hermeneutik mit Bezug auf F.
