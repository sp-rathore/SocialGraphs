Philosophically, Wittgenstein's thought shows fundamental alignment with religious discourse.<ref>Bruce R. Ashford, \"Wittgenstein's Theologians: A Survey of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Impact on Theology\"</ref> For example, Wittgenstein would become one of the century's fiercest critics of [[Scientism]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Monk|first1=Ray|title=Wittgenstein's Forgotten Lesson|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/regulars/ray-monk-wittgenstein|accessdate=24 August 2014|work=Prospect Magazine|issue=July 1999|publisher=Prospect Magazine|date=20 July 1999}}</ref>\n\nWith age, his deepening Christianity led to many religious elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, the temptation to think of God's existence as a matter of scientific evidence.<ref>Ludwig Wittgenstein, \"Lectures on Religious Belief\"</ref> In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, \"I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rush Rhees, \"Ludwig Wittgenstein: Personal Recollections\"</ref> In Wittgenstein's ''Culture and Value'', it is found, \"Is what I am doing [my work in philosophy] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above.\" His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, \"Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers.\"<ref>Norman Malcolm, \"Wittgenstein: A Religious Point of View\"</ref> At last, Wittgenstein writes, \"Bach wrote on the title page of his ''Orgelbuechlein'', ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’  That is what I would have liked to say about my work.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Influence of Otto Weininger===\n[[File:OttoWeiningerspring1903.jpg|thumb|upright|Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]] (1880–1903)]]\nWhile a student at the ''Realschule'', Wittgenstein was influenced by Austrian philosopher [[Otto Weininger]]'s 1903 book ''Geschlecht und Charakter'' (''[[Sex and Character]]'').\nWeininger (1880–1903), who was also Jewish, argued that the concepts male and female exist only as [[Platonic realism|Platonic forms]], and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only at the level of their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book.<ref name=Monk19>Monk, pp. 19–26.</ref> Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong that was interesting.<ref>p216, Philosophical Tales, Cohen, M., Blackwell 2008</ref>\n\n===Jewish background and Hitler===\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Austria}}\nThere is much debate about the extent to which Wittgenstein and his siblings, who were of 3/4 Jewish descent, saw themselves as Jews.

Popper's paper was ''Are there philosophical problems?'', in which he struck up a position against Wittgenstein's, contending that problems in philosophy are real, not just linguistic puzzles as Wittgenstein argued. Accounts vary as to what happened next, but Wittgenstein apparently started waving a hot poker, demanding that Popper give him an example of a moral rule. Popper offered one—\"Not to threaten visiting speakers with pokers\"—at which point Russell told Wittgenstein he had misunderstood and Wittgenstein left. Popper maintained that Wittgenstein 'stormed out', but it had become accepted practice for him to leave early (because of his aforementioned ability to dominate discussion).

He subsequently spent nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp.\n\nHe returned to his family in Vienna on 25 August 1919, by all accounts physically and mentally spent. He apparently talked incessantly about suicide, terrifying his sisters and brother Paul. He decided to do two things: to enroll in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher, and to get rid of his fortune. In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]. He divided it among his siblings, except for Margarete, insisting that it not be held in trust for him. His family saw him as ill, and acquiesced.<ref name=Bartley33/>\n\n==1920–1928: Teaching, the ''Tractatus'', Haus Wittgenstein==\n\n===Teacher training in Vienna===\nIn September 1919 he enrolled in the ''Lehrerbildungsanstalt'' (teacher training college) in the ''Kundmanngasse'' in Vienna. His sister Hermine said that Wittgenstein working as an elementary teacher was like using a precision instrument to open crates, but the family decided not to interfere.<ref name=Monk169>Monk, p. 169ff.</ref> [[Thomas Bernhard]], more critically, wrote of this period in Wittgenstein's life: \"the multi-millionaire as a village schoolmaster is surely a piece of perversity.\"<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 68.</ref>\n\n===Teaching posts in Austria===\nIn the summer of 1920, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener for a monastery. At first he applied, under a false name, for a teaching post at Reichenau, was awarded the job, but he declined it when his identity was discovered. As a teacher, he wished to no longer be recognized as a member of the famous Wittgenstein family. In response, his brother Paul wrote: <blockquote>\"It is out of the question, really completely out of the question, that anybody bearing our name and whose elegant and gentle upbringing can be seen a thousand paces off, would not be identified as a member of our family... That one can neither simulate nor dissimulate anything including a refined education I need hardly tell you.\"<ref>Waugh, p. 150</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1920, Wittgenstein was given his first job as a primary school teacher in [[Trattenbach]], under his real name, in a remote village of a few hundred people. His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: \"I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness. I know that human beings on the average are not worth much anywhere, but here they are much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere.\"<ref>Klagge, James Carl. ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy''. Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 185.</ref> He was soon the object of gossip among the villagers, who found him eccentric at best. He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students \"literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations.\"<ref>[[Norman Malcolm|Malcolm, Norman]].

The first two hours of each day were devoted to mathematics, hours that Monk writes some of the pupils recalled years later with horror.<ref>Monk, p. 195.</ref> They reported that he caned the boys and boxed their ears, and also that he pulled the girls' hair;<ref name=Bartley107>Bartley, p. 107.</ref> This was not unusual at the time for boys, but for the villagers he went too far in doing it to the girls too; girls were not expected to understand algebra, much less have their ears boxed over it. The violence apart, Monk writes that he quickly became a village legend, shouting \"''Krautsalat!''\" (\"coleslaw\" - i.e. shredded cabbage) when the headmaster played the piano, and \"Nonsense!\" when a priest was answering children's questions.<ref>Monk, pp. 196, 198.</ref>\n\n===Publication of the ''Tractatus''===\n{{rquote|right|''The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena.''\n''Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages.

Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy.<ref>For the introduction, see Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.kfs.org/~jonathan/witt/aintro.html Introduction], ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'', May 1922.</ref> In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote \"The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]s—i.e. by language—(and, which comes to the same thing, what can be ''thought'') and what can not be expressed by pro[position]s, but only shown (gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of philosophy.\"<ref>Russell, Nieli. ''Wittgenstein: From Mysticism to Ordinary Language''. SUNY Press, 1987, p. 199.</ref> But Wittgenstein was not happy with Russell's help. He had lost faith in Russell, finding him glib and his philosophy mechanistic, and felt he had fundamentally misunderstood the ''Tractatus''.<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 35ff.</ref>\n\nAn English translation was prepared in Cambridge by [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]], a mathematics undergraduate at King's commissioned by [[C. K. Ogden]]. It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.'' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason. Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation.<ref name=\"archiveTractatus\"/> This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways. Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness.<ref>For example, Ramsey translated \"''Sachverhalt''\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as \"atomic fact\" and \"state of affairs\" respectively. But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent \"''Sachverhalten''\", and there cannot be a non-existent fact. Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating \"''Sachverhalt''\" as \"state of affairs\" and \"''Sachlage''\" as ''situation''. The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness.

Wittgenstein argues that language has an underlying logical structure, a structure that provides the limits of what can be said meaningfully. The limits of language, for Wittgenstein, are the limits of philosophy. Much of philosophy involves attempts to say the unsayable: \"What we can say at all can be said clearly,\" he argues. Anything beyond that—religion, ethics, aesthetics, the mystical—cannot be discussed. They are not in themselves nonsensical, but any statement about them must be.<ref name=Grayling16>Grayling, A. C.

In November he began work at another primary school, this time in [[Puchberg am Schneeberg|Puchberg]] in the [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]] mountains. There, he told Russell, the villagers were \"one-quarter animal and three-quarters human.\"\n\n[[Frank P.

While he was there, he wrote a 42-page pronunciation and spelling dictionary for the children, ''Wörterbuch für Volksschulen'', published in Vienna in 1926 by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, the only book of his apart from the ''Tractatus'' that was published in his lifetime.<ref name=\"archiveTractatus\">[http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html \"Ludwig Wittgenstein: Tractatus and Teaching\"] {{wayback|url=http://www.wittgen-cam.ac.uk/biogre6.html |date=20100213064904 |df=y }}, Cambridge Wittgenstein archive.

Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid. He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse. Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out. Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled.<ref name=Monk225>Monk, pp. 224, 232–233.</ref> Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: \"I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!\"<ref name=Monk225/>\n\nPiribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over.<ref name=Monk225/> Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of [[leukaemia]].<ref>Waugh, p. 162. Monk, p. 232.</ref>\n\nTen years later, in 1936, as part of a series of \"confessions\" he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit. He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a \"Ja, ja,\" though other former students were more hospitable. Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not \"to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle it—to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought.\" Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, \"This brought me into more settled waters... and to greater seriousness.\"<ref>Monk, pp. 370–371.</ref>\n\n===The Vienna Circle===\n{{See also|Vienna Circle}}\nThe ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame. In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''.<ref name=Monk212/> While it is commonly assumed that Wittgenstein was a part of the Vienna Circle, in reality, this was not actually the case. German philosopher [[Oswald Hanfling]] writes bluntly: \"Wittgenstein was never a member of the Circle, though he was in Vienna during much of the time. Yet his influence on the Circle's thought was at least as important as that of any of its members.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Essential Readings in Logical Positivism|last = Hanfling|first = Oswald |author-link=Oswald Hanfling |publisher = Basil Blackwell|year = 1981|isbn = 0-631-12566-3|location = Oxford|pages = 3}}</ref> From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions. However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired. For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud.<ref>[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/09/07/the-limits-of-science-and-scientists/ The Limits of Science—and Scientists]</ref>  In his autobiography, [[Rudolf Carnap]] describes Wittgenstein as the thinker who gave him the greatest inspiration. However, he also wrote that \"there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself. Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems.\" As for Wittgenstein:\n{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer... When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answers came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of art or a divine revelation ... the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as through divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.<ref>Rudolf Carnap, ''Autobiography'', in P.A.

His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''. Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that \"This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty.\"<ref name=\"Jeffries\">Jeffries, Stuart.

Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150&nbsp;kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of ''The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein'', said there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \"It is as ingenious as it is expensive.

Russell noted that his previous residency was sufficient to fulfill eligibility requirements for a PhD, and urged him to offer the ''Tractatus'' as his thesis. It was examined in 1929 by Russell and Moore; at the end of the thesis defence, Wittgenstein clapped the two examiners on the shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it.\"<ref>Monk, p. 271.</ref> Moore wrote in the examiner's report: \"I myself consider that this is a work of genius; but, even if I am completely mistaken and it is nothing of the sort, it is well above the standard required for the Ph.D. degree.\"<ref>R.

In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of \"confessions\" to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself. In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it. The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Éamon de Valera]], himself a mathematics teacher. De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to an academy for advanced mathematics.\n\nWhile he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews. The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two. It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work.<ref name=Waugh137>Waugh, pp. 137ff, 204–209.</ref>\n\nAfter the Anschluss, his brother Paul left almost immediately for England, and later the US. The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later. Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement). He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him. He left so suddenly and quietly that for a time people believed he was the fourth Wittgenstein brother to have committed suicide.<ref>Waugh, pp. 224–226.</ref>\n\nWittgenstein began to investigate acquiring British or Irish citizenship with the help of Keynes, and apparently had to confess to his friends in England that he had earlier misrepresented himself to them as having just one Jewish grandparent, when in fact he had three.<ref>For the view that Wittgenstein saw himself as a Jew, see Stern, David.

Gretl, an American citizen by marriage, started the negotiations over the racial status of their grandfather, and the family's large foreign currency reserves were used as a bargaining tool. Paul had escaped to Switzerland and then the US in July 1938, and disagreed with the negotiations, leading to a permanent split between the siblings. After the war, when Paul was performing in Vienna, he did not visit Hermine who was dying there, and he had no further contact with Ludwig or Gretl.<ref name=Gottlieb/>\n\n===Professor of philosophy===\nAfter G. E. Moore resigned the chair in philosophy in 1939, Wittgenstein was elected, and acquired British citizenship soon afterwards. In July 1939 he travelled to Vienna to assist Gretl and his other sisters, visiting Berlin for one day to meet an official of the Reichsbank. After this, he travelled to New York to persuade Paul, whose agreement was required, to back the scheme. The required Befreiung was granted in August 1939. The unknown amount signed over to the Nazis by the Wittgenstein family, a week or so before the outbreak of war, included amongst many other assets, 1700&nbsp;kg of gold.<ref>Edmonds, Eidinow 2001, p. 98.</ref> There is a report Wittgenstein visited Moscow a second time in 1939, travelling from Berlin, and again met the philosopher [[Sofya Yanovskaya|Sophia Janowskaya]].<ref>Moran, John. \"Wittgenstein and Russia\" ''New Left Review'' 73, May–June 1972, pp. 83–96.</ref>\n\nNorman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|\"At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark. He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me. I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'. I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' – perhaps about 35. (His actual age was 49.) His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair. I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him. After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts. His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing... Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation. He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions. His voice was resonant... His words came out, not fluently, but with great force. Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person. His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked. His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression. His whole personality was commanding, even imperial.\"<ref>Malcolm, pp. 23–4.</ref>}}\n\nDescribing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|\"It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them. For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings... Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue. Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks. There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others. During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active. His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern. One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect... Wittgenstein was a frightening person at these classes.\"<ref>Malcolm, p. 25.</ref>}}\n\nAfter work, the philosopher would often relax by watching [[Western Movie|Western]]s, where he preferred to sit at the very front of the cinema, or reading detective stories especially the ones written by [[Norbert Davis]].<ref>Monk, p. 528</ref><ref>Hoffmann, Josef.

In his early 20s, Wittgenstein had thought logic could provide a solid foundation, and he had even considered updating Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered. He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]] who described Wittgenstein as \"a ''very'' peculiar man\". The two had many discussions about the relationship between computational logic and everyday notions of truth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Alan Turing: The Enigma|last = Hodges|first = Andrew|publisher = Vintage|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-784-70008-9|location = London|pages = 194}}</ref><ref>Diamond, Cora (ed.).

University Of Chicago Press, 1989.</ref>\n\n===World War II and Guy's Hospital===\nMonk writes that Wittgenstein found it intolerable that a war was going on and he was teaching philosophy. He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers.<ref>For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p. 28</ref>\n\nIn September 1941 he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London. John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]. Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly. He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wards—where he apparently advised the patients not to take them.<ref name=Monk431/>\n\nThe hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. \"Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!\" Wittgenstein begged one of them.<ref>Monk, p. 432.</ref> Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: \"I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless.\"<ref name=Monk431>Monk, p. 431ff.</ref>\n\nHe had developed a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of [[Francis Skinner]], the mathematics undergraduate he had had a relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a [[City and Guilds]] exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: \"For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A ''tragic'' thought!\"<ref name=Monk443/> Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.<ref name=Monk443>Monk, pp. 442–443.</ref>\n\nWhile Wittgenstein was at Guy's he met Basil Reeve, a young doctor with an interest in philosophy, who, with R. T. Grant, was studying the effect of shock on air-raid casualties. When the blitz ended there were fewer casualties to study. In November 1942, Grant and Reeve moved to the [[Royal Victoria Infirmary]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to study road traffic and industrial casualties. Grant offered Wittgenstein a position as a laboratory assistant at a wage of £4 per week, and he lived in Newcastle (at 28 Brandling Park, [[Jesmond]]<ref name=\"Schardt\">[http://www.newphilsoc.org.uk/OldWeb1/Wittgenstein/wittgenstein_upon_tyne.htm Wittgenstein Upon Tyne] Bill Schardt , Newcastle Philosophical Society.

Seeking solitude he moved to ''Rosro'', a holiday cottage in [[Connemara]] owned by Maurice O'Connor-Drury.<ref name=archivefinalyears/>{{dead link|date=May 2015}}\n\nHe also accepted an invitation from [[Norman Malcolm]], then professor at Cornell University, to stay with him and his wife for several months at [[Ithaca, New York]]. He made the trip in April 1949, although he told Malcolm he was too unwell to do philosophical work: \"I haven't done any work since the beginning of March & I haven't had the strength of even trying to do any.\" A doctor in Dublin had diagnosed anaemia and prescribed iron and liver pills. The details of Wittgenstein's stay in America are recounted in Norman Malcolm's ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir''. During his summer in America, Wittgenstein began his epistemological discussions, in particular his engagement with [[philosophical skepticism]], that would eventually become the final fragments ''[[On Certainty]]''.\n[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein Blue Plaque, 76 Storey's Way, Cambridge, UK.jpg|thumb|The plaque at \"Storey's End\", 76 [[Storey's Way]], Cambridge, where Wittgenstein died.]]\nHe returned to London, where he was diagnosed with an inoperable [[prostate cancer]], which had spread to his bone marrow. He spent the next two months in Vienna, where his sister Hermine died on 11 February 1950; he went to see her every day, but she was hardly able to speak or recognize him. \"Great loss for me and all of us,\" he wrote. \"Greater than I would have thought.\" He moved around a lot after Hermine's death staying with various friends: to Cambridge in April 1950, where he stayed with [[Georg Henrik von Wright|G. H. von Wright]]; to London to stay with [[Rush Rhees]]; then to Oxford to see [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], writing to Norman Malcolm that he was hardly doing any philosophy. He went to Norway in August with Ben Richards, then returned to Cambridge, where on 27 November he moved into ''Storey's End'' at 76 [[Storey's Way]], the home of his doctor, [[Edward Vaughan Bevan|Edward Bevan]], and his wife Joan; he had told them he did not want to die in a hospital, so they said he could spend his last days in their home instead.

He wrote a new will in Oxford on 29 January, naming Rhees as his executor, and Anscombe and von Wright his literary administrators, and wrote to Norman Malcolm that month to say, \"My mind's completely dead. This isn't a complaint, for I don't really suffer from it. I know that life must have an end once and that mental life can cease before the rest does.\"<ref>Malcolm, p. 79ff.</ref> In February he returned to the Bevans' home to work on MS 175 and MS 176.

It was his 62nd birthday on 26 April. He went for a walk the next afternoon, and wrote his last entry that day, 27 April. That evening, he became very ill; when his doctor told him he might live only a few days, he reportedly replied, \"Good!\" Joan stayed with him throughout that night, and just before losing consciousness for the last time on 28 April, he told her: \"Tell them I've had a wonderful life.\" Norman Malcolm describes this as a \"...strangely moving utterance.\"<ref name=Malcolm80/>\n\nFour of Wittgenstein's former students arrived at his bedside—Ben Richards, [[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Yorick Smythies]], and [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]]. Anscombe and Smythies were Catholics; and, at the latter's request, a Dominican friar, Father [[Conrad Pepler]], also attended. They were at first unsure what Wittgenstein would have wanted, but then remembered he had said he hoped his Catholic friends would pray for him, so they did, and he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.\n\nWittgenstein was given a Catholic burial at [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge.<ref>A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. [[Mark Goldie]], pages 62 and 63 (2009)</ref> Drury later said he had been troubled ever since about whether that was the right thing to do.<ref name=Monk576>Monk, pp. 576–580.</ref> In 2015 the ledger gravestone was refurbished by the British Wittgenstein Society.<ref>[http://www.britishwittgensteinsociety.org/wittgensteins-grave]</ref>\n\nOn his religious views, Wittgenstein was said to be greatly interested in [[Catholicism]] and was sympathetic to it.

According to [[Norman Malcolm]], Wittgenstein saw Catholicism as more of a way of life than as a set of beliefs he personally held, considering that he did not accept any religious faith.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir|authors=Norman Malcolm; G.

But I think that there was in him, in some sense, the possibility of religion. I believe that he looked on religion as a 'form of life' (to use an expression from the Investigations) in which he did not participate, but with which he was sympathetic and which greatly interested him. Those who did participate he respected — although here as elsewhere he had contempt for insincerity. I suspect that he regarded religious belief as based on qualities of character and will that he himself did not possess. Of Smythies and Anscombe, both of whom had become Roman Catholics, he once said to me: 'I could not possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.'

Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher. The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees. Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function. He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called \"language gone on holiday.\"<ref>''PI'', §38.</ref>\n\nAccording to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed. He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all.<ref>''PI'', §107.</ref> Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the \"rough ground\" of ordinary language in use. Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: \"the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity. But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear.\"<ref>''PI'', §133.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWittgenstein left a voluminous archive of unpublished papers, including 83 manuscripts, 46 typescripts and 11 dictations, amounting to an estimated 20,000 pages.

While the ''Tractatus'', particularly in its conclusion, seems paradoxical and self-undermining, New Wittgenstein scholars advance a \"therapeutic\" understanding of Wittgenstein's work—\"an understanding of Wittgenstein as aspiring, not to advance metaphysical theories, but rather to help us work ourselves out of confusions we become entangled in when philosophizing.\"<ref>Alice Crary, ''The [[New Wittgenstein]]'', Routledge, 2007, p. 1</ref> To support this goal, the New Wittgenstein scholars propose a reading of the ''Tractatus'' as \"plain nonsense\"—arguing it does not attempt to convey a substantive philosophical project but instead simply tries to push the reader to abandon philosophical speculation. The therapeutic approach traces its roots to the philosophical work of [[John Wisdom]]<ref>{{Cite book|first=John|last=Wisdom|title=Philosophy and Psycho-Analysis|publisher=Blackwell|date=1953}}</ref> and the review of ''The Blue Book'' written by [[Oets Kolk Bouwsma]].<ref name=\"Glock\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouwsma|first1=O.

The adult Wittgenstein is played by the Welsh actor [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]].\n\nFilm director [[Ethan Coen]] wrote his 1979 senior dissertation, at [[Princeton University]], on \"Two Views of Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy\",<ref>[http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01h128nf78s University database with information on dissertation]</ref> which has led critics to attempt a reconstruction of Wittgenstein's influence on the narrative style of the Coen Brothers as filmic language-games.<ref>{{cite web |author=Eddie Brawley |title=\"The Big Lebowski\", Wittgenstein, and the Garbage Pile That Is Online Discourse |url=http://splitsider.com/2015/09/the-big-lebowski-wittgenstein-and-the-garbage-pile-that-is-online-discourse |date=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Philip Kerr]]'s '[[A Philosophical Investigation]]' employs Wittgensteinian themes in a crime novel; there is also a serial killer who thinks that he is the historical Wittgenstein.{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\nCritic [[Terry Eagleton]] has described Wittgenstein as the philosopher of poets and composers, playwrights and novelists.<ref>For ethical and religious themes, see Barrett, Cyril. ''Wittgenstein on Ethics and Religious Belief''. Blackwell, 1991, p. 138.</ref>\n*For Wittgenstein's philosophy as therapy, see: Peterman, James F. ''Philosophy as Therapy'', [[SUNY Press]], 1992, p.&nbsp;13,ff.\n*For the poetic and literary quality of his work, see: [[Marjorie Perloff|Perloff, Marjorie]] (1999), ''[[Wittgenstein's Ladder]]: Poetic Language and the Strangeness of the Ordinary'', [[University of Chicago Press]]; and Gibson, John and Wolfgang Huemer (eds.)

''The Eagleton Reader'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], 1997, pp.&nbsp;337,ff\n\nIn 1987 [[Bruce Duffy]] wrote an acclaimed biographical novel, about Wittgenstein, Moore and Russell, entitled ''The World as I Found It''.{{cn|date=September 2016}} \n\n[[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]]'s 1985 television series ''[[The Day the Universe Changed]]'' contains a story:<blockquote>Someone apparently went up to the great philosopher Wittgenstein and said \"What a lot of morons back in the Middle Ages must have been to have looked, every morning, at the dawn and to have thought what they were seeing was the Sun going around the Earth,\" when every school kid knows that the Earth goes around the Sun, to which Wittgenstein replied, \"Yeah, but I wonder what it would have looked like if the Sun had been going around the Earth?\"<ref>''[http://www.documentary-video.com/items.cfm?id=1303 The Day the Universe Changed]'' at Documentary-Video; distributed by Ambrose Video Publishing, Inc., New York, NY</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Wittgenstein's Mistress]]'' by [[David Markson]] is a highly stylized, experimental novel in the tradition of [[Samuel Beckett]]. Readers familiar with Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' will recognize stylistic similarities to that work. [[David Foster Wallace]] described it as \"pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country\" in an article for [[Salon (website)|Salon]] entitled \"Five direly underappreciated U.S. novels >1960.\" Wallace also wrote a long essay on the novel detailing its connections with Wittgenstein, entitled \"The Empty Plenum: David Markson’s Wittgenstein’s Mistress\" for the 1990 ''Review of Contemporary Fiction''. (It was added as an afterword to the novel in 2012.){{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\nWittgenstein is extensively referenced in the work of the Australian poet, [[Gwen Harwood]], who describes him as \"favourite philosopher\".{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\nAnother reference to Wittgenstein is in the 2015 film [[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]. Here, one of the main characters Nathan is the creator of a search engine called the Blue Book in reference to Wittgenstein's Blue and Brown books. In Nathans bedroom, there is also Gustav Klimmt's painting of Ludwig Wittgenstein's sister.{{cn|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Works==\n{{Refbegin|20em}}\nA collection of Ludwig Wittgenstein's manuscripts is held by Trinity College, Cambridge.\n* ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', Annalen der Naturphilosophie, 14 (1921)\n**''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' [''TLP''], translated by C.K.
