Duke Professor]] of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of [[Neurobiology]] at [[Duke University]]. Flanagan has done work in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of psychology]], [[philosophy of social science]], [[ethics]], [[Contemporary ethics|contemporary ethical theory]], [[moral psychology]], as well as on [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] conceptions of the self.\n\n==Biography==\nFlanagan earned his [[Ph.D.]] from [[Boston University]] and his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Fordham University]]. He taught for many years at [[Wellesley College]] before moving to Duke.\n\nFlanagan has written extensively on [[consciousness]]. He has been realistic about the difficulty of consciousness as a scientific and philosophical problem, but optimistic about the chance of solving the problem. One of the problems in a study of consciousness is the hidden way in which conscious states are dependent on brain states. Flanagan has proposed that there is a \"natural method\" to go about understanding consciousness that involves creating a science of mind. Three key elements of this developing science are: paying attention to subjective reports on conscious experiences, incorporating the results from [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], and including the results from [[neuroscience]] that will reveal how neuronal systems produce consciousness.\n\nFlanagan is also responsible for bringing attention to the relevance of empirical psychology on the way we think of moral psychology. His efforts spawned the modern field of moral psychology.<ref name=Flanagan1991>Flanagan, Owen, <u>Varieties of Moral Personality</u>, Harvard University Press, 1991.</ref>{{Better source|reason=Cites book by the subject of the article, not acceptable for claiming creation of a modern discipline|date=February 2015}}\n\nFlanagan was also one of the first moral philosophers to see the relevance of developments in social psychology to ethics.\n\nFlanagan is currently on the Editorial Board of Greater Good Magazine, published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Flanagan's contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.
