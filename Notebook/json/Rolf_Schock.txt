His parents, who had left Germany in 1931, would eventually settle in the United States, where Rolf would go on to study [[geology]] and [[psychology]], with [[mathematics]] as a minor, at the [[University of New Mexico]]. After completing a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor of arts]] in 1955, he pursued studies in [[philosophy]] and [[logic]] from 1956 to 1960 at the [[University of California]], first in [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and then in [[University of California, Los Angeles|Los Angeles (UCLA)]], and in 1960 moved to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], to specialize in theoretical philosophy at [[Stockholm University]] with a particular interest in ''[[free logic]]'', logic free of existence assumptions. He was awarded an intermediate post-graduate degree in 1964 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1968, which was followed by an appointment as associate professor at [[Uppsala University]] in the following year.\n\nDuring the period 1964–1969 he also studied at the [[University College of Arts, Crafts and Design]] in [[Stockholm]] and he dedicated a lot of his time to painting and photography in addition to conducting research. He led a simple life as an independent scholar who was devoted to researching the field of [[logic]] and related areas in philosophy, and never held a permanent position, earning a living by temporary teaching assignments at universities and night-schools.  For some years he was affiliated with the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], where he taught a series of courses.\n\nIn 1986 Rolf Schock was killed in an accident in [[Berlin]]. To much surprise he left a large estate.  Schock bequeathed half of the funds for prizes in the arts and sciences, and beginning in 1993, [[Rolf Schock Prizes|Schock Prizes]] ({{lang|sv|''schockprisen''}}) instituted by his will are awarded every two or three years.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.kva.se/en/Prizes/Rolf-Shock-prizes/Rolf-Schock/ |title=Rolf Schock |work= |publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2010-06-16 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schock, Rolf}}\n[[Category:Swedish philosophers]]\n[[Category:Logicians]]\n[[Category:1933 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Stockholm University alumni]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Rolf Schock"}}}}
