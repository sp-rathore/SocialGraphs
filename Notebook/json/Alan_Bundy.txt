[[University of Edinburgh]]: initially in the 'Metamathematics' Unit, which in 1972 became the Department of Computational Logic, in 1974 was absorbed into the new Department of Artificial Intelligence and in 1998 was absorbed into the new [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]]. From 1971–73, he was a research fellow on Prof. B. Meltzer's [[Science and Engineering Research Council|SERC]] grant ''Theorem Proving by Computer''; in 1973 he became a university lecturer; in 1984 he was promoted to reader; in 1987 he was promoted to professorial fellow; and in 1990 he was promoted to professor. From 1987–92 he held an [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] Senior Fellowship. From 1998–2001 he was Head of the newly formed of Division (subsequently School) of [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] at Edinburgh.\n\nFrom 2000–2005 he was a founder and convener of the UK Computing Research Committee, which plays an advocacy role for computing research in the UK. From 2010 he is a Vice-President and Trustee of the [[British Computer Society]] with special responsibility for the Academy of Computing.\n\nBundy is the leader of the Mathematical Reasoning Group at Edinburgh.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nBundy was elected a founding Fellow of [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence|AAAI]] in 1990, a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1996, a founding fellow of AISB in 1997, a founding fellow of [[European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence|ECCAI]] in 1999, a fellow of the British Computer Society in 2004, and a Fellow of the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] in 2005. He was elected a [[Fellow]]<ref name=\"List of Fellows\"/> of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]<ref name=\"List of Fellows\"/> in 2008. He was elected to [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Fellow (2014) ''\"For contributions to [[artificial intelligence]], automated reasoning, and the formation and evolution of representations.\"''.<ref>[http://awards.acm.org/award_winners/bundy_2915504.cfm ACM Fellows 2014]</ref>\n\nHe is the winner of the 2007 [[IJCAI Award for Research Excellence]] and [[Herbrand Award|Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to Automated Deduction]].\n\nHe was one of the 41 professors selected worldwide to receive one of the HP Labs Innovation Research Awards 2008.<ref>http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080814xa.html</ref>\n\nBundy was appointed [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[2012 New Year Honours]] for services to computing science.<ref>{{LondonGazette |issue=60009 |date=31 December 2011 |startpage=7 |supp=yes }}</ref> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2012|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012]],<ref name=froyalsoc>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105225854/https://royalsociety.org/people/alan-bundy-11164/|archivedate=2015-11-05|url=https://royalsociety.org/people/alan-bundy-11164/|title=Professor Alan Bundy CBE FREng FRS|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London}}</ref> his certificate of election reads{{centred pull quote|Alan Bundy has made world-leading contributions to both automated reasoning and the automated formation and evolution of representations of knowledge. He has developed novel techniques with improved efficiency, range and behaviour. His work on automated reasoning has found application in hardware and software systems development, where it has increased the level of automation. It has decreased the skill level and development time required to verify computer programs and has been taken up by industry. His work on representation evolution facilitates communication between agencies with different representations of related knowledge.<ref name=froyalsoc/>}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n<!--- Use the DEFAULTSORT magic word to sort this article in all categories --->\n\n{{FRS 2012}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bundy, Alan}}\n[[Category:Artificial intelligence researchers]]\n[[Category:British computer scientists]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Leicester]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the British Computer Society]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Institution of Engineering and Technology]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the SSAISB]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1947 births]]\n[[Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Alan Bundy"}}}}
