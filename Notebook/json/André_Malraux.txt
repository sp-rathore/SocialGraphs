Malraux's novel ''La Condition Humaine'' ([[Man's Fate]]) (1933) won the [[Prix Goncourt]]. He was appointed by President [[Charles de Gaulle]] as Minister of Information (1945–1946) and subsequently as France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs during de Gaulle's presidency (1959–1969).\n\n==Early years==\nMalraux was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Fernand-Georges Malraux and Berthe Lamy (Malraux). His parents separated in 1905 and eventually divorced. There are suggestions that Malraux's paternal grandfather committed suicide in 1909.<ref name=MalrauxWebsite>[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html \"Biographie détaillée\"], André Malraux Website, accessed 3 Sep 2010</ref>\n\nMalraux was raised by his mother, maternal aunt Marie and maternal grandmother, Adrienne Lamy-Romagna, who had a grocery store in the small town of [[Bondy]].<ref name=MalrauxWebsite/><ref>Cate, p. 4</ref> His father, a stockbroker, committed suicide in 1930 after the international [[Stock market crash|crash of the stock market]] and onset of the [[Great Depression]].<ref>Cate, p. 153</ref>  From his childhood, associates noticed that André had marked nervousness and motor and vocal tics. The recent biographer Olivier Todd, who published a book on Malraux in 2005, suggests that he had [[Tourette's syndrome]], although that has not been confirmed.<ref name=Knorr>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/31/style/31iht-malraux_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1| title=Andre Malraux, the Great Pretender| author=Katherine Knorr| date= 31 May 2001| work=The New York Times}}</ref> Either way, most critics have not seen this as a significant factor in Malraux's life or literary works.\n\nThe young Malraux left formal education early, but he followed his curiosity through the booksellers and museums in Paris, and explored its rich libraries as well.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Banteay Srei - Cambodia.jpg|thumb|The [[Banteay Srei]] temple was the subject of a celebrated case of [[art theft]] when André Malraux stole four devatas in 1923 (he was soon arrested and the figures returned).]]\n[[File:André Malraux 1933.jpg|thumb|André Malraux in 1933]]\nIn 1922, Malraux married Clara Goldschmidt. Malraux and his first wife separated in 1938 but didn't divorce until 1947. His daughter from this marriage, Florence (b. 1933), married the filmmaker [[Alain Resnais]].<ref>Cate, pp. 388–389</ref>\n\nAfter the breakdown of his marriage with Clara, Malraux lived with journalist and novelist [[Josette Clotis]], starting in 1933. Malraux and Josette had two sons: Pierre-Gauthier (1940–1961) and Vincent (1943–1961). During 1944, while Malraux was fighting in [[Alsace]], Josette died, aged 34, when she slipped while boarding a train. His two sons died together in 1961 in an automobile accident.\n\nIn 1948, Malraux married a second time, to [[Marie-Madeleine Lioux]], a concert pianist and the widow of his half-brother, Roland Malraux. They separated in 1966.\n\nSubsequently, Malraux lived with [[Louise de Vilmorin]] in the Vilmorin family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but mordant tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu. Her most famous novel was ''Madame de...'', published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film ''The Earrings of Madame de...'' (1953), directed by Max Ophüls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin's other works included ''Juliette'', ''La lettre dans un taxi'', ''Les belles amours'', ''Saintes-Unefois'', and ''Intimités''. Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. After Louise's death, Malraux spent his final years with her relative, Sophie de Vilmorin.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nMalraux's first published work, an article entitled \"The Origins of Cubist Poetry\", appeared in the magazine ''Action'' in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by three semi-surrealist tales, one of which, \"Paper Moons\", was illustrated by Fernand Léger. Malraux also frequented the Parisian artistic and literary milieux of the period, meeting figures such as Demetrios Galanis, Max Jacob, François Mauriac, Guy de Pourtalès, André Salmon, Jean Cocteau, Raymond Radiguet, Florent Fels, Pascal Pia, Marcel Arland, Edmond Jaloux, and Pierre Mac Orlan.<ref>[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html Biographie détaillée]. Malraux.org. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.</ref>\n\n===Indochina===\nIn 1923, aged 22, Malraux left for [[Cambodia]] with Clara.<ref>Cate, pp. 53–58</ref> There, together with Clara and a friend, Louis Chevasson, he undertook a small expedition into unexplored areas of the Cambodian jungle in search of lost [[Khmer people|Khmer]] temples, hoping to find items that might be sold to art museums. (At about the same time, archaeologists, with the approval of the French Government, were removing large numbers of items from Angkor Wat - many of which are now in the Musée Guimet in Paris.) On his return, Malraux was arrested by French colonial authorities for removing a ''[[bas-relief]]'' from ''[[Banteay Srei]]''. Malraux, who believed he had acted within the law as it then stood, contested the charges but was unsuccessful.<ref>[http://www.academia.edu/1247202/Hierarchies_of_value_at_Angkor_Wat Hierarchies of value at Angkor Wat | Lindsay French]. Academia.edu. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.</ref>\n\nMalraux's experiences in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] led him to become highly critical of the French colonial authorities there. In 1925, with Paul Monin,<ref>Yves Le Jariel, L'ami oublié de Malraux en Indochine, Paul Monin (1890-1929)</ref> a progressive lawyer, he helped to organize the [[Young Annam League]] and founded a newspaper ''[[L'Indochine]]''.<ref>Cate, pp. 86–96</ref>\n\nOn his return to France, Malraux published ''[[The Temptation of the West]]'' (1926). The work was in the form of an exchange of letters between a Westerner and an Asian, comparing aspects of the two cultures. This was followed by his first novel ''The Conquerors'' (1928), and then by ''The Royal Way'' (1930) which reflected some of his Cambodian experiences.<ref>Cate, p. 159</ref> In 1933 Malraux published ''[[Man's Fate]]'' (''La Condition Humaine''), a novel about the 1927 [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|failed Communist rebellion in Shanghai]]. The work was awarded the 1933 [[Prix Goncourt]].<ref>Cate, pp. 170–181</ref>\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nDuring the 1930s, Malraux was active in the anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in France. At the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] forces in Spain, serving in and helping to organize the small Spanish Republican Air Force.<ref>Cate, pp. 228–242</ref> (Curtis Cate, one of his biographers, claims that Malraux was slightly wounded twice during efforts to stop the [[Falangists]]' takeover of [[Madrid]], but the historian Hugh Thomas claims otherwise.)\n\nThe French government sent aircraft to Republican forces in Spain, but they were obsolete by the standards of 1936. They were mainly [[Potez 540]] bombers and [[Dewoitine D.372]] fighters. The slow Potez 540 rarely survived three months of air missions, flying at 80 knots against enemy fighters flying at more than 250 knots. Few of the fighters proved to be airworthy, and they were delivered intentionally without guns or [[sight (device)|gunsights]]. (The Ministry of Defense of France had feared that modern types of planes would easily be captured by the Germans fighting for [[Francisco Franco]], and the lesser models were a way of maintaining official \"neutrality\".)<ref>Cate, p. 235</ref> The planes were surpassed by more modern types introduced by the end of 1936 on both sides.\n\nThe Republic circulated photos of Malraux standing next to some Potez 540 bombers suggesting that France was on their side, at a time when France and the United Kingdom had declared official neutrality. But Malraux's commitment to the Republicans was personal, like that of many other foreign volunteers, and there was never any suggestion that he was there at the behest of the French Government. Malraux himself was not a pilot, and never claimed to be one, but his leadership qualities seem to have been recognized because he was made Squadron Leader of the 'España' squadron. Acutely aware of the Republicans' inferior armaments, of which outdated aircraft were just one example, he toured the United States to raise funds for the cause. In 1938 he published ''[[Man's Hope|L'Espoir]]'' (Man's Hope), a novel influenced by his Spanish war experiences.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n15/john-sturrock/the-man-from-nowhere| title=The Man from Nowhere| author=John Sturrock| work=The London Review of Books| volume= 23| number= 15 | date= 9 August 2001 }}</ref>\n\nMalraux's participation in major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War inevitably brought him determined adversaries as well as strong supporters, and the resulting polarization of opinion has colored, and rendered questionable, much that has been written about his life. Fellow combatants praised Malraux's leadership and sense of camaraderie,<ref>Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009). pp. 25–27.</ref> although [[Antony Beevor]] says [[André Marty]] of the [[Comintern]] described him as an \"adventurer\" for his high profile and demands on the Spanish Republican government.<ref name=\"Beevor, p. 140\">Beevor, p. 140</ref> Beevor also claims that \"Malraux stands out, not just because he was a mythomaniac in his claims of martial heroism – in Spain and later in the French Resistance – but because he cynically exploited the opportunity for intellectual heroism in the legend of the Spanish Republic.\"<ref name=\"Beevor, p. 140\"/> Both these claims are highly questionable. Malraux’s only work about the Spanish Revolution was a novel – in which he does not figure at all. His later works occasionally describe episodes during the Resistance<ref>Mainly the first volume of his ''Antimémoires''.</ref> but in none of them does he make anything resembling \"claims of martial heroism”. Indeed, in one episode, he portrays himself in a somewhat unflattering light. The Comintern's remarks are, of course, very unsurprising. Malraux was never a card-carrying Communist and, as is well known, the Comintern did not take kindly to anyone who did not obey its dictates. During the Spanish Civil War it was normal Communist practice to denigrate anyone who \"deviated\"; indeed many suffered far worse fates than that as Orwell makes clear in ''Homage to Catalonia''.\n\nIn any case, Malraux's participation in events such as the Spanish Civil War has tended to distract attention from his important literary achievement. Malraux saw himself first and foremost as a writer and thinker (and not a \"man of action\" as biographers so often portray him) but his extremely eventful life – a far cry from the stereotype of the French intellectual confined to his study or a Left Bank café – has tended to obscure this fact. As a result, his literary works, including his important works on the theory of art, have received less attention than one might expect, especially in Anglophone countries.<ref>Derek Allan, \"Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art\" (Rodopi, 2009)</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nAt the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Malraux joined the [[French Army]]. He was captured in 1940 during the [[Battle of France]] but escaped and later joined the [[French Resistance]].<ref>Cate, pp. 278–287</ref> In 1944, he was captured by the [[Gestapo]].<ref>Cate, pp. 328–332</ref> He later commanded the tank unit [[Brigade Alsace-Lorraine]] in defence of [[Strasbourg]] and in the attack on [[Stuttgart]].<ref>Cate, pp. 340–349</ref>\n\n[[Otto Abetz]] was the German governor, and produced a series of \"black lists\" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi Occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. [[Louis Aragon]] and André Malraux were both on these \"Otto Lists\" of forbidden authors.<ref>Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Malraux was awarded the ''[[Médaille de la Résistance]]'' and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]. The British awarded him the [[Distinguished Service Order]], for his work with British liaison officers in [[Corrèze]], Dordogne and [[Lot (department)|Lot]]. After Dordogne was liberated, Malraux led a battalion of former resistance fighters to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where they fought alongside the [[First Army (France)|First Army]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7792088|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Malraux, Andre|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war, he worked on his last novel, ''The Struggle with the Angel'', the title drawn from the story of the Biblical [[Jacob]]. The manuscript was destroyed by the Gestapo after his capture in 1944. A surviving first section, titled ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.\n\n===After the war===\n[[File:ARC194219.png|thumb|U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], Marie-Madeleine Lioux, André Malraux, U.S. First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], and U.S. Vice President [[Lyndon B.

Soon after, he completed his first book on art, ''The Psychology of Art'', published in three volumes (1947–1949). The work was subsequently revised and republished in one volume as ''The Voices of Silence'' (''Les Voix du Silence''), the first part of which has been published separately as ''The Museum without Walls''. Other important works on the theory of art were to follow. These included the three-volume ''Metamorphosis of the Gods'' and ''Precarious Man and Literature'', the latter published posthumously in 1977.\n\nWhen de Gaulle returned to the French presidency in 1958, Malraux became France's first [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]], a post he held from 1958 to 1969. Among many initiatives, he launched an innovative (and subsequently widely imitated) program to clean the blackened façades of notable French buildings, revealing the natural stone underneath.<ref>Chilvers, Ian.  Entry for AM in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' (Oxford, 2004).  Accessed on 6/28/11 at: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andre_Malraux.aspx#4</ref>  He also created a number of ''maisons de la culture'' in provincial cities and worked to preserve France's national heritage.\n\nIn 1957, Malraux published the first volume of his trilogy on art entitled ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods''. The second two volumes (not yet translated into English) were published shortly before he died. They are entitled ''L’Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'' and discuss artistic developments from the Renaissance to modern times. Malraux also initiated the series ''[[Arts of Mankind]]'', an ambitious survey of world art that generated more than thirty large, illustrated volumes.\n\nMalraux was an outspoken supporter of the Bangladesh liberation movement during the 1971 [[Pakistani Civil War]] and despite his age seriously considered joining the struggle. When Indira Gandhi came to Paris in November 1971, there was extensive discussion between them about the situation in Bangladesh.\n\nDuring this post-war period, Malraux also published a series of semi-autobiographical works, the first entitled ''Antimémoires'' (1967). A later volume in the series, ''Lazarus'', is a reflection on death occasioned by his experiences during a serious illness. ''La Tête d'obsidienne'' (1974) (translated as ''Picasso's Mask'') concerns Picasso, and visual art more generally.\n\nMalraux died in [[Créteil]], near Paris, on 23 November 1976. He was buried in the [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (Essonne) cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to French culture, his ashes were moved to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris during 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of his death.\n\n===Legacy and honours===\n[[File:André Malraux, 1974, photo42.jpg|thumb|André Malraux in 1974]]\n*1933, [[Prix Goncourt]]\n*[[Médaille de la Résistance]]\n*[[Croix de guerre]]\n*[[Distinguished Service Order]] (United Kingdom)\n\nThere is now a large and steadily growing body of critical commentary on Malraux's literary ''œuvre'', including his very extensive writings on art. Unfortunately, some of his works, including the last two volumes of ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods'' (''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'') are not yet available in English translation.  Malraux's works on the theory of art contain a revolutionary approach to art that challenges the Enlightenment tradition that treats art simply as a source of \"aesthetic pleasure\". However, as French writer [[André Brincourt]] has commented, Malraux's books on art have been \"skimmed a lot but very little read\"<ref>Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art, Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009, p. 21</ref> (this is especially true in Anglophone countries) and the radical implications of his thinking are often missed. A particularly important aspect of Malraux's thinking about art is his explanation of the capacity of art to transcend time. In contrast to the traditional notion that art endures because it is timeless (\"eternal\"), Malraux argues that art lives on through metamorphosis – a process of resuscitation (where the work had fallen into obscurity) and transformation in meaning.<ref>Derek Allan.
