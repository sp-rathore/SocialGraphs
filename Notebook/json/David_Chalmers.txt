He is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Centre for Consciousness at the [[Australian National University]]. He is also Professor of Philosophy at [[New York University]]  in the [[NYU Department of Philosophy]].<ref>[http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/davidchalmers.html philosophy.fas.nyu.edu]</ref>  In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts & Sciences]].\n\n==Life==\nSince 2004, Chalmers has been Professor of Philosophy, Director of the Centre for Consciousness, and an ARC Federation Fellow at the [[Australian National University]].\n\nA [[Rhodes Scholar]] raised in Australia, Chalmers received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at [[Indiana University Bloomington]] under [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. He was a postdoctoral fellow in the Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology program directed by [[Andy Clark]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1993 to 1995, and his first professorship was at [[UC Santa Cruz]], from August 1995 to December 1998. Chalmers was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy (1999–2004) and, later, Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies (2002–2004) at the [[University of Arizona]], sponsor of the [[Toward a Science of Consciousness]]<ref>[http://consciousness.arizona.edu/ consciousness.arizona.edu]</ref> conference. After appearing as a plenary speaker at the first meeting, Chalmers has subsequently taken the role of co-organizer, alongside [[Stuart Hameroff]], of this conference.\n\nChalmers' 1996 book, ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'', was described by ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' as \"one of the best science books of the year\".<ref>''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory'' (1996), paperback edition, back cover.</ref> In the book, Chalmers argues that all forms of [[physicalism]] (whether [[reductionism|reductive]] or [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|non-reductive]]) that have dominated modern philosophy and science fail to account for the existence (that is, presence in reality) of consciousness itself. He proposes an alternative [[dualism|dualistic]] view he calls ''[[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] dualism'' (but which might also be characterized by more traditional formulations such as ''[[property dualism]]'', ''[[neutral monism]]'', or ''[[double-aspect theory]]'').\n\nHe  is the lead singer of the Zombie Blues band which performed at the [[Qualia Fest]] in 2012<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/nyregion/jamming-about-the-mind-at-qualia-fest.html NYTimes.com]</ref> in New York.\n\nOn the 14 of June 2016 David Chalmers visited [[Moscow]] to hold a lecture at [[Moscow State University]] focused on solving the Hard problem of consciousness.<ref>[http://hardproblem.ru/events/trudnaya-problema-soznaniya-300-let-spustya-lektsirs-oya-devida-chalmersa/ The hard problem of consciousness: 300 years on.

Interview with David Chalmers]</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n\n===Philosophy of mind===\n[[File:David Chalmers, delivering a talk at De La Salle University-Manila, March 27, 2012.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Chalmers on stage for an [[Alan Turing Year]] event at [[De La Salle University]], Manila, March 27, 2012]]\n\nChalmers is best known for his formulation of the notion of a [[hard problem of consciousness]] in both his 1996 book and in the 1995 paper \"Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness\".  He makes a distinction between \"easy\" problems of consciousness, such as explaining object discrimination or verbal reports, and the single hard problem, which could be stated \"why does the ''feeling'' which accompanies awareness of sensory information exist at all?\"  The essential difference between the ([[cognition|cognitive]]) easy problems and the ([[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenal]]) hard problem is that the former are at least theoretically answerable via the standard strategy in philosophy of mind: [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]. Chalmers argues for an \"explanatory gap\" from the objective to the subjective, and criticizes [[materialism|physical]] explanations of mental experience, making him a [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]]. Chalmers characterizes his view as \"naturalistic dualism\": naturalistic because he believes mental states are ''caused'' by physical systems (such as brains); dualist because he believes mental states are ontologically distinct from and not reducible to physical systems.\n\nIn support of this, Chalmers is famous for his commitment to the logical (though, importantly, not natural) possibility of [[philosophical zombie]]s, although he was not the first to propose the [[thought experiment]]. These zombies, unlike the [[zombie]] of popular fiction, are complete physical duplicates of human beings, lacking only qualitative experience. Chalmers argues that since such zombies are conceivable to us, they must therefore be logically possible. Since they are logically possible, then [[qualia]] and sentience are not fully explained by physical properties alone. Instead, Chalmers argues that consciousness is a fundamental property [[ontology|ontologically]] autonomous of any known (or even possible) physical properties, and that there may be lawlike rules which he terms \"psychophysical laws\" that determine which physical systems are associated with which types of qualia.  He further speculates that all [[information theory|information]]-bearing systems may be conscious, leading him to entertain the possibility of conscious thermostats and a qualified [[panpsychism]] he calls [[panprotopsychism]]. Chalmers maintains a formal agnosticism on the issue, even conceding that the viability of panpsychism places him at odds with the majority of his contemporaries.\n\nAfter the publication of Chalmers's landmark paper, more than twenty papers in response were published in the ''Journal of Consciousness Studies''.  These papers (by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Colin McGinn]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Francis Crick]], and [[Roger Penrose]], among others) were collected and published in the book ''Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem''. [[John Searle]] critiqued Chalmers's views in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=1258 Searle's review of ''The Conscious Mind''] 6 March 1997 (subscription required)<br />[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1179 Chalmers' response to Searle and Searle's reply] 15 May 1997 (free access)</ref>\n\nWith [[Andy Clark]], Chalmers has written ''The Extended Mind'', an article about the borders of the mind.<ref>[http://consc.net/papers/extended.html consc.net Analysis 58:10-23, 1998. Reprinted in The Philosopher's Annual, 1998. ]</ref>\n\n===Philosophy of language===\nChalmers has published works on the \"theory of reference\" concerning how words secure their referents. He, together with others such as [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], proposes a kind of theory called [[two dimensionalism]] arguing against [[Saul Kripke]]. Before Kripke delivered the famous lecture series [[Naming and Necessity]] in 1970, the [[Descriptivist theory of names|descriptivism]] advocated by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] was the orthodoxy. Descriptivism suggests that a name is indeed an abbreviation of a description, which is a set of properties or, as later modified by [[John Searle]], a disjunction of properties. This name secures its reference by a process of properties fitting: whichever object fits the description most, then it is the referent of the name. Therefore, the description is seen as the connotation, or, in Fregean terms, the sense of the name, and it is via this sense by which the denotation of the name is determined.\n\nHowever, as Kripke argued in ''Naming and Necessity'', a name does not secure its reference via any process of description fitting. Rather, a name determines its reference via a historical-causal link tracing back to the process of naming. And thus, Kripke thinks that a name does not have a sense, or, at least, does not have a sense which is rich enough to play the reference-determining role. Moreover, a name, in Kripke's view, is a [[rigid designator]], which refers to the same object in all [[possible worlds]]. Following this line of thought, Kripke suggests that any scientific identity statement such as \"Water is H<sub>2</sub>O\" is also a necessary statement, i.e. true in all possible worlds. Kripke thinks that this is a phenomenon that the descriptivist cannot explain.\n\nAnd, as also proposed by [[Hilary Putnam]] and Kripke himself, Kripke's view on names can also be applied to the reference of [[natural kind|natural kind terms]]. The kind of theory of reference that is advocated by Kripke and Putnam is called the [[direct reference theory]].\n\nHowever, Chalmers disagrees with Kripke, and all the direct reference theorists in general. He thinks that there are two kinds of intension of a natural kind term, a stance which is now called [[two dimensionalism]]. For example, the words,\n\n:\"Water is H<sub>2</sub>O\"\n\nare taken to express two distinct propositions, often referred to as a ''primary intension'' and a ''secondary intension'', which together compose its meaning.<ref>for a fuller explanation see Chalmers, David. ''The Conscious Mind''. Oxford UP: 1996. Chapter 2, section 4.</ref>\n\nThe primary intension of a word or sentence is its [[sense and reference|sense]], i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of \"water\" might be a description, such as ''watery stuff''. The thing picked out by the primary intension of \"water\" could have been otherwise. For example, on some other world where the inhabitants take \"water\" to mean ''watery stuff'', but where the chemical make-up of watery stuff is not H<sub>2</sub>O, it is not the case that water is H<sub>2</sub>O for that world.\n\nThe ''secondary intension'' of \"water\" is whatever thing \"water\" happens to pick out in ''this'' world, whatever that world happens to be. So if we assign \"water\" the primary intension ''watery stuff'' then the secondary intension of \"water\" is H<sub>2</sub>O, since H<sub>2</sub>O is ''watery stuff'' in this world. The secondary intension of \"water\" in our world is H<sub>2</sub>O, and is H<sub>2</sub>O in every world because unlike ''watery stuff'' it is impossible for H<sub>2</sub>O to be other than H<sub>2</sub>O. When considered according to its secondary intension, water means H<sub>2</sub>O in every world. Via this secondary intension, Chalmers proposes a way simultaneously to explain the necessity of the identity statement and to preserve the role of intension/sense in determining the reference.\n\n===Philosophy of verbal disputes===\nIn recent work, Chalmers has concentrated on verbal disputes.<ref>[http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf consc.net Philosophical Review, 120:4, 2011.]</ref> He argues that a dispute is best characterized as \"verbal\" when it concerns some sentence S which contains a term T such that (i) the parties to the dispute disagree over the meaning of T, and (ii) the dispute arises solely because of this disagreement. In the same work, Chalmers proposes certain procedures for the resolution of verbal disputes. One of these he calls the \"elimination method\", which involves eliminating the contentious term and observing whether any dispute remains.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''[[The Conscious Mind]]: In Search of a Fundamental Theory'' (1996).
