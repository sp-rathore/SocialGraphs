Baumgartner Obituary |publisher=Rand-wilson.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-06}}</ref>\n\nBaumgartner was born in [[Wichita, Kansas]], began his undergraduate study at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1960, then transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received his PhD in 1970 from  for a dissertation entitled ''Results and Independence Proofs in Combinatorial Set Theory''. His advisor was [[Robert Vaught]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=22587}}</ref>\nHe became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1969, and there spent his entire career.\n\nOne of Baumgartner's results is the consistency of the statement that any two <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic (a set of reals is <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense if it has exactly <math>\\aleph_1</math> points in every open interval). With [[András Hajnal]] he proved the result ([[Baumgartner–Hajnal theorem]]) that the [[partition relation]] <math>\\omega_1\\to(\\alpha)^2_n</math> holds for <math>\\alpha<\\omega_1,n<\\omega</math>. He died of a heart attack in 2011.<ref>[http://rand-wilson.com/obituaries/obit_view.php?id=26]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Baumgartner's axiom]]\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* Baumgartner, James E., ''A new class of order types'', Annals of Mathematical Logic, 9:187–222, 1976\n* Baumgartner, James E., ''Ineffability properties of cardinals I'', Infinite and Finite Sets, Keszthely (Hungary) 1973, volume 10 of Colloquia Mathematica Societatis János Bolyai, pages 109–130.
