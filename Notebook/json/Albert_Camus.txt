His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as [[absurdism]]. He wrote in his essay ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of [[nihilism]] while still delving deeply into individual freedom. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1957|publisher=Nobelprize.org|date=7 October 2010|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1957/|accessdate=7 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101008031320/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1957/| archivedate= 8 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nCamus did not consider himself to be an [[existentialist]] despite usually being classified as a follower of it, even in his lifetime.<ref>{{cite book |last=Solomon|first=Robert C. |authorlink=Robert C.

After he contracted [[tuberculosis]] in 1930, he had to end his [[Association football|football]] activities; he had been a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for a prominent Algerian university team. In addition, he was only able to study part-time. To earn money, he took odd jobs: as a private tutor, car parts clerk, and assistant at the [[Meteorological]] Institute. He completed his ''[[Licence (France)|licence de philosophie]]'' ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) in 1936; in May 1936, he successfully presented his thesis on [[Plotinus]], \"Rapports de l'hellénisme et du christianisme à travers les oeuvres de Plotin et de saint Augustin\" (\"Relationship of Greek and Christian thought in Plotinus and St. Augustine\"),<ref>Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 109.</ref> for his ''{{ill|fr|diplôme d'études supérieures}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis).\n\nCamus joined the [[French Communist Party]] in early 1935, seeing it as a way to \"fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria.\" He did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read ''Das Kapital'', but did write, \"We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities.\"<ref name=\"Todd\" /> In 1936, the independence-minded [[Algerian Communist Party]] (PCA) was founded. Camus joined the activities of the [[Algerian People's Party]] (''Le Parti du Peuple Algérien''), which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades, who in 1937 denounced him as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] and expelled from the party. Camus then became associated with the French [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement.\n\nThe anarchist [[André Prudhommeaux]] first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the ''Cercle des Étudiants Anarchistes'' (Anarchist Student Circle) as a sympathiser familiar with anarchist thought. Camus wrote for anarchist publications such as ''Le Libertaire'', ''La révolution Proletarienne'', and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' (Workers' Solidarity), the organ of the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] (National Confederation of Labor). Camus stood with the anarchists when they expressed support for the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. He again allied with the anarchists in 1956, first in support of the workers' uprising in [[Poznań]], Poland, and then later in the year with the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]].\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1934, Camus married Simone Hié, but the marriage ended as a consequence of infidelities on both sides. In 1935, he founded ''Théâtre du Travail'' (Worker's Theatre),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.famousauthors.org/albert-camus |title=Albert Camus: Biography, Books and Facts |publisher=FamousAuthors.org|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref> renamed ''Théâtre de l'Equipe'' (Theatre of the Team) in 1937. It lasted until 1939. From 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper, ''Alger-Républicain''. His work included a report on the poor conditions for peasants in [[Kabylie]], which apparently cost him his job. From 1939 to 1940, he briefly wrote for a similar paper, ''Soir-Republicain''. He was rejected by the French army because of his [[tuberculosis]].\n\nIn 1940, Camus married [[Francine Faure]], a pianist and mathematician. Although he loved her, he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage, dismissing it as unnatural. Even after Francine gave birth to twins, Catherine and Jean, on 5 September 1945, he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage.<ref>{{cite web|author = Stephen C.

In the same year, Camus began to work for ''[[Paris-Soir]]'' magazine. In the first stage of [[World War II]], during the so-called [[Phoney War]], Camus was a [[pacifism|pacifist]]. While in Lyon during the Wehrmacht occupation, on 15 December 1941, Camus read about the Paris execution of [[Gabriel Péri]];<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqbCBQAAQBAJ|title=Albert Camus: From the Absurd to Revolt|last=Foley|first=John|date=2014-12-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317492719|page=186 citation 51|language=en|quote=51 The passage quoted concludes with the following: \"And, to be precise, I recall the day when the waves of revolt within me reached their climax.

In the same year he finished his first books, ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. He returned briefly to [[Oran]], Algeria, in 1942.\n\n===Football===\nCamus was once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, [[Soccer|football]] or the theatre.

Any football  ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17. The affliction, which was then incurable, caused Camus to be bedridden for long and painful periods.\n\nWhen Camus was asked in the 1950s by an alumni sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, his response included the following: \"After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RUA.\"<ref name = \"rhybma\"/> Camus was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays, the principle of sticking up for your friends, of valuing bravery and fair-play. Camus's belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over-complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are, potentially to serve their own needs.<ref name=\"rhybma\" />\n\nA professional footballer appears as a character in ''The Plague'' and football is discussed in the dialogue.\n\n===Revolutionary Union Movement and Europe===\nAs he wrote in [[The Rebel (book)|''L'Homme révolté'']] (''The Rebel''), in the chapter about \"The Thought on Midday\", Camus was a follower of the ancient Greek 'Solar Tradition' (la ''pensée solaire''). In 1947–48, he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement (''Groupes de liaison internationale'' – GLI)<ref name=\"Todd\" /> a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (''Syndicalisme révolutionnaire''). According to Olivier Todd, in his biography ''Albert Camus, une vie'', it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Surrealist movement of André Breton. For more, see the book ''Alfred Rosmer et le mouvement révolutionnaire international'' by Christian Gras.\n\nHis colleagues were Nicolas Lazarévitch, [[Louis Mercier]], Roger Lapeyre, Paul Chauvet, Auguste Largentier, Jean de Boë (see the article: \"Nicolas Lazarévitch, Itinéraire d'un syndicaliste révolutionnaire\" by Sylvain Boulouque in the review ''Communisme'', n° 61, 2000). His main aim was to express the positive side of [[surrealism]] and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the [[nihilism]] of [[André Breton]].\n\nFrom 1943, Albert Camus had correspondence with [[Altiero Spinelli]] who founded the [[European Federalist Movement]] in Milan—see [[Ventotene Manifesto]] and the book \"Unire l'Europa, superare gli stati\", Altiero Spinelli nel Partito d'Azione del Nord Italia e in Francia dal 1944 al 1945-annexed a letter by Altiero Spinelli to Albert Camus.\n\nIn 1944, Camus founded the \"French Committee for the European Federation\" (''Comité Français pour la Féderation Européenne'' – CFFE) declaring that Europe \"can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy and peace if the nation states become a federation.\"\n\nFrom 22 to 25 March 1945, the first conference of the European Federalist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Camus, [[George Orwell]], [[Emmanuel Mounier]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[André Philip]], [[Daniel Mayer]], [[François Bondy]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]].<ref>See the book ''The Biography of Europe'' by Pan Drakopoulos.</ref> This specific branch of the [[European Federalist Movement]] disintegrated in 1957 after [[Winston Churchill]]'s ideas about European integration rose to dominance.\n\n===Death===\nCamus died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46, in a car accident near [[Sens]], in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of [[Villeblevin]]. In his coat pocket was an unused train ticket. He had planned to travel by train with his wife and children, but at the last minute he accepted his publisher's proposal to travel with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm |title=KIAD MA in Fine Art: a student run seminar |publisher=Raimes.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513004641/http://www.raimes.com/seminar.htm |archivedate=13 May 2009 }}</ref>\n[[File:20041113-002 Lourmarin Tombstone Albert Camus.jpg|thumb|Albert Camus's gravestone]]\nThe driver of the [[Facel Vega FVS|Facel Vega HK500]] car, Michel Gallimard, who was Camus's publisher and close friend, also died in the accident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bayley|first1=Stephen|title=Albert Camus’ Crash|url=http://www.stephenbayley.com/w/albert-camus-crash|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=de Gaudemar |first=Antoine |title= This one's had a good start born in the middle of a move |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1994/apr/16/fiction.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=16 April 1994 |accessdate=21 December 2008}}</ref> In August 2011, the Milan newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot, but Camus's biographer, Olivier Todd, did not consider it credible.<ref>Kim Willsher [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/aug/07/albert-camus-killed-by-kgb Albert Camus might have been killed by the KGB for criticising the Soviet Union, claims newspaper] ''The Observer'', 7 August 2011</ref> Camus was buried in the Lourmarin Cemetery, [[Lourmarin]], Vaucluse, France.\n\nHe was the second-youngest recipient, at the age of 44, of the Nobel Prize in Literature, after [[Rudyard Kipling]], at the age of 42.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lennon |first=Peter |title=''Camus and His Women'' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1997/oct/15/biography.albertcamus |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=1 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081207034232/http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1997/oct/15/biography.albertcamus| archivedate= 7 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nHe was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter, Jean and Catherine, who hold the copyrights to his work.\n\nTwo of Camus's works were published posthumously. The first, entitled ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (1970), featured a character named Patrice Mersault, comparable to ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Meursault. There is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books. The second was an unfinished novel, ''[[The First Man]]'' (1995), which Camus was writing before he died. The novel was an autobiographical work about his childhood in [[Algeria]].\n\n==Literary career==\nDuring the war Camus joined the [[French Resistance]] cell ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the ''[[pseudonym|nom de guerre]]'' ''Beauchard''. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, ''[[The Flies]]'', in June 1943.<ref>''{{Ill|fr|The Prime of Life|La Force de l'âge}}'', by [[Simone de Beauvoir]]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] [[Liberation of Paris|liberated Paris]] in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombs on Japan]]. He resigned from ''Combat'' in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the [[Café de Flore]] on the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]] in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned [[left-wing politics|left]], politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] and eventually alienated Sartre.\n\nIn 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'', a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays.\n\nCamus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his [[Absurdism|idea of the absurd]]. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' and incorporated into many of his other works, such as ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Plague]]''. Despite his split from his \"study partner\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an [[Existentialist]]. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \"Enigma\" and elsewhere.<ref>See: ''The Lyrical and Critical Essays of Albert Camus''</ref> The current confusion arises, in part, because many recent applications of existentialism have much in common with many of Camus's ''practical'' ideas (see: ''Resistance, Rebellion, and Death''). But, his personal understanding of the world (e.g., \"a benign indifference\", in ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]''), and every vision he had for its progress (e.g., vanquishing the \"adolescent furies\" of history and society, in ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'') undoubtedly set him apart.\n\nIn the 1950s, Camus devoted his efforts to [[human rights]]. In 1952, he resigned from his work for [[UNESCO]] when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. In 1953, he criticized [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] methods to crush a workers' strike in [[East Berlin]]. In 1956, he protested against similar methods in Poland (protests in [[Poznań]]) and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October.\n[[File:Lucia 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Camus crowning Stockholm's [[St Lucy's Day#In the Nordic countries|Lucia]] on December 13, 1957, three days after accepting the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nCamus maintained his pacifism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world. He wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with [[Arthur Koestler]], the writer, intellectual and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment. He was consistent in his call for non-aggression in Algeria (see below).<ref name=\"nybooks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/camus-and-algeria-moral-question/ |title=Camus & Algeria: The Moral Question |last=Messud |first=Claire |authorlink=Claire Messud |date=23 October 2013 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |publisher=Rea S.

In 1957, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] \"for his important literary production, which with clear-sighted earnestness illuminates the problems of the human conscience in our times\".\n\n[[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.4.JPG|left|thumb|\nThe bronze plaque on the monument to Camus in the town of [[Villeblevin]], France.

Financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize, he adapted and directed for the stage [[Dostoevsky|Dostoyesvsky's]] [[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]. The play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris.

His 1938 address on \"The New Mediterranean Culture\" represents Camus' most systematic statement on his views at this time.  In 1939, Camus wrote a stinging series of articles for ''Alger Republicain'' on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the Kabylie highlands, advocating for economic, educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency.  In 1945, following the [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]] after Arab revolts against French mistreatment, Camus was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony, again writing a series of article reports on conditions, and advocating for French concessions and reforms to the demands of the Algerian people.\n\nWhen the [[Algerian War]] began in 1954, Camus was confronted with a moral dilemma. He identified with the ''[[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]]'' such as his own parents and defended the French government's actions against the revolt. He argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the 'new [[Arab imperialism]]' led by Egypt and an 'anti-Western' offensive orchestrated by Russia to 'encircle Europe' and 'isolate the United States'.<ref>''Actuelles III: Chroniques Algeriennes'', 1939–58</ref> Although favoring greater Algerian [[self-governance|autonomy]] or even federation, though not full-scale independence, he believed that the ''Pieds-Noirs'' and Arabs could co-exist. During the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians, which was rejected by both sides, who regarded it as foolish. Behind the scenes, he began to work for imprisoned Algerians who faced the death penalty.<ref name=\"Foley2014\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kqbCBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA161|title=Albert Camus: From the Absurd to Revolt|last=Foley|first=John|date=2014-12-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317492719|page=161|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Camus Monument in Villeblevin France 17-august-2003.1.JPG|thumb|\nThe monument to Camus built in [[Villeblevin]], where he died in an car crash on 4 January 1960\n]]\n\nWhen he spoke to students at the [[University of Stockholm]], he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother, who still lived in Algeria. This led to further ostracism by French left-wing intellectuals. At the time of his death, Camus was working on an incomplete novel with a strong biographical component, ''The First Man.''  The publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Camus' allegedly unrepentant colonialism in the work of figures such as David Carroll in the anglosphere.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=11dwG9mnVXsC|title=Albert Camus the Algerian: Colonialism, Terrorism, Justice|last=Carroll|first=David|date=2007-05-04|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231511766|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Absurdism===\nMany writers have addressed the Absurd, each with his or her own interpretation of what the Absurd is and what comprises its importance. For example, [[Sartre]] recognizes the absurdity of individual experience, while [[Kierkegaard]] explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevent us from reaching God rationally. Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a \"philosopher of the absurd\". He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing ''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus''). To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to \"Camus' Absurd\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nHis early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, ''L'Envers et l'endroit'' (''Betwixt and Between)'' in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, ''Noces'' (''Nuptials''), in 1938. In these essays Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life as [[The Stranger (novel)|''L'Étranger'' (''The Stranger'')]]. In the same year he released [[The Myth of Sisyphus|''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'' (''The Myth of Sisyphus'')]], a literary essay on the Absurd. He also wrote [[Caligula (play)|a play]] about [[Caligula]], a Roman Emperor, pursuing an absurd logic. The play was not performed until 1945.\n\nThe turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the ''Revue Libre'' in 1943, the second in the ''Cahiers de Libération'' in 1944, and the third in the newspaper ''Libertés'', in 1945. The four letters were published as ''Lettres à un ami allemand'' (''Letters to a German Friend'') in 1945, and were included in the collection ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]''.\n\n===Ideas on the absurd===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\nCamus presents the reader with dualisms such as happiness and sadness, dark and light, life and death, etc. He emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality; for Camus, this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness. In ''Le Mythe'', dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universe's silence. While we can live with a dualism (''I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know I will also experience happiness to come''), we cannot live with the paradox (''I think my life is of great importance, but I also think it is meaningless''). In ''Le Mythe'', Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves?<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=3–8}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Le Mythe'', Camus suggests that 'creation of meaning' would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort.<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays|origyear=1942|year=1955|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|pages=21–48}}</ref>  But Camus wants to know if he can live with what logic and lucidity has uncovered – if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more. Creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem. He gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap. The alternative option, namely suicide, would entail another kind of leap, where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms (the human being). Camus points out, however, that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life, and that it simply evades the problem yet again. Camus concludes that we must instead \"entertain\" both death and the absurd, while never agreeing to their terms.\n\nMeursault, the absurdist hero of ''L'Étranger,'' has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed. Caligula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about. However, while Camus possibly suggests that Caligula's absurd reasoning is wrong, the play's anti-hero does get the last word, as the author similarly exalts Meursault's final moments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=Caligula and Three Other Plays|origyear=1944|year=1958|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=74}}</ref>\n\nCamus made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Absurd, and always rejected nihilism as a valid response. <blockquote>\"If nothing had any meaning, you would be right. But there is something that still has a meaning.\" ''Second Letter to a German Friend'', December 1943.</blockquote>\n\nCamus's understanding of the Absurd promotes public debate; his various offerings entice us to think about the Absurd and offer our own contribution. Concepts such as cooperation, joint effort and solidarity are of key importance to Camus, though they are most likely sources of 'relative' versus 'absolute' meaning. In ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]],'' Camus identifies rebellion (or rather, the values indicated by rebellion) as a basis for human solidarity. <blockquote>\"When he rebels, a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself, and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical. But for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Camus|first=Albert|title=The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt|year=1956|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|page=17}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===''The Myth of Sisyphus''===\nDespite his opposition to the label, Camus addressed one of the fundamental questions of existentialism: the problem of [[suicide]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/camus/|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Albert Camus|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> He wrote, \"There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.

On the French collaboration with [[Nazi]] occupiers he wrote: \"Now the only moral value is courage, which is useful here for judging the puppets and chatterboxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED9113FF93AA25751C1A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=In Camus's notebooks and letters, as quoted in ',Albert Camus A Life', By Olivier Todd |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510104040/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806EED9113FF93AA25751C1A961958260 |archivedate=10 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> After liberation, Camus remarked, \"This country does not need a [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], but a [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]].\"<ref name=\"Bronner2009\">{{cite book |author=Stephen Eric Bronner|title=Camus: Portrait of a Moralist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TyOjcCm8XDMC&pg=PA74|accessdate=3 September 2011|date=15 September 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-07567-9|page=74}}</ref> The reality of the bloody [[Épuration légale|postwar tribunals]] soon changed his mind: Camus publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of [[capital punishment]].<ref name=\"Bronner2009\" />\n\nCamus's well-known falling out with Sartre is linked to his opposition to communism. Camus detected a reflexive totalitarianism in the [[mass politics]] espoused by Sartre in the name of radical [[Marxism]]. This was apparent in his work ''L'Homme Révolté'' (''The Rebel'') which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state, but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics. Camus continued to speak out against the atrocities of the [[Soviet Union]], a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech, ''The Blood of the Hungarians'', commemorating the anniversary of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army.\n\n=== Philhellenism, debts to Greek classical thought ===\nOne further important, often neglected component of Camus' philosophical and literary persona was his love of classical Greek thought and literature.  This love looks back to his youthful encounters with Nietzsche, his teacher Jean Grenier, and his own sense of a \"Mediterranean\" identity, based in a common experience of sunshine, beaches, and living in proximity to the near-Eastern world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hellenicantidote.blogspot.com.au/2010/03/albert-camus-new-mediterranean-culture.html|title=Hellenic Antidote: Albert Camus: The New Mediterranean Culture|last=Akritas|first=John|date=2010-03-08|website=Hellenic Antidote|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref>  Camus' ''Diplomes'' thesis (roughly like an MA thesis in most anglophone countries) was on the transition between classical Greek and Roman, and [[Christian culture]], featuring chapters on the early Church, gnosticism, Plotinus and Saint Augustine's \"second revelation\", bringing Greek philosophical conceptuality to Christian revelation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Christian-Metaphysics-Neoplatonism-Albert-Camus/dp/1587311143|title=Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism|last=Camus|first=Albert|last2=Brague|first2=Rémi|date=2015-01-20|publisher=St. Augustines Press |isbn= 9781587311147 |edition=1st |language=English}}</ref>  Camus' early essay collection ''Noces (Nuptials)'' features essays set amidst classical Roman ruins; as the ''Myth of Sisyphus'' and ''The Rebel'' (which takes as its hero Prometheus) both are rooted in Camus' classical paideia.  The culmination of the latter work defends a \"midday thought\" based in classical moderation or ''mesure'', in opposition to the tendency of modern political ideologies to exclusively valorise race or class, and to dream of a total redemptive revolution.  Camus' conception of classical moderation also has deep roots in his lifelong love of Greek tragic theatre, about which he gave an intriguing address in Athen in 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kevinartigue.com/2013/09/lecture-on-the-future-of-tragedy/|title=Lecture on the Future of Tragedy :  Kevin Artigue|website=kevinartigue.com|access-date=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{French literature sidebar}}\n\n===Novels===\n* ''[[The Stranger (novel)|The Stranger]]'' (''L'Étranger'', often translated as ''The Outsider'') (1942)\n* ''[[The Plague]]'' (''La Peste'') (1947)\n* ''[[The Fall (Albert Camus novel)|The Fall]]'' (''La Chute'') (1956)\n* ''[[A Happy Death]]'' (''La Mort heureuse'') (written 1936–38, published posthumously 1971)\n* ''[[The First Man]]'' (''Le premier homme'') (incomplete, published posthumously 1995)\n\n===Short stories===\n* ''[[Exile and the Kingdom]]'' (''L'exil et le royaume'') (collection, 1957)\n* [[The Adulterous Woman]] (''La Femme adultère'')\n* [[The Renegade (Camus short story)|The Renegade or a Confused Spirit]] (''Le Renégat ou un esprit confus'')\n* [[The Silent Men]] (''Les Muets'')\n* [[The Guest]] (''L'Hôte'')\n* [[The Artist at Work|Jonas or the Artist at Work]] (''Jonas ou l’artiste au travail'')\n* [[The Growing Stone]] (''La Pierre qui pousse'')\n\n===Non-fiction books===\n* ''[[Christian Metaphysics and Neoplatonism]]'' (1935)\n* ''[[Betwixt and Between]]'' (''L'envers et l'endroit'', also translated as ''The Wrong Side and the Right Side'') (collection, 1937)\n* ''[[Nuptials (Camus)|Nuptials]]'' (''Noces'') (1938)\n* ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (''Le Mythe de Sisyphe'') (1942)\n* ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' (''L'Homme révolté'') (1951)\n* ''[[Notebooks 1935–1942]]'' (''Carnets, mai 1935&nbsp;—fevrier 1942'') (1962)\n* ''[[Notebooks 1943–1951]]'' (1965)\n* ''[[Notebooks 1951–1959]]'' (2008) Published as \"Carnets Tome III : Mars 1951 – December 1959\" (1989)\n* ''Algerian Chronicles'' (2013)<ref>Harvard University Press (ISBN 978-0674072589)</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323335404578444562558795632.html Betwixt and Between] by James Campbell - [[Wall Street Journal]] (3 May 2013 review)</ref><ref>[http://bookforum.com/inprint/020_01/11228 Resistance, Rebellion, and Writing], by [[George Scialabba]] - bookforum.com April / May 2013</ref>\n\n===Plays===\n* ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' (performed 1945, written 1938)\n* ''[[Requiem for a Nun (play)|Requiem for a Nun]]'' (''Requiem pour une nonne'', adapted from [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Requiem for a Nun|novel by the same name]]) (1956)\n* ''[[The Misunderstanding]]'' (''Le Malentendu'') (1944)\n* ''[[The State of Siege]]'' (''L'État de Siège'') (1948)\n* ''[[The Just Assassins]]'' (''Les Justes'') (1949)\n* ''[[The Possessed (play)|The Possessed]]'' (''Les Possédés'', adapted from [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novel [[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]) (1959)\n\n===Essays===\n* ''[[Create Dangerously]]'' (''Essay on Realism and Artistic Creation'') (1957)\n* ''[[The Ancient Greek Tragedy]]'' (''Parnassos lecture in Greece'') (1956)\n* ''[[The Crisis of Man]]'' (''Lecture at Columbia University'') (1946)\n* ''[[Why Spain?]]'' (''Essay for the theatrical play L' Etat de Siège'') (1948)\n* ''[[Reflections on the Guillotine]]'' (''Réflexions sur la guillotine'') (Extended essay, 1957)\n* ''[[Neither Victims Nor Executioners]]'' (''Combat'') (1946)\n\n===Collected essays===\n* ''[[Resistance, Rebellion, and Death]]'' (1961)&nbsp;– a collection of essays selected by the author, including the 1945 ''Lettres à un ami allemand'' (Letters to a German Friend) and ''A Defense of Intelligence'', a 1945 speech given at a meeting organized by Amitié Française<ref>Orme, Mark (2007).
