A. Meredith\" on publications) (July 28, 1904 &ndash; March 31, 1976) was an influential [[Ireland|Irish]] [[List of logicians|logician]], appointed to [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1947.  His work on [[condensed detachment]] (inspired by the work of [[Jan Łukasiewicz|Łukasiewicz]]) was under-appreciated in his own time, but is influential in modern research.{{citation needed|reason=Give some examples.|date=December 2014}}\n\nHe also proved the shortest known axiomatic bases for a number of logic systems.  His achievements in that area were unsurpassed until [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem prover]]s in the last few years, which build on his work, proved some shorter ones for some systems and proved his shortest for others.\n\nBorn July 28, 1904 into a distinguished [[Dublin]] family, he was the son of [[barrister]] Arthur Francis Carew Meredith K.C. (1862 &mdash; May 16, 1938),<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=115515840 ''Arthur Francis Carew Meredith''] at findagrave.com</ref> whose opinions were sought by [[Éamon de Valera]] in drafting the constitution of the [[Irish Republic]] (1919–22). Educated in England at [[Winchester College]], he went on to read mathematics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1922 becoming the first mathematical student to take a double first and 'B star' in two years.\n\nMeredith was related to another mathematician, [[Thomas Meredith]]. He was a nephew of [[Richard Edmund Meredith]] and a cousin of [[Monk Gibbon]], Judge [[James Creed Meredith]] and [[Ralph Creed Meredith]]. His old school friend from [[Winchester College|Winchester]], [[William Empson]], described him as \"a small, gnomelike figure with a grin like a Cheshire cat and a pronounced Dublin accent (good for reading aloud from [[James Joyce|Joyce]])\".\n\n==Selected publications==\n\n* {{cite journal | author=C.A.
