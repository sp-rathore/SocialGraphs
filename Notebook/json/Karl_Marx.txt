Born in [[Prussia]] to a middle-class family, he later studied [[political economy]] and [[G.W.F. Hegel|Hegelian philosophy]]. As an adult, Marx became [[Statelessness|stateless]] and spent much of his life in [[London, England]], where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker [[Friedrich Engels]] and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history.\n\nMarx's theories about society, economics and politics—collectively understood as [[Marxism]]—hold that human societies develop through [[class struggle]]: a conflict between ruling classes (known as the [[bourgeoisie]]) that control the [[means of production]] and working classes (known as the [[proletariat]]) that work on these means by selling their labour for wages. Through his theories of [[alienation of labor|alienation]], [[Law of value|value]], [[commodity fetishism]], and [[surplus value]], Marx argued that [[capitalism]] facilitated social relations and [[ideology]] through [[commodification]], [[Social stratification|inequality]], and the [[exploitation of labour]]. Employing a critical approach known as [[historical materialism]], Marx propounded the theory of [[base and superstructure]], asserting that the cultural and political conditions of society, as well as its [[Marx's theory of human nature|notions of human nature]], are largely determined by obscured economic foundations. These economic critiques would result in influential works such as ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (1867).\n\nAccording to Marx, states are run in the interests of the ruling class but are nonetheless represented as being in favor of the [[general will|common interest]] of all.<ref>\". For each new class which puts itself in the place of one ruling before it is compelled, merely in order to carry through its aim, to represent its interest as the common interest of all the members of society, that is, expressed in ideal form: it has to give its ideas the form of universality, and represent them as the only rational, universally valid ones.\" See: https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01b.htm</ref> He predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, capitalism produced internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system: [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism, owing in part to its instability and [[crisis theory|crisis-prone nature]], would eventuate the working class' development of [[class consciousness]], leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, [[communist]] society governed by a [[free association (communism and anarchism)|free association of producers]].<ref>Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm ''Critique of the Gotha Program''] (Marx/Engels Selected Works, Volume Three, pp. 13–30;)</ref><ref>In [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/letters/52_03_05.htm Letter from Karl Marx to Joseph Weydemeyer] (''MECW'' Volume 39, p. 58; )</ref> Marx actively fought for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised [[Revolution|revolutionary action]] to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic [[emancipation]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-23-24\" />\n\nMarx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and [[Criticisms of Marxism|criticised]].<ref name=\"Manchester\"/> His work in economics laid the basis for much of the current understanding of labour and its relation to [[capital (economics)|capital]], and subsequent economic thought.<ref>[[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]].

XII</ref> and would result in his major economic work—the three-volume series called ''Capital''.<ref>Karl Marx, ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', ''Volume 36'' and ''Volume 37'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996, 1997 and 1987).</ref> [[Marxism]] is based in large part on three influences: [[Hegel]]'s dialectics, French utopian socialism and English economics.  Together with his earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of \"Marxism\" (or political economy as Marx called it) were in place by the autumn of 1844.<ref>Isaiah Berlin, ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'', pp. 35–61.</ref>  Although Marx was constantly being pulled away from his study of political economy by the usual daily demands on his time that everyone faces, and the additional special demands of editing a radical newspaper and later by the demands of organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years in which popular uprisings of the citizenry might at any moment become a revolution, Marx was always drawn back to his economic studies.  Marx sought \"to understand the inner workings of capitalism\".<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 62.</ref>\n\nAn outline of \"Marxism\" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844.  Indeed, many features of the Marxist view of the world's political economy had been worked out in great detail.  However, Marx needed to write down all of the details of his economic world view to further clarify the new economic theory in his own mind.<ref>Note 54 contained on page 598 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3''.</ref>  Accordingly, Marx wrote ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts]]''.<ref>Karl Marx, \"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844\" ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 3'' (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 229–346.</ref>  These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Marx's concept of [[alienated labour]].<ref name=sep/>  However, by the spring of 1845 his continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Marx to the belief that the new political economic theory that he was espousing—scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'' had been written between April and August 1844. Soon, though, Marx recognised that the ''Manuscripts'' had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach.  Accordingly, Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism.  Thus, a year later, in April 1845, after moving from Paris to Brussels, Marx wrote his eleven \"[[Theses on Feuerbach]],\"<ref>Karl Marx, \"Theses on Feuerbach\", contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 3–14.</ref>  The \"Theses on Feuerbach\" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that \"philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it\".<ref name=sep/><ref>Karl Marx, \"Theses on Feuerbach,\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'', p. 8.</ref>  This work contains Marx's criticism of [[materialism]] (for being contemplative), [[idealism]] (for reducing practice to theory) overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.<ref name=sep/> It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's [[historical materialism]], an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.<ref name=sep/><ref name=\"Engels1999\"/> In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government shut down ''Vorwärts!'', with the interior minister, [[François Guizot]], expelling Marx from France.<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 90\"/>  At this point, Marx moved from Paris to Brussels, where Marx hoped to, once again, continue his study of capitalism and political economy.\n\n===Brussels: 1845–1848===\n[[File:Communist-manifesto.png|thumb|The first edition of ''The Manifesto of the Communist Party'', published in German in 1848]]\n\nUnable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845.  However, to stay in Belgium, Marx had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 90\"/> In Brussels, he associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including [[Moses Hess]], [[Karl Heinzen]], and [[Joseph Weydemeyer]], and soon, in April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 90\" /><ref>Heinrich Gemkow ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [\"New Book Publishing House\"]: Dresden, 1972) p. 101</ref>  Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England, to join Engels in Brussels.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 102.</ref>\n\nIn mid-July 1845, Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the [[Chartism|Chartists]], a socialist movement in Britain.  This was Marx's first trip to England and Engels was an ideal guide for the trip.  Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester, from November 1842<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'' (Verlag Zeit im Bild [New Book Publishing House]: Dresden, 1972) p. 53</ref> to August 1844.<ref>Heinrich Gemkow, ''et al.'', ''Frederick Engels: A Biography'', p. 78.</ref>  Not only did Engels already know the English language,<ref name=\"N.

Fedoseyev, p. 89\"/>  Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 92.</ref>\n\nIn collaboration with Engels, Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of [[historical materialism]], ''[[The German Ideology]]''.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \"German Ideology\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 5'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 19–539.</ref>  In this work, Marx broke with [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Bruno Bauer]], [[Max Stirner]] and the rest of the Young Hegelians, and also broke with [[Karl Grun]] and other \"true socialists\" whose philosophies were still based in part on \"idealism\".  In ''German Ideology'' Marx and Engels finally completed their philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 96–97.</ref>\n\n''German Ideology'' is written in a humorously satirical form.  But even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship.  Like so many other early writings of his, ''German Ideology'' would not be published in Marx's lifetime and would be published only in 1932.<ref name=sep/><ref name=wk/><ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 93.</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''German Ideology'', Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding \"the theory and tactics\" of a truly \"revolutionary proletarian movement\" operating from the standpoint of a truly \"scientific materialist\" philosophy.<ref>See Note 71 on p. 672 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers: New York, 1976).</ref>  This work was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Marx's own scientific socialist philosophy.  Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Marx knew that people would tend on most occasions to act in accordance with their own economic interests.  Thus, appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of that class to make a revolution and change society.  This was the intent of the new book that Marx was planning.  However, to get the manuscript past the government censors, Marx called the book ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' (1847)<ref>Karl Marx, ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6''(International Publishers: New York, 1976) pp. 105–212.</ref> and offered it as a response to the \"petty bourgeois philosophy\" of the French anarchist socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] as expressed in his book ''[[The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1840).<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Marx+Family and Engels.jpg|thumb|right|180|Marx, Engels and Marx's daughters]]\nThese books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Marx continued his association with the secret radical organisation [[League of the Just]].<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'' (Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1973) p. 124.</ref>  As noted above, Marx thought the League to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working class revolution.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 671–672.</ref>  However, to organise the working class into a mass movement, the League had to cease its \"secret\" or \"underground\" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.<ref>Note 260 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'', p. 672.</ref>  Members of the League eventually became persuaded in this regard.  Accordingly, in June 1847 the League of the Just was reorganised by its membership into a new open \"above ground\" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev,''et al.'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', pp. 123–125.</ref>  This new open political society was called the Communist League.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''et al'', ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 125.</ref>  Both Marx and Engels participated in drawing the programme and organisational principles of the new [[Communist League]].<ref>Frederick Engels, \"Principles of Communism\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'' (International Publishers, New York, 1976) pp. 341–357.</ref>\n\nIn late 1847, Marx and Engels began writing what was to become their most famous work — a programme of action for the [[Communist League]].  Written jointly by Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' was first published on 21 February 1848.<ref>Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, \"The Communist Manifesto\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 6'', pp. 477–519.</ref>  ''The Communist Manifesto'' laid out the beliefs of the new Communist League.  No longer a secret society, the Communist League wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding its beliefs as the [[League of the Just]] had been doing.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. p. 115.</ref> The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism, that \"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\"<ref name=\"ShillingMellor2001\">{{cite book|author1=Chris Shilling|author2=Philip A Mellor|title=The Sociological Ambition: Elementary Forms of Social and Moral Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CdgJe9Jx0UC&pg=PA114|year=2001|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6549-7|page=114}}</ref> It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the [[bourgeoisie]] (the wealthy capitalist class) and the [[proletariat]] (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the ''Manifesto'' presents the argument for why the [[Communist League]], as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.<ref>[[#Mar48|Marx and Engels 1848]].</ref>\n\nLater that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the [[Revolution of 1848]].<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 125\"/> In France, [[French Revolution of 1848|a revolution]] led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the [[French Second Republic]].<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 125\"/> Marx was supportive of such activity, and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father of either 6,000<ref name=\"MaltsevN.-93\"/> or 5,000 francs,<ref>Saul Kussiel Padover, ''Karl Marx, an intimate biography'', McGraw-Hill, 1978, page 205</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> allegedly used a third of it to arm [[Belgium|Belgian]] workers who were planning revolutionary action.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,<ref name=\"MaltsevN.-93\"/><ref>David McLellan 1973 ''Karl Marx: His life and Thought''.

Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence.

The headquarters of the [[Communist League]] also moved to London.  However, in the winter of 1849–1850, a split within the ranks of the Communist League occurred when a faction within it led by [[August Willich]] and [[Karl Schapper]] began agitating for an immediate uprising. Willich and Schapper believed that once the Communist League had initiated the uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise \"spontaneously\" to join it, thus, creating revolution across Europe.  Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the Communist League was \"adventuristic\" and would be suicide for the Communist League.<ref name=\"N. Fedoseyev, p. 233\">P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', p. 233.</ref>  Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe.  This, Marx maintained, would spell doom for the Communist League itself.  Changes in society, Marx argued, are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of \"a handful of men\".<ref name=\"N. Fedoseyev, p. 233\"/>  Instead, they are brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development.  In the present stage of development (circa 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848, Marx felt that the Communist League should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage.  In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working class revolution.\n\nAfter a long struggle which threatened to ruin the Communist League, Marx's opinion prevailed and, eventually, the Willich/Schapper group left the Communist League. Meanwhile, Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.<ref>Note 269 contained on page 674 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref>  The Society held their meetings in [[Great Windmill Street]], [[Soho]], central London's entertainment district.<ref>[[#Whe00|Wheen 2001]]. pp. 151–155.</ref><ref name=\"Harriss2006\"/> This organisation was also racked by an internal struggle between its members, some of whom followed Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction.  The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the Communist League. Marx, however, lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and, on 17 September 1850, resigned from the Society.<ref>Note 269 on page 674 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11''.</ref>\n\n===''New York Tribune'' and journalism ===\nWhile in London, Marx devoted himself to the task of revolutionary organising of the working class. For the first few years, he and his family lived in extreme poverty.<ref name=\"DusselMoseley2001\"/><ref name=\"egsbio\"/> His main source of income was his colleague, Engels, who derived much of his income from his family's business.<ref name=egsbio/> Later Marx and Engels both began writing for six different newspapers around the world, in England, the United States, [[Prussia]], Austria and South Africa.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 295.</ref> Most of Marx's journalistic writing, however, was as a European correspondent for the ''[[New York Daily Tribune]]''.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knoft Publishing Co.: New York, 1986) p. 17.</ref> In earlier years, Marx had been able to communicate with the broad masses of the working class by editing his own newspaper or editing a newspaper financed by others sympathetic to his philosophy. Now, in London, Marx was unable to finance his own newspaper and unable to put together financing from others. Thus, Marx sought to communicate with the public by writing articles for the ''New York Tribune'' and other \"bourgeois\" newspapers. At first Marx's English-language articles were translated from German by {{ill|de|Wilhelm Pieper (revolutionary)|Wilhelm Pieper (Revolutionär)|Wilhelm Pieper}}; eventually, however, Marx learned English well enough to write without translation.<ref name=\"Dispatches\" />\n\nThe ''New York Daily Tribune'' had been founded in New York City in the United States of America by [[Horace Greeley]] in April 1841.<ref>P. N. Fedoseyev, ''Karl Marx: A Biography'', 274.</ref> Marx's main contact on the ''Tribune'' was [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana]]. Later, in 1868, Charles Dana would leave the ''Tribune'' to become the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''New York Sun'', a competing newspaper in New York City.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knopt Publishing, New York, 1986) p. 121.</ref> However, at this time Charles Dana served on the editorial board of the ''Tribune''.\n\nSeveral characteristics about the ''Tribune'' made the newspaper an excellent vehicle for Marx to reach a sympathetic public across the Atlantic Ocean. Since its founding, the ''Tribune'' had been an inexpensive newspaper—two cents per copy.<ref>Taken from a picture on page 327 of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979).</ref> Accordingly, it was popular with the broad masses of the working class of the United States. With a run of about 50,000 issues, the ''Tribune'' was the most widely circulated journal in the United States.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'', p. 14.</ref> Editorially, the ''Tribune'' reflected Greeley's anti-slavery opinions.<ref>Richard Kluger, ''The Paper: The Life and Death of the New York Herald Tribune'' (Alfred A. Knoft: New York, 1986), p, 82.</ref> Not only did the ''Tribune'' have wide readership with the United States and not only did that readership come from the working classes, but the readers seemed to be from the progressive wing of the working class. Marx's first article for the ''New York Tribune'' was on the British elections to Parliament and was published in the ''Tribune'' on 21 August 1852.<ref>Karl Marx, \"The Elections in England – Tories and Whigs\" contained in the''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 327–332.</ref>\n\nMarx was just one of the reporters in Europe that the ''New York Tribune'' employed. However, with the slavery crisis in the United States coming to a head in the late 1850s and with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, the American public's interest in European affairs declined.<ref>Note 1 at page 367 contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 19'' (International Publishers: New York, 1984).</ref> Thus Marx very early began to write on issues affecting the United States — particularly the \"slavery crisis\" and the \"War Between the States\".\n\nFrom December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'',<ref>Karl Marx, \"The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon\" contained in the ''Collected Works of KarlMarx and Frederick Engels: Volume 11'' (International Publishers: New York, 1979) pp. 99–197.</ref> a work on the [[French Revolution of 1848]], in which he expanded upon his concepts of historical materialism, [[class struggle]] and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the [[bourgeois]] state.<ref name=\"Marx2008\"/>\n\nThe 1850s and 1860s also mark the line between what some scholars see as the [[idealistic]], Hegelian [[young Marx]] from the more scientifically minded [[mature Marx]] writings of the later period.<ref name=\"Wood\"/><ref name=\"Wood1993\"/><ref name=\"Hook1994\"/><ref name=\"Johnston2000\"/> This distinction is usually associated with the [[structural Marxism]] school,<ref name=\"Johnston2000\"/> and not all scholars agree that it exists.<ref name=\"Hook1994\"/><ref name=\"GeorgeScanlan1975\"/> The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became sure that their economic view of the course of history was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they began to think that a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn. The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new [[revolutionary situation]] in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries. Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being \"adventurists\" because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer \"will power\" of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation.\n\nThe downturn in the United States economy in 1852 led Marx and Engels to wonder if a revolutionary upsurge would soon occur. However, the United States' economy was too new to play host to a classical revolution. The western frontier in America always provided a relief valve for the pent-up forces that might in other countries cause social unrest. Any economic crisis which began in the United States would not lead to revolution unless one of the older economies of Europe \"caught the contagion\" from the United States. In other words, economies of the world were still seen as individual national systems which were contiguous with the national borders of each country. The [[Panic of 1857]] broke the mould of all prior thinking on the world economy. Beginning in the United States, the Panic spread across the globe.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century'', p. 320.</ref> Indeed, the Panic of 1857 was the first truly global economic crisis.\n\nMarx longed to return to his economic studies. He had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, he felt he would be able to understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.\n\n===The First International and ''Capital''===\nMarx continued to write articles for the ''New York Daily Tribune'' as long as he was sure that the ''Tribune's'' editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.<ref>Jonathan Sperber, ''Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life'', p. 347.</ref> No longer was the ''Tribune'' to be a strong [[abolitionist]] paper dedicated to a complete [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy.

In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, \"[[The Civil War in France]],\" a defence of the Commune.<ref name=\"Curtis1997\"/><ref>Karl Marx, \"The Civil War in France\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 22'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 307–359.</ref>\n\nGiven the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism, and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the [[British Museum]] studying and reflecting on the works of [[political economy|political economists]] and on economic data.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20\"/> By 1857 he had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, [[landed property]], wage labour, the state, and foreign trade and the world market; this work did not appear in print until 1939, under the title ''[[Grundrisse|''Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy'']]''.<ref name=\"Segrest2002\"/><ref>Karl Marx, \"Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'' (International Publishers: New York, 1986) pp. 5–537.</ref><ref>Karl Marx, \"Economic Manuscripts of 1857–1858\" contained in the Preparatory Materials section of the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) pp. 421–507.</ref>\n\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich Das Kapital Marx 1867.jpg|thumb|right|The first volume of ''[[Das Kapital]]'']]\nFinally in 1859 Marx published ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'',<ref>Karl Marx, \"A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', pp. 257–417.</ref> his first serious economic work.  This work was intended merely as a preview of his three-volume ''[[Das Kapital]]'' (English title: ''Capital: Critique of Political Economy''), which he intended to publish at a later date.  In ''A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'', Marx accepts the [[labour theory of value]] as advocated by [[David Ricardo]], but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between [[use value]] and [[value (economics)|value]] in commodities, Ricardo always had been unable to define the real relationship between use value and value.

Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's \"admirable work\" ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' at more than one point in ''Capital.''<ref>See footnote #2 on the bottom of page 360 in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35''.</ref>  Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production.  No longer was there any \"natural reward of individual labour.  Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself.'\"<ref>Thomas Hodgskin, ''Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital'' (London, 1825) p. 25.</ref>  In this first volume of ''Capital'', Marx outlined his conception of [[surplus value]] and [[Exploit (sociology)|exploitation]], which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-23\"/>  Demand for a Russian language edition of ''Capital'' soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872.

He wrote that \"the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type—collective production and appropriation\". He added that \"the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies\".<ref>K. Marx, First draft of letter to Vera Zasulich [1881].

While in Paris, he used that of \"Monsieur Ramboz\", whilst in London he signed off his letters as \"A. Williams\". His friends referred to him as \"Moor\", owing to his dark complexion and black curly hair, while he encouraged his children to call him \"Old Nick\" and \"Charley\".<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 152\"/> He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as \"General\", his housekeeper Helene as \"Lenchen\" or \"Nym\", while one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as \"Qui Qui, Emperor of China\" and another, Laura, was known as \"Kakadou\" or \"the [[Khoikhoi|Hottentot]]\".<ref name=\"Wheen 2001. p. 152\"/>\n\n===Health===\nMarx was afflicted by poor health (what he himself described as \"the wretchedness of existence\")<ref>Blumenberg, 98.</ref> and various authors have sought to describe and explain it.  His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterwards free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head and rheumatic pains.  A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877; protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics.  The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet.  Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, \"none of which are good for liver patients\"; he also liked wine and liqueurs, and smoked an enormous amount, \"and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars\". From 1863 he complained a lot about boils: \"these are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes\".<ref>Blumenberg, 100.</ref> The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright.  According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients, and\n\n<blockquote>the illness emphasised certain traits in his character.  He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel.  Though in general Marx had a blind faith in his closest friends, nevertheless he himself complained that he was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them.  His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence….  There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.<ref>Blumenberg, 99-100.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Princeton historian J.E. Seigel, in his late teens Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to his being exempted from Prussian military service.  In later life whilst working on ''Capital'' (which he never completed)<ref>Blumenberg, 98; Siegel, 494.</ref> Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions.  A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, bad diet and lack of sleep.  Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night.  A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, \"was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Marx's style of life — alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep — all contributed.  Engels often exhorted Marx to alter this dangerous regime\".  In Professor Siegel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of his health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by his father.<ref>Seigel, 495-6.</ref>\n\nIn 2007 a [[retrodiagnosis]] of Marx's skin disease was made by [[dermatologist]] Sam Shuster of [[Newcastle University]].  For Shuster the most probable explanation was that Marx suffered, not from liver problems, but from [[hidradenitis suppurativa]], a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of [[apocrine]] ducts opening into [[hair follicles]].  This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Marx's physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions.  To arrive at his retrodiagnosis Shuster considered the primary material: the Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the ''Marx/Engels Collected works''.  There, \"although the skin lesions were called 'furuncules', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Marx, his wife and his physicians, they were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis\".  The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, [[perianal]], [[genital]] ([[penis]] and [[scrotum]]) and [[suprapubic]] regions and inner thighs, \"favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa\".  Professor Shuster claimed the diagnosis \"can now be made definitively\".<ref>Shuster, 1-2.</ref>\n\nShuster went on to consider the potential [[psychosocial]] effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication, and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust, and depression of self-image, mood and well-being; feelings for which Shuster found \"much evidence\" in the Marx correspondence.  Professor Shuster went on to ask himself whether the mental effects of the disease affected Marx's work, and even helped him to develop [[Marx's theory of alienation|his theory of alienation]].<ref>Shuster, 3.</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (12).jpg|thumb|400px|Memorial to Karl Marx, East [[Highgate Cemetery]], London]]\n\nFollowing the death of his wife, Jenny, in December 1881, Marx developed a [[catarrh]] that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life.

By \"ideology\", Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.<ref name=\"Hernadi1989\"/> Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods; it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).<ref name=sep/><ref name=\"Thompson1990\"/> An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface<ref>Karl Marx: [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction] to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in: ''[[Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher]]'', February 1844</ref> to his 1843 ''Contribution to the [[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'':\n\n{{quote|''Religious'' suffering is, at one and the same time, the ''expression'' of real suffering and a ''protest'' against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the ''opium'' of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.<ref name=\"MarxO'Malley1977\"/>}}\n\nWhereas his [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] senior thesis argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]], here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic status quo and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].<ref name=\"SwatosKivisto1998\"/>\n\n====Economy, history, and society====\n{{further information|Marxian economics}}\nMarx's thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also [[economic determinism]]).<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20-23\"/><ref name=\"Clark1998\"/><ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> [[Accumulation of capital]] shapes the [[social system]].<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/> [[Social change]], for Marx, was about conflict between opposing interests, driven, in the background, by economic forces.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20-23\"/> This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the [[conflict theory]].<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> In his [[sociocultural evolution|evolutionary]] model of history, he argued that [[human history]] began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20-23\"/> Marx noted that this was not an intentional process; rather, no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/>\n\nThe organisation of society depends on [[means of production]]. Literally those things, like land, natural resources, and technology, necessary for the production of material goods and the [[relations of production]], in other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Together these compose the [[mode of production]], and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between [[base and superstructure]], with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system, and superstructure, to the cultural and political system.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/> Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] as a major source of social disruption and conflict.<ref name=\"Turner2005\"/>\n\nDespite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new [[communist society]] that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones ([[slavery]] and [[feudal]]).<ref name=sep/> Marx also never clearly discusses issues of [[morality]] and [[justice]], although scholars agree that his work contained [[Logical implication|implicit]] discussion of those concepts.<ref name=sep/>\n\n[[File:Marx Moscow.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Karl Marx in Moscow. The inscription reads \"[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]\"]]\nMarx's view of capitalism was two-sided.<ref name=sep/><ref name=\"Wood1993\"/> On one hand, Marx, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system, noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation, and recurring, cyclical [[economic depressions|depressions]] leading to mass unemployment; on the other hand capitalism is also characterised by \"revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity\" (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, [[technological progress]], increased [[productivity]] and growth, [[rationality]] and [[scientific revolution]]), that are responsible for progress.<ref name=sep/><ref name=\"Wood1993\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20-23\"/> Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history, because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history, and was responsible for the overthrow of [[feudalism]] and its transition to capitalism.<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert2010\"/> Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist can, and has an incentive to, reinvest profits in new technologies and [[capital equipment]].<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-22\"/>\n\nAccording to Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference \"[[surplus value]]\" and argued that this surplus value had its source in [[surplus labour]], the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.<ref name=sep/> Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as [[vampire]]s sucking worker's blood, but at the same time,<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-20-23\"/> he notes that drawing profit is \"by no means an injustice\"<ref name=sep/> and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system.<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/> The true problem lies with the \"cancerous cell\" of [[Capital (economics)|capital]], understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.<ref name=\"Clark1998\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable, and prone to [[crisis theory|periodic crises]].<ref name=wk/> He suggested that over time, capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies, and less and less in labour.<ref name=sep/> Since Marx believed that surplus value appropriated from labour is the source of profits, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall even as the economy grew.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-23\"/> Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this [[business cycles|cycle]] of growth, collapse, and more growth.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-23\"/> Moreover, he believed that in the long-term, this process would necessarily enrich and [[empowerment|empower]] the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.<ref name=\"Calhoun2002-23\"/><ref name=\"Clark1998\"/> In section one of ''The Communist Manifesto'', Marx describes [[feudalism]], capitalism, and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:\n{{quote|We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged&nbsp;... the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder. Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of the bourgeois class. A similar movement is going on before our own eyes&nbsp;... The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring order into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois property.<ref name=manifesto/>}}\n\n[[File:MandK Industrial Revolution 1900.jpg|thumb|Marx believed that industrial workers (the [[proletariat]]) would rise up around the world.]]\nMarx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:\n{{quote|The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products.

Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\"<ref name=\"Karl Marx:Critique of the Gotha Programme\"/> While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the US and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries with strong centralised state-oriented traditions, like France and Germany, the \"lever of our revolution must be force\".<ref>\"You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries – such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland – where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means.

One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core, known as Analytical Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx's social theory and to emphasise the \"relative autonomy\" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx's central narrative of interaction between the development of the \"forces of production\" and the succession of \"modes of production\". Such has been, for example, the neo-marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx's social theory, such as [[E. P. Thompson]] and [[Eric Hobsbawm]]. It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like [[Antonio Gramsci]] who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Marxist social theory.<ref>Kołakowski, Leszek.
