He is often called '''Philo of Megara''' although the city of his birth is unknown. He is most famous for the disputes he had with his teacher [[Diodorus Cronus]] concerning the idea of the [[Subjunctive possibility|possible]] and the criteria of the truth of [[material conditional|conditional statements]].\n\n==Life==\nPhilo was a disciple of [[Diodorus Cronus]], and a friend of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], though older than the latter.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 16: \"He [Zeno] used to dispute very carefully with Philo the logician and study along with him. Hence Zeno, who was the junior, had as great an admiration for Philo as his master Diodorus.\"</ref> In his ''Menexenus'' he mentioned the five daughters of his teacher.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', iv.</ref>\n\n[[Jerome]] incorrectly refers to Philo as the teacher of [[Carneades]].<ref>Jerome, ''Contra Jovinianum'', 1</ref> [[Diogenes Laërtius]] mentions a (presumably different) Philo who was a disciple of [[Pyrrho]].<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, ix. 67, 69</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\nPhilo disputed with Diodorus respecting the idea of the [[Subjunctive possibility|possible]] and the criteria of the truth of [[material conditional|conditional statements]].\n\nIn regards to things possible, Philo was similar to [[Aristotle]], as he recognized that not only what is, or will be, is possible (as Diodorus maintained), but also what is in itself conformable to the particular purpose of the object in question, as of straw to burn.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''Nat. Qual.'' i. 14.</ref>\n\nBoth Philo and Diodorus sought for criteria for the correct form of conditional propositions, and each of them did so in a manner corresponding to what he maintained respecting the idea of the possible. Philo regarded a conditional as true unless it has both a true [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and a false [[consequent]]. Precisely, let ''T<sub>0</sub>'' and ''T<sub>1</sub>'' be true statements, and let ''F<sub>0</sub>'' and ''F<sub>1</sub>'' be false statements; then, according to Philo, each of the following conditionals is a true statement, because it is not the case that the consequent is false while the antecedent is true (it is not the case that a false statement is asserted to follow from a true statement):\n* If ''T<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>1</sub>''\n* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''T<sub>0</sub>''\n* If ''F<sub>0</sub>'', then ''F<sub>1</sub>''\nThe following conditional does not meet this requirement, and is therefore a false statement according to Philo:\n* If ''T<sub>0</sub>, then ''F<sub>0</sub>''\nIndeed, Sextus says \"According to &#91;Philo&#93;, there are three ways in which a conditional may be true, and one in which it may be false.\"<ref name=sextus-adv-math>Sextus Empiricus, ''Adv. Math.'' viii, Section 113</ref> Philo's criterion of truth is what would now be called a [[truth-functional]] definition of \"if ... then\"; it is the definition used in [[predicate logic|modern logic]].\n\nIn contrast, Diodorus allowed the validity of conditionals only when the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion.<ref name=sextus-adv-math /><ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Hypotyp.'' ii. 110, comp.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 47, ''de Fato'', 6.</ref> A century later, the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Chrysippus]] attacked the assumptions of both Philo and Diodorus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite SEP |url-id=dialectical-school |title=Dialectical School |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}\n*[http://www.ontology.co/biblio/master-argument-biblio.htm Selected Bibliography on the \"Master Argument\" in Diodorus Cronus and Philo the Dialectician] with a bibliography on Diodorus and the problem of future contingents\n\n{{SmithDGRBM|article=Philon the Megarian or Dialectician |volume=III|page=312-313}}\n\n{{Megarian philosophy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philo The Dialectician}}\n[[Category:Ancient Greek philosophers]]\n[[Category:4th-century BC philosophers]]\n[[Category:Megarian philosophers]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek logicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Philo the Dialectician"}}}}
