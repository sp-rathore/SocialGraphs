In [[set theory]], he discovered the notion of [[proper forcing axiom|proper forcing]], an important tool in iterated [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] arguments. With [[PCF theory]], he showed that in spite of the undecidability of the most basic questions of cardinal arithmetic (such as the [[continuum hypothesis]]), there are still highly nontrivial [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] theorems about [[cardinal number|cardinal]] exponentiation. Shelah constructed a [[Kurosh monster]], an uncountable group for which every proper subgroup is countable. He showed that [[Whitehead's problem]] is [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC|independent of ZFC]]. He gave the first [[primitive recursive]] upper bound to [[Van der Waerden's theorem|van der Waerden's numbers V(C,N)]]. He extended [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] on voting systems.\n\n==Awards==\n* The first recipient of the [[Erdős Prize]], in 1977;<ref>{{cite web | title = Erdős Prize Website| url = http://imu.org.il/Prizes/ErdosPrize/erdos_prize.html|publisher=IMU.org.il}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}</ref>\n* The [[Karp Prize]] of the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]] in 1983\n* The [[Israel Prize]], for mathematics, in 1998;<ref>{{cite web | title = Israel Prize Official Site – Recipients in 1998 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/TashnagTashsab/TASNAG_TASNAT_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashnach | publisher=CMS.education.gov.il | accessdate=2014-08-31}}</ref>\n* The [[Bolyai Prize]] in 2000;<ref>{{cite web | title = Laudation of Shelah on the occasion of winning the Bolyai Prize (in Hungarian)| url = http://www.renyi.hu/~csirmaz/shelah/sh.pdf | publisher=Renyi.hu | accessdate=2014-08-31}}</ref>\n* The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics | url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/index.php?dir=site&page=winners&name=&prize=%D7%91%D7%97%D7%A8+%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%9C&year=2001&field=3004 | publisher=[[Wolf Foundation]] | year=2008 | accessdate=2014-08-31}}\n</ref>\n* The [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|EMET prize]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web | title=EMET Prize | url=http://en.emetprize.org/laureates/exact-sciences/mathematics/prof-saharon-shelah/ | year=2011 | accessdate=2014-08-31}}</ref>\n*The [[Leroy P.
