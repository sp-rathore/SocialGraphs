Montague, one of Tarski's most accomplished American students, spent his entire career teaching in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]], where he supervised the dissertations of [[Nino Cocchiarella]] and [[Hans Kamp]].\n\nMontague wrote on the foundations of [[logic]] and [[set theory]], as would befit a student of Tarski. His Ph.D. dissertation, titled ''Contributions to the Axiomatic Foundations of Set Theory'',<ref>{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Montague |first=Richard Merritt |date=June 1957 |title=Contributions to the axiomatic foundations of set theory |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b13106911~S1}}</ref> contained the first proof that all possible axiomatizations of the standard [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] must contain infinitely many axioms. In other words, ZFC cannot be finitely axiomatized.\n\nHe pioneered a logical approach to natural language [[semantics]] which became known as [[Montague grammar]]. This approach to language has been especially influential among certain computational linguists—perhaps more so than among more traditional [[Philosophy of Language|philosophers of language]]. In particular, Montague's influence lives on in grammar approaches like categorial grammar (such as Unification Categorial Grammar, Left-Associate Grammar, or [[Combinatory categorial grammar|Combinatory Categorial Grammar]]), which attempt a derivation of syntactic and semantic representation in tandem and the semantics of quantifiers, scope and discourse (Hans Kamp, a student of Montague, co-developed Discourse Representation Theory).\n\nMontague was an accomplished organist and a successful real estate investor. He died violently in his own home; the crime is unsolved to this day. Anita Feferman and Solomon Feferman argue that he usually went to bars \"cruising\" and bringing people home with him.<ref name=\"Feferman04\">Feferman and Feferman 2004: 332-3</ref> On the day that he was murdered, he brought home several people \"for some kind of soirée\", but they instead robbed his house and strangled him.<ref name=\"Feferman04\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[American philosophy]]\n*[[List of American philosophers]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Feferman, Anita, and [[Solomon Feferman]], 2004.
