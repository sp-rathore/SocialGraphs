The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]].

He committed eighty mistakes in his book which are not intelligible to you.\"{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} Ibn Taymiyyah is thought to have severely criticized Sibawayh but the actual substance of those criticisms is not known because the book that Ibn Taymiyyah wrote, ''al-Bahr'', within which he wrote the criticisms has been lost.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} He stated that when there is an explanation of an [[Ayah]] of the Qur'an or a Hadith, from the Prophet himself, the use of philology or a grammatical explanation becomes obsolete.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} He also said one should refer only to the understanding of the Salaf (first three generations of Muslims) when interpreting a word within the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":19\" /> However he did not discount the contributions of the grammarians completely.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=20-21}} Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Arabic nouns within the scriptural sources have been divided by the [[faqih|fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) into three categories; those that are defined by the shari'a, those defined by [[philology]] (lugha) and finally those that are defined by [[urf|social custom (`urf)]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} For him each of these categories of nouns had to be used in their own appropriate manner.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=21-24}}\n\n=== Madh'hab ===\nIbn Taymiyyah censured the scholars for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any resort to the Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.<ref name=\":17\" /> The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nIbn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi‘un|Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi‘ al-Tabi‘in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=\":2\" /> For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid‘ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden. He also praised and wrote a commentary on some speeches of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]].<ref name=\"qadiri\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.se/~m9783/n/itaysf_e.html |title=IBN TAYMIYYA ON FUTOOH AL-GHAYB AND SUFISM|author=G.
