He wrote his [[DPhil]] thesis ''Connections between Category Theory and Logic'' under the supervision of [[Dana Scott]] at Oxford, defending his thesis in 1974.\n\n==Career==\n\nHe continued to work with Scott as an [[Science and Engineering Research Council|SRC]] postdoctoral Research Fellow and Junior Research Fellow of [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], in Oxford, until 1976, when he moved to the USA, first as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Clark University]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], then, from 1977–1982, as [[Joseph Ritt|JF Ritt]] Assistant Professor of Mathematics at [[Columbia University]] in New York.\n\nIn 1983 he moved, with a [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] Fellowship, to the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at [[Brunel University]]. He was appointed to a Readership, and then to the Chair of Formal Systems, at Brunel in 1986.\n\nFourman was co-founder and Technical Director of Abstract Hardware Limited (AHL), a company formed in 1986. He was central in the development of the [[LAMBDA system]] (Logic And Mathematics Behind Design Automation) to aid [[hardware design]], a tool implemented in the [[Standard ML|SML]] programming language and marketed by AHL. He left the company in 1997.\n\nIn 1988 he joined the [[Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and was appointed to the Chair of Computer Systems in the Department of Computer Science.\nIn 1998 he was founding Head of the Division of Informatics, which became the current [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]], incorporating the former Department of Artificial Intelligence, the [[Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute]], the Centre for Cognitive Science, the [[Human Communication Research Centre]], and the Department of Computer Science.\n\nHe has again been Head of the School of Informatics since August 2002.\n\nHe has held visiting positions at universities in [[University of Paris|Paris]] (1975), [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]] (1977, 1980), [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (1979–80), [[University of Sydney|Sydney]] (1982), [[McGill University|Montreal]] (1983), and [[University of Western Australia|Perth]] (1994).\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Citation|last= Fourman |first=Michael P. |year=1977|chapter=The logic of topoi|editor=Jon Barwise|title=Handbook of Mathematical Logic (Stud.
