From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in [[Steinfurt|Burgsteinfurt]], and then at [[Lüdenscheid]] until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (''Academy of Sciences'') in Göttingen, and was an honorary professor at the [[University of Münster]].\n\nIn 1928, Ackermann helped [[David Hilbert]] turn his 1917 &ndash; 22 lectures on introductory [[mathematical logic]] into a text, ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''. This text contained the first exposition ever of [[first-order logic]], and posed the problem of its [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] and [[Decidability (logic)|decidability]]  ([[Entscheidungsproblem]]). Ackermann went on to construct [[consistency proof]]s for [[set theory]] (1937), [[Peano arithmetic|full arithmetic]] (1940), [[Logic|type-free logic]] (1952), and a new [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatization]] of [[set theory]] (1956).\n\nAlthough Ackermann did not choose a university career and rather continued as a high school teacher, he was continually engaged in research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life.  He died in [[Lüdenscheid]], [[Germany]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ackermann coding]]\n*[[Ackermann ordinal]]\n*[[Ackermann set theory]]\n*[[Ackermann function]]\n*[[Inverse Ackermann function]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*1928. \"On Hilbert's construction of the [[real number]]s\" in [[Jean van Heijenoort]], ed., 1967.
