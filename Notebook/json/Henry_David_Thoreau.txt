In his early years he followed [[Transcendentalism]], a loose and eclectic [[Idealism|idealist]] philosophy advocated by Emerson, Fuller, and Alcott. They held that an ideal spiritual state transcends, or goes beyond, the physical and empirical, and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine. In their view, Nature is the outward sign of inward spirit, expressing the \"radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts\", as Emerson wrote in ''Nature'' (1836).\n\n[[File:Thoreau1967stamp.jpg|thumb|right|1967 U.S. postage stamp honoring Thoreau, designed by [[Leonard Baskin]]]]\n\nOn April 18, 1841, Thoreau moved into the [[Ralph Waldo Emerson House|Emerson house]].<ref name=\"Cheever\">Cheever, Susan (2006).

(The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, was patented by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]] in 1795). His other source had been [[Tantiusques]], an Indian operated mine in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]].

Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation. A new, expanded edition of the journals is underway, published by [[Princeton University Press]]. Today, Thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost American writers, both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics.

He was himself a highly skilled canoeist; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], after a ride with him, noted that \"Mr. Thoreau managed the boat so perfectly, either with two paddles or with one, that it seemed instinct with his own will, and to require no physical effort to guide it.\" <ref>Nathaniel Hawthorne, Passages From the American Note-Books, entry for September 2, 1842.</ref>\n\nHe was not a strict vegetarian, though he said he preferred that diet<ref>Brooks, Van Wyck.

He wrote in ''Walden'': \"The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially.

Instead he sought a middle ground, the [[pastoral]] realm that integrates both nature and culture. His philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitration between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of North American humanity. He decried the latter endlessly but felt the teachers need to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred \"partially cultivated country.\" His idea of being \"far in the recesses of the wilderness\" of Maine was to \"travel the logger's path and the Indian trail\", but he also hiked on pristine untouched land. In the essay \"Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher\" [[Roderick Nash]] writes: \"Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance.\"<ref>Roderick Nash, ''Wilderness and the American Mind: Henry David Thoreau: Philosopher''.</ref>\nOn alcohol, Thoreau wrote: \"I would fain keep sober always...

Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.\"<ref>King, M.L.

[Bibliographic data necessary for this ref.]</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nAlthough his writings would receive widespread acclaim, Thoreau's ideas were not universally applauded. Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] judged Thoreau's endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of \"unmanly\" [[effeminacy]] and \"womanish solitude\", while deeming him a self-indulgent \"skulker\".<ref>Stevenson, Robert Louis. [http://thoreau.eserver.org/stevens1.html \"Henry David Thoreau: His Character and Opinions\"]. Cornhill Magazine. June 1880.</ref>\n\n[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] had mixed feelings about Thoreau. He noted that \"He is a keen and delicate observer of nature,—a genuine observer,—which, I suspect, is almost as rare a character as even an original poet; and Nature, in return for his love, seems to adopt him as her especial child, and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness.\" <ref>Nathaniel Hawthorne, ''Passages From the American Note-Books'', entry for September 2, 1842.</ref> On the other hand, he also wrote that Thoreau \"repudiated all regular modes of getting a living, and seems inclined to lead a sort of Indian life among civilized men\".<ref>Hawthorne, ''The Heart of Hawthorne's Journals, pg. 106.</ref><ref>Borst, Raymond R. ''The Thoreau Log: A Documentary Life of Henry David Thoreau, 1817–1862.'' New York: G.K. Hall, 1992.</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein, poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] detested what he deemed to be the \"wicked\" and \"heathenish\" message of ''Walden'', claiming that Thoreau wanted man to \"lower himself to the level of a [[woodchuck]] and walk on four legs\".<ref>Wagenknecht, Edward. ''John Greenleaf Whittier: A Portrait in Paradox''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1967: 112.</ref>\n\nIn response to such criticisms, English novelist [[George Eliot]], writing for the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', characterized such critics as uninspired and narrow-minded:\n{{quote|text=People—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every man's life ordered according to a particular pattern, and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them, may pooh-pooh Mr. Thoreau and this episode in his history, as unpractical and dreamy.<ref>[[The New England Quarterly]], Vol. 6, No. 4 (Dec., 1933), pp. 733–746</ref>|}}\n\nThoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work ''Walden'' by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries:\n{{quote|text=I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I maintained. [...] Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men's lives; [...] I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.<ref>Thoreau ''Walden'' (1854)</ref>|}}\n\nRecent criticism has accused Thoreau of hypocrisy, misanthropy, and being sanctimonious, based on his writings in ''Walden'',<ref name=neworker1>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |title=Henry David Thoreau, Hypocrite |last1=Schultz |first1=Kathryn |date=October 19, 2015 |publisher=The New Yorker |access-date=October 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019170355/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum |archivedate=October 19, 2015 }}</ref> although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective.<ref name=medium1>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@TheNewThoreau/why-do-we-love-thoreau-because-he-was-right-175251814c |title=Why do we love Thoreau?
