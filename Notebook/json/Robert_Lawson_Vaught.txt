C. Berkeley]</ref>\n\n==Life==\nVaught was a musical prodigy in his youth, in his case playing the piano. He began his university studies at [[Pomona College]], at age 16. When [[World War II]] broke out, he enlisted into the [[US Navy]] which assigned him to the [[University of California]]'s [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12]] program. He graduated in 1945 with an AB in physics.\n\nIn 1946, he began a Ph.D. in mathematics at Berkeley. He initially worked under the supervision of the topologist [[John L. Kelley]], writing on [[C* algebra]]s. In 1950, in response to [[McCarthyism|McCarthyite]] pressures, Berkeley required all staff to sign a [[loyalty oath]]. Kelley declined and moved his career to [[Tulane University]] for three years. Vaught then began afresh under the supervision of [[Alfred Tarski]], completing in 1954 a thesis on [[mathematical logic]], titled ''Topics in the Theory of Arithmetical Classes and Boolean Algebras''. After spending four years at the [[University of Washington]], Vaught returned to Berkeley in 1958, where he remained until his 1991 retirement.\n\nIn 1957, Vaught married Marilyn Maca; they had two children.\n\n==Work==\nVaught's work is primarily focused on [[model theory]]. In 1957, he and Tarski introduced [[elementary submodel]]s and the [[Tarski–Vaught test]] characterizing them. In 1962, he and [[Michael D. Morley|M. D. Morley]] pioneered the concept of a [[saturated structure]]. His investigations on countable models of first order theories led him to the [[Vaught conjecture]] stating that the [[cardinality|number]] of countable models of a complete first order theory (in a countable language) is always either finite, or countably infinite, or equinumerous with the real numbers.  Vaught's [[Vaught's theorem|\"Never 2\" theorem]] states that a complete first order theory cannot have exactly 2 nonisomorphic countable models.\n\nHe considered his best work was his paper \"Invariant sets in topology and logic\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, introducing the [[Vaught transform]]. He is known for the Tarski–Vaught test for elementary substructures, the [[Feferman–Vaught theorem]], the [[Łoś–Vaught test]] for completeness and decidability, the Vaught two-cardinal theorem, and his conjecture on the nonfinite axiomatizability of totally [[categorical theory|categorical theories]] (this work eventually led to [[geometric stability theory]]).\n\nVaught was a capable teacher of undergraduates, and his writing was reputed for elegance and clarity. His ''Set Theory: An Introduction'' (2001, 2nd ed.) attests to his abilities in this regard.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Łoś–Vaught test]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Feferman, Anita Burdman, and [[Solomon Feferman]], 2004.
