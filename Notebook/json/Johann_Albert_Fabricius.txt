The son received his early education from his father, who on his deathbed recommended him to the care of the theologian [[Valentin Alberti]].\n\nHe studied under [[J. G. Herrichen]], and afterwards at [[Quedlinburg]] under [[Samuel Schmid]]. It was in Schmid’s library, as he afterwards said, that he found the two books, [[Kaspar von Barth]]'s compendium ''Adversariorum libri LX'' (1624) and [[Daniel Georg Morhof]]'s ''Polyhistor'' (1688), which suggested to him the idea of his ''Bibliothecæ'', the kind of works on which his great reputation was ultimately founded.\n\nOn returning to Leipzig in 1686, he published anonymously two years later his first work, ''Scriptorum recentiorum decas'', an attack on ten writers of the day.  His ''Decas Decadum, sive plagiariorum et pseudonymorum centuria'' (1689) is the only one of his works to which he signs the name Faber.  Fabricius then applied himself to the study of medicine, which, however, he relinquished for that of [[theology]]; and having gone to [[Hamburg]] in 1693, he proposed to travel abroad, when the unexpected tidings that the expense of his education had absorbed his whole patrimony, and even left him in debt to his trustee, forced him to abandon this project.  In 1693 he published a doctoral dissertation ''De Platonismo Philonis Judaei'' which contributed to [[Philo of Alexandria]]'s losing his position as an \"honorary [[Church Father]]\".<ref>Runia, David T. Philo in Early Christian Literature, p. 31.</ref>\n\nHe therefore remained at Hamburg in the capacity of librarian to [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (theologian)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] (1650–1712).  In 1696 he accompanied his patron to [[Sweden]]; and on his return to Hamburg, not long afterwards, he became a candidate for the chair of logic and philosophy.  The suffrages being equally divided between Fabricius and [[Sebastian Edzardus]], one of his opponents, the appointment was decided by lot in favour of Edzardus; but in 1699 Fabricius succeeded [[Vincent Placcius]] in the chair of [[rhetoric]] and [[ethics]], a post which he held until his death, refusing invitations to [[Greifswald]], [[Kiel]], [[Giessen]], and [[Wittenberg]].  He died at Hamburg.  The details of the life of Fabricius are to be found in ''De Vita et Scriptis J. A. Fabricii Commentarius'', by his son-in-law, [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus|H. S. Reimarus]], the well-known editor of [[Dio Cassius]], published at Hamburg in 1737.<ref>[[Karl Christian Wilhelm Felix Bähr|C. F.

Schol.'' iii (1908).</ref>\n\n==Works==\nFabricius is credited with 128 books. He was a celebrated bibliographer and collector of manuscripts, and many of his volumes are compilations, editions, or anthologies.\n\n===Bibliotheca Latina===\nOne of the most famed and laborious of his works is the ''Bibliotheca Latina''<ref>(1697) republished in an improved and amended form by [[Johann August Ernesti|J.A. Ernesti]] (1773)</ref> The divisions of the compilation are:\n*the writers to the age of [[Tiberius]]\n*to that of the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|Antonines]]\n*to the decay of the language\n*fragments from old authors, and chapters on early Christian literature. \n*A supplementary work was ''Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae Aetatis''<ref> (1734–1736) supplementary volume by Christian Schottgen, 1746; ed. Mansi, 1754</ref>\n\n===Bibliotheca Graeca===\nFabricius' most important work is the ''Bibliotheca Graeca'' (1705–1728, revised and continued by [[Gottlieb Christoph Harless|G. C. Harles]], 1790—1812), a work which has been denominated ''maximus antiquae eruditionis thesaurus'' (the greatest repository of ancient learning). Its divisions are marked off by [[Homer]], [[Plato]], [[Jesus]], [[Constantine I|Constantine]], and the capture of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, while a sixth section is devoted to canon law, jurisprudence and medicine.\n\n===Other works===\n*''Specimen elencticum historiae logicae'', a catalogue of the treatises on logic known by him (1699)\n*''Bibliotheca Antiquaria'', an account of the writers whose works illustrated Jewish, Greek, Roman, and Christian antiquities (1713)\n*''Centifolium Lutheranum'', a [[Lutheran]] bibliography (1728)\n*''Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica'' (1718)\n* Preface to [[Vincent Placcius]]'s ''Theatrum anonymorum et pseudonymorum'' (1708).\n\nFabricius was also influential in articulating current scholarly notions of the \"[[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha]]\" and \"[[New Testament Apocrypha]]\", through his compilations of collections of texts and excerpts:\n*''Codex apocryphus Novi Testamenti'' (1703)\n*''Codex pseudepigraphus Veteris Testamenti'' (1713)\n*''Codicis pseudepigraphi Veteris Testamenti Volumen alterum accedit Josephi veteris Christiani auctoria Hypomnesticon'' (1723)\nThese volumes were widely cited and consulted as recently as 20th century.<ref>Chisholm, Hugh, ed.
