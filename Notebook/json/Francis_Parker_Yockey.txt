This book argues for a culture-based, totalitarian path for the preservation of Western culture.<ref>ADL Research Report 'Poisoning the Airwaves: The Extremist Message of Hate on Shortwave Radio' U.S. Newswire February 1, 1996</ref>\n\nYockey actively supported many [[far-right politics|far-right]] causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences of many [[White nationalist]] and [[New Right]] movements.<ref name=\"spotlight1\">Liberty Lobby in the spotlight with Duke, Buchanan in race Chicago Tribune January 12, 1992</ref> Although he was a devotee of [[Oswald Spengler]] (who was critical of the Nazis), Yockey was a passionate proponent of [[antisemitism]], and expressed a reverence for [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|National Socialism]], and a general affinity for [[Fascism|fascist]] causes.  Yockey contacted or worked with the Nazi aligned [[Silver Shirts]] and the [[German-American Bund]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Brad Steiger|author2=Sherry Hansen Steiger|title=Conspiracies and Secret Societies: The Complete Dossier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h6_na9j0tcC&pg=PA511|year=2006|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-174-9|page=511}}</ref>  After the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yockey became even more active in [[neo-Fascism|neo-Fascist]] causes.\n\nYockey believed that the United States was an engine of liberalism, controlled by [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jews]]. Yockey also met [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], and wrote [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] [[propaganda]] on behalf of the Egyptian government, seeing the [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] nationalist movement as another ally to challenge \"the Jewish-American power.\"  While in prison for falsified passports, he was visited by American [[Right-wing politics|right-winger]] [[Willis Carto]], who ultimately became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's writings.\n\n==Early life==\nMany biographical facts about Yockey cannot be known with absolute certainty. The majority comes from the accounts of those who knew him and from [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] efforts to gain intelligence in regard to his activities, as recorded by his biographer [[Kevin Coogan]] in his book ''Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International.''\n \nYockey was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the youngest of four siblings,<ref>Appendix, Francis Parker Yockey, ''Imperium'' (Abergele: The Palingenesis Project (Wermod and Wermod Publishing Group), 2013, p. 799.</ref> but his family returned to their original homestead in [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]], [[Michigan]] during the [[Great Depression]]. His parents were [[Anglophile]]s who raised Yockey to appreciate [[Europe]] and high culture. Subsequently, Yockey's mother introduced him to [[European classical music|classical music]]. Young Francis had a prodigious talent for the [[piano]] and developed his repertoire to include pieces by [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]], and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]. Yockey claimed that his ideas about [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] were initially the result of a car accident, wherein he was assaulted by several [[African Americans]]. As a result of this attack he lost his front teeth and wore [[dentures]] for the rest of his short life.\n\nBefore becoming a devotee of [[elitism|elitist]] and [[Antimaterialism|anti-materialist]]{{dn|date=September 2016}} [[Oswald Spengler]], he briefly flirted with [[Marxism]]. Aside from Spengler, he was heavily influenced by the ideas of German legal scholar [[Carl Schmitt]].  Like Spengler, he rejected the strict biological view of race, instead preferring a spiritual conception of race married with [[Karl Haushofer]]'s idea of [[geopolitics]]; but unlike Spengler, who regarded the Nazis as too bourgeois, Yockey believed in [[Germany|German]] [[Nazism|National Socialism]], and supported various [[Fascism|Fascist]] and neo-Fascist causes for the remainder of his life, including [[anti-Semitism]].\n\nAs a university student in the late 1930s, Yockey had his first political essay published in ''[[Social Justice]]'', a periodical distributed by [[Charles Coughlin|Fr. Charles Coughlin]], known as the \"radio priest,\" At the time Coughlin was widely known for his sympathetic view of the anti-[[Bolshevist]] policies associated with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]], and [[Francisco Franco|Gen. Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]].\n\nYockey attended at least seven universities. He studied for two years (1934–36) as an undergraduate at the [[University of Michigan]], and then transferred to [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]'s [[School of Foreign Service]]. He completed his undergraduate degree at the [[University of Arizona]], and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from the [[University of Notre Dame]] Law School in 1941.\n\nAccording to an FBI report, Yockey was [[honorably discharged]] from the US Army in 1943 because of [[delusions of persecution]] and [[paranoia]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/foia_Yockey_Francis_P.-HQ-3/Yockey_Francis_P.-HQ-3#page/n37/mode/2up FBI file on Francis Yockey, 1959]</ref>\n\n==Later life and works==\n\nOver time, Yockey contacted or worked with many of the far-right figures and organizations of his day. These included the [[German-American Bund]], the [[National German-American Alliance]], [[William Dudley Pelley]]'s [[Silver Shirts]], [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley's]] [[Union Movement]], [[George Sylvester Viereck]], the American [[H. Keith Thompson]], [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], and [[James H. Madole]]'s [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]]. After the war Thompson and Madole became advocates of Yockey's worldview and published some of his essays. While Yockey's pro-Fascist activities began in the late 1930s, they did not end there. Unfazed by the defeat of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in the [[World War II|Second World War]], Yockey actually became even more active in [[neo-Fascism|neo-Fascist]] causes after 1945. From this point forward, he remained dedicated solely to his cause of reviving Fascism. He dispensed with any semblance of an ordinary life, and remained constantly on the move, travelling to wherever he felt he could pursue his goals most effectively, and cultivating countless contacts along the way.\n\nYockey's ideas were usually embraced only by those, however, who could countenance the necessity of an alliance between the far Left and the far Right, which was a fundamental pillar of Yockey's ideas. The [[American Nazi Party]] of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], for example, rejected Yockey on the basis of his anti-American attitude, as well as his willingness to work with [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] [[Communist]] governments and movements, as the ANP adhered solely to the ideals of absolute anti-[[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] National Socialism, as had been advocated by Hitler. (Yockey, however, seems to have remained unaware of Rockwell, as he told [[Willis Carto]] that he had never heard of the ANP when Carto visited him in prison in 1960.) Other proponents of Universal [[Nazism]], such as Rockwell's ally [[Colin Jordan]], disagreed with Yockey's views on race, and saw Yockeyism as advocating a kind of \"New [[Strasserism]]\" which would undermine true Nazism.\n\nIn early 1946, Yockey began working for the [[United States War Department]] as a post-trial review attorney for the [[Nuremberg Trials]] in Germany. He soon began agitating against [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] occupation of Germany, as well as what he perceived to be the biased procedures of the Nuremberg tribunal. Eventually, he was fired for \"abandonment of position\" in November 1946.\n\nWithout notes, Yockey wrote his first book, ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'', in [[Brittas Bay]], [[Ireland]] over the winter and early spring of 1948. It is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century [[materialism]] and [[rationalism]]. It is dedicated to 'The hero of the twentieth century'; allegedly, he intended that description to apply to [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref>Theodore J. O'Keefe of the Journal of Historical Review makes this assertion in his review of Kevin Coggan's 1999 study of Yockey. According to the late Doris Foster Lessard, an historian for many years in [[Ludington, Michigan]], this information about ''Imperium'' was apparently known to Ludington residents of Yockey's parents' social circle.</ref> In a rebuttal to the accusations of [[Arnold Leese]], Yockey stated that the \"hero\" of which he spoke was indeed Hitler. The views expressed in ''Imperium'' were endorsed by far-Right thinkers around the world including former German General [[Otto Remer]]; Professor of [[Classics]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[Revilo P. Oliver]]; and [[Italy|Italian]] [[Esotericism|esotericist]] [[Julius Evola]]. Yockey became embittered with Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] after the latter refused to publish or review ''Imperium'' upon its completion, after having promised to do so. [[Guy Chesham]], one of the leaders of Mosley's movement, actually resigned from it, in part because of Mosley's treatment of Yockey. ''Imperium'' subscribes to Spengler's suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the 'Roman' role in Western Civilization by uniting all its constituent states into one large empire.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=McNaughton, D.L.|title=Spengler's Philosophy, and its implication that Europe has 'lost its way'|journal=Comparative Civilizations Review|publisher=ISCSC, Michigan, USA|volume=67|year=2012|pages=7–15|url=http://DLMcN.com/oswaldspengler.html}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dlmcn.com/YockeyReview.html ''Brief Review of \"Imperium\"'']</ref>\n\nAlong with former Mosleyites [[Guy Chesham]] and [[John Gannon (Mosleyite)|John Gannon]], Yockey formed the [[European Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1948-49. The ELF issued a newsletter, ''Frontfighter'', and published Yockey's virulent  [[anti-American]], [[anti-communist]] and [[anti-semitic]] text ''The Proclamation of London''.<ref name=\"alphalink.com.au\">[http://www.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/proclamation.html ''The Proclamation of London'', full text]</ref> In Yockey's view, \"social decay\" was permeated by the Jew, who as a \"Culture-distorter\" and a \"bearer of Culture-disease\", \"instinctively allied himself with all forms, theories, doctrines and practices of decadence in every sphere of life\". \"America is [the Jew and the liberal-communist-democrat]'s programme in process of actualization, and its example shows Europe what the liberal-communist-democratic regime of Culture-distortion is preparing for it during the coming generations\".<ref name=\"alphalink.com.au\"/> Yockey was also approached by the group around the anti-Communist Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] in 1951. He was asked to ghost-write a speech for McCarthy which stressed the importance of greater friendship between Germany and the [[United States]], although McCarthy never delivered it as the theme of the speech, when it was announced, aroused a great deal of controversy.\n \nIn late 1952, Yockey traveled to [[Prague]] and witnessed the [[Prague Trials]].  He believed they \"foretold a [[Russia]]n break with [[Jewry]]\", a view he put forward in his article ''What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?''.<ref>[http://www.alphalink.com.au/~radnat/fpyockey/prague.html ''What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?'', full text]</ref> Indeed, that prediction was vindicated by the fact that the last Jewish member of the Soviet Presidium, [[Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich|Lazar Kaganovich]], was expelled in 1957 - having been sidelined as early as 1953. (In addition, after sympathizing with [[Israel]] in its [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948-49 war]], Russia switched sides and supported the Arabs in subsequent conflicts.) Yockey believed that [[Stalinism]] had purged [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] [[Communism]] of [[Jew| Jewish influence]]. He spent the remainder of his life attempting to forge an alliance between the worldwide forces of Communism and the international network of the extreme Right of which he was a part, with an aim toward weakening or overthrowing the government of the United States.\n\nYockey met [[Egypt]]ian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], whom he called \"a great and vigorous man\", in [[Cairo]] in 1953.  He worked briefly for the Egyptian [[Information Ministry]], writing [[anti-Zionist]] [[propaganda]].  Yockey saw the rise of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] states in the [[Third World]], and in particular [[Arab nationalism]], as significant [[geopolitical]] challenges to \"the Jewish-American power\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/world.html |title=The World in Flames: An Estimate of the World Situation|date=February 1961|author=Francis Parker Yockey |accessdate=2008-09-15|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/integral_tradition/world.html&date=2009-10-26+00:28:00|archivedate=2009-10-26}}</ref> Some speculate that Yockey made clandestine trips during the 1950s into [[East Germany]], and possibly even into the USSR itself, attempting to cultivate Communist ties. It is also known that Yockey visited [[Cuba]] shortly after the revolution of [[Fidel Castro]], in the hopes of winning Cuban support for his anti-American alliance. He met with some lower-level officials, but nothing is known to have come of it.\n\nYockey was continuously pursued by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) for over a decade, which he avoided by adopting numerous aliases. He was finally arrested in 1960 after returning to the United States from abroad, as his suitcase was sent to the wrong airport. When the authorities opened it to determine whose suitcase it was, they discovered several of Yockey's falsified passports and birth certificates. When this was reported to the federal government, the FBI tracked him down in Oakland, California and arrested him. (Curiously, he was staying at the home of a friend who was thought to be Jewish, a Holocaust survivor and teacher of Hebrew at Temple Beth Abraham, a local synagogue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}) While in prison, he was visited by the American Rightist [[Willis Carto]], who later became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's ideas. Yockey was soon after found dead with an empty [[cyanide]] capsule nearby while in a jail cell in [[San Francisco]] under FBI supervision, leaving a note in which he claimed that he was committing suicide in order to protect the anonymity of his political contacts.\n\n[[Maurice Bardèche]], a French writer of fascist sympathies, wrote about his meeting with Yockey in his semi-autobiographical novel ''Suzanne et le taudis''. Yockey, called \"Ulrich Clarence\" in the book, was described by Bardèche as a \"lunatic.\" Most of Yockey's other acquaintances, however, always regarded him as a brilliant and dedicated fighter for the cause in which he believed.\n\n==Impact of ideas==\nYockey was rather unusual among thinkers of the far right wing post-[[World War II|Second World War]]. \nMost European and American neo-Fascists and other [[Right-wing politics|rightists]] of the post-war period advocated an alliance with the [[United States of America|United States]] as the best hope for the survival of Western culture under the threat of Communism. But Yockey\nfelt that an alliance of the Right with the Left was a far-more desirable course.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  This proposed alliance is referred to as a ''Red-Brown Alliance'' (the color [[red]] representing the [[Far-left politics|Far Left]] and the color [[brown]] representing the [[Far-right politics|Far Right]]).  Yockey felt that American universalism, democracy and consumer culture, which was by then spreading into western Europe and much of the rest of the world, as well as its alliance with [[Zionism]], was far more corrosive and deadly to the true spirit of the West than was the Soviet Union. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Yockey believed that the USSR had become genuinely anti-Zionist under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], that in its authoritarianism it preserved something of the traditional European concept of hierarchy, and he felt it could more easily be adapted to a Rightist orientation over time than was possible in the egalitarian United States.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  He thus believed that true Rightists should aid the spread of Communism and [[Third World]] anti-colonial movements wherever possible, and he remained staunchly opposed to the government and culture of the United States, which he did not even consider to be truly Western in nature. He was also rather unusual at the time (along with Evola) in his advocacy of a spiritual, as opposed to biological, understanding of race. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nYockey himself did not have a very significant influence on the American extreme Right, however, which, throughout the [[Cold War]], for the most part remained staunchly anti-Communist. He had a much greater impact in Europe, where intellectuals of the Right, especially the current of thought sometimes called the [[European New Right]], including the Belgian [[Jean Thiriart]], the Russian [[Aleksandr Dugin]], and French writers [[Alain de Benoist]] and [[Guillaume Faye]], adopted positions similar to Yockey's, although there is little evidence his work influenced them in this.\n\nYockey's present influence is reflected mostly through the work of [[Willis Carto]] and his [[Liberty Lobby]] and successor organizations. Carto ran the ''Youth for George Wallace'' group supporting segregationist [[George Wallace]]'s 1968 presidential campaign. That group formed the basis for the [[National Youth Alliance]] which promoted Yockey's political philosophy and his book ''Imperium''. Many supporters of Yockey, such as [[H. Keith Thompson]], claim that Carto failed to understand Yockey's ideas on their deepest level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Far-right politics]]\n* [[German-Soviet Axis talks]]\n* [[Heartland Theory]]\n* [[Neo-Nazism]]\n* [[Oswald Spengler]]\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Kevin Coogan]], ''[[Dreamer of the Day]]: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International'' Brooklyn, NY: Autonomedia, 1998 ISBN 1-57027-039-2 ([http://www.autonomedia.org/dreameroftheday2.html publisher's blurb], [http://www.autonomedia.org/dreameroftheday3.html Table of contents]) - The only biography of Yockey ever written, Coogan's work on Yockey's life is definitive, but the 'facts' he presents regarding other figures should be regarded with caution.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n* ''Varange: Life and Thoughts of Yockey'' by [[Kerry Bolton]], ([[Renaissance Press]], [[New Zealand]], [http://www.nsm88.com/articles/renaissance%20press%20catalogue.html Catalogue])\n* Francis Parker Yockey, ''Imperium'', Abergele: The Palingenesis Project (Wermod and Wermod Publishing Group), 2013.
