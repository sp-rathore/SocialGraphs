He writes about the [[history of philosophy]], political theory, religion, [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], literature and theatre.<ref>{{Cite web|title = simon-critchley|url = http://www.simoncritchley.org/#!about/c1mnx|website = simon-critchley|accessdate = 2015-09-16}}</ref> He studied philosophy and has held visiting professorship at numerous universities. He has authored many books, and his work has been acknowledged. He argues that religious disappointment raises the question of meaning and has to, as he sees it, deal with the problem of nihilism; political disappointment provokes the question of justice and raises the need for a coherent ethics.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nCritchley was born on 27 February 1960 in Hertfordshire, England.
