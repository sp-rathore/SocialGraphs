Assen: Royal van Gorcum, 2012.</ref> – October 27, 1485) was a pre-[[Erasmus|Erasmian]] [[Humanism|humanist]] of the northern [[Low Countries]], famous for his supple [[Latin]] and one of the first north of the Alps to know [[Greek language|Greek]] well. Agricola was a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] scholar towards the end of his life, an educator, musician and builder of a church [[organ (music)|organ]], a poet in Latin as well as the vernacular, a diplomat and a sportsman of sorts ([[boxing]]{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for this interesting claim, all of his portraits show an unharmed very pointed nose|date=July 2016}}). He is best known today as the author of ''De inventione dialectica'', as the father of northern European humanism and as a zealous anti-[[Scholasticism|scholastic]] in the late-fifteenth century.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Image:Rudolf Agricola 2.jpg|thumb|<center>Rodolphus Agricola</center>|right]]\nAgricola was born at [[Baflo]] in the Dutch province of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] as the illegitimate son of the cleric Hendrik Vries, who later became an abbot, and Zycka Huesman, a rich farmer's daughter.<ref>[https://www.kb.nl/themas/filosofie/rodolphus-agricola/het-leven-van-rodolphus-agricola {{nl}} Biography at the Dutch [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]]</ref> He was originally named ''Roelof Huesman'' or ''Huisman'' by his mother's surname. The Latin adjective ''Phrisius'' identifies him as a [[Frisians|Frisian]].\n\nEducated first by the celebrated school of St. Maarten in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], thanks to his father's help he matriculated at the university of [[Erfurt]] (BA in 1458). He went on to [[Leuven|Louvain]] University (MA in 1465), where he won renown for the purity of his Latin and for his skill in disputation. He concentrated his studies on [[Cicero]] and [[Quintilian]], and during his university years added French and Greek to his ever-growing list of languages. At the end of his life he would learn Hebrew in order to be able to read the Old Testament - and especially the Psalms - unadulterated by translation.\n\nIn the 1460s Agricola travelled to Italy, where he associated with humanist masters and statesmen.  From 1468 (?) until 1475 he studied civil law at the university of [[Pavia]], and later went to [[Ferrara]] (1475–1479), where he became the protégé of Prince d'[[House of Este|Este]] of Ferrara, was a pupil of [[Theodor Gaza]] and attended lectures by the famous [[Battista Guarino]].  He devoted himself wholly to the study of classical texts. He won renown for the elegance of his Latin style and his knowledge of philosophy. Also while in Ferrara he gained formal employment as the organist to the ducal chapel, at that time one of the most opulent musical establishments in Europe.  He held that post until 1479, after which he returned to the North to become secretary to the city of Groningen. Here at the Cistercian Abbey of St Bernard at Aduard near Groningen and at 's-Heerenbergh near Emmerich in the south-east he was at the centre of a group of scholars and humanists with whom he kept up a lively exchange of letters. His correspondents included the musician and choirmaster of Antwerp, [[Jacobus Barbireau|Jacobus Barbirianus]] (Barbireau), [[Alexander Hegius von Heek]], rector of the Latin school at Deventer (of Erasmian fame), and the humanist scholar and later famed student of Hebrew, [[Johannes Reuchlin]].\n\nIn 1470 he taught a deaf child how to communicate orally and in writing. ''De inventione dialectica'' documents this pioneering educational effort.\n\nOnce in Germany again, he spent time in [[Dillingen an der Donau|Dillingen]], where he continued to correspond with humanist friends and colleagues throughout Europe, promoting interest in his project to promote the study of classical learning and the ''studia humanitatis''. He remained an independent scholar, unattached to a university or religious establishment—this independence became a hallmark of humanist scholars. In Dillingen Agricola in 1479 completed his ''De inventione dialectica'' (''On Dialectical Invention''), which argued for the precise application of ''[[topical logic|loci]]'' in scholarly argumentation.\n\nFrom 1480 to 1484 he held the post of secretary of the city of Groningen.\n\nIn 1481, Agricola spent six months in Brussels at the court of archduke Maximilian (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], the Holy Roman Emperor). Friends attempted to dissuade him from accepting the archduke's patronage; they feared that the archduke's influence would undermine his philosophical ideals. He also declined the offer to become head of a Latin school at Antwerp.\n\nIn 1484, Agricola moved to [[Heidelberg]] by invitation of Johann von [[Dalberg]], the Bishop of Worms. The two men had met in Pavia, and they became close friends in Heidelberg. The bishop was a generous benefactor of learning. At this time Agricola began studying Hebrew, and he is said{{or|date=August 2013}} to have published an original translation of the Psalms. In 1485, Dalberg was sent{{by whom|date=August 2013}} as an ambassador to [[Pope Innocent VIII]] in Rome. Agricola accompanied him and was struck gravely ill on their journey.\n\nHe died shortly after their return to Heidelberg.  [[Ermolao Barbaro]] composed an epitaph for him.<ref>Contemporaries of Erasmus a biographical register of the Renaissance and Reformation, v.1-3, A-Z”, Peter G Bietenholz; niv. of Toronto Press 2003, pg.16 [http://books.google.com/books?id=hruQ386SfFcC], ISBN 0-8020-8577-6</ref>\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\n''De inventione dialectica'' was influential in creating a place for logic in rhetorical studies, and was of significance in the education of early humanists.\n\n<blockquote>It was a critical, and systematic treatment of ideas and concepts related to dialectics. \"The significance of ''De inventione dialectica'' for the history of argumentation is that it assimilated the art of dialectic to that of rhetoric. Argumentation focused not on truth but on what might be said with reason. Accordingly, Agricola focused on the ''Topics'' rather than the ''Analytics'' of [[Aristotle]] and on [[Cicero]], but also on the writings of historians, poets, and orators. Thus, for Agricola, dialectic was an open field; the art of finding 'whatever can be said with any degree of probability on any subject'(Hamilton, David. ''From Dialectic to Didactic'').</blockquote>\n\nIt also affected the [[deaf]] community. He held that a person who is born deaf can express himself by putting down his thoughts in writing.  The book was not published until 1515. His statement that deaf people can be taught a language is one of the earliest positive statements about deafness on record (Gannon, 1981).\n\nAgricola's ''De formando studio''—his long letter on a private educational programme—was printed as a small booklet and thus influenced pedagogical insights of the early-sixteenth century.\n\nAgricola's real legacy was his personal influence over others. [[Erasmus]] admired Agricola, eulogizing him in \"Adagia\" and calling him \"the first to bring a breath of better literature from Italy.\" Erasmus claimed him as a father/teacher figure and may have met him through his own schoolmaster [[Alexander Hegius]] (most probably one of Agricola's students) at Hegius's school in Deventer.  In addition to Hegius, Agricola's students include [[Conrad Celtis]] (in Heidelberg).\n\nErasmus made it his personal mission to ensure that several of Agricola's major works were printed posthumously. Agricola's literary executor was Adolphus Occo, a physician of Augsburg. By about 1530 disciples and followers had gathered in the manuscripts left by Agricola, and these were edited by [[Alardus of Amsterdam]].<ref name=\"AkkermanVanderjagt1988\">{{cite book|author1=Fokke Akkerman|author2=Arie Johan Vanderjagt|title=Rodolphus Agricola Phrisius, 1444-1485: Proceedings of the International Conference at the University of Groningen, 28-30 October 1985|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vJWnpWQ0fJUC&pg=PA42|year=1988|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-08599-2|page=42}}</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n* ''De Inventione Dialectica libri tres'' (1479): This is the work for which Agricola is particularly known.
