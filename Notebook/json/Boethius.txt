Boethius and Basilius were arrested. First the pair were detained in the baptistery of a church, then Boethius was exiled to the ''Ager Calventianus'', a distant country estate, where he was put to death.

The [[Acacian Schism]] had been resolved, and the [[First Council of Nicea|Nicene Christian]] aristocrats of his kingdom were seeking to renew their ties with Constantinople.

Perhaps he was killed with an axe or a sword, or, possibly, he was clubbed to death. According to another version a rope was attached round his head and tightened till his eyes bulged out; then his skull was cracked.

The first work has six books, and is largely a response to Cicero's ''Topica''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|first=Anicius|title=In Ciceronis Topica|year=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8933-4|pages=22}}</ref> The first book of ''In Ciceronis Topica'' begins with a dedication to Patricius. It includes distinctions and assertions important to Boethius's overall philosophy, such as his view of the role of philosophy to \"establish our judgment concerning the governing of life\",<ref name=ct>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=In Ciceronis Topica|year=1988|publisher=Cornell University|pages=25}}</ref> and definitions of logic from Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. He breaks logic into three parts: that which defines, that which divides, and that which deduces.<ref name=ct/>  He asserts that there are three types of arguments: those of necessity, of ready believability, and sophistry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=In Ciceronis Topica|year=1988|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=26}}</ref> He follows Aristotle in defining one sort of Topic as the maximal proposition, a proposition which is somehow shown to be universal or readily believable.<ref>Boethius.

In Ciceronis Topica. 35</ref> Book{{nbsp}}II covers two kinds of topics: those from related things and those from extrinsic topics. Book{{nbsp}}III discusses the relationship between things studied through Topics, Topics themselves, and the nature of definition. Book{{nbsp}}IV analyzes partition, designation and relationships between things (such as pairing, numbering, genus, and species, etc.). After a review of his terms, Boethius spends Book{{nbsp}}V discussing Stoic logic and Aristotelian causation. Book{{nbsp}}VI relates the nature of the Topic to causes.\n\n''In Topicis Differentiis'' has four books; Book{{nbsp}}I discusses the nature of rhetorical and dialectical Topics together, Boethius's overall purpose being \"to show what the Topics are, what their differentiae are, and which are suited for what syllogisms.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=29}}</ref> He distinguishes between argument (that which constitutes belief) and argumentation (that which demonstrates belief). Propositions are divided into three parts: those that are universal, those that are particular, and those that are somewhere in between.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=31}}</ref> These distinctions, and others, are applicable to both types of Topical argument, rhetorical and dialectical. Books{{nbsp}}II and III are primarily focused on Topics of dialectic (syllogisms), while Book{{nbsp}}IV concentrates on the unit of the rhetorical Topic, the enthymeme. Topical argumentation is at the core of Boethius’s conception of dialectic, which \"have categorical rather than conditional conclusions, and he conceives of the discovery of an argument as the discovery of a middle term capable of linking the two terms of the desired conclusion.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Eleanor|first=Stump|title=In Ciceronis Topica|year=1978|location=Introduction|pages=6}}</ref>  Not only are these texts of paramount importance to the study of Boethius, they are also crucial to the history of topical lore. It is largely due to Boethius that the Topics of Aristotle and Cicero were revived, and the Boethian tradition of topical argumentation spans its influence throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance: \"In the works of [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], [[Buridan]], [[Albert of Saxony]], and the [[Pseudo-Scotus]], for instance, many of the rules of consequence bear a strong resemblance to or are simply identical with certain Boethian Topics...Boethius’s influence, direct and indirect, on this tradition is enormous.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stump|first=Eleanor|title=In Ciceronis Topica|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Introduction|pages=7, 9=8}}</ref>\n\nIt was also in ''De Topicis Differentiis'' that Boethius made a unique contribution to the discourse on dialectic and rhetoric. Topical argumentation for Boethius is dependent upon a new category for the topics discussed by Aristotle and Cicero, and \"[u]nlike Aristotle, Boethius recognizes two different types of Topics. First, he says, a Topic is a maximal proposition (''maxima propositio''), or principle; but there is a second kind of Topic, which he calls the ''differentia'' of a maximal proposition...\"<ref name=\"Boethius 1978 180\">{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=180}}</ref> Maximal propositions are \"propositions [that are] known per se, and no proof can be found for these.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=33}}</ref> This is the basis for the idea that demonstration (or the construction of arguments) is dependent ultimately upon ideas or proofs that are known so well and are so fundamental to human understanding of logic that no other proofs come before it. They must hold true in and of themselves. According to Stump, \"the role of maximal propositions in argumentation is to ensure the truth of a conclusion by ensuring the truth of its premises either directly or indirectly.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=181}}</ref> These propositions would be used in constructing arguments through the ''Differentia'', which is the second part of Boethius' theory. This is \"the genus of the intermediate in the argument.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=198}}</ref> So maximal propositions allow room for an argument to be founded in some sense of logic while ''differentia'' are critical for the demonstration and construction of arguments.\n\nBoethius’ definition of “differentiae” is that they are \"the Topics of arguments...The Topics which are the Differentiae of [maximal] propositions are more universal than those propositions, just as rationality is more universal than man.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=48}}</ref> This is the second part of Boethius’ unique contribution to the field of rhetoric. ''Differentia'' operate under maximal propositions to \"be of use in finding maximal propositions as well as intermediate terms,\" or the premises that follow maximal propositions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=204}}</ref>\n\nThough Boethius is drawing from Aristotle’s Topics, ''Differentiae'' are not the same as Topics in some ways. Boethius arranges ''differentiae'' through statements, instead of generalized groups as Aristotle does. Stump articulates the difference. They are \"expressed as words or phrases whose expansion into appropriate propositions is neither intended nor readily conceivable\", unlike Aristotle’s clearly defined four groups of Topics. Aristotle had hundreds of topics organized into those four groups, whereas Boethius has twenty-eight \"Topics\" that are “highly ordered among themselves.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=205}}</ref> This distinction is necessary to understand Boethius as separate from past rhetorical theories.\n\nMaximal propositions and ''Differentiae'' belong not only to rhetoric, but also to dialectic. Boethius defines dialectic through an analysis of \"thesis\" and hypothetical propositions. He claims that \"[t]here are two kinds of questions. One is that called, ‘thesis’ by the [Greek] dialecticians. This is the kind of question which asks about and discusses things stripped of relation to other circumstances; it is the sort of question dialecticians most frequently dispute about—for example, 'Is pleasure the greatest good?' [or] 'Should one marry?'.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Boethius|title=De topicis differentiis|year=1978|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=35}}</ref> Dialectic has \"dialectical topics\" as well as \"dialectical-rhetorical topics\", all of which are still discussed in ''De Topicis Differentiis''.<ref name=\"Boethius 1978 180\"/> Dialectic, especially in Book{{nbsp}}I, comprises a major component of Boethius' discussion on Topics.\n\nBoethius planned to completely translate Plato's ''Dialogues'', but there is no known surviving translation, if it was actually ever begun.<ref name=\"kt\">''Variae'', I.45.4; translated by Barnish, S.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;B.

New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989.</ref>\n\nIn \"De Musica\", Boethius introduced the threefold classification of music:<ref name=\"Christensen2002\">{{citation|author=Thomas Christensen, ed.|title=The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioa9uW2t7AQC&pg=PA146|accessdate=17 January 2013|date=25 April 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62371-1|pages=146–}}</ref>\n* ''Musica mundana'' — music of the spheres/world\n* ''Musica humana'' — harmony of human body and spiritual harmony\n* ''Musica instrumentalis'' — instrumental music\n\nIn ''De musica'' I.2, Boethius describes 'musica instrumentis' as music produced by something under tension (e.g. strings), by wind (e.g. aulos), by water, or by percussion (e.g. cymbals). Boethius himself doesn't use the term 'instrumentalis', which was used by Adalbold II of Utrecht (975{{nsndns}}1026) in his ''Epistola cum tractatu''.{{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}  The term is much more common in the 13th century and later.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} It is also in these later texts that ''musica instrumentalis'' is firmly associated with audible music in general, including vocal music. Scholars have traditionally assumed that Boethius also made this connection, possibly under the header of wind instruments (\"administratur ... aut spiritu ut tibiis\"<ref>\"Haec vero administratur aut intentione ut nervis, aut spiritu ut tibiis, vel his, quae ad aquam moventur, aut percussione quadam, ut in his, quae in concava quaedam aerea feriuntur, atque inde diversi efficiuntur soni.\" Translated: \"This, however, is operated by the motion of a string, or the wind of a pipe, or to those, which are moved by the water, or the beat of time, as in the following, which is striking a kind of brass hollow, and in the other are made of a corresponding sound.\"</ref> {{sfn|Boethius|1867|p=189}})<!--Boethius fails to mention these later scholars and their assumptions.-->, but Boethius himself never writes about \"instrumentalis\" as separate from \"instrumentis\" explicitly in his very brief description.\n\nIn one of his works within ''De institutione musica'', Boethius was to say that \"music is so naturally united with us that we cannot be free from it even if we so desired.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Donnell|first=Laurence|title=Music and the Brain|url=http://www.cerebromente.org.br/n15/mente/musica.html|publisher=Music Power|accessdate=8 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Boethius was connected to several texts that were used to teach liberal arts. Although he did not address the subject of trivium, he did write many treatises explaining the principles of rhetoric, grammar, and logic. During the Middle Ages, his works of these disciplines were commonly used when studying the three elementary arts.<ref name=\"a\"/\n\nAn 1872 German translation of \"De Musica\" was the magnum opus of [[Oscar Paul]].<ref>[http://imslp.org/wiki/5_B%C3%BCcher_%C3%BCber_die_Musik_(Bo%C3%ABthius,_Anicius_Manlius_Severinus) 5 Bücher über die Musik (Boëthius, Anicius Manlius Severinus)]</ref>\n\n===''Opuscula sacra''===\nBoethius also wrote Christian theological treatises, which supported [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and condemned [[Arianism]] and other [[heresy|heterodox]] forms of Christianity.<ref name=\"mult\" />\n\nFive theological works are known:<ref name=\"KaylorPhillips2012 p15\" />\n* ''De Trinitate''  – \"The Trinity\", where he defends the Council of Chalcedon Trinitarian position, that God is in three persons who have no differences in nature.

Boethius argues for a middle ground in conformity with Roman Catholic faith.\n\nHis theological works played an important part during the [[Middle Ages]] in philosophical thought, including the fields of [[logic]], [[ontology]], and [[metaphysics]].<ref name=\"Bradshaw2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Bradshaw|first1=David|title=The Opuscula sacra: Boethius and theology|year=2009|pages=105–128|doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521872669.006}}</ref>\n\n== History of reception ==\n[[Lorenzo Valla]] described Boethius as the [[last of the Romans]] and the first of the [[scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]].<ref name=\"multiply\"/> Despite the use of his mathematical texts in the early universities, it is his final work, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', that assured his legacy in the [[Middle Ages]] and beyond. This work is cast as a dialogue between Boethius himself, at first bitter and despairing over his imprisonment, and the spirit of philosophy, depicted as a woman of wisdom and compassion. \"Alternately composed in prose and verse,<ref name=\"an\"/> the ''Consolation'' teaches acceptance of hardship in a spirit of philosophical detachment from misfortune\".<ref name=\"mul\" /> Parts of the work are reminiscent of the [[Socratic method]] of Plato's dialogues, as the spirit of philosophy questions Boethius and challenges his emotional reactions to adversity.
