He came to [[Athens]] at a young age and initially studied in [[Platonic Academy|Plato's school]]. After Plato's death, he attached himself to Aristotle. Aristotle took to Theophrastus his writings and designated him as his successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Theophrastus presided over the Peripatetic school for thirty-six years, during which time the school flourished greatly.  He is often considered the \"father of [[botany]]\" for his works on plants.  After his death, the Athenians honoured him with a public funeral. His successor as head of the school was [[Strato of Lampsacus]].\n\nThe interests of Theophrastus were wide ranging, extending from [[biology]] and [[physics]] to [[ethics]] and [[metaphysics]]. His two surviving [[botanical]] works, ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants (Historia Plantarum)]]''  and ''On the Causes of Plants'', were an important influence on [[Renaissance science]]. There are also surviving works ''On Moral Characters'', ''On Sensation'', ''On Stones'', and fragments on ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics''. In philosophy, he studied [[grammar]] and [[language]] and continued Aristotle's work on [[logic]]. He also regarded [[space]] as the mere arrangement and position of bodies, [[time]] as an accident of motion, and [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as a necessary consequence of all activity. In [[ethics]], he regarded [[happiness]] as depending on external influences as well as on [[virtue]] and famously said that \"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom.\"\n\n==Life==\nMost of the biographical information we have of Theophrastus was provided by [[Diogenes Laërtius]]' ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', written more than four hundred years after Theophrastus' time.<ref name=Hort1916>{{harvnb|Hort|1916|loc=Book I–V}}</ref> He was a native of [[Eresos]] in [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]].<ref>Strabo, xiii.; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 36, etc}}.</ref> His given name was '''Tyrtamus''' (Τύρταμος), but he later became known by the nickname \"Theophrastus,\" given to him, it is said, by Aristotle to indicate the grace of his conversation (from Ancient Greek Θεός \"god\" and φράζειν \"to phrase\", i.e. divine expression).<ref>Strabo, xiii.; {{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 38}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aristotle Theophrastus Strato Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Aristotle]], Theophrastus, and [[Strato of Lampsacus]].

The latter report is problematic\" {{harv|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}}.}} He became friends with [[Aristotle]], and when Plato died (348/7 BC) Theophrastus may have joined Aristotle in his self-imposed exile from Athens. When Aristotle moved to [[Mytilene]] on Lesbos in 345/4, it is very likely that he did so at the urging of Theophrastus.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}} It seems that it was on Lesbos that Aristotle and Theophrastus began their research into [[natural science]], with Aristotle studying animals and Theophrastus studying plants.{{sfn|Grene|Depew|2004|p=11}} Theophrastus probably accompanied Aristotle to [[Macedon]]ia when Aristotle was appointed tutor to [[Alexander the Great]] in 343/2.{{sfn|''Encyclopedia of classical philosophy''|1997|p=552}} Around 335 BC, Theophrastus moved with Aristotle to Athens where Aristotle began teaching in the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]].

Like Aristotle, most of his writings are [[lost work]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Thus Theophrastus, like Aristotle, had composed a first and second ''Analytic'' (Ἀναλυτικῶν προτέρων and Ἀναλυτικῶν ὑστέρων).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42}} He had also written books on ''Topics'' (Ἀνηγμένων τόπων, Τοπικῶν and Τὰ πρὸ τῶν τόπων);{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 45, 50}} on the ''Analysis of Syllogisms'' (Περὶ ἀναλύσεως συλλογισμῶν and Περὶ συλλογισμῶν λύσεως), on ''Sophisms'' (Σοφισμάτων) and ''On Affirmation and Denial'' (Περὶ καταφάσεως καὶ ἀποφάσεως){{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 45}} as well as on the ''Natural Philosophy'' (Περὶ φύσεως, Περὶ φυσικῶν, Φυσικῶν and others), on ''Heaven'' (Περὶ οὐρανοῦ), and on ''Meteorological Phenomena'' (Τῆς μεταρσιολεσχίας and Μεταρσιολογικῶν).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 46, 50, 43, 44}}\n\n[[Image:161Theophrastus 161 frontespizio.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to the illustrated 1644 edition of the ''Enquiry into Plants'' (''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Historia Plantarum]]'')]]\n\nIn addition, Theophrastus wrote on the ''Warm and the Cold'' (Περὶ θερμοῦ καὶ ψυχροῦ),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 44}} on ''Water'' (Περὶ ὕδατος), ''Fire'' (Περὶ πυρὸς),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 45}} ''the Sea'' (Περὶ θαλάττης),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 45}} on ''Coagulation and Melting'' (Περὶ πήξεων καὶ τήξεων), on various phenomena of organic and spiritual life,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 45}} and on the ''Soul'' (Περὶ ψυχῆς), ''On Experience'' (Περὶ ἐμπειρίας) and ''On Sense Perception'' (also known as ''On the Senses''; Περὶ αἰσθήσεων).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 46}} Likewise, we find mention of monographs of Theophrastus on the early Greek philosophers [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Empedocles]], [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 43}} [[Diogenes of Apollonia]], [[Democritus]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 43}} which were made use of by [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]]; and also on [[Xenocrates]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 47}} against the [[Platonism|Academics]],{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 49}} and a sketch of the political doctrine of [[Plato]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 43}}\n\nHe studied general history, as we know from [[Plutarch]]'s lives of [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], [[Solon]], [[Aristides]], [[Pericles]], [[Nicias]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Lysander]], [[Agesilaus]], and [[Demosthenes]], which were probably borrowed from the work on ''Lives'' (Περὶ βίων).{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42}} But his main efforts were to continue the labours of Aristotle in [[natural history]]. This is testified to not only by a number of treatises on individual subjects of [[zoology]], of which, besides the titles, only fragments remain, but also by his books on ''Stones'', his ''Enquiry into Plants'', and ''On the Causes of Plants'' (see below), which have come down to us entire. In politics, also, he seems to have trodden in the footsteps of Aristotle. Besides his books on the ''State'' (Πολιτικῶν and Πολιτικοῦ), we find quoted various treatises on ''Education'' (Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως and Περὶ παιδείας),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 50}} on ''Royalty'' (Περὶ βασιλείας, Περὶ παιδείας βασιλέως and Πρὸς Κάσανδρον περὶ βασιλείας),{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 47, 45}} on the ''Best State'' (Περὶ τῆς ἀρίστης πολιτείας), on ''Political Morals'' (Πολιτικῶν ἐθῶν), and particularly his works on the ''Laws'' (Νόμων κατὰ στοιχεῖον, Νόμων ἐπιτομῆς and Περὶ νόμων), one of which, containing a recapitulation of the laws of various [[barbarian]] as well as [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] states, was intended to be a companion to Aristotle's outline of ''Politics'', and must have been similar to it.<ref>Cicero, ''de Finibus'', v. 4.</ref> He also wrote on [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[poetry]].<ref>Cicero, ''de Invent.'' i. 35.</ref> Theophrastus, without doubt, departed further from Aristotle in his [[ethical]] writings,{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 49, 50}} as also in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] investigations of [[Motion (physics)|motion]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and [[God]].{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 48}}\n\nBesides these writings, Theophrastus wrote several collections of problems, out of which some things at least have passed into the ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]]'' that have come down to us under the name of Aristotle,<ref>{{harvnb|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 45, 47, 48}}; comp.

The work is arranged into a system whereby plants are classified according to their modes of generation, their localities, their sizes, and according to their practical uses such as foods, juices, herbs, etc.<ref name=\"Long1842\">{{harvnb|Long|1842|pp=332–224}}</ref> The first book deals with the parts of plants; the second book with the reproduction of plants and the times and manner of sowing; the third, fourth, and fifth books are devoted to trees, their types, their locations, and their practical applications; the sixth book deals with [[shrubs]] and spiny plants; the seventh book deals with herbs; the eighth book deals with plants that produce edible seeds; and the ninth book deals with plants that produce useful juices, [[natural gum|gums]], [[resins]], etc.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/>\n[[Image:Cinnamomum verum - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-182.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Cinnamomum verum]]'', from ''[[Köhler's Medicinal Plants]]'', (1887)]]\n\n''On the Causes of Plants'' was originally eight books, of which six survive.

Much of the information on the Greek plants may have come from his own observations, as he is known to have travelled throughout Greece, and to have had a botanical garden of his own; but the works also profit from the reports on plants of Asia brought back from those who followed [[Alexander the Great]]: {{quote|to the reports of Alexander's followers he owed his accounts of such plants as the [[Cotton|cotton-plant]], [[banyan]], [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[cinnamon]], [[myrrh]], and [[frankincense]].<ref name=Hort1916/>}}\n\nTheophrastus' ''Enquiry into Plants'' was first published in a [[Latin]] translation by [[Theodore Gaza]], at Treviso, 1483;{{efn|Theodore Gaza, a refugee from [[Thessalonika]], was working from a lost Greek manuscript that was different from any others (Hort){{full citation needed|date=March 2016}}.}} in its original Greek it first appeared from the press of [[Aldus Manutius]] at Venice, 1495–98, from a third-rate manuscript, which, like the majority of the manuscripts that were sent to printers' workshops in the fifteenth and sixteenth century, has disappeared.{{efn|It was carefully copied in a printing at [[Basel]], 1541.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} }} [[Christian Friedrich Heinrich Wimmer|Wimmer]] identified two manuscripts of first quality, the ''Codex Urbinas'' in the [[Vatican Library]], which was not made known to [[Johann Gottlob Schneider|J. G. Schneider]], who made the first modern critical edition, 1818–21, and the excerpts in the ''Codex Parisiensis'' in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].\n\n{{botanist|Theophr.}}\n\n===Characters===\nHis book {{anchor|Characters}}''Characters'' (Ἠθικοὶ χαρακτῆρες), if it is indeed his, deserves a separate mention. The work contains thirty brief, vigorous, and trenchant outlines of moral types, which form a most valuable picture of the life of his time, and in fact of human nature in general.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} They are the first recorded attempt at systematic [[character sketch|character writing]]. The book has been regarded by some as an independent work; others incline to the view that the sketches were written from time to time by Theophrastus, and collected and edited after his death; others, again, regard the ''Characters'' as part of a larger systematic work, but the style of the book is against this.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Theophrastus has found many imitators in this kind of writing, notably [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] (1608), [[Thomas Overbury|Sir Thomas Overbury]] (1614–16), [[John Earle (bishop)|Bishop Earle]] (1628), and [[Jean de La Bruyère]] (1688), who also translated the ''Characters''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[George Eliot]] also took inspiration from Theophrastus' ''Characters'', most notably in her book of caricatures, ''[[Impressions of Theophrastus Such]]''. Writing the \"[[character sketch]]\" as a scholastic exercise also originated in Theophrastus's typology.\n\n===On Sensation===\nA treatise ''On Sense Perception'' (Περὶ αἰσθήσεων) and its objects is important for a knowledge of the doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject. A paraphrase and commentary on this work was written by [[Priscian of Lydia]] in the sixth century.<ref name=\"Long1842\"/> With this type of work we may connect the fragments on ''Smells'', on ''Fatigue'', on ''Dizziness'', on ''Sweat'', on ''Swooning'', on ''Palsy'', and on ''Honey''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/>\n\n===Physics===\nWe also possess in fragments a ''History of Physics'' (Περὶ φυσικῶν ἱστοριῶν). To this class of work belong the still extant sections on ''Fire'', on the ''Winds'', and on the signs of ''Waters'', ''Winds'', and ''Storms''.<ref>Probably out of the fourth book of the ''Meteorology'' (\"ἐν τετάρτῃ περὶ μεταρσίων\") of Theophrastus: see Plutarch, ''Quaest.

There is no reason for assigning this work to some other author because it is not noticed in [[Hermippus of Smyrna|Hermippus]] and [[Andronicus of Rhodes|Andronicus]], especially as [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] had already mentioned it.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/>\n\n===On Stones===\n[[Image:Beryl emeralds cut XH.jpg|thumb|left|Cut [[emerald]]s]]\nIn his treatise ''On Stones'' (Περὶ λίθων), which was to be used as a source for other [[lapidary (text)|lapidaries]] until at least the [[Renaissance]],{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=359–364}} Theophrastus classified rocks and gems based on their behavior when heated, further grouping minerals by common properties, such as [[amber]] and [[magnetite]], which both have the power of attraction.<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\">{{harvnb|Cuvier|1830|pp=76–83}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Richards|Caley|1956|p=238}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Caley|1956}}.</ref>  He also comments on the effect of heat on minerals and their different [[hardness]]es.\n\nTheophrastus describes different [[marble]]s; mentions [[coal]], which he says is used for heating by metal-workers; describes the various [[ore|metal ores]]; and knew that [[pumice|pumice-stones]] had a [[volcanic]] origin. He also deals with precious stones, [[emeralds]], [[amethysts]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], etc., and describes a variety of \"sapphire\" that was blue with veins of gold, and thus was presumably [[lapis-lazuli]].<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/>\n\nHe knew that [[pearls]] came from [[shell-fish]], that [[coral]] came from India, and speaks of the [[fossilized]] remains of organic life.<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/> Theophrastus made the first known reference to the phenomenon of [[pyroelectricity]], noting that the mineral [[tourmaline]] becomes charged when heated. He also considers the practical uses of various stones, such as the minerals necessary for the manufacture of glass; for the production of various pigments of paint such as [[ochre]]; and for the manufacture of [[plaster]].<ref name=\"Cuvier1830\"/> He discusses the use of the [[touchstone (assaying tool)|touchstone]] for [[assaying]] gold and gold alloys, an important property which would require the genius of [[Archimedes]] to resolve in quantitative detail when he was asked to investigate the suspected debasement of a crown a few years later.\n\nMany of the rarer minerals were found in mines, and he mentions the famous [[copper]] mines of [[Cyprus]] and the even more famous [[silver mine]]s, presumably of [[Laurium]] near [[Athens]], and upon which the wealth of the city was based, as well as referring to [[gold mines]]. The Laurium silver mines, which were the property of the state, were usually leased for a fixed sum and a percentage on the working. Towards the end of the fifth century the output fell, partly owing to the [[Sparta]]n occupation of [[Decelea]]. But the mines continued to be worked, though [[Strabo]] records that in his time the tailings were being worked over, and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] speaks of the mines as a thing of the past. The ancient workings, consisting of shafts and galleries for excavating the ore, and washing tables for extracting the metal, may still be seen. Theophrastus wrote a separate work ''On Mining'',{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 44}} which like most of his writings is a [[lost work]].\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] makes clear references to his use of ''On Stones'' in his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of 77 AD, while updating and making much new information available on [[minerals]] himself. Although Pliny's treatment of the subject is more extensive, Theophrastus is more systematic and his work is comparatively free from fable and magic,{{sfn|Healy|1999|pp=17–7}} although he did describe [[lyngurium]], a gemstone supposedly formed of the solidified urine of the [[lynx]] (the best ones coming from wild males), which was included in many lapidiaries until it gradually disappeared from view in the 17th century.{{sfn|Walton|2001|loc=abstract & throughout}}  From both of these early texts was to emerge the science of [[mineralogy]], and ultimately [[geology]]. Pliny is especially observant on [[crystal habit]] and mineral hardness, for example.\n\n==Philosophy==\n[[Image:Theophrastus Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|upright|thumb|Theophrastus, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]\nThe extent to which Theophrastus followed Aristotle's doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss of so many of his writings.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> Many of his opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]].\n\n===Logic===\nTheophrastus seems to have carried out still further the [[grammatical]] foundation of [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]], since in his book on the elements of [[speech]], he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (κυρία λέξις ''kuria lexis'') from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (πάθη ''pathe'') of speech.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' 8</ref> He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (σχίσις ''schisis'') to things (πράγματα ''pragmata'') and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.<ref>Ammonius, ''de Interpr.'' 53; Schol.

''in Arist.'' p. 184. 24. 183, b. 2; Boethius, ''de Interpr.''</ref> on the different kinds of negation,<ref>Ammonius, ''in Arist. de Interpr.'' 128; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 121. 18</ref> and on the difference between unconditional and conditional necessity.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' f. 12. 6; Schol. ''in Arist.'' p. 149. 44</ref> In his doctrine of [[syllogisms]] he brought forward the proof for the conversion of universal affirmative judgments, differed from Aristotle here and there in the laying down and arranging the ''modi'' of the syllogisms,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 14, 72, 73, 82. 22, b, 35; Boethius, ''de Syll. categ.'' ii. 594. 5, f. 603, 615</ref> partly in the proof of them,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b</ref> partly in the doctrine of mixture, i.e. of the influence of the modality of the premises upon the modality of the conclusion.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 39, b. etc. 40, 42, 56, b. 82, 64, b. 51; John Phil. xxxii, b. etc.</ref> Then, in two separate works, he dealt with the reduction of arguments to the syllogistic form and on the resolution of them;<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Anal. Pr.'' 115</ref> and further, with hypothetical conclusions.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Arist. Anal. Pr.'' 109, b. etc. 131, b.; John Phil. lx. etc. lxxv.; Boethius, ''de Syll. hypoth.''</ref> For the doctrine of [[Proof (truth)|proof]], [[Galen]] quotes the second ''Analytic'' of Theophrastus, in conjunction with that of Aristotle, as the best treatises on that doctrine.<ref>Galen, ''de Hippocr. et Plat. Dogm.'' ii. 2.</ref> In different [[monograph]]s he seems to have tried to expand it into a general theory of [[science]]. To this, too, may have belonged the proposition quoted from his ''Topics'', that the ''principles of opposites'' are themselves opposed, and cannot be deduced from one and the same higher genus.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.'' f. 5; Schol. p. 89. 15; comp. Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Metaph.'' p. 342. 30</ref> For the rest, some minor deviations from the Aristotelian definitions are quoted from the ''Topica'' of Theophrastus.<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 5, 68, 72, 25, 31.</ref> Closely connected with this treatise was that upon ambiguous words or ideas,<ref>Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''in Top.'' 83, 189</ref> which, without doubt, corresponded to book Ε of Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/>\n\n===Physics and metaphysics===\nTheophrastus introduced his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being corporeal and composite, requires ''principles'',<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 1, 6</ref> and first and foremost, [[Motion (physics)|motion]], as the basis of all change.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 5, 6</ref> Denying the substance of [[space]], he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position (''taxis'' and ''thesis'') of bodies.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 149, b. 141</ref> [[Time]] he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' f. 87, b; John Phil. 213. 4.</ref> He attacked the doctrine of the four [[classical elements]] and challenged whether [[fire (classical element)|fire]] could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.<ref>Theophrastus, ''On Fire'', 1</ref>\n\n[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aristotle]]]]\nHe departed more widely from Aristotle in his doctrine of motion, since on the one hand he extended it over all categories, and did not limit it to those laid down by Aristotle.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''; comp. Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 94, 201, 202, 1.</ref> He viewed motion, with Aristotle, as an activity, not carrying its own goal in itself (''ateles''), of that which only [[Potentiality and actuality|potentially]] exists,<ref>Simplicius, l. c. and f. 94, 1.</ref> but he opposed Aristotle's view that motion required a special explanation, and he regarded it as something proper both to nature in general and the celestial system in particular:\n\n{{quote|Surely, then, if the life in animals does not need explanation or is to be explained only in this way, may it not be the case that in the heavens too, and in the heavenly bodies, movement does not need explanation or is to be explained in a special way?|Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.16-29.{{sfn|Gould|1970|p=24}} }}\n\nHe recognised no activity without motion,<ref>Simplicius, ''in Categ.''</ref> and so referred all activities of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to motion: the desires and emotions to corporeal motion, judgment (''kriseis'') and contemplation to spiritual motion.<ref>Simplicius, ''in Phys.'' 225</ref> The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet he appears to have contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it.<ref>Themistius, ''in Arist. de An.'' 89, b. 91, b.</ref> Other Peripatetics, like [[Dicaearchus]], [[Aristoxenus]], and especially [[Strato of Lampsacus|Strato]], developed further this [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in Aristotelian doctrine.\n\nTheophrastus seems, generally speaking, where the investigation overstepped the limits of experience, to have preferred to develop the difficulties rather than solve them, as is especially apparent in his ''Metaphysics''.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> He was doubtful of Aristotle's [[teleology]] and recommended that such ideas be used with caution:\n\n{{quote|With regard to the view that all things are for the sake of an end and nothing is in vain, the assignation of ends is in general not easy, as it is usually stated to be ... we must set certain limits to purposiveness and to the effort after the best, and not assert it to exist in all cases without qualification.|Theophrastus, ''Metaphysics'', 10a.22–24, 11a.1–3.{{sfn|Gould|1970b|p=25}}<!--end of quote-->}}\n\nHe did not follow the incessant attempts by Aristotle to refer phenomena to their ultimate foundations, or his attempts to unfold the internal connections between the latter, and between them and phenomena.<ref name=\"SmithDGRBM\"/> In antiquity, it was a subject of complaint that Theophrastus had not expressed himself with precision and consistency respecting [[God]], and had understood it at one time as [[Heaven]], at another an (enlivening) breath (''[[pneuma]]'').<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Protrept.''; Cicero, ''de Natura Deorum'', i. 13</ref>\n\n===Ethics===\n[[File:Theophrastus.jpg|thumb|upright|The bust inscribed \"Θεόφραστος Μελάντα Ἐρέσιος (''Theophrastos Melanta Eresios'')\"]]\nTheophrastus did not allow a happiness resting merely upon virtue,<ref>Cicero, ''Academica'', i. 10, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', v. 9</ref> or, consequently, to hold fast by the unconditional value of [[morality]]. He subordinated moral requirements to the advantage at least of a friend,<ref>Aulus Gellius, i. 3. § 23</ref> and had allowed in prosperity the existence of an influence injurious to them. In later times, fault was found with his expression in the ''Callisthenes'', \"life is ruled by fortune, not wisdom\" (''{{lang|la|vitam regit fortuna non sapientia}}'').<ref>Cicero, ''Tusculanae Quaestiones'', iii. 10; comp. Alexander of Aphrodisias, ''de Anima'', ii.</ref> That in the definition of pleasure, likewise, he did not coincide with Aristotle, seems to be indicated by the titles of two of his writings, one of which dealt with pleasure generally, the other with pleasure as Aristotle had defined it.{{sfn|Laërtius|1925|loc=§ 44}} Although, like his teacher, he preferred contemplative (theoretical), to active (practical) life,<ref>Cicero, ''ad Atticus'', ii. 16</ref> he preferred to set the latter free from the restraints of family life, etc. in a manner of which Aristotle would not have approved.<ref>Jerome, ''Adversus Jovinianum'', i, 189</ref>\n\nTheophrastus was opposed to eating meat on the grounds that it robbed animals of life and was therefore unjust. Non-human animals, he said, can reason, sense, and feel just as human beings do.<ref name=Taylor35>[[Angus Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor, Angus]]. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==The \"portrait\" of Theophrastus==\nThe marble [[Herma|herm figure]] with the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the explicit inscription, must be taken as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome.{{efn|\"Since 'unknown portraits' were not valued highly, identifying inscriptions were often added to classical portraits by antiquaries and collectors before modern scholarship condemned the practice\", notes Eugene Dwyer.{{sfn|Dwyer|1993|p=478 note 65..}} }} This bust was formerly in the collection of marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L.
