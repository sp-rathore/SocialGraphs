He then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he obtained his doctorate.\n\nBohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of Oppenheimer's other graduate students ([[Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz]], Joseph Weinberg, and Max Friedman) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics. He was active in Communist and Communist-backed organizations, including the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]], the Campus Committee to Fight Conscription, and the [[American Peace Mobilization|Committee for Peace Mobilization]].\n\n===Work and doctorate===\n\n====Manhattan Project contributions====\nDuring World War II, the Manhattan Project mobilized much of Berkeley's physics research in the effort to produce the first [[atomic bomb]]. Though Oppenheimer had asked Bohm to work with him at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] (the top-secret laboratory established in 1942 to design the atom bomb), the project's director, General [[Leslie Groves]], would not approve Bohm's security clearance after seeing evidence of his politics (Bohm's friend, Joseph Weinberg, had also been suspected of [[espionage]]).\n\nBohm remained in Berkeley, teaching physics, until he completed his Ph.D. in 1943 by an unusual circumstance. According to Peat (see reference below, p.&nbsp;64), \"the scattering calculations (of collisions of protons and deuterons) that he had completed proved useful to the Manhattan Project and were immediately classified. Without security clearance, Bohm was denied access to his own work; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis, he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place!\" To satisfy the university, Oppenheimer certified that Bohm had successfully completed the research. Bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the [[Calutron]]s at the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] facility in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], used to [[Isotope separation#Electromagnetic|electromagnetically enrich uranium]] for the bomb dropped on [[Hiroshima]] in 1945.\n\n====McCarthyism and leaving the United States====\nAfter the war, Bohm became an assistant professor at [[Princeton University]], where he worked closely with [[Albert Einstein]]. In May 1949, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] called upon Bohm to testify because of his previous ties to suspected Communists. Bohm invoked his [[Fifth amendment rights of witness|Fifth amendment]] right to refuse to testify, and refused to give evidence against his colleagues.\n\nIn 1950 Bohm was arrested for refusing to answer HUAC's questions. He was acquitted in May 1951, but Princeton had already suspended him. After the acquittal, Bohm's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at Princeton, and Einstein reportedly wanted him to serve as his assistant, but Princeton President [[Harold W. Dodds]]<ref>Russell Olwell: [http://web.mit.edu/sts/pubs/pdfs/MIT_STS_WorkingPaper_20_Olwell.pdf ''Physics and Politics in Cold War America: The Two Exiles of David Bohm''], Working Paper Number 20.

As a post-graduate at Berkeley, he developed a theory of [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]], discovering the [[electron]] phenomenon known now as [[Bohm-diffusion]].<ref>D. Bohm: ''The characteristics of electrical discharges in magnetic fields'', in: A.&nbsp;Guthrie, R.&nbsp;K. Wakerling (eds.), McGraw–Hill, 1949</ref> His first book, ''Quantum Theory'', published in 1951, was well received by Einstein, among others. But Bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he had written about in that book. Starting from the realization that the [[WKB approximation]] of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations, and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory, he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics.<ref>[[Maurice A. de Gosson]], Basil J. Hiley: ''Zeno paradox for Bohmian trajectories: the unfolding of the metatron'', January&nbsp;3, 2011 ([http://www.freewebs.com/cvdegosson/ZenoPaper.pdf PDF]&nbsp;– retrieved 16 February 2012)</ref>\n\nBohm's aim was not to set out a deterministic, mechanical viewpoint, but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality, in contrast to the conventional approach.<ref>B. J. Hiley: [http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/History_of_Bohm_s_QT.pdf ''Some remarks on the evolution of Bohm's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics''], 30 January 2010</ref> He began to develop his own interpretation (the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]]), the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory. He initially referred to his approach as a [[hidden variable theories|hidden variable]] theory, but later referred to it as ''ontological theory'', reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found. Bohm and his colleague [[Basil Hiley]] later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an \"interpretation in terms of hidden variables\" to be too restrictive, especially since their variables, position, and momentum \"are not actually hidden\".<ref>David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'', edition published in the Taylor & Francis e-library 2009 (first edition Routledge, 1993), ISBN 0-203-98038-7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vt9XKjc4WAQC&pg=PA2 p. 2]</ref>\n\nBohm's work and the [[EPR paradox|EPR argument]] became the major factor motivating [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]]'s [[Bell's inequality|inequality]], which rules out [[locality principle|local]] hidden variable theories; the full consequences of Bell's work are still being investigated.\n\n====Brazil====\nAfter Bohm's arrival in Brazil on October 10, 1951, the U.S. Consul in [[São Paulo]] confiscated his passport, informing him he could retrieve it only to return to his country.

He applied for and received [[Brazilian citizenship]], but by law had to give up his [[U.S. citizenship]] and was able to reclaim it only decades later, in 1986, after pursuing a lawsuit.<ref name=\"freire\">[[Olival Freire, Jr.]]: ''[http://www.controversia.fis.ufba.br/index_arquivos/Freire-Bohm-HSPS.pdf Science and Exile: David Bohm, the cold war, and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics]'', HSPS, vol.&nbsp;36, Part&nbsp;1, pp.&nbsp;1–34, ISSN 0890-9997, 2005</ref>\n\nAt the University of São Paulo, Bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952. [[Jean-Pierre Vigier]] traveled to São Paulo, where he worked with Bohm for three months; Ralph Schiller (a student of cosmologist [[Peter Bergmann]]) was his assistant for two years; he worked with Tiomno and Walther Schützer; and [[Mario Bunge]] stayed to work with him for one year. He was in contact with Brazilian physicists [[Mário Schönberg]], [[Jean Meyer]], [[José Leite Lopes|Leite Lopes]], and had discussions on occasion with visitors to Brazil, including [[Richard Feynman]], [[Isidor Rabi]], [[Léon Rosenfeld]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Herbert Anderson]], [[Donald Kerst]], [[Marcos Moshinsky]], Alejandro Medina, and the former assistant to [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Guido Beck]], who encouraged him in his work and helped him to obtain funding. The Brazilian [[CNPq]] explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around Bohm. His work with Vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and [[Louis De Broglie]], in particular, on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by [[Erwin Madelung|Madelung]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb/fb13/Dateien/paf/paf73.html | title=Erwin Madelung 1881–1972 | publisher=[[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main]] | date=12 December 2008 | accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism, with many physicists holding the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"freire\"/>\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Bohm and [[David Pines]] published the articles in which they introduced the [[random phase approximation]] and proposed the [[plasmon]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Pines, D  |author2=Bohm, D.

In 1959 Bohm and Aharonov discovered the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded, although its vector potential did not vanish there. This showed for the first time that the [[magnetic vector potential]], hitherto a mathematical convenience, could have real physical (quantum) effects.

These features can be considered to be independent only up to a certain level of approximation in which certain criteria are fulfilled. In this picture, the [[classical limit]] for quantum phenomena, in terms of a condition that the [[Action (physics)|action function]] is not much greater than [[Planck's constant]], indicates one such criterion. They used the word \"[[holomovement]]\" for the activity in such orders.<ref>Basil J. Hiley: ''Process and the Implicate Order: their relevance to Quantum Theory and Mind.''

Bohm mused: \"So one begins to wonder what is going to happen to the human race. Technology keeps on advancing with greater and greater power, either for good or for destruction.\" He went on to ask:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat is the source of all this trouble? I'm saying that the source is basically in thought. Many people would think that such a statement is crazy, because thought is the one thing we have with which to solve our problems. That's part of our tradition. Yet it looks as if the thing we use to solve our problems with is the source of our problems. It's like going to the doctor and having him make you ill. In fact, in 20% of medical cases we do apparently have that going on. But in the case of thought, it's far over 20%.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn Bohm's view:\n<blockquote>\n...the general tacit assumption in thought is that it's just telling you the way things are and that it's not doing anything&nbsp;– that 'you' are inside there, deciding what to do with the info. But you don't decide what to do with the info. Thought runs you. Thought, however, gives false info that you are running it, that you are the one who controls thought. Whereas actually thought is the one which controls each one of us.\n\nThought is creating divisions out of itself and then saying that they are there naturally. This is another major feature of thought: Thought doesn't know it is doing something and then it struggles against what it is doing. It doesn't want to know that it is doing it. And thought struggles against the results, trying to avoid those unpleasant results while keeping on with that way of thinking. That is what I call \"sustained incoherence\".\n</blockquote>\n\nBohm thus proposed in his book ''Thought as a System'' a pervasive, systematic nature of thought:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I mean by \"thought\" is the whole thing&nbsp;– thought, ''felt'', the body, the whole society sharing thoughts&nbsp;– it's all one process. It is essential for me not to break that up, because it's all one process; somebody else's thoughts become my thoughts, and vice versa. Therefore it would be wrong and misleading to break it up into my thoughts, your thoughts, my feelings, these feelings, those feelings... I would say that thought makes what is often called in modern language a ''system''. A system means a set of connected things or parts. But the way people commonly use the word nowadays it means something all of whose parts are mutually interdependent&nbsp;– not only for their mutual action, but for their meaning and for their existence. A corporation is organized as a system&nbsp;– it has this department, that department, that department. They don't have any meaning separately; they only can function together. And also the body is a system. Society is a system in some sense. And so on.\n\nSimilarly, thought is a system. That system not only includes thoughts, \"felts\" and feelings, but it includes the state of the body; it includes the whole of society&nbsp;– as thought is passing back and forth between people in a process by which thought evolved from ancient times. A system is constantly engaged in a process of development, change, evolution and structure changes...although there are certain features of the system which become relatively fixed. We call this the ''structure''.... Thought has been constantly evolving and we can't say when that structure began. But with the growth of civilization it has developed a great deal. It was probably very simple thought before civilization, and now it has become very complex and ramified and has much more incoherence than before.\n\nNow, I say that this system has a fault in it&nbsp;– a \"systematic fault\". It is not a fault here, there or here, but it is a fault that is all throughout the system. Can you picture that? It is everywhere and nowhere. You may say \"I see a problem here, so I will bring my thoughts to bear on this problem\". But \"my\" thought is part of the system. It has the same fault as the fault I'm trying to look at, or a similar fault.\n\nThought is constantly creating problems that way and then trying to solve them. But as it tries to solve them it makes it worse because it doesn’t notice that it's creating them, and the more it thinks, the more problems it creates. (pp. 18–19)\n</blockquote>\n{{Neuropsychology|expanded=people}}\n\nBohm viewed physical processes as determined by interacting levels of information of increasing subtlety, and did not limit this consideration to matter alone. In a 1990 article, \"A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter\", he resumed his view that there is a close link to mental processes: \"the whole notion of active information suggests a rudimentary mind-like behaviour of matter\". In his view, mental processes can also be understood as representing levels of activity of increasing subtlety that act upon each other. While everyday experience shows that thought is intricately connected to physical reactions, action as response to information need not be immediate; rather, in some cases at least, it can be mediated by \"suspension\" of physical action and the resulting train of thought.<ref name=Bohm1990/>\n\nBohm suggested that the mental and the physical, which he saw as two \"poles\" of a unified whole, are closely interlinked and that \"at each level, information is the bridge or link between the two sides\". A relationship between the mental and matter may exist at indefinitely great levels of subtlety, while nonetheless each kind and level of mind may have a relative autonomy and stability. His article concludes with the statement that \"knowledge of matter (as well as of mind) has changed in such a way as to support the approach that has been described here. To pursue this approach further might perhaps enable us to extend our knowledge of both poles into new domains\".<ref name=Bohm1990>David Bohm: ''[http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~mdt26/local_papers/bohm_mind_matter_1990.pdf A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter]'', Philosophical Psychology, vol.&nbsp;3, no.&nbsp;2, 1990, pp.&nbsp;271—286, {{doi|10.1080/09515089008573004}}</ref>\n\n====Further interests====\nIn his book ''On Creativity'', quoting the work of [[Alfred Korzybski]], Bohm expressed the view that \"metaphysics is an expression of a world view\" and is \"thus to be regarded as an art form, resembling poetry in some ways and mathematics in others, rather than as an attempt to say something true about reality as a whole.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=David Bohm|title=On Creativity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcd4SsIjVKUC&pg=PA118|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76818-7|pages=118}}</ref>\n\nBohm was keenly aware of various ideas outside the scientific mainstream.

Bohm temporarily even held [[Uri Geller]]'s bending of keys and spoons to be possible, prompting warning remarks by his colleague [[Basil Hiley]] that this might undermine the scientific credibility of their work in physics. [[Martin Gardner]] reported this in a ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' article, and also critiqued the views of Krishnamurti, whom Bohm had encountered in 1959 and had many subsequent exchanges with. Gardner said that Bohm's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter (on one occasion summarized as \"Even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Implications: Essays in Honour of David Bohm|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781134914173|page=443|editor1=Hiley, Basil|editor2=Peat, F.

An essential ingredient in this form of dialogue is that participants \"suspend\" immediate action or judgment and give themselves and each other the opportunity to become aware of the thought process itself. Bohm suggested that if these \"dialogue groups\" were experienced on a sufficiently wide scale, they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation Bohm observed in society.\n\n===Later years===\nBohm continued his work in quantum physics past his retirement in 1987. His final work, the posthumously published ''The Undivided Universe: An Ontological Interpretation of Quantum Theory'' (1993), resulted from a decades-long collaboration with [[Basil Hiley]]. He also spoke to audiences across Europe and North America on the importance of dialogue as a form of sociotherapy, a concept he borrowed from London psychiatrist and practitioner of [[Group Analysis]] [[Patrick De Mare]], and had a series of meetings with the [[Dalai Lama]]. He was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1990.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\nNear the end of his life, Bohm began to experience a recurrence of the depression he had suffered earlier in life. He was admitted to the [[Maudsley Hospital]] in [[South London]] on 10&nbsp;May 1991. His condition worsened and it was decided that the only treatment that might help him was [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. Bohm's wife consulted psychiatrist David Shainberg, Bohm's longtime friend and collaborator, who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option. Bohm showed improvement from the treatments and was released on 29&nbsp;August. But his depression returned and was treated with medication.<ref name=\"F.&nbsp;David Peat 1997, pp.&nbsp;308–317\">F.
