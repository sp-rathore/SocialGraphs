He made influential contributions to the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[Christian philosophy]]. He earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] and taught at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Rutgers University]], [[University of Illinois]], and [[Syracuse University]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAlston was born to Eunice Schoolfield and William Alston on November 29, 1921, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. He graduated from high school when he was 15 and went on to [[Centenary College of Louisiana]], graduating in 1942 with a [[Bachelor of Music]] in piano. During [[World War II]], he played clarinet and bass drum in a [[military band]] in California. During this time, he became interested in philosophy, sparked by [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s book ''[[The Razor's Edge]]''. After this, he engrossed himself in works by well-known philosophers such as [[Jacques Maritain]], [[Mortimer J. Adler]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[Plato]], [[René Descartes]], and [[John Locke]].<ref name=\"Shook2005\">{{cite book|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|chapter=Alston, William Payne (1921– )|editor-last=Shook|editor-first=John R.|title=Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers|url=http://faculty.wwu.edu/howardd/alston/alstonforthoemmes.pdf|volume=1|year=2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-84371-037-0|pages=56–61|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> After being discharged, he entered a graduate program for philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]], even though he had never formally taken a class on the subject.<ref name=\"Syracuse\" /><ref name=\"SU\">{{cite news|title=Emeritus professor of philosophy William Payne Alston dies|url=http://www.syr.edu/news/articles/2009/alston-09-09.html|newspaper=[[Syracuse University]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref> While he was there, he learned more about philosophy from [[Richard McKeon]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]], and he received his [[PhD]] in 1951.<ref name=\"Shook2005\" />\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1949 until 1971, Alston was a professor at the [[University of Michigan]], and he became professor of philosophy in 1961.<ref name=\"Marquette\">{{cite web|title=The Aquinas Lecture in Philosophy i|url=http://www.marquette.edu/mupress/Alston.shtml|publisher=[[Marquette University Press]]|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref> He then taught at [[Rutgers University]] for five years, followed by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1976 to 1980 and then [[Syracuse University]] from 1980 to 1992.<ref name=\"Shook2005\" />\n\nHis views on [[foundationalism]], [[internalism and externalism|internalism versus externalism]], [[illocutionary act|speech acts]], and the epistemic value of mystical experience, among many other topics, have been very influential.
