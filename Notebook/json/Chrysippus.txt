He was a native of [[Soli, Cilicia]], but moved to [[Athens]] as a young man, where he became a pupil of [[Cleanthes]] in the Stoic school. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, Chrysippus became the third head of the school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of the school, which earned him the title of Second Founder of Stoicism.<ref>{{harvnb|Dorandi|1999|p=40}}</ref>\n\nChrysippus excelled in [[logic]], the [[theory of knowledge]], [[ethics]] and [[Stoic physics|physics]]. He created an original system of [[propositional logic]] in order to better understand the workings of the universe and role of humanity within it. He adhered to a [[deterministic]] view of [[Destiny|fate]], but nevertheless sought a role for personal freedom in thought and action. Ethics, he taught, depended on understanding the nature of the universe, and he taught a therapy of [[wikt:extirpate|extirpating]] the [[Stoic passions|unruly passions]] which depress and crush the soul. He initiated the success of Stoicism as one of the most influential philosophical movements for centuries in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world.\n\n== Life ==\n\nChrysippus, the son of Apollonius of [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], was born at [[Soli, Cilicia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=7}}, citing Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 179; Galen, ''Protreptic'', 7; ''de Differentia Pulsuum'', 10</ref> He was slight in stature,<ref name=\"laertius182\">Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 182</ref> and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner.<ref name=\"laertius179\">Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 179</ref> While still young, he lost his substantial inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 181.

His reputation for learning among his contemporaries was considerable.<ref name=\"laertius179\"/> He was noted for intellectual audacity and self-confidence and his reliance on his own ability was shown, among other things, in the request he is supposed to have made to Cleanthes: \"Give me the principles, and I will find the proofs myself.\"<ref name=\"laertius179\"/> He succeeded Cleanthes as head of the Stoic school when Cleanthes died, in around 230 BC.\n\nChrysippus was a prolific writer.

[[Aristotle]]'s [[term logic]] had been concerned with the interrelations of [[Syllogism#Terms in syllogism|terms]] such as \"Socrates\" or \"man\" (\"all men are mortal, Socrates is a man, so Socrates is mortal\"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned with the interrelations of [[proposition]]s such as \"it is day\" (\"if it is day, it is light: but it is day: so it is light\").<ref name=\"sharples24\">{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=24}}</ref> Though the earlier [[Megarian school|Megarian dialecticians]] –&nbsp;[[Diodorus Cronus]] and [[Philo the Dialectician|Philo]]&nbsp;– had worked in this field and the pupils of [[Aristotle]] –&nbsp;[[Theophrastus]] and [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]]&nbsp;– had investigated [[hypothetical syllogism]]s,<ref name=\"johansen466\">{{harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=466}}</ref> it was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic.<ref name=\"johansen466\"/><ref name=\"sharples2425\">{{harvnb|Sharples|2014|pp=24–25}}</ref>\n\n===Propositions===\nChrysippus defined a proposition as \"that which is capable of being denied or affirmed as it is in itself\" and gave examples of propositions such as \"it is day\" and \"Dion is walking.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=69–70}}</ref> He distinguished between simple and non-simple propositions, which in modern terminology are known as [[Atomic sentence|atomic]] and [[Molecular sentence|molecular]] propositions.<ref name=\"johansen466\"/> A simple proposition is an elementary statement such as \"it is day.\"<ref name=\"gould71\">{{harvnb|Gould|1970|p=71}}</ref> Simple propositions are linked together to form non-simple propositions by the use of [[logical connective]]s.

Writing five-hundred years later, [[Sextus Empiricus]] refers to a debate between Diodorus and Philo.<ref name=\"sextus1\">[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Pyr. Hyp.'' ii. 110–112; ''Adv. Math.'' viii. 112–117</ref> Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] had an incorrect [[consequent]], and this meant a proposition such as \"if it is day, then I am talking,\" is true unless it is day and I fall silent.<ref name=\"sextus2\">Sextus Empiricus, ''Pyr. Hyp.'', ii. 110–112</ref> But Diodorus argued that a true conditional is one in which the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition \"if it is day, then I am talking\" can be false, it is invalid.<ref name=\"sextus1\"/> However, [[Paradoxes of material implication|paradoxical propositions]] were still possible such as \"if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists.\"<ref name=\"sextus2\"/> Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible:<ref>When Sextus Empiricus reports the different criteria offered by ancient philosophers for the truth of conditional propositions, he does not mention Chrysippus by name, but modern scholars believe that Chrysippus authored, or, at least, held this view. See {{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=72–82}}</ref> to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent.<ref name=\"johansen468\">{{Harvnb|Johansen|Rosenmeier|1998|p=468}}</ref> This corresponds to the modern-day [[strict conditional]].<ref name=\"johansen468\"/>\n\n===Syllogistic===\nChrysippus developed a syllogistic or system of deduction in which he made use of five types of basic arguments or [[argument form]]s called indemonstrable syllogisms, which played the role of axioms, and four [[Rule of inference|inference rules]], called ''themata'' by means of which complex syllogisms could be reduced to these axioms.<ref>[[Susanne Bobzien]], Stoic Syllogistic, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 14, 1996, pp. 133–192</ref> The forms of the five indemonstrables were:<ref>Diogenes Laertius, vii. 79; Sextus Empiricus, ''Hyp.

The other, the third ''thema'', was a cut rule by which chain syllogisms could be reduced to simple syllogisms.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=logic-ancient/#StoSyl |title=Ancient Logic: Stoic Syllogistic |last=Bobzien |first=Susanne}}</ref>  The purpose of Stoic syllogistic was not merely to create a formal system.

Aristotle's logic prevailed, partly because it was seen as more practical, and partly because it was taken up by the [[Neoplatonists]].<ref name=\"sharples26\"/> As recently as the 19th century, Stoic logic was treated with contempt, a barren formulaic system, which was merely clothing the logic of Aristotle with new terminology.<ref name=\"otoole403\">{{Harvnb|O'Toole|Jennings|2004|p=403}}</ref> It was not until the 20th century, with the advances in logic, and the modern [[propositional calculus]], that it became clear that Stoic logic constituted a significant achievement.<ref name=\"johansen466\"/>\n\n== Epistemology ==\n\nFor the Stoics, truth is distinguished from error by the [[Sage (sophos)|sage]] who possesses right reason.<ref name=\"hicks70\">{{Harvnb|Hicks|1910|p=70}}</ref> Chrysippus's theory of knowledge was [[Empiricism|empirical]].<ref name=\"gould90\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=90}}</ref> The [[sense]]s transmit messages from the external world, and their reports are controlled not by referring them to innate ideas, but by comparing them to previous reports stored in the mind.<ref name=\"gould90\"/> Zeno had defined impressions of sense as \"an impression in the soul\"<ref name=\"stock22\">{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=22}}</ref> and this was interpreted literally by Cleanthes, who compared the impression on the soul to the impression made by a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] on wax.<ref name=\"zeller77\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=77}}</ref> Chrysippus preferred to regard it as an alteration or change in the soul;<ref name=\"stock22\"/> that is, the soul receives a modification from every external object that acts upon it, just as the air receives countless strokes when many people are speaking at once.<ref name=\"stock22\"/>\n\nIn the receipt of an impression, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its own existence, but that also of its cause—just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it.<ref name=\"stock22\"/> The power to name the object resides in the understanding.

Chrysippus accepted [[divination]] as part of the [[causal chain]] of [[Destiny|fate]].]]\nChrysippus also argued for the existence of fate based on [[divination]], which he thought there was good evidence for.<ref name=\"gould144-5\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|pp=144–145}}</ref> It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental.<ref name=\"zeller175\"/> Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences.<ref name=\"hicks947\">{{Harvnb|Hicks|1911|p=947}}</ref> There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity.<ref name=\"hicks947\"/> To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.<ref name=\"hicks947\"/>\n\n===God===\nThe Stoics believed that the universe is [[God]], and Chrysippus affirmed that \"the universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul.\"<ref name=\"cicerodenati15\">Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 15</ref> It is the guiding principle of the universe, \"operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality which embraces all existence.\"<ref name=\"cicerodenati15\"/> Based on these beliefs, physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] identified Chrysippus as a [[Pandeist]].<ref>Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\") (1910), page 233: \"Dieser Pandeismus, der von Chrysippos (aus Soloi 280-208 v. Chr.) herrühren soll, ist schon eine Verbindung mit dem Emanismus; Gott ist die Welt, insofern als diese aus seiner Substanz durch Verdichtung und Abkühlung entstanden ist und entsteht, und er sich strahlengleich mit seiner Substanz durch sie noch verbreitet.\"</ref>\n\nChrysippus sought to prove the [[existence of God]], making use of a [[teleological argument]]:\n<blockquote>If there is anything that humanity cannot produce, the being who produces it is better than humanity. But humanity cannot produce the things that are in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.<ref>Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10. Cf. ii. 6 for the fuller version of this argument</ref></blockquote>\nChrysippus spoke of God and gods interchangeably. He interpreted the [[Greek gods|gods]] of traditional Greek religion by viewing them as different aspects of the one reality. [[Cicero]] tells us that \"he further maintained that aether is that which people call [[Zeus]], and that the air which permeates the seas is [[Poseidon]], and that the earth is what is known by the name of [[Demeter]], and he treated in similar style the names of the other gods.\"<ref name=\"cicerodenati15\"/> In addition, the universe exists for the benefit of the universal god:\n<blockquote>We should infer in the case of a beautiful dwelling-place that it was built for its owners and not for [[mice]]; we ought, therefore, in the same way to regard the universe as the dwelling-place of the gods.<ref name=\"cicerodenatiii10\">Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', iii. 10</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Theodicy===\nIn response to the question of how [[evil]] could exist in a good universe, Chrysippus replied \"evil cannot be removed, nor is it well that it should be removed.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1051 B</ref> Firstly, he argued, following [[Plato]], that it was impossible for good to exist without evil, for justice could not be known without injustice, courage without cowardice, temperance without intemperance or wisdom without foolishness.<ref name=\"gelliusvii1\">Aulus Gellius, vii. 1</ref> Secondly, apparent evils exist as a consequent of nature's goodness, thus it was necessary for the human skull to be made from small and thin bones for reasons of utility, but this superior utility meant that the skull is vulnerable to blows.<ref name=\"gelliusvii1\"/> Thirdly, evils are distributed according to the rational will of Zeus, either to punish the wicked or because they are important to the world-order as a whole.<ref>Plutarch, ''De Stoicorum Repugnantiis'', 1050 E; ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 B</ref> Thus evil is good under disguise, and is ultimately conducive to the best. Chrysippus compared evil to the coarse jest in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]]; for, just as the jest, though offensive in itself, improves the piece as a whole, \"so too you may criticize evil regarded by itself, yet allow that, taken with all else, it has its use.\"<ref>Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1065 D</ref>\n\n== Mathematics ==\n[[File:Kegelstumpf.png|thumb|right|The puzzle of Democritus. If a cone is sliced horizontally, are the surfaces produced equal or unequal?]]\n\nChrysippus regarded [[Physical body|bodies]], surfaces, [[Line (geometry)|lines]], [[Location (geography)|places]], the [[Vacuum|void]] and [[time]] as all being [[Infinite divisibility|infinitely divisible]].<ref name=\"gould116\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=116}}</ref> He determined one of the principal features of the [[infinite set]]: since a man and a finger have an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.<ref name=\"gould117\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=117}}</ref>\n\nChrysippus also responded to a problem first posed by [[Democritus]].<ref>Plutarch, ''De Communibus Notitiis'', 1079F</ref> If a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is divided by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] parallel to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]; if they are unequal, then the surface of the cone must be [[Step function|stepped]].<ref name=\"gould117\"/> The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal.<ref name=\"gould118\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=118}}</ref> Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the [[law of excluded middle]] with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern [[infinitesimal calculus]], namely, the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] and the process of [[Convergent series|convergence towards a limit]].<ref name=\"gould118\"/>\n\nChrysippus was notable for claiming that \"[[1 (number)|one]]\" is a [[number]]. One was not always considered a number by the ancient Greeks since they viewed one as that by which things are measured. [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' wrote, \"... a measure is not the things measured, but the measure or the One is the beginning of number.\"<ref name=\"heath69\">{{Harvnb|Heath|1921|p=69}}</ref> Chrysippus asserted that one had \"magnitude one\" ({{lang-el|πλῆθος ἕν}}),<ref>[[Iamblichus]], ''in Nicom.'', ii. 8f; [[Syrianus]], ''in Arist. Metaph.'', Kroll 140. 9f.</ref> although this was not generally accepted by the Greeks, and [[Iamblichus]] wrote that \"magnitude one\" was a contradiction in terms.<ref name=\"heath69\"/>\n\n== Ethics ==\n[[File:Medeia child Louvre K300.jpg|right|thumb|Greek [[amphora]] depicting [[Euripides]]' ''[[Medea (play)|Medea]]''. Chrysippus regarded [[Medea]] as a prime example of how bad judgments could give rise to irrational passions.<ref>[[Galen]], ''On The Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato'', iii.3.13–22, iv.2.27, iv.6.19–27. See also [[Epictetus]], ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', i.28.6–10; ii.17.19–23, for an example of this play being discussed in the setting of a Stoic school</ref>]]\n\nChrysippus taught that [[ethics]] depended on physics. In his ''Physical Theses'', he stated: \"for there is no other or more appropriate way of approaching the subject of good and evil on the virtues or happiness than from the nature of all things and the administration of the universe.\"<ref name=\"stock13\">{{Harvnb|Stock|1908|p=13}}</ref> The goal of life, said Chrysippus, is to live in accordance with one's experience of the actual course of nature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=163}}</ref> A person's individual nature is part of the nature of the whole universe,<ref name=\"laertius87\">Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 87</ref> and thus life should be lived in accordance with one's own human nature as well as that of the universe.<ref name=\"laertius88\">Diogenes Laërtius, vii. 88</ref> Human nature is ethical, and humanity is akin to the Divine, emanating from the primal fire or aether, which, though material, is the embodiment of reason; and people should conduct themselves accordingly.<ref name=\"davidson615\">{{Harvnb|Davidson|1908|p=615}}</ref> People have freedom, and this freedom consists in emancipation from irrational desires (lust, riches, position in life, domination, etc.) and in subjecting the will to reason.<ref name=\"davidson615\"/> Chrysippus laid the greatest stress on the worth and dignity of the individual, and on the power of will.<ref name=\"davidson615\"/>\n\nThe Stoics admitted between the good and the bad a third class of things – the indifferent (''[[adiaphora]]'').<ref name=\"kenny282\">{{Harvnb|Kenny|2006|pp=282–3}}</ref> Of things morally indifferent, the best includes health, and riches, and honour, and the worst includes sickness and poverty.<ref name=\"zeller284\">{{Harvnb|Zeller|1880|p=284}}</ref> Chrysippus accepted that it was normal in ordinary usage to refer to the preferred indifferent things as \"good\",<ref name=\"kenny282\"/> but the wise person, said Chrysippus, uses such things without requiring them.<ref name=\"zeller284\"/> Practice and habit are necessary to render virtue perfect in the individual – in other words, there is such a thing as moral progress, and character has to be built up.<ref name=\"davidson615\"/>\n\nThe Stoics sought to be free of the [[Stoic passions|unruly emotions]], which they regarded as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (''pathe'') are the disturbing element in right judgment.<ref name=\"davidson615\"/> Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of the emotions.<ref name=\"gould186\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=186}}</ref> The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (''[[apatheia]]'').<ref name=\"gould186\"/> Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop.<ref name=\"sharples68\">{{Harvnb|Sharples|2014|p=68}}</ref> One cannot hope to eradicate the emotions when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm.<ref name=\"gould187\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=187}}</ref> Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with the emotions in the mind as if they were present.<ref name=\"gould188\">{{Harvnb|Gould|1970|p=188}}</ref> By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.<ref name=\"gould188\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Apocatastasis#Stoicism|Apocatastasis]]\n*[[Deixis]]\n*[[History of logic]]\n*[[Lazy argument]]\n*[[List of unusual deaths]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation |last=Barnes |first=Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Barnes |year=1999 |contribution=The History of Hellenistic Logic |editor-last=Algra |editor-first=Keimpe |editor-link=Keimpe Algra |editor2-last=Barnes |editor2-first=Jonathan |editor3-last=Mansfeld |editor3-first=Jaap |editor4-last=Schofield |editor4-first=Malcolm |title=The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-61670-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Brunschwig |first=Jacques |last2=Sedley |first2=David |author2-link=David Sedley |year=2003 |contribution=Hellenistic philosophy |editor-last=Sedley |editor-first=David |title=The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77503-5}}\n* {{Citation |last=Davidson |first=William Leslie |year=1908 |contribution=Chrysippus |editor-last=Hastings |editor-first=James |editor-link=James Hastings |title=Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics |volume=3 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopaediaofr03hastuoft |publisher=T. & T.
