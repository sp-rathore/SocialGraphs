As the Princeton philosopher [[Mark Johnston (philosopher)]] explained in the ''Boston Review'':   \"In Scheffler’s self-consciously idiosyncratic use of the term, the 'afterlife' is neither a supernatural continuation of this life, nor the result of a deeper naturalistic understanding of the kind of thing we are; it is what John Stuart Mill called 'the onward rush of mankind,' the collective life of humanity after our individual deaths. Scheffler’s thesis is that the onward rush of humankind—the collective afterlife—is much more important to us than we are ordinarily apt to notice.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/mark-johnston-samuel-scheffler-death-afterlife-humanity-ponzi-scheme|title=Is Life a Ponzi Scheme?|work=bostonreview.net}}</ref>  Assessing the argument, the English philosopher [[John Cottingham]] wrote:  \"Scheffler has produced a superb essay -- indeed it seems to me about as good as analytic philosophy gets. It is entirely free from obfuscating jargon and other tiresome tricks of the trade, yet it is meticulously argued and demanding in exactly the right way -- forcing us to think about hitherto unexamined implications of our existing beliefs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/48060-death-and-the-afterlife/|title=Death and the Afterlife|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|work=nd.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Selected books==\n*''Death and the Afterlife'' (Oxford University Press, 2013)\n*''Equality and Tradition'' (Oxford University Press, 2010)\n*''Boundaries and Allegiances: Problems of Justice and Responsibility in Liberal Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 2001)\n*''The Rejection of Consequentialism'' (Oxford University Press 2nd ed., 1994) (editor)\n*''Human Morality'' (Oxford University Press, 1992)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWHqIhbYBas Video interview with Scheffler].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scheffler, Samuel}}\n[[Category:American philosophers]]\n[[Category:New York University faculty]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:21st-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:Princeton University alumni, 1970–79]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Analytic philosophers]]\n[[Category:Political philosophers]]\n[[Category:Moral philosophers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Samuel Scheffler"}}}}
