Hugh Woodin]] formulated the Bi-interpretability Conjecture for the [[Turing degrees]], which conjectures that the partial order of the Turing degrees is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to second order arithmetic.  They showed that the Bi-interpretability Conjecture is equivalent to there being no nontrivial automorphism of the Turing degrees.  They also exhibited limits on the possible automorphisms of the Turing degrees by showing that any automorphism will be arithmetically definable.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite conference\n | last=Slaman \n | first=Theodore A. \n | author-link=Theodore Slaman \n | title=Degree structures \n |mr=93b:03074 \n | booktitle= Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vol. I, II (Kyoto, 1990)\n | year=1991\n | pages=303â€“316}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://math.berkeley.edu/~slaman/ home page].\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=30966}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slaman, Theodore}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American logicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:American philosophers]]\n\n\n{{US-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Theodore Slaman"}}}}
