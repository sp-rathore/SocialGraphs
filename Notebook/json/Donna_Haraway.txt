Haraway''' (born September 6, 1944) is a Distinguished Professor Emerita in the [[History of Consciousness]] Department and [[Feminist studies|Feminist Studies]] Department at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], United States. Haraway, a prominent scholar in the field of [[science and technology studies]], was described in the early 1990s as a \"[[feminist]], rather loosely a [[neo-Marxist]]  and a [[postmodernist]]\".<ref>Young, Robert M, \"Science, Ideology & Donna Haraway\", in Science as Culture, 15.3 (1992): 165-207.</ref> She is the author of numerous books and essays that bring together questions of science and feminism, such as \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" (1985) and ''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective'' (1988).\n\nHaraway has taught [[Women's Studies]] and the [[History of Science]] at the [[University of Hawaii]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In September 2000, Haraway was awarded the highest honor given by the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]] (4S), the [[J. D. Bernal]] Award, for lifetime contributions to the field. Haraway's works have contributed to the study of both human-machine and [[Animal Studies|human-animal]] relations. Her works have sparked debate in [[primatology]], [[philosophy]], and [[developmental biology]].<ref>Kunzru, Hari. \"You Are Cyborg\", in Wired Magazine, 5:2 (1997) 1-7.</ref> Haraway participated in a collaborative exchange with the eminent feminist theorist [[Lynn Randolph]] from 1990 to 1996. Their engagement with specific ideas relating to feminism, technoscience, political consciousness, and other social issues, formed the images and narrative of Haraway's book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnrandolph.com/|title=Lynn Randolph|work=lynnrandolph.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nDonna Jeanne Haraway was born in 1944 in [[Denver, Colorado]].  Haraway's father was a sportswriter for ''[[The Denver Post]]'' and her mother, who came from a heavily Irish Catholic background, died when Haraway was 16 years old.<ref>Haraway, Donna J., ''How Like a Leaf: Donna J. Haraway an interview with Thyrza Nichols Goodeve''.  Routledge, 2000, pp. 6–7.</ref>  Haraway attended high school at [[St. Mary's Academy (Cherry Hills Village)|St. Mary’s Academy]] in [[Cherry Hills Village, Colorado]].  Haraway triple majored in zoology, philosophy and literature at the [[Colorado College]].<ref>Haraway,''How Like a Leaf'' (2000), p. 12.</ref> After college, Haraway moved to [[Paris]] and studied evolutionary philosophy and theology at the Fondation Teilhard de Chardin on a [[Fulbright scholarship]].<ref>Haraway, ''How Like a Leaf'' (2000), p. 18.</ref>   She completed her Ph.D. in [[biology]] at [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1970 writing a dissertation about the use of metaphor in shaping experiments in experimental biology titled ''The Search for Organizing Relations: An Organismic Paradigm in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology'',<ref>Library of Congress, ''Catalog of Copyright Entries Third Series: 1973: January–June''</ref> later edited into a book and published under the title ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology''.<ref>Haraway, Donna Jeanne, ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology''.  Yale University Press, 1976.</ref> Haraway was the recipient of a number of scholarships, to which she wittily accepted (alluding to the [[Cold War]] and post-war American hegemony) saying, “...people like me became national resources in the national science efforts.  So, there was money available for educating even Irish Catholic girls’ brains.\"<ref>Bhavnani, Kum-Kum.; Haraway, Donna H. (February 1994), \"Shifting the Subject: A Conversation between Kum-Kum Bhavnani and Donna Haraway, 12 April\n1993, Santa Cruz, California\", ''[[Feminism & Psychology]]'' (Thousand Oaks:Sage Publications) 4(1):20.</ref>\n\n==Major themes==\n\n===''Primate Visions''===\n{{Citation style|date=September 2013}}\n\nHaraway’s work is grounded in the [[history of science]] and [[biology]]. In ''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science'', she focuses on the metaphors and narratives that direct the science of [[primatology]]. She asserts that there is a tendency to masculinize the stories about \"reproductive competition and sex between aggressive males and receptive females [that] facilitate some and preclude other types of conclusions\".<ref>Carubia, Josephine M., \"Haraway on the Map\", in ''Semiotic Review of Books''. 9:1 (1998), 4-7.</ref> She contends that female primatologists focus on different observations that require more communication and basic survival activities, offering very different perspectives of the origins of nature and culture than the currently accepted ones. Drawing on examples of Western [[narratives]] and [[ideologies]] of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[social class|class]], Haraway questions the most fundamental constructions of scientific human nature stories based on primates. In ''Primate Visions'', she writes:\n<blockquote>\"My hope has been that the always oblique and sometimes perverse focusing would facilitate revisionings of fundamental, persistent western narratives about difference, especially racial and sexual difference; about reproduction, especially in terms of the multiplicities of generators and offspring; and about survival, especially about survival imagined in the boundary conditions of both the origins and ends of history, as told within western traditions of that complex genre\".<ref>''Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science'', Routledge: New York and London, 1989. ISBN 978-0-415-90294-6</ref></blockquote>\n\nHaraway's aim for science is \"to reveal the limits and impossibility of its '[[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]]' and to consider some recent revisions offered by feminist primatologists\".<ref>Russon, Anne. \"Deconstructing Primatology?\", in ''Semiotic Review of Books'', 2:2 (1991), 9-11.</ref> Haraway presents an alternative perspective to the accepted ideologies that continue to shape the way scientific human nature stories are created.<ref>Elkins, Charles, \"The Uses of Science Fiction\", in ''Science Fiction Studies'', 17:2 (1990).</ref>\nHaraway urges feminists to be more involved in the world of technoscience and to be credited for that involvement. In a 1997 publication, she remarked:\n<blockquote>I want feminists to be enrolled more tightly in the meaning-making processes of technoscientific world-building. I also want feminist—activists, cultural producers, scientists, engineers, and scholars (all overlapping categories) — to be recognized for the articulations and enrollment we have been making all along within technoscience, in spite of the ignorance of most \"mainstream\" scholars in their characterization (or lack of characterizations) of feminism in relation to both technoscientific practice and technoscience studies.<ref>''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan© Meets_OncoMouse™: Feminism and Technoscience'', New York: Routledge, 1997. ISBN 0-415-91245-8.</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===\"A Cyborg Manifesto\"===\n{{See also|A Cyborg Manifesto}}\n\nIn 1985, Haraway published the essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" in ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]]''. Although most of Haraway's earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto came at a critical juncture at which feminists, in order to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the \"informatics of domination.\"<ref name=\"stanford.edu\">Haraway, Donna. [https://materia.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/haraway_cyborg_manifesto.pdf \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\"]. Stanford University.</ref> Feminists must, she proclaims, unite behind \"an ironic dream of a common language for women in the integrated circuit.\"<ref name=\"stanford.edu\"/> Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.\n\nAccording to Haraway's \"Manifesto\", \"there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category. There is not even such a state as '[[being]]' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices\" (p.&nbsp;155). A cyborg does not require a stable, essentialist identity, argues Haraway, and feminists should consider creating coalitions based on \"affinity\" instead of identity. To ground her argument, Haraway analyzes the phrase \"women of color\", suggesting it as one possible example of affinity politics. Using a term coined by theorist Chela Sandoval, Haraway writes that \"oppositional consciousness\" is comparable with a cyborg politics, because rather than identity it stresses how affinity comes as a result of \"otherness, difference, and specificity\" (p.&nbsp;156).\n\n===Cyborg feminism===\nIn her updated essay \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\",<ref name=\"stanford.edu\" /> in her book ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991), Haraway uses the cyborg metaphor to explain how fundamental contradictions in feminist theory and identity should be conjoined, rather than resolved, similar to the fusion of machine and organism in cyborgs. \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" is also an important feminist critique of capitalism.\n\n===\"Situated Knowledges\"===\n\n''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective''<ref>''Feminist Studies'' 14, no. 3 (Fall 1988), pp. 575–599.</ref> sheds light on Haraway's vision for a feminist science. This essay originated as a commentary on [[Sandra Harding]]'s ''The Science Question in Feminism'' (1986) and is a reply to Harding's ''\"successor science\"''. Haraway offers a critique of the feminist intervention into masculinized traditions of scientific rhetoric and the concept of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]]. The essay identifies the metaphor that gives shape to the traditional feminist critique as a polarization. At one end lies those who would assert that science is a rhetorical practice and, as such, all ''\"science is a contestable text and a power field\"'' (p.&nbsp;577). At the other are those interested in a feminist version of objectivity, a position Haraway describes as a \"feminist empiricism\" {{clarify|date=September 2013}}.\n\n==Criticisms==\n\nHaraway's work has been criticized for being \"methodologically vague\"<ref>Hamner, M.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/993887380658p195/fulltext.pdf]</ref>\n\nA 1991 review of Haraway's ''Primate Visions'', published in the ''[[International Journal of Primatology]]'', provides examples of some of the most common critiques of her view of science:<ref name=\"springerlink.com\"/>\n\n<blockquote>This is a book that contradicts itself a hundred times; but that is not a criticism of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This is a book that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.\n\nThis is a book that clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; but that is not a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and refreshing to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book as much as I do is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.</blockquote>\n\nAnother review of the same book, appearing in a 1990 issue of the ''[[American Journal of Primatology]]'', offers a similar criticism of Haraway's literary style and scholarly methods:<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\" />\n\n<blockquote>There are many places where an editorial hand appears absent altogether. Neologisms are continually coined, and sentences are paragraph-long and convoluted. Biography, history, propaganda, science, science fiction, and cinema are intertwined in the most confusing way. Perhaps the idea is to induce a slightly dissociated state, so that readers can be lulled into belief. If one did not already possess some background, this book would give no lucid history of anthropology or primatology.</blockquote>\n\n== Publications ==\n* ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields: Metaphors of Organicism in Twentieth-Century Developmental Biology'', 1976.
