He was a member of the [[Young Germany]] group of German writers.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn at [[Potsdam]], Mundt studied [[philology]] and philosophy at Berlin. In 1832 he settled at [[Leipzig]] as a journalist, where he co-edited ''Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung'', and where he was subjected to a rigorous police supervision. In 1839 he married Klara Müller (1814–1873), who under the name of [[Luise Mühlbach]] became a popular novelist, and he moved in the same year to Berlin. Here his intention of entering upon an academical career was for a time thwarted by his collision with the [[Prussia]]n press laws. In 1842, however, he was permitted to establish himself as ''[[Privatdozent]]''. In 1848 he was appointed Professor of Literature and History in [[Breslau]], and in 1850 ordinary professor and librarian in Berlin, where he died.\n\n==Works==\nMundt wrote extensively on [[aesthetic]] subjects, and as a critic he had considerable influence in his time. Prominent among his works are ''Die Kunst der deutschen Prosa'' (1837); ''Geschichte der Literatur der Gegenwart'' (1840); ''Aesthetik, die Idee der Schönheit und des Kunstwerks im Lichte unserer Zeit'' (1845, new ed. 1868); ''Die Götterwelt der alten Völker'' (1846, new ed. 1854). He also wrote several historical novels such as ''[[Thomas Münzer]]'' (1841); ''Mendoza'' (1847); and ''Die Matadore'' (1850). With [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]], he edited [[Karl Ludwig von Knebel]]'s letters and posthumous works. But perhaps Mundt's chief title to fame was his part in the [[emancipation of women]], a theme which he elaborated in ''Madonna, Unterhaltungen mit einer Heiligen'' (1835).\n\n== References ==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Mundt, Theodor}}\n*{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Mundt, Theodor |year=1905}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mundt, Theodor}}\n[[Category:1808 births]]\n[[Category:1861 deaths]]\n[[Category:German philosophers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Berlin]]\n[[Category:German male novelists]]\n[[Category:19th-century German novelists]]\n[[Category:19th-century male writers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Theodor Mundt"}}}}
