Some of the people there were expressing the view that there could be a justification for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Another occasion which is equally telling: Fritz Machlup was a student of Mises's, one of his most faithful disciples. At one of the Mont Pelerin meetings, Machlup gave a talk in which I think he questioned the idea of a gold standard; he came out in favor of floating exchange rates. Mises was so mad he wouldn't speak to Machlup for three years. Some people had to come around and bring them together again. It's hard to understand; you can get some understanding of it by taking into account how people like Mises were persecuted in their lives.</blockquote>\n\nEconomist [[Murray Rothbard]], who studied under Mises, agreed he was uncompromising, but disputes reports of his abrasiveness. In his words, Mises was \"unbelievably sweet, constantly finding research projects for students to do, unfailingly courteous, and never bitter\" about the discrimination he received at the hands of the economic establishment of his time.<ref>Murray Rothbard, {{YouTube|KWdUIuID8ag|\"The Future of Austrian Economics\"}}, 1990 talk at Mises University at Stanford, at MisesMedia Youtube channel.</ref>\n\nMises' 1927 book ''Liberalism'' has been largely ignored, except for its comments on [[fascism]].

The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history. But though its policy has brought salvation for the moment, it is not of the kind which could promise continued success. Fascism was an emergency makeshift. To view it as something more would be a fatal error.</blockquote>\n\nMises biographer Jörg Guido Hülsmann says that critics who suggest that Mises supported fascism are \"absurd\", as he notes that the full quote describes fascism as dangerous. He notes that Mises thought it was a \"fatal error\" to think that it was more than an \"emergency makeshift\" against the looming threat of communism and socialism, as exemplified by the [[Bolsheviks]] in Russia.<ref name=Knight />{{rp|560}}\n\nAfter Mises died, his widow quoted a passage that he had written about [[Benjamin Anderson]]. She said it best described Mises's own personality: \n<blockquote>\"His most eminent qualities were his inflexible honesty, his unhesitating sincerity. He never yielded.
