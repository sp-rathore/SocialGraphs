To make matters worse, Arabic, my native language, and English, my school language, were inextricably mixed: I have never known which was my first language, and have felt fully at home in neither, although I dream in both.

About Victoria College, Edward said:\n\n{{Quotation|The moment one became a student at [Victoria College], one was given the student handbook, a series of regulations governing every aspect of school life—the kind of uniform we were to wear, what equipment was needed for sports, the dates of school holidays, bus schedules, and so on. But the school’s first rule, emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook, read: 'English is the language of the school; students caught speaking any other language will be punished.' Yet, there were no native speakers of English among the students. Whereas the masters were all British, we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Turks, each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed. Yet all, or nearly all, of us spoke Arabic—many spoke Arabic and French—and so we were able to take refuge in a common language, in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial stricture.|”Between Worlds”, ''Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57.<ref> ”Between Worlds”, ''Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1951, Victoria College expelled Edward, who had proved a troublesome boy, despite being a student of great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation.

In his Foreword, Said said that ''Jewish History, Jewish Religion'' is \"nothing less than a concise history of classic and modern [[Judaism]], insofar as these are relevant to the understanding of modern Israel\"; and praised the historian Shahak for describing contemporary Israel as a nation subsumed in a \"Judeo–Nazi\" cultural ambience that allowed the [[dehumanization]] of the Palestinian [[Other]]:<ref>[[Werner Cohn]]: [http://www.wernercohn.com/Said.html What Edward Said knows] Page accessed 2012-06-15.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|In all my works, I remained fundamentally critical of a gloating and uncritical nationalism. . . .

As a political party, the ideology of ''Al-Mubadara'' is specifically an alternative to the extremist politics of the social-democratic [[Fatah]] and the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Hamas]] (Islamic Resistance Movement). Said's founding of the group, as well as his other international political activities concerning Palestine, were noticed by the U.S. government; in 2006, the anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283-page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Said, begun in 1971, four years into his career as a public intellectual active in U.S. politics.<ref>David Price, [http://www.counterpunch.org/price01132006.html \"How the FBI Spied on Edward Said,\"] ''CounterPunch'' 13 January 2006, accessed 15 January 2006.</ref>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Diván Este-Oeste 2005.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=Photo of an orchestra playing in casual dress.|The harmonious Middle East: the [[West-Eastern Divan Orchestra]] conducted by Daniel Barenboim.]]\nBesides having been a public intellectual, Edward Said was an accomplished pianist, worked as the music critic for ''The Nation'' magazine, and wrote four books about music: ''Musical Elaborations'' (1991); ''Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society'' (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; ''On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain'' (2006); and ''Music at the Limits'' (2007) in which final tome he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.<ref>Ranjan Ghosh, [http://www.ewidgetsonline.com/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=lHNy0CN9jdX%2fkV3%2f8IVtAA%3d%3d&rand=1414102986&buyNowLink= ''Edward Said and the Literary, Social, and Political World''], New York: Routledge, 2009: p. 22.</ref><ref>Columbia University Press, [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13936-6/music-at-the-limits ''Music at the Limits'' by Edward W.
