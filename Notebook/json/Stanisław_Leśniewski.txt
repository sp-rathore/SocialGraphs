Later he attended lectures by [[Hans Cornelius]] at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and lectures by [[Wacław Sierpiński]] at the [[Lviv University]].\n\n==Life==\nLeśniewski belonged to the first generation of the [[Lwów-Warsaw School of logic]] founded by [[Kazimierz Twardowski]]. Together with [[Alfred Tarski]] and  [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], he formed the ''troika'', which made the [[University of Warsaw]], during the [[Interbellum]], perhaps the most important research center in the world for [[formal logic]].\n\nHis main contribution was the construction of three nested [[formal system]]s, to which he gave the Greek-derived names of protothetic, ontology, and [[mereology]]. (\"Calculus of names\" is sometimes used instead of [[ontology]], a term widely employed in [[metaphysics]] in a very different sense.) A good textbook presentation of these systems is Simons (1987), who compares and contrasts them with the variants of [[mereology]], more popular nowadays, descending from the ''calculus of individuals'' of Leonard and Goodman. Simons clarifies something that is very difficult to determine by reading Leśniewski and his students, namely that Polish mereology is a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]] isomorphic to what is now called classical extensional [[mereology]].\n\nWhile he did publish a fair body of work (Leśniewski, 1992, is his collected works in English translation), some of it in German, the leading language for mathematics of his day, his writings had limited impact because of their enigmatic style and highly idiosyncratic notation. Leśniewski was also a radical [[nominalist]]: he rejected [[axiomatic set theory]] at a time when that theory was in full flower. He pointed to [[Russell's paradox]] and the like in support of his rejection, and devised his three formal systems as a concrete alternative to set theory. Even though [[Alfred Tarski]] was his sole doctoral pupil, Leśniewski nevertheless strongly influenced an entire generation of Polish logicians and mathematicians via his teaching at the University of Warsaw. It is mainly thanks to the writings of his students (e.g., Srzednicki and Rickey 1984) that Leśniewski's thought is known.\n\nDuring the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-21, Leśniewski served the cause of Poland's independence by breaking [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russian]] [[cipher]]s for the Polish [[General Staff]]'s [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]].\n\nLeśniewski died suddenly of cancer, shortly before the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]], which resulted in the destruction of his [[Nachlass]].\n\n==Works==\n* 1988.
