Much of Buffett's early childhood years were enlivened with entrepreneurial ventures. One of his first business ventures, Buffett sold chewing gum, [[Coca-Cola]] bottles, or weekly magazines [[door to door]]. He worked in his grandfather's grocery store. While still in high school, he made money delivering newspapers, selling golf balls and stamps, and detailing cars, among other means.

The next year they had their first child, [[Susan Alice Buffett|Susan Alice]]. In 1954, Buffett accepted a job at [[Benjamin Graham]]'s partnership. His starting salary was $12,000 a year (approximately $105,000 [[Inflation adjustment|inflation adjusted]] for the 2012 [[USD]]<ref name=\"CPI Inflation Calculator\"/>). There he worked closely with [[Walter Schloss]]. Graham was a tough boss. He was adamant that stocks provide a wide margin of safety after weighing the trade-off between their price and their intrinsic value. The argument made sense to Buffett but he questioned whether the criteria were too stringent and caused the company to miss out on big winners that had other appealing features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} That same year the Buffetts had their second child, [[Howard Graham Buffett|Howard Graham]]. In 1956, Benjamin Graham retired and closed his partnership. At this time Buffett's personal savings were over $174,000 ($1.47&nbsp;million 2012 [[USD]]<ref name=\"CPI Inflation Calculator\"/>) and he started Buffett Partnership Ltd..\n\n[[File:Dundee HD Omaha NE.JPG|thumb|Buffett's home in Omaha]]\nIn 1957, Buffett operated three partnerships. He purchased a five-bedroom stucco house in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], where he still lives, for $31,500.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, [[Peter Andrew Buffett|Peter Andrew]], was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner [[Charlie Munger]]. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He asked one of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors willing to invest $10,000 each in his partnership.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Eventually eleven agreed, and Buffett pooled their money with a mere $100 original investment of his own.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1961, Buffett revealed that [[Sanborn Map Company]] accounted for 35% of the partnership's assets.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He explained that in 1958 Sanborn stock sold at only $45 per share when the value of the Sanborn investment portfolio was $65 per share.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} This meant that buyers valued Sanborn stock at \"minus $20\" per share and were unwilling to pay more than 70 cents on the dollar for an investment portfolio with a map business thrown in for nothing which earned him a spot on Sanborn's board.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===As a millionaire===\nIn 1962, Buffett became a millionaire because of his partnerships, which in January 1962 had an excess of $7,178,500, of which over $1,025,000 belonged to Buffett. He merged these partnerships into one. Buffett invested in and eventually took control of a textile manufacturing firm, [[Berkshire Hathaway]]. He began buying shares in Berkshire from [[Seabury Stanton]], the owner, whom he later fired.  Buffett's partnerships began purchasing shares at $7.60 per share. In 1965, when Buffett's partnerships began purchasing Berkshire aggressively, they paid $14.86 per share while the company had [[working capital]] of $19 per share. This did not include the value of fixed assets (factory and equipment). Buffett took control of Berkshire Hathaway at a board meeting and named a new president, Ken Chace, to run the company. In 1966, Buffett closed the partnership to new money. He later claimed that the textile business had been his worst trade.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=Buffett's Worst Trade | date=October 18, 2010 |url= http://www.cnbc.com/id/39724884 |publisher=CNBC }}</ref> He then moved the business into the insurance sector, and, in 1985, the last of the mills that had been the core business of Berkshire Hathaway was sold. Buffett wrote in his letter: \"... unless it appears that circumstances have changed (under some conditions added capital would improve results) or unless new partners can bring some asset to the partnership other than simply capital, I intend to admit no additional partners to BPL.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn a second letter, Buffett announced his first investment in a private business&nbsp;— Hochschild, Kohn and Co, a privately owned Baltimore department store. In 1967, Berkshire paid out its first and only dividend of 10 cents. In 1969, following his most successful year, Buffett liquidated the partnership and transferred their assets to his partners. Among the assets paid out were shares of Berkshire Hathaway. In 1970, Buffett began writing his now-famous annual letters to shareholders. However, he lived solely on his salary of $50,000 per year and his outside investment income. In 1979, Berkshire began the year trading at $775 per share, and ended at $1,310. Buffett's net worth reached $620&nbsp;million.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1973, Berkshire began to acquire stock in the [[Washington Post Company]]. Buffett became close friends with [[Katharine Graham]], who controlled the company and its flagship newspaper, and joined its board. In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Buffett and Berkshire's acquisition of WESCO, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Berkshire indirectly purchased the ''[[Buffalo Evening News]]'' for $32.5&nbsp;million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the ''[[Buffalo Courier-Express]]''. Both papers lost money, until the ''Courier-Express'' folded in 1982.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1979, Berkshire began to acquire stock in ABC. [[Capital Cities Communications|Capital Cities]] announced a $3.5&nbsp;billion purchase of ABC on March 18, 1985 surprising the media industry, as ABC was four times bigger than Capital Cities at the time. Buffett helped finance the deal in return for a 25% stake in the combined company.<ref>Kleinfield, N.R. \"ABC is being sold for $3.5&nbsp;billion; 1st network sale\".

In 1990, a scandal involving [[John Gutfreund]] (former CEO of [[Salomon Brothers]]) surfaced. A [[rogue trader]], Paul Mozer, was submitting bids in excess of what was allowed by Treasury rules.

He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, as a result of putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]]. <blockquote>Americans ... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an '[[ownership society]]' will not find happiness in – and I'll use hyperbole here for emphasis – a '[[sharecropping|sharecropping society]]’.</blockquote>\n\n===Dollar and gold===\nThe trade deficit induced Buffett to enter the foreign currency market for the first time in 2002. He substantially reduced his stake in 2005 as changing interest rates increased the costs of holding currency contracts. Buffett remained [[Bear market|bearish]] on the dollar, stating that he was looking to acquire companies with substantial foreign revenues. Buffett emphasized the non-productive aspect of a [[gold standard]] for the USD in 1998 at Harvard: <blockquote>It gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</blockquote> In 1977, about stocks, gold, farmland and inflation, he stated:<blockquote>Stocks are probably still the best of all the poor alternatives in an era of inflation – at least they are if you buy in at appropriate prices.<ref>{{Cite journal | last=Buffett | first=Warren | title=How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor | journal=Fortune | date=May 1977 | ref=harv | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===China===\nBuffett invested in [[PetroChina]] Company Limited and in a rare move, posted a commentary<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=May 20, 2008|url=http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sudan.pdf|format=PDF|title=Shareholder Proposal Regarding Berkshire's Investment In PetroChina|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]}}</ref> on Berkshire Hathaway's website stating why he would not divest over its connection with the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese civil war]] that caused Harvard to divest.
