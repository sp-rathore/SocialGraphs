Leaving school at 12, he continued to study in his free time whilst undertaking a series of jobs.  These included assistant to his father (a tailor), a clerk at a nearby iron works, a private tutor, secretary to the editor of ''Basler Zeitung'' and, at the age of 20, private tutor to the sons of Count Salis in [[Chur]].  Travelling Europe with his charges (1756–1758) allowed him to meet established mathematicians in the German states, The Netherlands, France and the Italian states. On his return to Chur he published his first books (on optics and cosmology) and began to seek an academic post. After a few short posts he was rewarded (1763) by an invitation to a position at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, where he gained the sponsorship of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] of [[Prussia]], and became a friend of [[Euler]]. In this stimulating and financially stable environment, he worked prodigiously until his death in 1777.\n\n== Work ==\n\n===Mathematics===\nLambert was the first to introduce [[hyperbolic function]]s into [[trigonometry]]. Also, he made conjectures regarding [[non-Euclidean]] space. Lambert is credited with the first proof that [[Proof that π is irrational|π is irrational]]. He used a [[generalized continued fraction]] for the function tan x. [[Euler]] believed but could not prove that π was irrational, and it is speculated that [[Aryabhata]] also believed this, in 500 CE.<ref>{{cite book |first= S.

These are triangles drawn on a concave surface, as on a [[saddle]], instead of the usual flat Euclidean surface. Lambert showed that the angles  added up to less than [[π]] ([[radian]]s), or 180°. The amount of shortfall, called the defect, increases with the area. The larger the triangle's area, the smaller the sum of the angles and hence the larger the defect CΔ = π — (α + β + γ). That is, the area of a hyperbolic triangle (multiplied by a constant C) is equal to π (in radians), or 180°, minus the sum of the angles α, β, and γ. Here C denotes, in the present sense, the negative of the [[curvature]] of the surface (taking the negative is necessary as the curvature of a saddle surface is defined to be negative in the first place). As the triangle gets larger or smaller, the angles change in a way that forbids the existence of [[similar triangle|similar]] hyperbolic triangles, as only triangles that have the same angles will have the same area. Hence, instead of expressing the area of the triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides, as in Euclid's geometry, the area of Lambert's hyperbolic triangle can be expressed in terms of its angles.\n\n===Map projection===\nLambert was the first mathematician to address the general properties of [[map projection]]s. In particular he was the first to discuss the properties of conformality and equal area\npreservation and to point out that they were mutually exclusive.\n(Snyder 1993<ref name=flattening>{{cite book | author=Snyder, John P. | title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections | publisher =University of Chicago Press| date=1993|isbn=0-226-76747-7}}.</ref>  p77).

In 1760, he published a book on photometry, the ''[[Photometria]]''. From the assumption that light travels in straight lines, he showed that illumination was proportional to the strength of the source, inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the illuminated surface and the [[Lambert's cosine law|sine of the angle]] of inclination of the light's direction to that of the surface. These results were supported by experiments involving the visual comparison of illuminations and used for the calculation of illumination. In ''Photometria'' Lambert also formulated the law of light absorption—the [[Beer–Lambert law]]) and introduced the term ''[[albedo]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mach|first=Ernst|title=The Principles of Physical Optics|publisher=Dover|date=2003|isbn=0-486-49559-0|pages=14–20}}</ref> He wrote a classic work on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and contributed to [[geometrical optics]]. The photometric unit [[lambert (luminance)|lambert]] is named in recognition of his work in establishing the study of [[photometry (optics)|photometry]]. Lambert was also a pioneer in the development of three-dimensional [[colour models]]. Late in life, he published a description of a triangular colour pyramid (''Farbenpyramide''), which shows a total of 107 colours on six different levels, variously combining red, yellow and blue pigments, and with an increasing amount of white to provide the vertical component.<ref>Lambert, ''Beschreibung einer mit dem Calauschen Wachse ausgemalten Farbenpyramide wo die Mischung jeder Farben aus Weiß und drey Grundfarben angeordnet, dargelegt und derselben Berechnung und vielfacher Gebrauch gewiesen wird'' (Berlin, 1772).

John Benjamins, Amsterdam & Philadelphia. ISBN 978-90-272-4610-3. pp. 218–222.</ref> His investigations were built on the earlier theoretical proposals of [[Tobias Mayer]], greatly extending these early ideas. Lambert was assisted in this project by the court painter [[Benjamin Calau]].<ref>Introduction to {{cite book|date=2011|title=Johann Heinrich Lambert's ''Farbenpyramide''|type=Translation of \"Beschreibung einer mit dem Calauischen Wachse ausgemalten Farbenpyramide\" (\"Description of a colour pyramid painted with Calau's wax\"), 1772, with an introduction by Rolf  Kuehni|url=http://www.iscc.org/pdf/LambertFarbenpyramide.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Philosophy ===\nIn his main philosophical work, ''Neues Organon'' (''New Organon'', 1764), Lambert studied the rules for distinguishing [[Subjectivity|subjective]] from [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] appearances. This connects with his work in the [[science]] of [[optics]]. In 1765 he began corresponding with [[Immanuel Kant]] who intended to dedicate to him the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' but the work was delayed, appearing after his death.<ref>O'Leary M., ''Revolutions of Geometry'', London:Wiley, 2010, p.385</ref>\n\n=== Astronomy ===\nLambert also developed a theory of the generation of the [[universe]] that was similar to the [[nebular hypothesis]] that [[Thomas Wright (astronomer)|Thomas Wright]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] had (independently) developed. Wright published his account in ''An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe'' (1750), Kant in ''Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels'', published anonymously in 1755. Shortly afterward, Lambert published his own version of the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the [[solar system]] in ''Cosmologische Briefe über die Einrichtung des Weltbaues'' (1761). Lambert hypothesized that the stars near the [[sun]] were part of a group which travelled together through the [[Milky Way]], and that there were many such groupings ([[star system]]s) throughout the [[galaxy]]. The former was later confirmed by Sir [[William Herschel]]. In [[astrodynamics]] he also solved the problem of determination of time of flight along a section of orbit, known now as [[Lambert's problem]]. \nHis work in this area is commemorated by the [[Asteroid]] [[187 Lamberta]] named in his honour.\n\n===Logic===\nJohann-Heinrich Lambert is the author of a treatise on logic, which he called ''Neues Organon'' (1764), that is to say, the New Organon. The most recent edition of this work named after Aristotle's Organon was issued in 1990 by the Akademie-Verlag of Berlin. To say nothing of the fact that in it one has the first appearance of the term ''phenomenology'',<ref>In his Preface, p. 4, of vol. I, Lambert called phenomenology “the doctrine of appearance.” In vol. ii, he discussed sense appearance, psychological appearance, moral appearance, probability, and perspective.</ref> one can find therein a very pedagogical presentation of the various kinds of syllogism. In ''A System of Logic Ratiocinative and Inductive'', John-Stuart Mill expresses his admiration for Johann Heinrich Lambert.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of things named after Johann Lambert]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* ''A Short Account of the History of Mathematics'', W.
