In 1864 he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and elected a member of the academy of moral and political sciences.\n\nHe wrote widely on philosophy, politics and ethics, on idealistic lines: ''La Famille'', ''Histoire de la philosophie dans l'antiquité et dans le temps moderne'', ''Histoire de la science politique'', ''Philosophie de la Revolution Française'', etc. However, in the opinion of [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], these writings are not characterised by much originality of thought. In philosophy he was a follower of [[Victor Cousin]], and through him of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]. His principal work, ''Théorie de la morale'', owes much to [[Immanuel Kant]].\n\n=== Works ===\n*The Materialism of the Present Day, a Critique of Dr. Büchner's System ISBN 1152057863\n\n==Notes==\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2014 }}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikisource author}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Janet, Paul}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Janet,+Paul | name=Paul Janet}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Paul Janet}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Janet, Paul}}\n[[Category:1823 births]]\n[[Category:1899 deaths]]\n[[Category:University of Bourges faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Strasbourg faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Paris faculty]]\n[[Category:French philosophers]]\n[[Category:French essayists]]\n[[Category:École Normale Supérieure alumni]]\n[[Category:French male writers]]\n[[Category:Male essayists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Paul Janet"}}}}
