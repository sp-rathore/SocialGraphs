He spent about 20 years of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nDescartes's ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes's influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]—allowing reference to a point in space as a set of numbers, and allowing algebraic equations to be expressed as geometric shapes in a two- or three-dimensional coordinate system (and conversely, shapes to be described as equations)—was named after him. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between algebra and geometry, used in the discovery of [[infinitesimal calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[scientific revolution]].\n\nDescartes refused to accept the authority of previous philosophers. He frequently set his views apart from those of his predecessors. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', a treatise on the [[early modern]] version of what are now commonly called [[emotion]]s, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic \"as if no one had written on these matters before\". He was also suspicious of his own senses: his best known philosophical statement is \"''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''\" ({{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}; ''I think, therefore I am''), found in part IV of ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; written in French but with inclusion of \"''Cogito ergo sum''\") and §7 of part I of ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644; written in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by the Spanish philosopher [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: \"I know I know something. Everything that knows is: thus I am\" (''Nosco me aliquid noscere: at quidquid noscit, est: ergo ego sum''). See: Gómez Pereira, ''De Inmortalitate Animae'', 1749 [1554], p. 277; Santos López, Modesto (1986). \"Gómez Pereira, médico y filósofo medinense\". In: ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', ed. by Eufemio Lorenzo Sanz, 1986.</ref>\n\nMany elements of his philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: First, he rejected the splitting of [[corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]]—divine or natural—in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |url= |id= |isbn=0-205-30840-6 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation.\n\nDescartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and opposed by the [[empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]].

Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way so as to derive some profit from it.</blockquote>\n\nGiven his ambition to become a professional military officer, in 1618, Descartes joined the [[Dutch States Army]] in Breda under the command of [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], and undertook a formal study of [[military engineering]], as established by [[Simon Stevin]]. Descartes therefore received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics. In this way he became acquainted with [[Isaac Beeckman]], principal of a [[Dordrecht]] school, for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music (written 1618, published 1650). Together they worked on [[free fall]], [[catenary]], [[conic section]] and [[fluid statics]]. Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics.<ref name=\"Durandin\">Guy Durandin, Les Principes de la Philosophie.

While within, he had three visions and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy. Upon exiting he had formulated [[analytical geometry]] and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy. He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be, for him, the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life's work.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Durant |first1=Will |authorlink1=Will Durant |last2=Durant |first2=Ariel |authorlink2=Ariel Durant |title=[[The Story of Civilization: Part VII, the Age of Reason Begins]] |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-01320-3 |page=637}}</ref><ref>Clarke (2006), pp. 58–59.</ref> Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another, so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science.

He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years spent time in Paris.

In it Descartes lays out four rules of thought, meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation.\n\n{{Quote|The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt.}}\n\n[[File:René Descartes i samtal med Sveriges drottning, Kristina.jpg|thumb|René Descartes (right) with [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina of Sweden]] (left).]]\n[[File:René Descartes 1644 Principia philosophiae.jpg|thumb|right| ''Principia philosophiae'', 1644]]\nDescartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics work, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed, in 1644, by ''Principia Philosophiæ'' (Principles of Philosophy), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht, and Descartes was obliged to flee to The Hague.\n\nDescartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a long correspondence with [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects. Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published ''Les Passions de l'âme'' (Passions of the Soul), that he dedicated to the Princess. In 1647, he was awarded a pension by the [[Louis XIV]], though it was never paid.<ref name=\"Descartes, René 2009\">Descartes, René. (2009). Encyclopædia Britannica.

Although the [[National Convention]] in 1792 had planned to transfer his remains to the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]], he was reburied in the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]] in 1819, missing a finger and the skull.<ref>The remains are, two centuries later, still resting between two other graves–those of the scholarly monks [[Jean Mabillon]] and [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]—in a chapel of the abbey.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical work==\n{{Further information|Cartesianism}}\nDescartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural sciences]].<ref>\n{{cite book |last=Grosholz |first=Emily |title=Cartesian method and the problem of reduction |authorlink=Emily Grosholz |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2EtAVLU1eIAC&pg=PA1 |isbn=0-19-824250-6 |year=1991 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=But contemporary debate has tended to...understand [Cartesian method] merely as the 'method of doubt'...I want to define Descartes' method in broader terms...to trace its impact on the domains of mathematics and [[physics]] as well as [[metaphysics]].}}</ref> For him the philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge, and expressed it in this way:<ref name=\"Preface\">{{cite web |last=Descartes |first=René |translator-last=Veitch |translator-first=John |url=http://www.classicallibrary.org/descartes/principles/preface.htm |title=Letter of the Author to the French Translator of the Principles of Philosophy serving for a preface |accessdate=December 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|Thus, all Philosophy is like a tree, of which Metaphysics is the root, Physics the trunk, and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk, which are reduced to three principals, namely, Medicine, Mechanics, and Ethics.

To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[methodological skepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted, and then reestablishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archivedate=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Descartes arrives at only a single principle: thought exists. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most famously, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: \"I think, therefore I am\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting, therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. \"The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|left|René Descartes at work]]\nDescartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines \"thought\" (''cogitatio'') as \"what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it\". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book |first=René |last=Descartes |year=1644 |title=The Principles of Philosophy (IX)}}</ref>\n\nTo further demonstrate the limitations of these senses, Descartes proceeds with what is known as the ''[[Wax Argument]]''. He considers a piece of wax; his senses inform him that it has certain characteristics, such as shape, texture, size, color, smell, and so forth. When he brings the wax towards a flame, these characteristics change completely. However, it seems that it is still the same thing: it is still the same piece of wax, even though the data of the senses inform him that all of its characteristics are different. Therefore, in order to properly grasp the nature of the wax, he should put aside the senses. He must use his mind. Descartes concludes:\n\n{{quote|And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is in fact grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind.}}\n\nIn this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and instead admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method. In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', he offers an [[ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the [[ontological argument]] and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, he can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, he finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. In terms of [[epistemology]] therefore, he can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. He, nevertheless, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary in order to verify and validate theories.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nDescartes also wrote a response to [[External world scepticism]]. He argues that [[sensory perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the \"propensity\" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been \"hijacked\" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.\n\n===Dualism===\n{{Further information|Mind-body dichotomy|dualism}}\nDescartes in his ''Passions of the Soul'' and ''[[The Description of the Human Body]]'' suggested that the body works like a machine, that it has material properties. The [[mind]] (or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]), on the other hand, was described as a [[mental world|nonmaterial]] and does not follow the laws of nature. Descartes argued that the mind interacts with the body at the [[pineal gland]]. This form of [[dualism]] or duality proposes that the mind controls the body, but that the body can also influence the otherwise rational mind, such as when people act out of passion. Most of the previous accounts of the relationship between mind and body had been uni-directional.\n\nDescartes suggested that the pineal gland is \"the seat of the soul\" for several reasons. First, the soul is unitary, and unlike many areas of the brain the pineal gland appeared to be unitary (though subsequent microscopic inspection has revealed it is formed of two hemispheres). Second, Descartes observed that the pineal gland was located near the [[ventricular system|ventricles]]. He believed the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] of the ventricles acted through the nerves to control the body, and that the pineal gland influenced this process. Sensations delivered by the nerves to the pineal, he believed, caused it to vibrate in some sympathetic manner, which in turn gave rise to the emotions and caused the body to act.<ref name=\"Descartes, René 2009\"/> Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes' death.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.</ref>\n\nIn present-day discussions on the practice of animal [[vivisection]], it is normal to consider Descartes as an advocate of this practice, as a result of his dualistic philosophy. Some of the sources say that Descartes denied the animals could feel pain, and therefore could be used without concern.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=''Richard Dawkins on vivisection: \"But can they suffer?'' |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |publisher=[[Boingboing]] |date=June 2012 |url=http://boingboing.net/2011/06/30/richard-dawkins-on-v.html |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> Other sources consider that Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence, but did not lack sensations or perceptions, but these could be explained mechanistically''.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Animal Consciousness'', No. 2.

Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name=\"Preface\"/> In this way he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind-body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good choices, and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body. He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name=\"Blom\">Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. ISBN 0-8147-0999-0</ref>\n\nHumans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid blessedness or pleasure. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness, but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name=\"Blom\"/>\n\nThe moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|\"Provisional Morals\"]].\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nIn his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded upon the possibility of thinking the \"idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite,\" and suggests that \"of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct.\"<ref>Descartes, Rene \"Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref>  Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic<ref name=\"books.google.be\" /><ref name=\"KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207\" /><ref name=\"Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107\" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time, however: [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes' views as rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: \"I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God,\" while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''.

(While the traditional concept of \"truth\" implies an external authority, \"certainty\" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.) In an [[anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason.

He \"invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''\". He also \"pioneered the standard notation\" that uses [[superscript]]s to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 4 used in x<sup>4</sup> to indicate squaring of squaring.<ref>René Descartes, ''Discourse de la Méthode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La Géométrie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image page 299.] From page 299: ''\" ...

New York: Oxford University Press. p. 19.</ref> He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in our system of knowledge, and believed that algebra was a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities. European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians, such as [[François Viète|Vieta]], who argued that it could represent only area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or \"universal mathematics,\" as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (1972). New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 280–281</ref>\n\nDescartes' work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |authorlink=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=0-393-04002-X}}</ref> His [[Descartes' rule of signs|rule of signs]] is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial.\n\nDescartes discovered an early form of the law of conservation of mechanical [[momentum]] (a measure of the motion of an object), and envisioned it as pertaining to motion in a straight line, as opposed to perfect circular motion, as [[Galileo]] had envisioned it. He outlined his views on the universe in his [[Principles of Philosophy]].\n\nDescartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes' law or more commonly [[Snell's law]]) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P.

Newton continued Descartes' work on cubic equations, which freed the subject from the fetters of the Greek and Macedonian perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of independent variables.<ref>''Contemporary Newtonian Research'', edited by Z.
