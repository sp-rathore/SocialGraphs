His studies led him to ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' by [[Philip Wicksteed]] which, he later said, was his first \"tremendous influence\" in the subject.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen5_1_1.asp |title=Interview with Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=Spring 1984 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}</ref> Hazlitt published his first book, ''[https://mises.org/books/thinking.pdf Thinking as a Science]'', at the age of 21.\n\n=== Military service ===\nDuring [[World War I]], he served in the Army Air Service. While residing in Brooklyn, he enlisted in New York City on February 11, 1918 and served with the Aviation Section of the Signal Enlisted Reserve Corps until July 9, 1918.  He was then in Princeton, NJ at the US School of Military Aeronautics until October 22, when he was sent to AS Camp Dick in Dallas, Texas for a couple weeks until November 7, and he was honorably discharged from service with the rank of Private First Class on December 12, 1918.

Later, when the publisher [[W. W. Norton]] suggested he write an official [[biography]] of their author [[Bertrand Russell]], Hazlitt spent \"a good deal of time,\" as he described it, with the famous philosopher.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">Hazlitt, Henry, \"Reflections at 70,\" ''Henry Hazlitt: An Appreciation'', The Foundation for Economic Education, 1989, pp. 6–9.</ref> Lord Russell \"so admired the young journalist's talent\" that he had agreed with Norton's proposal,<ref name=\"mises1\">Rockwell, Llewellyn H., {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> but the project ended after nearly two years of work when Russell declared his intention to write his own [[autobiography]].<ref name=\"autogenerated6\"/>\n\nDuring the interwar decades, a vibrant period in the history of [[American literature]], Hazlitt served as literary editor of ''[[The Sun (New York)|The New York Sun]]''  (1925–1929), and as literary editor of the [[political left|Left]]-leaning journal, ''[[The Nation]]'' (1930–1933). In connection with his work for ''The Nation'', Hazlitt also edited ''A Practical Program for America'' (1932), a compilation of [[Great Depression]] policy considerations, but he was in the minority in calling for less government intervention in the economy. After a series of public debates with socialist [[Louis Fischer]], Hazlitt and ''The Nation'' parted ways.<ref>Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=The Freeman |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}; Rockwell, Llewellyn H., {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Hazlitt published ''[https://www.mises.org/books/anatomy.pdf The Anatomy of Criticism]'', an extended \"trialogue\" examining the nature of [[literary criticism]] and appreciation, regarded by some to be an early refutation of literary [[deconstruction]].<ref name=\"mises1\"/> In the same year, he became [[H. L. Mencken]]'s chosen successor as editor of the literary magazine, ''[[The American Mercury]]'', which Mencken had founded with [[George Jean Nathan]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746204-2,00.html |title=The Press: Hazlitt for Mencken |publisher=Time.com (''Time'' magazine) |date=1933-10-16 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> as a result of which appointment ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]]'' included Hazlitt among those hailed in its regular \"Hall of Fame\" photo feature.<ref name=\"Hall of Fame\"/> Due to increasing differences with the publisher, [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.]], he served in that role for only a brief time, but Mencken wrote that Hazlitt was the \"only competent critic of the arts that I have heard of who was at the same time a competent economist, of practical as well as theoretical training,\" adding that he \"is one of the few economists in human history who could really write.\"<ref name=\"mises2\">Rockwell, Llewellyn H., {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1934 to 1946, Hazlitt was the principal editorial writer on finance and economics for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writing both a signed weekly column along with most of the unsigned editorials on economics, producing a considerable volume of work.<ref name=\"thefreemanonline1\"/> Following [[World War II]], he came into conflict with [[Arthur Hays Sulzberger]], publisher of ''The New York Times'', over the newly established [[Bretton Woods system]] which created the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Hazlitt opposed the Bretton Woods Agreement, primarily fearing the risk of [[inflation]]. After agreeing not to write on the topic, he looked for another venue for his work, deciding on ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, for which he wrote a signed column, \"Business Tides,\" from 1946 to 1966.<ref name=\"mises2\"/>\n[[File:Hazlitt-photo.jpg|thumb|200px]]\nAccording to Hazlitt, the greatest influence on his writing in economics was the work of [[Ludwig von Mises]], and he is credited with introducing the ideas of the [[Austrian School]] of economics to the English-speaking layman. In 1938, for example, he reviewed the recently published English translation of Mises’s influential treatise ''[[Socialism (book)|Socialism]]'' for ''The New York Times'', declaring it \"a classic\" and “the most devastating analysis of [[socialism]] yet penned.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/aen/aen5_1_1.asp |title=Interview with Henry Hazlitt |publisher=the Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=Spring 1984 |accessdate=2011-03-08}}; Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web|url=http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/remembering-henry-hazlitt/ |title=Remembering Henry Hazlitt |publisher=The Freeman |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}</ref> After the [[Jews|Jewish]] economist's emigration to the United States from [[Nazi]]-dominated Europe in 1940, Hazlitt arranged for Mises to contribute editorials to ''The New York Times'', and helped to secure for Mises a teaching position at [[New York University]]. Along with the efforts of his friends, [[Max Eastman]] and [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]], Hazlitt also helped introduce [[F. A. Hayek]]'s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' to the American reading public. His 1944 review in ''The New York Times'' caused ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', where Eastman served as roving editor, to publish one of its trademark condensations, bringing the future [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate's work to a vast audience.<ref>Hulsmann, Jorg Guido, ''Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism'', 2007, Ludwig von Mises Institute, ISBN 978-1-933550-18-3, p. xi; Ludwig von Mises Institute, ''Henry Hazlitt: A Giant of Liberty'', pp. 20–7; Greaves, Bettina Bien, {{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3233 |title=Biography of Henry Hazlitt |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}; ''Henry Hazlitt: an Appreciation'', Foundation for Economic Education, 1989, pp. 8–9.</ref>\n{{Austrian School sidebar}} {{Libertarianism sidebar}}\n\nUnlike many other writers of his generation from the [[right-wing politics|political right]], Hazlitt never experienced a period when he was a  [[socialism|socialist]] or [[communism|communist]], or a significant change in his [[classical liberal]] political views. He was the founding vice-president of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], which also acquired his large personal library in the 1980s. Established by [[Leonard Read]] in 1946, FEE is considered to be the first \"think tank\" for free market ideas.

There were differences between the journals: ''The Freeman'' under Hazlitt was more [[secularism|secular]] and presented a wider range of [[foreign policy]] opinion than the later ''National Review''.<ref name=\"diggins217\"/>\n\nEven prior to her success with ''[[The Fountainhead]]'', the novelist [[Ayn Rand]] was a friend of both Hazlitt and his wife, Frances, and it was Hazlitt who introduced Rand to Mises, bringing together the two figures who would become most associated with the defense of pure [[laissez-faire]] capitalism.<ref>Burns, Jennifer, ''[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', 2009, [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 141–43; cf.

(Shortly following FDR's death, [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|presidential term limits]] were enacted.) His 1951 [[novel]], ''[https://www.mises.org/books/time.pdf The Great Idea]'' (reissued in 1966 as ''Time Will Run Back'') depicts rulers of a centrally-planned socialist [[dystopia]] discovering, amid the resulting economic chaos, the need to restore market pricing system, private ownership of capital goods and competitive markets.\n\n== Personal life ==\nHenry was born to Stuart Clark and Bertha (Zauner) Hazlitt on November 28, 1894 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  They resided at 819 North Broad Street in Philadelphia. The Hazlitt family was originally from England, although his paternal grandmother was from Ireland.  His maternal grandparents were German immigrants.  Henry's father, a clerk, died of diabetes when Henry was only five months old. His mother, Bertha, then married Frederick E. Piebes, who was engaged in manufacturing, and they resided in Brooklyn, where Henry was raised.  Henry is listed on the 1905 New York state census as Henry S. Piebes, and he is listed on Frederick's will as Henry Hazlitt Piebes, Frederick's adopted son.  His stepfather diedin 1907, leaving Henry to support his mother and probably leading to the ambition that enabled him to work at the ''Wall Street Journal'' while he was still a teenager.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1929, Hazlitt married Valerie Earle, daughter of the noted photographer and [[Vitagraph]] film director [[William P.

This organization was named in honor of Hazlitt because he was known for introducing a wide range of people to libertarian ideas through his writing and for helping free-market advocates connect with each other. The foundation was started after Hazlitt's death and had no official connection with his estate.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Books ==\n* ''[https://mises.org/books/thinking.pdf Thinking as a Science]'', 1916\n* ''[https://mises.org/books/willpower.pdf The Way to Will-Power]'', 1922\n* ''A Practical Program for America'', 1932\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/anatomy.pdf The Anatomy of Criticism]'', 1933\n* ''[https://mises.org/books/instead_of_dictatorship_hazlitt.pdf Instead of Dictatorship]'', 1933\n* ''A New Constitution Now'', 1942\n* ''Freedom in America: The Freeman'' (with [[Virgil Jordan]]), 1945\n* ''The Full Employment Bill: An Analysis'', 1945\n* {{cite book\n| last          =\n| first         =\n| authorlink    =\n| editor        =\n| editor-link   =\n| others        =\n| title         = Economics in One Lesson\n| trans_title   =\n| url           = http://library.mises.org/books/Henry%20Hazlitt/Economics%20in%20One%20Lesson.pdf\n| format        =\n| accessdate    =\n| type          =\n| year          = 2008\n| month         =\n| publisher     = Ludwig von Mises Institute\n| location      = Auburn\n| language      =\n| isbn          = 978-1-933550-21-3\n| doi           =\n| page          =\n| pages         =\n}} (Introduction by [[Walter Block]])\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/dollarssave.pdf Will Dollars Save the World?]'', 1947\n* ''Forum: Do Current Events Indicate Greater Government Regulation, Nationalization, or Socialization?, Proceedings from a Conference Sponsored by The Economic and Business Foundation'', 1948\n* ''[https://mises.org/books/illusions_of_point_four_hazlitt.pdf The Illusions of Point Four]'', 1950\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/time.pdf The Great Idea]'', 1951 (titled ''Time Will Run Back'' in Great Britain, revised and rereleased with this title in 1966.)\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/freemanslibrary.pdf The Free Man's Library]'', 1956\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/failureofneweconomics.pdf The Failure of the 'New Economics': An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies]'', 1959\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/critics.pdf The Critics of Keynesian Economics (ed.)]'', 1960\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/inflation.pdf What You Should Know About Inflation]'', 1960\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/foundationsofmorality.pdf The Foundations of Morality]'', 1964\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/manwelfarestate.pdf Man vs. The Welfare State]'', 1969\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/conquest.pdf The Conquest of Poverty]'', 1973\n* ''To Stop Inflation, Return to Gold'', 1974\n* {{cite book\n| last          =\n| first         =\n| authorlink    =\n| editor        =\n| editor-link   =\n| others        =\n| title         = The Inflation Crisis, and How To Resolve It\n| trans_title   =\n| url           = https://mises.org/document/3676/The-Inflation-Crisis-and-How-To-Resolve-It\n| format        =\n| accessdate    =\n| type          =\n| year          = 2009\n| month         =\n| publisher     = Ludwig von Mises Institute\n| location      = Auburn\n| language      =\n| isbn          = 978-1-933550-56-5\n| doi           =\n| page          =\n| pages         =\n}}\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/brettonwoods.pdf From Bretton Woods to World Inflation]'', 1984\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/stoics.pdf The Wisdom of the Stoics: Selections from Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius]'', with Frances Hazlitt, 1984\n* ''[https://www.mises.org/books/wisdom.pdf The Wisdom of Henry Hazlitt]'', 1993\n* [https://archive.org/details/ispoliticsinsolu00henrguat ''Is Politics Insoluble?''], 1997\n* [https://archive.org/details/rulesforlivinget00henrguat ''Rules for Living: The Ethics of Social Cooperation''], 1999 (an abridgment by Bettina Bien Greaves of Hazlitt's ''The Foundations of Morality''.)\n* [http://library.mises.org/books/Henry%20Hazlitt/Business%20Tides%20The%20Newsweek%20Era%20of%20Henry%20Hazlitt.pdf ''Business Tides: The Newsweek Era of Henry Hazlitt''], 2011\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n;Articles\n* [http://fee.org/library/detail/the-complete-bibliography-of-henry-hazlitt The Complete Bibliography of Henry Hazlitt]\n* ''Henry Hazlitt: A Giant of Liberty'', [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]],  1994.
