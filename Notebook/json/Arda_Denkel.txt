Phil. dissertation which he later developed into a more expansive study with his book [[The Natural Background of Meaning]] in 1999.\n\nUpon his return to [[Turkey]] he became an important promoter of [[analytical philosophy]] in Turkey, a country traditionally almost entirely cultivated within a continental atmosphere, and became a faculty member in the philosophy department at the [[Bogazici University]] in [[Istanbul]] for the rest of his life.\n\nHe was twice a visiting professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] between 1985 and 1989, and served as a member of the steering committee of the [[European Society for Analytic Philosophy]] (ESAP) between 1996 and 1999.\n\nHe also authored several other books and articles in both Turkish and English, including his [[Object and Property]] in 1996. He died in 2000 after a prolonged fight with a brain tumour.\n\n==Books==\n* ''Object and Property'', 1996\n* ''The Natural Background of Meaning'', 1999\n\n{{epistemology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Denkel, Arda}}\n[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:Analytic philosophers]]\n[[Category:Epistemologists]]\n[[Category:Turkish philosophers]]\n[[Category:Philosophers of language]]\n[[Category:Metaphysicians]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:2000 deaths]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Arda Denkel"}}}}
