His [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]] or [[Marxism-Leninism-Maoism]].\n\nBorn the son of a wealthy farmer in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]], Mao adopted a [[Chinese nationalism|Chinese nationalist]] and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism–Leninism while working at [[Peking University]] and became a founding member of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Guomindang]] (GMD) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the [[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the [[Long March]]. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the GMD under the [[Second United Front|United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45), after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's defeat]] China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government|Nationalists]] who withdrew to [[Taiwan]].\n\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), a [[one-party state]] controlled by the CPC. In the following years Mao solidified his control through [[land reform]] campaigns against landlords, and perceived enemies of the state he termed as \"[[Counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]]\". In 1957, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] campaign that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from an [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] economy to an [[Industrial society|industrial]] one. The campaign contributed to a [[Great Chinese Famine|widespread famine]], whose death toll is estimated at between 15 and 45 million. In 1966, he initiated the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements of Chinese society that lasted 10 years and which was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts and unprecedented elevation of Mao's [[personality cult]].<ref>\"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the .

During the decade spent researching the book, ''Mao: The Unknown Story'',<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chang, Jung and Jon Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story'', Jonathan Cape 2005</ref> for instance, Chang found evidence that there was no battle at Luding and that the CPC crossed the bridge unopposed. Chang interviewed an eye witness to the crossing of the Dadu (Tatu) River at Luding, Mrs Zhu De, then 93 years old, who recalled no deaths, except for two people who fell from the bridge at Luding while repairing it. Chang also points out the contradictions in the version of events as told by the CPC, which said the bridge was taken by a suicide attack by 22 men, but that these men were also present at a ceremony following the crossing of the bridge.<ref name=\"ChangHalliday_a\">Chang, Halliday; Mao, Ch. 13</ref>\n\nChang and Halliday also dispute the Communist Party of China's official version by claiming that far from the Long March being a masterful piece of strategy by the CPC, it was in fact devised by Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT. Chiang's aim was to give the CPC an easy route to follow through warlord controlled areas. Hemmed in by Nationalist troops on three sides, the CPC was forced to follow the route dictated by the KMT. The aim of this was to allow KMT forces to follow the reds into warlord controlled areas such as Sichuan and win over warlords scared of the sudden arrival of the Communist force. The only glitch in this plan came when Mao refused to follow the easy route into Sichuan where he was to meet up with a red army much larger than his own and led by a more senior CPC member, Chang Kuo Tao. Mao recognised the threat Chang posed to his rising position in the CPC and doubled back to give himself time to further cement his political power, causing the needless deaths of thousands of his own troops.<ref name=\"ChangHalliday_a\" />\n\nChang and Halliday also claim that Mao and other top CPC leaders did not walk the Long March, but were carried on litters&nbsp;– Mao himself told his staff that being carried on the Long March gave him much time to read – with the litter bearers' knees being worn to the bone when forced to carry Mao up mountains.<ref name=\"ChangHalliday_a\" />\n\n===Alliance with the Kuomintang: 1935–1940===\n{{Main|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\n[[File:1945 Mao and Chiang.jpg|thumb|In an effort to defeat the Japanese, Mao (left) agreed to collaborate with Chiang (right).]]\nMao's troops arrived at the [[Yan'an]] Soviet during October 1935 and settled in Pao An, until spring 1936.

The CPC seemed less corrupt, more unified, and more vigorous in its resistance to Japan than the KMT.

Whereas the three-anti campaign was a focused purge of government, industrial and party officials, the five-anti campaign set its sights slightly broader, targeting capitalist elements in general.<ref>John Fairbank and Merle Goldman, ''China: A New History'', (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2002), 349.</ref> Workers denounced their bosses, spouses turned on their spouses, and children informed on their parents; the victims were often humiliated at [[Struggle Session|struggle sessions]], a method designed to intimidate and terrify people to the maximum.

For example, in his biography of Mao, [[Philip Short]] notes that in the [[Yan'an Rectification Movement]], Mao gave explicit instructions that \"no cadre is to be killed\", but in practice allowed security chief [[Kang Sheng]] to drive opponents to suicide and that \"this pattern was repeated throughout his leadership of the People's Republic.\"<ref name=\"deathtoll\"/>\n[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|left|Mao at [[Joseph Stalin]]'s 70th birthday celebration in Moscow, December 1949 ]]\nFollowing the consolidation of power, Mao launched the First [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] (1953–58). The plan aimed to end Chinese dependence upon agriculture in order to become a world power. With the [[Soviet Union]]'s assistance, new industrial plants were built and agricultural production eventually fell{{clarification needed|date=May 2016}} to a point where industry was beginning to produce enough capital that China no longer needed the USSR's support.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The success of the First-Five Year Plan was to encourage Mao to instigate the Second [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|Five-Year Plan]] in 1958. Mao also launched a phase of rapid [[collectivization]]. The CPC introduced price controls as well as a [[Simplified Chinese character|Chinese character simplification]] aimed at increasing literacy. Large-scale industrialization projects were also undertaken.\n\nPrograms pursued during this time include the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]], in which Mao indicated his supposed willingness to consider different opinions about how China should be governed. Given the freedom to express themselves, liberal and intellectual Chinese began opposing the Communist Party and questioning its leadership. This was initially tolerated and encouraged. After a few months, Mao's government reversed its policy and persecuted those, totaling perhaps {{formatnum:500000}},{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} who criticised, as well as those who were merely alleged to have criticised, the party in what is called the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]].

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives which had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel. Some private food production was banned; livestock and farm implements were brought under collective ownership.\n\nUnder the Great Leap Forward, Mao and other party leaders ordered the implementation of a variety of unproven and unscientific new agricultural techniques by the new communes. The combined effect of the diversion of labour to steel production and infrastructure projects, and cyclical [[natural disasters]] led to an approximately 15% drop in grain production in 1959 followed by a further 10% decline in 1960 and no recovery in 1961.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\">{{Harvnb|Spence|1999}}{{Page needed|date=January 2013}}<!-- Book has only 188 pages, so page 553 does not look right --></ref>\n\nIn an effort to win favour with their superiors and avoid being purged, each layer in the party hierarchy exaggerated the amount of grain produced under them. Based upon the fabricated success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that rural peasants were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the largest [[famine]] known as the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. This famine was a direct cause of the death of some 30 million Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1136/bmj.319.7225.1619 \n| last1 = Smil | first1 = V. \n| title = China's great famine: 40 years later \n| journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.) \n| volume = 319 \n| issue = 7225 \n| pages = 1619–1621 \n| year = 1999 \n| pmid = 10600969 \n| pmc = 1127087\n}}</ref> Further, many children who became emaciated and malnourished during years of hardship and struggle for survival died shortly after the Great Leap Forward came to an end in 1962.<ref name=\"Spence1999 p553\"/>\n\nThe extent of Mao's knowledge of the severity of the situation has been disputed.

In most cases the party knew very well that it was starving its own people to death. At a secret meeting in the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai dated March 25, 1959, Mao specifically ordered the party to procure up to one third of all the grain, much more than had ever been the case. At the meeting he announced that \"To distribute resources evenly will only ruin the Great Leap Forward. When there is not enough to eat, people starve to death. It is better to let half of the people die so that the other half can eat their fill.\"<ref name=Dikottersite>{{cite web|title=Famine 2|url=http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|website=web.mac.com|accessdate=28 July 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809001243/http://web.mac.com/dikotter/Dikotter/Famine_2.html|archivedate=August 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Jasper|title=A utopian nightmare|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8659581/a-utopian-nightmare/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nProfessor Emeritus Thomas P.

My own view is that this is an instance of Mao’s use of hyperbole, another being his casual acceptance of death of half the population during a nuclear war. In other contexts, Mao did not in fact accept mass death. Zhou’s Chronology shows that in October 1958, Mao expressed real concern that 40,000 people in Yunnan had starved to death (p. 173). Shortly after the March 25 meeting, he worried about 25.2 million people who were at risk of starvation.<ref name=\"wilfulness\">{{cite journal|last1=Thomas P.|first1=Bernstein|title=Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness|journal=The China Quarterly|date=June 2006|volume=186|pages=421–445|doi=10.1017/S0305741006000221|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/20192620?sid=21105082252081&uid=4&uid=3739256&uid=70&uid=2134&uid=2&uid=3739808|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> But from late summer on, Mao essentially forgot about this issue, until, as noted, the \"Xinyang Incident\" came to light in October 1960.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bernstein|first1=Thomas P.|title=Book Reviews: Zhou Xun (ed), The Great Famine in China, 1958-1962: A Documentary History|journal=China Perspectives|volume=2013/2|issue=Real Estate Speculation and its Social Consequences|url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/6196|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the article \"Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness\", published in 2006 in ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', Professor Thomas P. Bernstein also discussed Mao's change of attitudes during different phases of the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>In late autumn 1958, Mao Zedong strongly condemned widespread practices of the Great Leap Forward (GLF) such as subjecting peasants to exhausting labour without adequate food and rest, which had resulted in epidemics, starvation and deaths. At that time Mao explicitly recognized that anti-rightist pressures on officialdom were a major cause of \"production at the expense of livelihood.\" While he was not willing to acknowledge that only abandonment of the GLF could solve these problems, he did strongly demand that they be addressed. After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao revived the GLF in the context of a new, extremely harsh anti-rightist campaign, which he relentlessly promoted into the spring of 1960 together with the radical policies that he previously condemned. Not until spring 1960 did Mao again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he failed to apply the pressure needed to stop them. Given what he had already learned about the costs to the peasants of GLF extremism, the Chairman should have known that the revival of GLF radicalism would exact a similar or even bigger price. Instead, he wilfully ignored the lessons of the first radical phase for the sake of achieving extreme ideological and developmental goals.<ref name=\"wilfulness\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn ''[[Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine]]'', [[Jasper Becker]] notes that Mao was dismissive of reports he received of food shortages in the countryside and refused to change course, believing that peasants were lying and that [[rightists]] and [[kulaks]] were hoarding grain. He refused to open state granaries,<ref name=\"Becker81\">{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=81}}</ref> and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=86}}</ref> Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=93}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the cause of the disaster, Mao lost esteem among many of the top party cadres, was eventually forced to abandon the policy in 1962, and lost political power to moderate leaders, perhaps most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. Mao, however, supported by national propaganda, claimed that he was only partly to blame for the famine. As a result, he was able to remain Chairman of the Communist Party, with the Presidency transferred to Liu Shaoqi.\n\nThe Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=128}}</ref> As [[Jasper Becker]] explains:\n<blockquote>\n\"The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called '[[enemies of the people]]'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.\"''<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|p=103}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAt a large Communist Party conference in Beijing in January 1962, called the \"Conference of the Seven Thousand\", State Chairman Liu Shaoqi denounced the Great Leap Forward as responsible for widespread famine.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{Harvnb|Chang|Halliday|2005|pp=568, 579}}</ref> The overwhelming majority of delegates expressed agreement, but Defense Minister [[Lin Biao]] staunchly defended Mao.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> A brief period of liberalization followed while Mao and Lin plotted a comeback.<ref name=\"Chang\"/> Liu Shaoqi and [[Deng Xiaoping]] rescued the economy by disbanding the people's communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Kissinger Mao.jpg|thumb|Mao with [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zhou Enlai]], Beijing, 1972]]\n\n===Consequences===\nAt the [[Lushan Conference]] in July/August 1959, several ministers expressed concern that the Great Leap Forward had not proved as successful as planned. The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and [[Korean War]] veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92–93}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labor camps where many would subsequently die in the famine. Years later the CPC would conclude that as many as six million people were wrongly punished in the campaign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Valentino|2004|p=127}}</ref>\n\nThe number of deaths by starvation during the Great Leap Forward is deeply controversial. Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958–61, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. The official statistic is 20 million deaths, as given by [[Hu Yaobang]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] resulted in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s withdrawal of all Soviet technical experts and aid from the country. The split concerned the leadership of [[world Communism]]. The USSR had a network of Communist parties it supported; China now created its own rival network to battle it out for local control of the left in numerous countries.<ref>Robert A. Scalapino, \"Sino-Soviet Competition in Africa\", ''Foreign Affairs'' (1964) 42#4 pp. 640-654 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/20029719 in JSTOR]</ref>   Lorenz M. Lüthi argues:\n:The Sino-Soviet split was one of the key events of the Cold War, equal in importance to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Second Vietnam War, and Sino-American rapprochement.  The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lorenz M. Lüthi|title=The Sino-Soviet Split: Cold War in the Communist World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dl4TRDxqexMC|year=2010|publisher=Princeton UP|page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe split resulted from [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s more moderate Soviet leadership after the death of Stalin in March 1953.  Only [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] openly sided with China, thereby forming an alliance between the two countries which would last until after Mao's death in 1976. Warned that the Soviets had nuclear weapons, Mao minimized the threat. Becker says that, \"Mao believed that the bomb was a 'paper tiger', declaring to Khrushchev that it would not matter if China lost 300 million people in a nuclear war: the other half of the population would survive to ensure victory.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Jasper|last=Becker|title=The Chinese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oyGtw4cXJjMC&pg=PA271|year=2002|publisher=Oxford UP|page=271}}</ref>\n\nStalin had established himself as the successor of \"correct\" Marxist thought well before Mao controlled the [[Communist Party of China]], and therefore Mao never challenged the suitability of any Stalinist doctrine (at least while Stalin was alive). Upon the death of Stalin, Mao believed (perhaps because of seniority) that the leadership of Marxist doctrine would fall to him. The resulting tension between Khrushchev (at the head of a politically and militarily superior government), and Mao (believing he had a superior understanding of Marxist ideology) eroded the previous patron-client relationship between the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the CPC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In China, the formerly favoured Soviets were now denounced as \"revisionists\" and listed alongside \"American imperialism\" as movements to oppose.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nPartly surrounded by hostile American military bases (in South Korea, Japan, and [[Taiwan]]), China was now confronted with a new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat from the north and west. Both the internal crisis and the external threat called for extraordinary statesmanship from Mao, but as China entered the new decade the statesmen of the People's Republic were in hostile confrontation with each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution===\nDuring the early 1960s, Mao became concerned with the nature of post-1959 China. He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged [[elite]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966. Some scholars, such as Mobo Gao, claim the case for this is overstated.<ref>For a full treatment of this idea, see {{Harvnb|Gao|2008}}</ref> Others, such as [[Frank Dikötter]], hold that Mao launched the Cultural Revolution to wreak revenge on those who had dared to challenge him over the Great Leap Forward.<ref>Jonathan Mirsky. [http://www.literaryreview.co.uk/mirsky_09_10.html ''Livelihood Issues.''] [[Literary Review]]</ref>\n\nBelieving that certain liberal bourgeois elements of society continued to threaten the socialist framework, groups of young people known as the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] struggled against authorities at all levels of society and even set up their own tribunals. Chaos reigned in much of the nation, and millions were persecuted, including a famous philosopher, Chen Yuen. During the Cultural Revolution, nearly all of the schools and universities in China were closed and the young intellectuals living in cities were ordered to the countryside to be \"re-educated\" by the peasants, where they performed hard manual labour and other work.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of much of China's traditional cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as the creation of general economic and social chaos in the country. Millions of lives were ruined during this period, as the Cultural Revolution pierced into every part of Chinese life, depicted by such Chinese films as ''[[To Live (1994 film)|To Live]]'', ''[[The Blue Kite]]'' and ''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]''. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, perished in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=\"maostats\">{{cite web|url= http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao |title= Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm |publisher= Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century |accessdate= August 23, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Mao was informed of such losses, particularly that people had been driven to suicide, he is alleged to have commented: \"People who try to commit suicide&nbsp;— don't attempt to save them!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Lin was later officially named as Mao's successor. By 1971, however, a divide between the two men became apparent. Official history in China states that Lin was planning a military coup or an assassination attempt on Mao. Lin Biao died in a plane crash over the air space of Mongolia, presumably as he fled China, probably anticipating his arrest. The CPC declared that Lin was planning to depose Mao, and posthumously expelled Lin from the party. At this time, Mao lost trust in many of the top CPC figures.

Supporters generally credit and praise him for having unified China and for ending the previous decades of civil war. He is also credited for having improved the status of women in China and for improving literacy and education.  His policies caused the deaths of tens of millions of people in China during his 27-year reign, more than any other Twentieth Century leader; the number of people who died under his regime range from 40 million to as many as 70 million. However, supporters point out that in spite of this, life expectancy improved during his reign. His supporters claim that he rapidly industrialised China; however, others have claimed that his policies such as the \"Great Leap Forward\" and the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\", were impediments to industrialisation and modernisation. His supporters claim that his policies laid the groundwork for China's later rise to become an economic superpower, while others claim that his policies delayed economic development and that China's economy only underwent its rapid growth only after Mao's policies had been widely abandoned.  Mao's revolutionary tactics continue to be used by insurgents, and his political ideology continues to be embraced by many Communist organizations around the world.\n\nIn mainland China, Mao is still revered by many members and supporters of the Communist Party and respected by the majority of the general population as the \"[[List of national founders|Founding Father]] of modern China\", credited for giving \"the Chinese people dignity and self-respect.\"<ref name=\"Biography 2005\">[[Biography (TV series)]] [http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi3081083673/ Mao Tse Tung: China's Peasant Emperor] [[A&E Network]] 2005, ASIN B000AABKXG {{time needed|date=January 2013}}</ref> Mobo Gao in his 2008 book ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'', credits Mao for raising the average life expectancy from 35 in 1949 to 63 by 1975, bringing \"unity and stability to a country that had been plagued by civil wars and foreign invasions\", and laying the foundation for China to \"become the equal of the great global powers\".<ref name = \"MoboGao\" /> Gao also lauds Mao for carrying out massive [[land reform]], promoting the status of women, improving popular literacy, and positively \"transform(ing) Chinese society beyond recognition.\"<ref name = \"MoboGao\">{{Harvnb|Gao|2008|p=81}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Mao has many Chinese critics, both those who live inside and outside China. Opposition to Mao is subject to restriction and censorship in mainland China, but is especially strong elsewhere, where he is often reviled as a brutish ideologue. In the West, his name is generally associated with tyranny and his economic theories are widely discredited—though to some political activists he remains a symbol against [[capitalism]], [[imperialism]] and western influence. Even in China, key pillars of his economic theory have been largely dismantled by market reformers like [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], who succeeded him as leaders of the Communist Party.\n[[File:Mao Zedong youth art sculpture 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of young Mao in [[Changsha]], the capital of [[Hunan]]]]\n\nThough the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which Mao led to power, has rejected in practice the economic fundamentals of much of Mao's ideology, it retains for itself many of the powers established under Mao's reign: it controls the Chinese army, police, courts and media and does not permit multi-party elections at the national or local level, except in Hong Kong. Thus it is difficult to gauge the true extent of support for the Chinese Communist Party and Mao's legacy within mainland China. For its part, the Chinese government continues to officially regard Mao as a national hero.

For example, they note that Mao was well aware that his policies would be responsible for the deaths of millions; While discussing labour-intensive projects such as waterworks and making steel, Mao said to his inner circle in November 1958: \"Working like this, with all these projects, half of China may well have to die.

In the speech, Mao talks about massive earthmoving irrigation projects and numerous big industrial ones, all requiring huge numbers of people. If the projects, he said, are all undertaken simultaneously \"half of China's population unquestionably will die; and if it's not half, it'll be a third or ten percent, a death toll of 50 million people.\" Mao then pointed to the example of Guangxi provincial Party secretary, Chén Mànyuǎn (陳漫遠) who had been dismissed in 1957 for failing to prevent famine in the previous year, adding: \"If with a death toll of 50 million you didn't lose your jobs, I at least should lose mine; whether I should lose my head would also be in question. Anhui wants to do so much, which is quite all right, but make it a principle to have no deaths.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0305741006000221 |last= Bernstein |first= Thomas III |title= Mao Zedong and the Famine of 1959–1960: A Study in Wilfulness |journal= [[The China Quarterly]] |volume= 186 |date=July 2006 |pages= 421–445 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jasper Becker]] notes, \"archive material gathered by Dikötter&nbsp;... confirms that far from being ignorant or misled about the famine, the Chinese leadership were kept informed about it all the time.

But as fresh and abundant archival evidence shows, coercion, terror and systematic violence were the foundation of the Great Leap, and between 1958 to 1962, by a rough approximation, some 6 to 8 per cent of those who died were tortured to death or summarily killed—amounting to at least 3 million victims.\n\nCountless others were deliberately deprived of food and consequently starved to death. Many more vanished because they were too old, weak or sick to work—and hence unable to earn their keep. People were killed selectively because they had the wrong class background, because they dragged their feet, because they spoke out or simply because they were not liked, for whatever reason, by the man who wielded the ladle in the canteen.</poem></blockquote>\n\nDikötter argues that CPC leaders \"glorified violence and were inured to massive loss of life. And all of them shared an ideology in which the end justified the means. In 1962, having lost millions of people in his province, [[Li Jingquan]] compared the Great Leap Forward to the [[Long March]] in which only one in ten had made it to the end: 'We are not weak, we are stronger, we have kept the backbone.'\"<ref name=\"Dikotter299\">{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=299}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the large-scale irrigation projects, Dikötter stresses that, in spite of Mao being in a good position to see the human cost, they continued unabated for several years, and ultimately claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of exhausted villagers. He also notes that \"In a chilling precursor of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, villagers in Qingshui and Gansu called these projects the 'killing fields'.\"<ref name=\"Dikotter33\">{{Harvnb|Dikötter|2010|p=33}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong, Zhang Yufeng et Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|upright|Mao greets United States President [[Richard Nixon]] during his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China in 1972]]]]\n\nThe United States placed a trade embargo on the People's Republic as a result of its involvement in the [[Korean War]], lasting until [[Richard Nixon]] decided that developing relations with the PRC would be useful in dealing with the Soviet Union.\n\nThe television series [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]] stated: \"[Mao] turned China from a feudal backwater into one of the most powerful countries in the World&nbsp;...

Jackson [[Trail of Tears|forcibly moved Native Americans]], resulting in thousands of deaths, while Mao was at the helm during the violent years of the Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward:<ref>{{cite web|title=BOOK REVIEWS: What Everyone Needs to Know about China and Burma|url=http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/2010/04/21/what-everyone-needs-to-know-about-china-and-burma/book-reviews/|website=Zocalo Public Square|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Though admittedly far from perfect, the comparison is based on the fact that Jackson is remembered both as someone who played a significant role in the development of a political organization (the Democratic Party) that still has many partisans, and as someone responsible for brutal policies toward Native Americans that are now referred to as genocidal.\n\nBoth men are thought of as having done terrible things yet this does not necessarily prevent them from being used as positive symbols. And Jackson still appears on $20 bills, even though Americans tend to view as heinous the institution of slavery (of which he was a passionate defender) and the early 19th-century military campaigns against Native Americans (in which he took part).\n\nAt times Jackson, for all his flaws, is invoked as representing an egalitarian strain within the American democratic tradition, a self-made man of the people who rose to power via straight talk and was not allied with moneyed interests. Mao stands for something roughly similar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Some China Book Notes|url=http://mattschiavenza.com/2010/10/08/some-china-book-notes/|website=Matt Schiavenza.com|accessdate=8 February 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMao's military writings continue to have a large amount of influence both among those who seek to create an insurgency and those who seek to crush one, especially in manners of guerilla warfare, at which Mao is popularly regarded as a genius.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} As an example, the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] followed Mao's examples of guerilla warfare to considerable political and military success even in the 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Mao's major contribution to the military science is his theory of [[People's War]], with not only guerrilla warfare but more importantly, [[Mobile Warfare]] methodologies. Mao had successfully applied Mobile Warfare in the Korean War, and was able to encircle, push back and then halt the UN forces in Korea, despite the clear superiority of UN firepower.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Mao also gave the impression that he might even welcome a [[nuclear war]].<ref>\"[http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1226.html Mao Tse-Tung: Father of Chinese Revolution]\".

This accompanied a decline in state recognition of Mao in later years in contrast to previous years when the state organised numerous events and seminars commemorating Mao's 100th birthday. Nevertheless, the Chinese government has never officially repudiated the tactics of Mao. Deng Xiaoping, who was opposed to the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, has to a certain extent rejected Mao's legacy, famously saying that Mao was \"70% right and 30% wrong\".\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Mao Zedong's picture began to appear on all new [[renminbi]] (人民幣) currency from the People's Republic of China.
