Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz College, which was a [[Presbyterian]] [[missionary|missionary school]], where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay.<ref name=FL18 /> Zadeh says that he was \"deeply influenced\" by the \"extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful\" missionaries from the United States who ran the college. \"To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States &ndash; people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really 'Good Samaritans' &ndash; willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.\"<ref name=blair99 /> During this time, Zadeh was awarded several [[patents]].<ref name=FL18 />\n\nDespite being more fluent in Russian than in Persian, Zadeh sat for the national university exams and placed third in the entire country.<ref name=FL18 />  As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years.  In 1942, he graduated from the [[University of Tehran]] with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] (Fanni), one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by [[World War II]], when the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union invaded Iran whose ruler, the [[Rezā Shāh|Shah]], was pro-German.  Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.<ref name=FL19>McNeil & Freiberger, p.19</ref>\n\nIn 1943, Zadeh decided to emigrate to the United States, and traveled to [[Philadelphia]] by way of [[Cairo]] after months of delay waiting for the proper papers or for the right ship to appear.  He arrived in mid-1944, and entered [[M.I.T.]] as a graduate student later that year.<ref name=FL19 /> While in the United States, he changed his name to Lotfi Asker Zadeh.<ref name=FL17 />\n\nHe received an [[Master of Science|MS degree]] in electrical engineering from M.I.T. in 1946, and then applied to [[Columbia University]], as his parents had settled in [[New York City]].<ref name=FL19 /> Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student, and offered him an instructorship as well.<ref name=FL19 /> He received his [[PhD]] in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949, and became an assistant professor the next year.<ref name=bookrags/><ref name=FL19 />\n\nZadeh taught for ten years at Columbia, was promoted to [[Full Professor]] in 1957, and has taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] since 1959. He published his seminal work on [[fuzzy sets]] in 1965, in which he detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory. In 1973 he proposed his theory of [[fuzzy logic]].\n\n==Personal life and beliefs==\n{{anchor|Nationality}} Zadeh is noted to be \"quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life\", and is quoted as stating in an interview: \"The question really isn't whether I'm American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else. I've been shaped by all these people and cultures and I feel quite comfortable among all of them.\"<ref>Blair, Betty.

''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 2:4 (Winter 1994), p. 49.</ref>  Zadeh also notes in the same interview: \"Obstinacy and tenacity. Not being afraid to get embroiled in controversy. That's very much a Turkish tradition. That's part of my character, too. I can be very stubborn. That's probably been beneficial for the development of Fuzzy Logic.\"<ref>Blair, Betty. [http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_fuzzylogic.html \"Interview with Lotfi Zadeh, Creator of Fuzzy Logic\"]. ''Azerbaijan International'', Vol. 2:4 (Winter 1994), pp. 46 ff.</ref> He describes himself as \"an American, mathematically oriented, electrical engineer of Iranian descent, born in Russia.\"<ref name=bookrags />\n\nZadeh is married to Fay Zadeh and has two children, Stella Zadeh and [[Norm Zada|Norman Zadeh]].\n\n== Work ==\nAccording to [[Google Scholar]], as of September 2015 Zadeh's work had been cited 150,852 times with the 1965 \"Fuzzy Sets\" paper receiving 58,251.<ref>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=06052364</ref>\n\n=== Fuzzy sets and systems ===\nZadeh, in his theory of [[fuzzy set]]s, proposed using a [[membership function]] (with a [[Interval (mathematics)|range]] covering the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,1]) operating on the [[Domain of a function|domain]] of all possible values.  He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that [[fuzzy logic]] was a generalisation of classical and Boolean [[logic]]. He also proposed [[fuzzy number]]s as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).<ref>McNeil & Freiberger, ''passim''</ref>\n\n=== Other contributions ===\nLotfi Zadeh is also credited, along with [[John R. Ragazzini]], in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the [[z-transform]] method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in [[digital signal processing]], [[digital control]], and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research. He is an editor of International Journal of Computational Cognition.\n\nZadeh's latest work includes [[computing with words and perceptions]].
