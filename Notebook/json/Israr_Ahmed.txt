He vehemently maintained that only by revitalising [[Iman (concept)|concept]] and importance of faith among the Muslims in general and intelligentsia in particular. His solution was to teach Qur'an in contemporary idiom backed by the highest level of scholarship. Commenting on scientific aspects, Ahmed wrote that \"this undertaking would remove the existing dichotomy between modern physical and social sciences on the one hand, and Islamic revealed knowledge on the other.\"\n\nIn 1971 Ahmed gave up his medical practice to devote himself fully to the Islamic revival. In 1972, he established (or helped establish) the Markazi Anjuman Khuddam-ul-Qur'an Lahore, Tanzeem-e-Islami was founded in 1975, and Tahreek-e-Khilafat Pakistan was launched in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nHe criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly.<ref>Mumtaz Ahmad, \"Media-Based Preachers and the Creation of New Muslim Publics in Pakistan,\" NBR Special Report 22, February 2010 [http://nbr.org/publications/specialreport/pdf/SR22.pdf]</ref> Although he did not like to receive it personally, Ahmed was awarded [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]] in 1981.

Furthermore, Ahmed followed Maulana [[Abul Kalam Azad]] and Maulana [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] in regards to what he believes is the \"dynamic and revolutionary conception of Islam.\"\n\n\"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Maulana Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way\".<ref name=\"Dr.IA\"/>\nAhmed believed in what he called \"Islamic revolutionary thought,\" which consists of the idea that Islam &ndash; the teachings of the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] &ndash; must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life.

The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Maulana Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to \"degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one\".<ref name=\"TanzeemHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://tanzeem.info/webapps/tip_dnnweb/Organization/Background.aspx |title=Background/History of Tanzeem-e-Islami |publisher=Tanzeem.org |date= |accessdate=22 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Tanzeem-e-Islami==\nOriginally a member of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, \"significant policy matters\", and what he saw as the \"lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process.\"  He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a \"disciplined organization.\" \"A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami.\"<ref name=\"Dr.IA\"/>\n\nAlong with his work to revive \"the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view\" Ahmed aimed with his party to \"reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of [[Caliphate|Khilafah]]\".<ref name=\"tanzeem.org\"/>\n\n===Caliphate===\nAccording to the [[Tanzeem-e-Islami]] website Ahmed and the party believe \"the spiritual and intellectual center of the Muslim world has shifted from the Arab world to the region of Khorasan\" and \"conditions are much more congenial for the establishment of Khilafah in Pakistan\" than in other Muslim countries.{{Cite quote| date=September 2014}}\n\n===Hizb ut-Tahrir===\nAccording to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'état to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate.
