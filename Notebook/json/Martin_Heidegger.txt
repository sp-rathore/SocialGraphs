Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called [[Dasein]] (\"being-there\"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-in-the-world|Being-in-the-world]], in opposition to [[Rationalist]] thinkers like [[René Descartes]] who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities. For Heidegger thinking is thinking ''about'' things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its [[Temporality]], or its concern with, and relationship to [[time]], existing as a structurally open \"possibility-for-being.\" He emphasized the importance of [[Authenticity (philosophy)|Authenticity]] in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our [[thrownness]] into a world which we are  \"always already\" concerned with, and to our [[Heideggerian terminology#Being-toward-death|Being-towards-death]], the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.<ref name=\"JR\">John Richardson, ''Heidegger'', Routledge, 2012.</ref>\n\nHeidegger also made critical contributions to philosophical conceptions of [[truth]], arguing that its original meaning was [[Aletheia|unconcealment]], to philosophical analyses of [[art]] as a site of the revelation of truth, and to philosophical understanding of [[language]] as the \"house of being.\"<ref>Martin Heidegger. \"Brief über den »Humanismus«\" (\"Letter on 'Humanism'\").

His family could not afford to send him to university, so he entered a [[Jesuit]] [[seminary]], though he was turned away within weeks because of the health requirement and what the director and doctor of the seminary described as a [[psychosomatic]] heart condition. Heidegger was short and sinewy, with dark piercing eyes. He enjoyed outdoor pursuits, being especially proficient at skiing.<ref>Hermann Philipse, ''Heidegger's Philosophy of Being'' p. 173, Notes to Chapter One, Martin Heidegger, ''Supplements'', trans. John Van Buren p. 183.</ref>\n\nStudying theology at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|University of Freiburg]] while supported by the church on the understanding that he would defend their doctrine, Heidegger broke with Catholicism and switched his field of study to philosophy. He completed his doctoral thesis on [[psychologism]] in 1914,<ref>''Die Lehre vom Urteil im Psychologismus. Ein kritisch-theoretischer Beitrag zur Logik'' (1914).

He served as a soldier during the final year of [[World War I]], working behind a desk and never leaving Germany. During the 1930s, critics of Heidegger's espousal of a Nazi-style rhetoric of martial manliness noted the unheroic nature of his service in WWI.\n\n===Marburg===\nIn 1923, Heidegger was elected to an [[Professor#Main positions 2|extraordinary Professorship]] in Philosophy at the [[University of Marburg]]. His colleagues there included [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]], and [[Paul Natorp]].

Following on from [[Aristotle]], he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of the sense of being. He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete [[existence]], which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Martin Luther|Luther]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]. He also read the works of [[Dilthey]], [[Husserl]], and [[Max Scheler]].<ref>Gethmann-Siefert, 1982, p. 563</ref>\n\n===Freiburg===\nIn 1927, Heidegger published his main work ''Sein und Zeit'' (''Being and Time''). When [[Husserl]] retired as Professor of Philosophy in 1928, Heidegger accepted Freiburg's election to be his successor, in spite of a counter-offer by Marburg. Heidegger remained at [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] for the rest of his life, declining a number of later offers, including one from [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. His students at Freiburg included Arendt, [[Günther Anders]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Charles Malik]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Ernst Nolte]].<ref>Richard Wolin, Heidegger’s Children: Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Hans Jonas, and Herbert Marcuse (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001); Samuel Fleischacker (ed.)

Evans, Heidegger was not only a member of the Nazi Party, but was enthusiastic about participating. He wanted to position himself as the philosopher of the Party, but the highly abstract nature of his work and the opposition of [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who himself aspired to act in that position, limited Heidegger's role.

McGrath, Heidegger; A (Very) Critical Introduction (Cambridge, U.K.: Erdmans, 2008), p. 10</ref> Heidegger died on 26 May 1976, and was buried in the Meßkirch cemetery, beside his parents and brother.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Being, time, and ''Dasein''===\nHeidegger's philosophy is founded on the attempt to conjoin what he considers two fundamental insights: the first is his observation that, in the course of over 2,000 years of history, philosophy has attended to all the beings that can be found in the world (including the world itself), but has forgotten to ask what Being itself is. Heidegger thought the presence of things for us is not their being, but merely them interpreted as equipment according to a particular system of meaning and purpose. For instance, when a hammer is efficiently used to knock in nails, we cease to be aware of it. This is termed \"ready to hand\", and Heidegger considers it an authentic mode, saying that the given (\"past\") has presence in an oversimplified way when reduced to possible future usefulness to us.\n\nHeidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of [[Franz Brentano]]'s treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word \"being\", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, ''Being and Time'', with a citation from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''<ref>For a study on Heidegger's reading of the ''Sophist'' and his less central interest in Plato's ''Timaeus'' and its conception of ''space'' qua ''khôra'': see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"''On kai khôra'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus''\", ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issue 1–2 (2004), pp. 73–98.  This study is also closely connected with an investigation of Heidegger's later reflections on 'dwelling' as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger’s Reflections on Dwelling', Environment, Space, Place 3 (2011), pp. 47–71.  Refer also to other aspects of this research under the section of 'Heidegger and Eastern Thought', and also the influence on architectural thinking in the main body of the text above</ref> indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered obvious, rather than as worthy of question. Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the \"history of Being\", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive [[Heideggerian terminology|destruction]] of the history of philosophy.\n\nThe second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of [[Edmund Husserl]], a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, \"to the things themselves\"). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is [[world disclosure|always already situated in a world]] and in ways of being. Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is \"[[intentionality|intentional]]\" (in the sense that it is always intended ''toward'' something, and is always \"about\" something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in \"care\". This is the basis of Heidegger's \"existential analytic\", as he develops it in ''Being and Time''. Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to \"''[[Dasein]]''\", the being for whom Being is a question.<ref>In everyday German, \"''Dasein''\" means \"existence.\" It is composed of \"''Da''\" (here/there) and \"''Sein''\" (being). ''Dasein'' is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is ''there'' in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters. In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as ''Da-sein'', thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage.</ref>\n\nIn ''Being and Time'', Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. ''Dasein'', then, is not intended as a way of conducting a [[philosophical anthropology]], but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything ''like'' a philosophical anthropology.<ref>Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: \"We can see then that Dasein, though ''not'' man, is nevertheless ''nothing other'' than man.\" Jacques Derrida, \"The Ends of Man\", ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 127.</ref> ''Dasein'', according to Heidegger, ''is'' care. In the course of his existential analytic, Heidegger argues that ''Dasein'', who finds itself [[thrownness|thrown into the world]] (''Geworfenheit'') amidst things and with others, is thrown into its possibilities, including the possibility and inevitability of one's own mortality. The need for ''Dasein'' to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness—that is, of those specific possibilities for ''Dasein'' which depend on escaping the \"vulgar\" temporality of calculation and of public life.\n\nThe marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That ''Dasein'' is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that ''Dasein'' is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of ''Dasein'' can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the \"dismantling\" (''Destruktion'') of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of \"limit case\" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThat Heidegger did not write this second part of ''Being and Time'', and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of ''individual'' experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the ''collective'' human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time.<ref>Cf.

Heidegger wrote most of ''Being and Time'' there.]]\n{{Main article|Being and Time}}\n\n''Being and Time'' (German title: ''Sein und Zeit''), published in 1927, was Heidegger's first academic book. He had been under pressure to publish in order to qualify for Husserl's (to whom he dedicated the work) chair at the [[University of Freiburg]] and the success of this work ensured his appointment to the post.\n\nIt investigates the question of [[Being]] by asking about the being for whom Being is a question. Heidegger names this being ''Dasein'' (see above), and the book pursues its investigation through themes such as mortality, [[Heideggerian terminology#Care or Concern|care]], anxiety, temporality, and historicity. It was Heidegger's original intention to write a second half of the book, consisting of a \"''Destruktion''\" of the history of philosophy—that is, the transformation of philosophy by re-tracing its history—but he never completed this project.\n\n''Being and Time'' influenced many thinkers, including such existentialist thinkers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (although Heidegger distanced himself from [[existentialism]]—see below).\n\n===Later works: The Turn===\n{{see also|Kehre}}\n[[File:Heideggers Feldweg.JPG|thumb|''Am Feldweg'' in Meßkirch.

For example, in 2011 [[Mark Wrathall]]<ref>Wrathall, Mark:  Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> argued that Heidegger pursued and refined the central notion of unconcealment throughout his life as a philosopher. Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows that he did not have a \"turn\". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: \"An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade.\"<ref>[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=24212 Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]</ref>\n\nHeidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behaviour itself depends on a prior \"openness to being.\" The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness. Heidegger contrasts this openness to the \"will to power\" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.\n\nHeidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], especially [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]]. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with [[Plato]], and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.\n\nTwo recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of \"revealing.\" Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with ''modern'' technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the \"material\" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated \"standing reserve\" (''Bestand'') of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as ''[[Gestell]]'', or \"enframing.\" Heidegger does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being. Despite this, some commentators have insisted that an agrarian nostalgia permeates his later work.<ref>Refer in this context to reflections on [[Heidegger]]'s conception of \"dwelling\" against the background of ''Gestell'' as set in:{{cite journal | last1 = El-Bizri | first1 = Nader | authorlink = Nader El-Bizri | year = 2015 | title = On Dwelling: Heideggerian Allusions to Architectural Phenomenology | url = http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/920.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Studia UBB Philosophia | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 5–30 }}</ref>\n\nIn a 1950 lecture he formulated the famous saying ''[[Language speaks]]'', later published in the 1959 essays collection ''Unterwegs zur Sprache'', and collected in the 1971 English book ''Poetry, Language, Thought''.<ref name=\"Lyon06\">Lyon, James K.

Augustine's  ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' was particularly influential in shaping Heidegger's thought.<ref>See ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology'', ed. Craig J. N. de Paulo (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2006.) and also ''Martin Heidegger's Interpretations of Augustine: Sein und Zeit und Ewigkeit'', ed. Frederick Van Fleteren (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2005.)</ref>\n\nAugustine viewed time as relative and subjective, and that being and time were bound up together.<ref>Augustine of Hippo (2008). ''Confessions''. Chadwick, Henry transl. New York: Oxford University Press, Book XI</ref> Heidegger adopted similar views, e.g. that time was the horizon of Being: ' ...time temporalizes itself only as long as there are human beings.'<ref>''Introduction to Metaphysics'', trans. by Gregory Fried and Richard Polt (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000), p. 89.</ref>\n\n====Aristotle and the Greeks====\nHeidegger was influenced at an early age by Aristotle, mediated through Catholic [[theology]], [[medieval philosophy]] and [[Franz Brentano]]. Aristotle's ethical, logical, and metaphysical works were crucial to the development of his thought in the crucial period of the 1920s. Although he later worked less on Aristotle, Heidegger recommended postponing reading Nietzsche, and to \"first study Aristotle for ten to fifteen years.\"<ref>Heidegger, ''[[What is Called Thinking?]]'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), p. 73.</ref> In reading Aristotle, Heidegger increasingly contested the traditional Latin translation and scholastic interpretation of his thought. Particularly important (not least for its influence upon others, both in their interpretation of Aristotle and in rehabilitating a neo-Aristotelian \"practical philosophy\")<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007).</ref> was his radical reinterpretation of Book Six of Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and several books of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''. Both informed the argument of ''Being and Time''. Heidegger's thought is original in being an authentic retrieval of the past, a repetition of the possibilities handed down by the tradition.<ref name=\"Sikka1997\">{{cite book|author=Sonya Sikka|title=Forms of Transcendence: Heidegger and Medieval Mystical Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNYIDrA0zrYC&pg=PA265|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3345-4|page=265}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of asking about [[being]] may be traced back via Aristotle to [[Parmenides]]. Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition extending from [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], a forgetfulness extending to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek thought]], in particular on Plato, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright [[Sophocles]].<ref>[http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf \"The Ode on Man in Sophocles' Antigone\"]</ref>\n\n====Dilthey====\nHeidegger's very early project of developing a \"hermeneutics of [[Facticity|factical]] life\" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nOf the influence of Dilthey, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] writes the following: \"As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in ''Being and Time'' that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late.\" He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt \"the clear superiority of [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg|Count Yorck]] over the famous scholar, Dilthey.\" Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger \"in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in ''Being and Time''.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger's One Path\", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp. 22–4.</ref> Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as \"too late\", scholars as diverse as [[Theodore Kisiel]] and [[David Farrell Krell]] have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.<ref>In ''The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in ''Being and Time'', \"the Dilthey draft\" (p. 313). David Farrell Krell comments in ''Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that \"Heidegger's project sprouts (in part, but in ''good'' part) from the soil of Dilthey's philosophy of factical-historical life\" (p. 35).</ref>\n\nEven though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a ''gestalt'' formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the [[hermeneutic circle]] offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Husserl====\nThere is disagreement over the degree of influence that [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in phenomenology. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.\n\nOn the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: \"When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'.\" Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's \"rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of [[Max Scheler]]'s volcanic fire.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger—75 Years\", ''Heidegger's Ways'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 18.</ref>\n\nRobert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:\n<blockquote>Heidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in ''Being and Time'' or why he left it unfinished.<ref>Robert J. Dostal, \"Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger\", in Charles Guignon (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 142.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDaniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Heidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a ''misrepresentation'' of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its \"dangerous closeness\" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.<ref>Daniel O. Dahlstrom, \"Heidegger's Critique of Husserl\", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 244.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Kierkegaard====\nHeideggerians regarded [[Søren Kierkegaard]] as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts.<ref>Dreyfus, Hubert. ''Being-in-the-world: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I.''  (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), Sec. Appendix.</ref> Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (''[[Angst]]'') and mortality draw on Kierkegaard and are indebted to the way in which the latter lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence, and the importance of passionate affirmation of one's individual [[being-in-the-world]].<ref>A recent study touches specifically on the ontological aspects of angst from a Heideggerian standpoint and the nuances that distinguish it in a radical way from the take on ''anguish'' in Kierkegaard's thought, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ‘Variations ontologiques autour du concept d’angoisse chez Kierkegaard’, in ''Kierkegaard notre contemporain paradoxal'' (Beirut, 2013), pp. 83–95</ref>\n\n====Hölderlin and Nietzsche====\n[[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were both important influences on Heidegger,<ref>Historical Dictionary of Heidegger's Philosophy, By Frank Schalow, Alfred Denker</ref> and many of his lecture courses were devoted to one or the other, especially in the 1930s and 1940s. The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger read ''The Will to Power'' as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.\n\nThe fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and [[Adorno]] can be found in their contrasting views of Hölderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on [[German romanticism]] in general. For Heidegger, Hölderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection. Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities.<ref>Oliver Garbrecht (1999). (Dissertation Universität München). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1SlXtJuuOYwC&pg=PA287 ''Rationalitätskritik der Moderne – Adorno und Heidegger'']. p. 269. Herbert Utz Verlag – Wissenschaft. ISBN 3-89675-652-4.</ref> Nevertheless, it was Heidegger's rationalization and later work on Hölderlin's poems as well as on [[Parmenides]] (\"For to be aware and to be are the same,\" [[Diels–Kranz numbering|DK]] B 3) and his consistent understanding of Nietzsche's thought that formed the foundation of [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] [[existentialism]].<ref>Martin Heidegger (1954). Was heisst denken? p. 6-86. Max Niemeyer Verlag Tübingen. ISBN 3-484-70029-7.</ref>\n\nThis is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's work and thought. Heidegger grants to Hölderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be \"heard\" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from Hölderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"]]'').\n\n===Heidegger and Eastern thought===\nSome writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking. Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue.<ref>Heidegger, \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1971).</ref> Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Kuki Shūzō]].  It has also been claimed that a number of elements within Heidegger's thought bear a close parallel to Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. Reinhard May records Chang Chung-Yuan saying that \"Heidegger is the only Western Philosopher who not only intellectually understands but has intuitively grasped Taoist thought.\"<ref>''Heidegger’s hidden sources: East Asian influences on his work'' by Reinhard May, p. 7.  Translated, with a complementary essay, by Graham Parkes. 1996. London and New York.</ref> May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts: \"The investigation concludes that Heidegger’s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger’s work.\"<ref>''Heidegger's hidden sources: East Asian influences on his work'' by Reinhard May, p.

This is for instance evident in the works and profiles of theorists such as [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], [[Dalibor Vesely]], [[Nader El-Bizri]], [[Karsten Harries]], [[Neil Leach]], Adam Sharr, etc., within what is known as Architectural [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and in contemporary [[architectural theory]] in general.\n\n==The Heidegger controversy==\n{{Main article|Martin Heidegger and Nazism|l1=Heidegger and Nazism}}\n\n===The rectorate===\n[[File:Universität Freiburg Kollegiengebäude I (Altbau).jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Freiburg]], where Heidegger was Rector from April 21, 1933, to April 23, 1934]]\n[[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on January 30, 1933. Heidegger was elected [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Freiburg]] on April 21, 1933, and assumed the position the following day. On May 1, he joined the [[Nazi Party]].\n\nHeidegger delivered his inaugural address, the ''Rektoratsrede'', on \"Die Selbstbehauptung der Deutschen Universität\" (\"The Self-assertion of the German University\") on 27 May.\n\nHis tenure as rector was fraught with difficulties from the outset. Some National Socialist education officials viewed him as a rival, while others saw his efforts as comical. Some of Heidegger's fellow National Socialists also ridiculed his philosophical writings as gibberish. He finally offered his resignation on 23 April 1934, and it was accepted on 27 April. Heidegger remained a member of both the academic faculty and of the Nazi Party until the end of the war.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nPhilosophical historian [[Hans Sluga]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Though as rector he prevented students from displaying an anti-Semitic poster at the entrance to the university and from holding a book burning, he kept in close contact with the Nazi student leaders and clearly signaled to them his sympathy with their activism.<ref>Hans Sluga, ''Heidegger's Crisis: Philosophy and Politics in Nazi Germany'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, & London: Harvard University Press, 1993), p. 149.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1945, Heidegger wrote of his term as rector, giving the writing to his son Hermann; it was published in 1983:\n\n<blockquote>The rectorate was an attempt to see something in the movement that had come to power, beyond all its failings and crudeness, that was much more far-reaching and that could perhaps one day bring a concentration on the Germans' Western historical essence. It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity. In no way will what was caused by my own inadequacy in office be played down. But these points of view do not capture what is essential and what moved me to accept the rectorate.<ref>Heidegger, \"The Rectorate 1933/34: Facts and Thoughts\", in Günther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), ''Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers'' (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 29.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Treatment of Husserl===\nBeginning in 1917, German-Jewish philosopher [[Edmund Husserl]] championed Heidegger's work, and helped him secure the retiring Husserl's chair in Philosophy at the University of Freiburg.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3l7S-ZTK4YC&pg=PA120 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Reluctant Modernism Of Hannah Arendt''] (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003, p. 120.)</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1933, the [[Reichskommissar]] of [[Baden]] Province, Robert Wagner, suspended all Jewish government employees, including present and retired faculty at the University of Freiburg. Heidegger's predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his \"enforced leave of absence\" on 14 April 1933.\n\nHeidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933, replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree.  The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.<ref>[http://www.bostonreview.net/BR24.5/benhabib.html#5 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Personal is not the Political''] (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.)</ref>\n\nHeidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries.  Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly \"settled accounts\" with Heidegger and [[Max Scheler]] in the early 1930s.<ref>Martin Heidegger, \"Der Spiegel Interview\", in Günther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), ''Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers'' (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 48.</ref>\n\nHeidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from ''Being and Time'' (restored in post-war editions).<ref>Rüdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253–8.</ref>\n\nHeidegger's behavior towards Husserl has evoked controversy. Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a \"potential murderer.\" However, she later recanted her accusation.<ref>Elzbieta Ettinger,''Hannah Arendt – Martin Heidegger'', (New Haven, Conn., & London: Yale University Press, 1995), p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his ''[[Black Notebooks]]'': \"The more original and inceptive the coming decisions and questions become, the more inaccessible will they remain to this [Jewish] 'race'. (Thus, Husserl’s step toward phenomenological observation, and his rejection of psychological explanations and historiological reckoning of opinions, are of enduring importance—yet it never reaches into the domains of essential decisions\",<ref>GA 96: 46-47 (from Überlegungen XII, 24) (1939?)</ref> seeming to imply that Husserl's philosophy was limited purely because he was Jewish.\n\n===Post-rectorate period===\nAfter the failure of Heidegger's rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, without canceling his membership in the NSDAP (Nazi Party). References to National Socialism continued to appear in his work.\n\nThe most controversial such reference occurred during a 1935 lecture which was published in 1953 as part of the book ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]''. In the published version, Heidegger refers to the \"inner truth and greatness\" of the National Socialist movement (''die innere Wahrheit und Größe dieser Bewegung''), but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: \"namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity\" (''nämlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen''). However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Habermas | first1 = Jürgen | authorlink = Jürgen Habermas | year = 1989 | title = Work and ''Weltanschauung'': the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective | url = | journal = [[Critical Inquiry]] | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 452–54 }} See also [[J. Habermas]], \"Martin Heidegger: on the publication of the lectures of 1935\", in [[Richard Wolin]], ed., ''The Heidegger Controversy'' ([[MIT Press]], 1993). The controversial page of the 1935 manuscript is missing from the Heidegger Archives in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]]; however, Habermas's scholarship leaves little doubt about the original wording.</ref>\n\nIn private notes written in 1939, Heidegger took a strongly critical view of Hitler's ideology;<ref>Martin Heidegger, ''Mindfulness'' (Continuum, 2006), section 47.</ref> however, in public lectures, he seems to have continued to make ambiguous comments which, if they expressed criticism of the regime, did so only in the context of praising its ideals. For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship:\n\n<blockquote>In the majority of \"research results,\" the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such \"results\" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.<ref>Heidegger, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"]]'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: [[Indiana University Press]], 1996), pp. 79–80.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to National Socialism during the post-rectorship period is his former student [[Karl Löwith]], who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), Löwith recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that Löwith was Jewish. Löwith also recalled that Heidegger \"left no doubt about his faith in [[Hitler]]\", and stated that his support for National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.<ref>Karl Löwith, \"My last meeting with Heidegger in Rome\", in R. Wolin, ''The Heidegger Controversy'' (MIT Press, 1993).</ref>\n\n===Post-war period===\nAfter the end of World War II, Heidegger was summoned to appear at a [[denazification]] hearing. Heidegger's former lover [[Arendt]] spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] spoke against him. The result of the hearings was that Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.<ref>[[:Fr:Dominique Janicaud|Dominique Janicaud]], ''Heidegger en France'' vol. 1 (Paris: Albin Michel, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem \"scandalous\" to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and [[industrialisation]], including the treatment of animals by [[factory farming]]. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: \"Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.\"<ref name=Sheehan>Thomas Sheehan, [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/relstud/faculty/sheehan/pdf/88-nazi.PDF \"Heidegger and the Nazis\"], a review of Víctor Farías' ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', Vol. XXXV, n°10, June 16, 1988, pp. 38–47</ref>\n\nIn 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet [[Paul Celan]], a concentration camp survivor. Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/488241\n| issn = 0094-033X\n| issue = 53\n| pages = 3–18\n| last = Anderson\n| first = Mark M.\n| title = The \"Impossibility of Poetry\": Celan and Heidegger in France\n| journal = New German Critique\n| date = 1991-04-01\n| jstor=488241\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Der Spiegel'' interview===\nOn 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by Rudolf Augstein and Georg Wolff for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously.

Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]].\n\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the NSDAP. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\n\nThe Löwith account from 1936 has been cited to contradict the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps. In fact, the interviewers were not in possession of much of the evidence now known for Heidegger's Nazi sympathies.<ref>For critical readings of the interview (published in 1966 as \"Only a God Can Save Us,\" ''Der Spiegel''), see the \"Special Feature on Heidegger and Nazism\" in ''Critical Inquiry'' 15:2 (Winter 1989), particularly the contributions by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Maurice Blanchot|Blanchot]]. The issue includes partial translations of Derrida's ''Of Spirit'' and Lacoue-Labarthe's ''Of Spirit'' and ''Heidegger, Art, and Politics: the Fiction of the Political''.</ref>\n\n==Influence and reception in France==\nHeidegger was one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century, and his ideas have penetrated into many areas, but in France there is a very long and particular history of reading and interpreting his work which in itself resulted in deepening the impact of his thought in Continental Philosophy.  His influence is clear on [[Jean Beaufret]], [[:fr:François Fédier|François Fédier]], [[Dominique Janicaud]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[:fr:Jean-François Courtine|Jean-François Courtine]], etc. -- one cannot even read [[Derrida]] or [[Levinas]] without taking into account their critiques of Heidegger that run deep at the basis of their thinking.\n\n===Existentialism and pre-war influence===\nHeidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when ''Being and Time'', \"What is Metaphysics?\" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as [[Alexandre Kojève]], [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].<ref>On the history of the French translation of Heidegger's \"What is Metaphysics?\", and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf. Denis Hollier, \"Plenty of Nothing\", in Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 894–900.</ref> Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (''Da-sein'', or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the \"Letter on 'Humanism.'\" In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>Sartre's key proposition about the priority of ''existentia'' over ''essentia''  [that is, Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence\"] does, however, justify using the name \"existentialism\" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of \"existentialism\" has nothing at all in common with the statement from ''Being and Time'' [that \"the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence\"]—apart from the fact that in ''Being and Time'' no statement about the relation of ''essentia'' and ''existentia'' can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.<ref>Heidegger, \"Letter on 'Humanism,'\" ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250–1.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Letter on 'Humanism'\" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture [[Existentialism is a Humanism|\"Existentialism is a Humanism.\"]]  Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in \"Letter on 'Humanism,'\" Heidegger asserts that \"Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one.\"  Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\" From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word \"humanism\".\n\n===Post-war forays into France===\nAfter the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his activities as Rector of Freiburg University. He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at [[Todtnauberg]] (see, for example, [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s brief account in ''Heidegger and \"the Jews\"'', which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students). Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]], an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.\n\n===Derrida and deconstruction===\n[[Deconstruction]] came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work ([[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see ''Penser à Strasbourg,'' Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, \"À mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida\").\n\nDerrida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and existentialist terms. In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term \"déconstruction\" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words \"Destruktion\"—literally \"destruction\"—and \"Abbau\"—more literally \"de-building\"). According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ''Dasein'' in ''Being and Time''.\n\n===The Farías debate===\nDerrida, Lacoue-Labarthe, and [[Jean-François Lyotard]], among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as \"Les Fins de l'homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980\", Derrida's \"Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco\", and the studies on [[Paul Celan]] by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.\n\nWhen in 1987 [[Víctor Farías]] published his book ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called \"deconstructionists\" for their association with Heidegger's philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Farías on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: [[Richard Rorty]], for example, declared that \"[Farías'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published.\"<ref>[http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/618_reg_print.html Richard Rorty, review of ''Heidegger and Nazism'' in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for ''Heidegger and Nazism'']</ref>\n\n===Bernard Stiegler===\nMore recently, Heidegger's thought has considerably influenced the work of the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]]. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume ''magnum opus'', ''La technique et le temps'' (volume one translated into English as ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'').<ref>Bernard Stiegler,'' Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2.</ref> Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to \"originary temporality\" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' as an account of psychic [[individuation]], and his later \"history of being\" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.\n\n===Giorgio Agamben===\nHeidegger has been very influential on the work of Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Agamben attended seminars in France led by Heidegger in the late 1960s.<ref>Durantaye, Leland de la. (2009). Giorgio Agamben. A Critical Introduction. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nHeidegger's influence upon 20th century [[continental philosophy]] is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.\n\n===Early criticisms===\nAccording to Husserl, ''Being and Time'' claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to ''Dasein''. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to \"philosophical anthropology\" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.<ref>See Edmund Husserl, ''Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927–1931)'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997).</ref>\n\nThe [[Neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]] and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in [[Davos]] in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality (see [[Cassirer–Heidegger debate]]). Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.\n\nDilthey's student [[Georg Misch]] wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in ''Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3rd ed. Stuttgart 1964).\n\n===Left-Hegelianism and critical theory===\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially [[György Lukács]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.\n\nInitially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its \"false concreteness\" and \"revolutionary conservativism.\" [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the ''Jargon of Authenticity''. Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence. In particular, [[Jürgen Habermas]] admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against \"postmodernism\" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (1985). However, recent work by philosopher and critical theorist [[Nikolas Kompridis]] tries to show that Heidegger's insights into [[world disclosure]] are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of [[reflective disclosure|renewing that tradition]].<ref>Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' MIT Press, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a723657914 Nikolas Kompridis, \"Disclosing Possibility: The Past and Future of Critical Theory\", ''International Journal of Philosophical Studies'', Volume 13, Issue September 3, 2005, pages 325–351.]</ref>\n\n===Reception by analytic and Anglo-American philosophy===\nCriticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from [[analytic philosophy]], beginning with [[logical positivism]]. In \"The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\" (1932), [[Rudolf Carnap]] accused Heidegger of offering an \"illusory\" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing \"nonsensical pseudo-propositions.\"\n\nThe British logical positivist [[A. J. Ayer]] was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy. In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] commented, expressing the sentiments of many mid-20th-century analytic philosophers, that:\n<blockquote>Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''Wisdom of the West'' (New York: Crescent Books, 1989), p. 303.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] stated that:  \"His major work ''Being and Time'' is formidably difficult—unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it\".<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:\n\n<blockquote>those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can ''never'' be confirmed by \"facts,\" i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize \"facts\" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce ''their'' nearness.<ref name=\"MartinHeidegger\">Martin Heidegger, ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 307.</ref></blockquote>\n\nApart from the charge of [[obscurantism]], other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. [[Gilbert Ryle]] wrote a critical yet positive review of ''Being and Time''. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made a remark recorded by [[Friedrich Waismann]]: \"To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety\"<ref>''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1979, p. 68</ref> which has been construed by some commentators<ref>James Luchte, ‘Under the Aspect of Time (\"sub specie temporis\"): Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and the Place of the Nothing,’ Philosophy Today, Volume 53, Number 2, 2009.</ref> as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays'' (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Richard Rorty]], and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 170.</ref>\n\nThe Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that Heidegger's writing is \"notoriously difficult\", possibly because his thinking was \"original\" and clearly on obscure and innovative topics.<ref>[http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/#SH8a Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"Martin Heidegger (1889—1976)\"]</ref>\n\n===Contemporary European reception===\nEven though Heidegger is considered by many observers to be the most influential philosopher of the 20th century in continental philosophy, aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]), sexual difference ([[Luce Irigaray]]), or space ([[Peter Sloterdijk]]).\n\nLevinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, stating: \"One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger.\"<ref>Emmanuel Levinas, ''Nine Talmudic Readings'' (Indiana University Press, 1990), p. xxv, translated by Annette Aronowicz</ref>\n\nHeidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal \" 'error' \" (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics).<ref>Hannah Arendt, ''Martin Heidegger At 80'', New York Review of Books, 17/6, (Oct. 21, 1971), 50–54; repr. in ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy'' ed. M. Murray  (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978), 293–303</ref> Defenders think this error was irrelevant to Heidegger's philosophy. Critics such as Levinas,<ref>[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-11052004-163310/unrestricted/Gauthier_dis.pdf \"Martin Heidegger, Emmanuel Levinas, and the Politics of Dwelling\"] by David J.
