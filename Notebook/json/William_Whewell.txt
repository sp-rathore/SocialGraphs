He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].  In his time as a student there, he achieved distinction in both poetry and mathematics.\n\nWhat is most often remarked about Whewell is the breadth of his endeavours.  At a time when men of science were becoming increasingly specialised, Whewell appears as a vestige of an earlier era when men of science dabbled in a bit of everything. He researched ocean tides (for which he won the [[Royal Medal]]), published work in the disciplines of [[mechanics]], [[physics]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], and [[economics]], while also finding the time to compose [[poetry]], author a [[Bridgewater Treatise]], translate the works of [[Goethe]], and write [[sermon]]s and [[Theology|theological]] tracts.  In [[mathematics]], Whewell introduced what is now called the [[Whewell equation]], an equation defining the shape of a curve without reference to an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system.\n\nOne of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with [[neologism|new terms]] for their discoveries.  Whewell contributed the terms [[scientist]], [[physicist]],  [[consilience]], [[catastrophism]], and [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], amongst others; Whewell suggested the terms [[ion]], [[dielectric]], [[anode]], and [[cathode]] to [[Michael Faraday]].\n\nWhewell died in Cambridge in 1866 as a result of a fall from his horse.\n\n==Life and career==\n\nWhewell was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. His father, a carpenter, wished him to follow his trade, but his success in [[mathematics]] at [[Lancaster Grammar School|Lancaster]] and [[Heversham Grammar School|Heversham]] [[grammar school]]s won him an [[exhibition (scholarship)|exhibition]] (a type of scholarship) at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1812). In 1814 he was awarded the [[Chancellor's Gold Medal]] for poetry.<ref>{{Citation|title=A Complete Collection of the English Poems which Have Obtained the Chancellor's Gold Medal in the University of Cambridge|publisher=W.

While the History traced how each branch of the sciences had evolved since antiquity, Whewell viewed the ''Philosophy'' as the \"Moral\" of the previous work as it sought to extract a universal theory of knowledge through the history he had just traced. In the ''Philosophy'', Whewell attempted to follow [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s plan for discovery of an effectual art of discovery. He examined ideas (\"explication of conceptions\") and by the \"colligation of facts\" endeavoured to unite these ideas with the facts and so construct science. But no art of discovery, such as Bacon anticipated, follows, for \"invention, sagacity, genius\" are needed at each step.\n\n===Whewell's three steps of induction===\nWhewell analysed [[inductive reasoning]] into three steps:\n* The selection of the (fundamental) idea, such as space, number, cause, or likeness (resemblance);\n* The formation of the conception, or more special modification of those ideas, as a circle, a uniform force, etc.; and,\n* The determination of magnitudes.\n\nUpon these follow special methods of induction applicable to quantity: the method of curves, the method of means, the method of least squares and the method of residues, and special methods depending on resemblance (to which the transition is made through the law of continuity), such as the method of gradation and the method of natural classification. In ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' Whewell was the first to use the term \"[[consilience]]\" to discuss the unification of knowledge between the different branches of learning.\n\n===Opponent of English empiricism===\nHere, as in his [[ethics|ethical]] doctrine, Whewell was moved by opposition to contemporary [[Empiricism|English empiricism]]. Following [[Immanuel Kant]], he asserted against [[John Stuart Mill]] the ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' nature of [[Logical truth|necessary truth]], and by his rules for the construction of conceptions he dispensed with the inductive methods of Mill.\n\n===Whewell's neologisms===\nAs stated, one of Whewell's greatest gifts to science was his wordsmithing.  He often corresponded with many in his field and helped them come up with [[neologism|new terms]] for their discoveries.  In fact, Whewell came up with the term ''[[scientist]]'' itself in 1833, and it was first published in Whewell's anonymous 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''[[On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences]]'' published in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''.<ref name=Ross1962>{{Cite journal| format = PDF | author = Ross, Sydney | year = 1962 | title = Scientist: The story of a word | journal = [[Annals of Science]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–85 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/index/739364907.pdf | accessdate = 2011-03-08 | doi = 10.1080/00033796200202722| ref = harv}} To be exact, the person coined the term ''scientist'' was referred to in Whewell 1834 only as \"some ingenious gentleman.\" Ross added a comment that this \"some ingenious gentleman\" was Whewell himself, without giving the reason for the identification. Ross 1962, p.72.</ref> (They had previously been known as \"natural philosophers\" or \"men of science\").\n\n==Work in college administration==\n[[File:Cambridge52.JPG|thumb|Statue of Whewell by [[Thomas Woolner]] in [[Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge]] ]]\nWhewell was prominent not only in scientific research and philosophy, but also in [[university]] and college administration. His first work, ''An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics'' (1819), cooperated with those of [[George Peacock]] and [[John Herschel]] in reforming the Cambridge method of mathematical teaching. His work and publications also helped influence the recognition of the moral and natural sciences as an integral part of the Cambridge curriculum. In general, however, especially in later years, he opposed reform: he defended the [[tutorial system]], and in a controversy with [[Connop Thirlwall]] (1834), opposed the admission of [[Dissenter]]s; he upheld the clerical fellowship system, the privileged class of \"fellow-commoners,\" and the authority of heads of colleges in university affairs. He opposed the appointment of the University Commission (1850), and wrote two pamphlets (''Remarks'') against the reform of the university (1855). He stood against the scheme of entrusting elections to the members of the senate and instead, advocated the use of college funds and the subvention of scientific and professorial work.\n\nHe was elected Master of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1841, and retained that position until his death in 1866; he is buried in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge while his wives are buried together in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge]].\n\nThe [[Whewell Professorship of International Law]] and the Whewell Scholarships were established  through the provisions of his will.<ref>{{cite book |title=Statutes and Ordinances of the University of Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |pages=49–50 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JSi0S7aH320C&pg=PA49 |isbn=9780521137454}}</ref><ref>Dr. William Whewell laid in his will: \"an earnest an express injunction on the occupant of this chair that he should make it his aim in all parts of his treatment of the subject, to lay down such rules and suggest such measures as might tend to diminsh the evils of war and finally to extinguish war among nations.

He is best known for his writings on [[Gothic architecture]], specifically his book, ''Architectural Notes on German Churches'' (first published in 1830).  In this work, Whewell established a strict nomenclature for German Gothic churches and came up with a theory of stylistic development.  His work is associated with the \"scientific trend\" of architectural writers, along with [[Thomas Rickman]] and [[Robert Willis (architect)|Robert Willis]].\n\nHe paid from his own resources for the construction of two new courts of rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, built in a Gothic style.  The two courts were completed in 1860 and (posthumously) in 1868, and are now collectively named [[Trinity College, Cambridge#Other courts|Whewell's Court]] (in the singular).\n\n==Whewell's works in philosophy and morals==\n[[File:William Whewell portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Portrait by [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]]]]\nBetween 1835 and 1861 Whewell produced various works on the philosophy of [[moral]]s and [[politics]], the chief of which, ''Elements of Morality'', including ''Polity'', was published in 1845. The peculiarity of this work—written from what is known as the [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitional point of view]]—is its fivefold division of the springs of action and of their objects, of the primary and universal rights of man (personal security, property, contract, family rights and government), and of the cardinal virtues ([[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[justice]], [[truth]], [[wiktionary:Purity|purity]] and [[Social order|order]]).\n\nAmong Whewell's other works—too numerous to mention—were popular writings such as the third ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' ''Astronomy and General Physics considered with reference to Natural Theology'' (1833), and the essay, ''Of the Plurality of Worlds'' (1853), in which he argued against the [[probability]] of [[Extraterrestrial life|life on other planets]], and also the ''[[Plato]]nic Dialogues for English Readers'' (1850–1861), the ''Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy in England'' (1852), the essay, ''Of a Liberal Education in General, with particular reference to the Leading Studies of the University of Cambridge'' (1845), the important edition and abridged translation of [[Hugo Grotius]], ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (1853), and the edition of the ''Mathematical Works'' of [[Isaac Barrow]] (1860).<ref>''Grotius on the Right of War and Peace, An Abridged Translation by William Whewell'', Cambridge: At the University Press, 1853 [https://archive.org/stream/onrightsofwarpea00grotuoft#page/n7/mode/2up at Internet Archive]</ref><ref>''The Mathematical Works of Isaac Barrow, D.D., edited for Triniity College by W.
