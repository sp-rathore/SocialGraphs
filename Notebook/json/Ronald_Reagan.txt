Prior to his presidency, he was the 33rd [[Governor of California]] from 1967 to 1975, following a career as a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor and union leader.\n\nRaised in a poor family in small towns of northern Illinois, Ronald Reagan graduated from [[Eureka College]] in 1932 and worked as a sports announcer on several regional radio stations. After moving to [[Hollywood]] in 1937, he became an actor and starred in a few major productions. Reagan was twice elected as President of the [[Screen Actors Guild]], the labor union for actors, where he worked to root out [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Communist influence]]. In the 1950s, he moved into television and was a motivational speaker at [[General Electric]] factories. Having been a lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)#Liberals|Democrat]], his views changed. He became a conservative and in 1962 switched to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], Reagan's speech, \"[[A Time for Choosing]]\", in support of [[Barry Goldwater]]'s floundering presidential campaign, earned him national attention as a new conservative spokesman. Building a network of supporters, he was [[California gubernatorial election, 1966|elected Governor of California]] in 1966. As governor, Reagan raised taxes, turned a state budget deficit to a surplus, challenged the protesters at the [[University of California]], ordered [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] troops in during a period of [[People's Park (Berkeley)|protest movements]] in 1969, and was [[California gubernatorial election, 1970|re-elected in 1970]]. He twice ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]]; four years later, he easily won the nomination outright, going on to be elected the oldest President, defeating incumbent [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]].\n\nEntering the presidency in [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|1981]], Reagan implemented sweeping new political and economic initiatives. His [[Supply-side economics|supply-side economic]] policies, dubbed \"[[Reaganomics]]\", advocated tax rate reduction to spur economic growth, control of the money supply to curb inflation, economic deregulation, and reduction in government spending. In his first term he survived [[Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan|an assassination attempt]], escalated the [[War on Drugs]], and fought [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|public-sector labor]]. Over his two terms, his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12.5% to 4.4%, and an average annual growth of [[Gross domestic product|real GDP]] of 3.4%; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending, increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall, even after adjustment for inflation. During his re-election bid, Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was \"[[Morning in America]]\", winning a [[United States presidential election, 1984|landslide in 1984]] with the largest electoral college victory in history. Foreign affairs dominated his second term, including ending of the [[Cold War]], the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|bombing of Libya]], and the [[Iran–Contra affair]]. Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an \"[[evil empire]]\", he transitioned Cold War policy from [[détente]] to [[rollback]], by escalating an [[arms race]] with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], which culminated in the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]], shrinking both countries' nuclear arsenals.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gingrich, Newt|authorlink=Newt Gingrich|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/evil-empire|title=The Evil Empire|work=[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]|date=Spring–Summer 2008|volume=58|issue=4|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}</ref> During his famous speech at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], President Reagan challenged Gorbachev to \"[[tear down this wall!]]\". Five months after the end of his term, the [[Berlin Wall]] fell, and on December 26, 1991, nearly three years after he left office, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]].\n\nLeaving office in 1989, Reagan held an approval rating of sixty-eight percent, matching those of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and later [[Bill Clinton]], as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A Look Back At The Polls|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-look-back-at-the-polls/|publisher = CBS News|accessdate = May 15, 2015}}</ref> While having planned an active post-presidency, in 1994 Reagan disclosed his diagnosis with [[Alzheimer's disease]] earlier that year, appearing publicly for the last time at the [[Death and funeral of Richard Nixon|funeral of Richard Nixon]]; he [[Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan|died ten years later]] in 2004 at the age of 93.
