He is the coeditor of the complete works of Hume published by Oxford University Press, and together with Alexander Rosenberg is the author of ''Hume and the Problem of Causation'' (1981), in which Hume's regularity theory of [[Causality|causation]] is defended, along with a nonskeptical interpretation of Hume's arguments against induction.\n\nHe has also written extensively about [[animal rights]], and has defended a theory of animal rights which would significantly alter, though would not end, the ways in which non-human animals are currently used.<ref>[http://www.phil.ucalgary.ca/node/676 \"Tom Beauchamp - \"Rights Theory and Animal Rights\"], Department of Philosophy, University of Calgary, accessed 5 June 2012.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[American philosophy]]\n*[[List of American philosophers]]\n*[[List of animal rights advocates]]\n*[[Principlism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://philosophy.georgetown.edu/faculty/bios/beauchamp.htm Homepage], Georgetown University.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Beauchamp, Tom}}\n[[Category:American philosophers]]\n[[Category:Animal rights advocates]]\n[[Category:Bioethicists]]\n[[Category:Hastings Center Fellows]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Yale Divinity School alumni]]\n[[Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni]]\n[[Category:Hume scholars]]\n[[Category:Southern Methodist University alumni]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Tom Beauchamp"}}}}
