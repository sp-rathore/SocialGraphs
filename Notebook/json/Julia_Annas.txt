(1970) and a  Ph.D. (1972).<ref>http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jannas/</ref> She was a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] and Tutor at [[St Hugh's College, Oxford]] for fifteen years, before joining the faculty at Arizona in 1986, where she has taught since, apart for one year as a professor at Columbia University. She concentrates on the study of ancient [[Greek philosophy]], including [[Ethics]], [[Psychology]] and [[Epistemology]]. \nHer current research interests are in Platonic ethics. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1992,<ref name=AAAS /> and a Fellow of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2013.<ref>https://www.amphilsoc.org/members/electedApril2013</ref>  She is the founder and former editor of the annual journal, ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy''.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmNNb_rcX1YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Julia+Annas+oxford&source=bl&ots=XGP4zpmH-v&sig=e31Dna25-74RJhU7pjtIJJyjBIM&hl=en&ei=ILl6S8SrJY-3ngerxbiwCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=Oxford studies in ancient philosophy, Volume 20| editor=Julia Annas| publisher=Oxford University Press| year= 2001| isbn= 978-0-19-924225-2 | first=David | last=Sedley}}</ref>  She is married to the Hume scholar, David Owen, also a professor of philosophy at the University of Arizona.\n\n==Philosophy==\nJulia Annas has advocated ethics based on [[Virtue Ethics|character]], building on ideas attributed to [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher, [[Aristotle]] and making them relevant for contemporary moral discourse.<ref>A detailed account of her philosophical approach is set out in her 2011 book, Intelligent Virtue; an academic synopsis of the book is available [http://philpapers.org/rec/ANNIV here]</ref>  She has argued that being virtuous involves “practical reasoning”<ref name=\"here\">For more on this, see Julia Annas’ article from ‘Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences, 2008, accessible [http://philpapers.org/rec/ANNTPO here]</ref> which can be compared to the “exercising of a practical skill”.  Hence, she argues, rather than relating virtues to rules, principles, or an end goal, Annas says, first, people should ask how they can improve their moral “skills”.<ref name=\"here\"/>\n\n==Major writings==\n\n===Books===\n*''Intelligent Virtue'' (Oxford, 2011).\n*''Plato: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford, 2003).\n*''Ancient Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction'' (Oxford, 2000).\n*''Voices of Ancient Philosophy: An Introductory Reader'' (Oxford, 2000).\n*''Platonic Ethics, Old and New'' (Cornell, 1999).\n*{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRfwSjk3fBcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Julia+Annas&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false| title=The Morality of Happiness| year= 1993| publisher=Oxford University Press | first=Julia | last=Annas | isbn=978-0-19-509652-1}}  (reprint 1995, ISBN 978-0-19-509652-1)\n*''Hellenistic Philosophy of Mind'' (California, 1992).\n*''The Modes of Scepticism'' (Cambridge, 1985), with [[Jonathan Barnes]].\n*''An Introduction to Plato's Republic'' (Oxford, 1981).\n*''Aristotle's Metaphysics, Books M and N, translated with introduction and notes, (Oxford 1976).\n\n===Translations===\n*[[Plato]], ''Statesman'' (Cambridge, 1995), with [[Robin Waterfield]].\n*[[Sextus Empiricus]], ''Outlines of Scepticism'' (Cambridge, 1994), with [[Jonathan Barnes]].\n*[[Aristotle]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics Books M and N'' (Oxford, 1976).\n\n===Recent articles===\n*\"What are Plato’s “Middle” Dialogues in the Middle Of?\" (Harvard University Press, 2002)\n*\"Democritus and Eudaimonism\" (Presocratic Philosophy: Essays in Honour of Alex Mourelatos, edited by Victor Caston and Daniel Graham, Ashgate, Aldershot, 2002)\n*\"Aristotle and Kant on Morality and Practical Reasoning\" (Aristotle, Kant & The Stoics,ed.
