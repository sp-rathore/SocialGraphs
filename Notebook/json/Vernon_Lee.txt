An early follower of [[Walter Pater]], she wrote over a dozen volumes of essays on art, music, and travel.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Violet Paget - Vernon Lee ca 1870.jpg|thumb|Violet Paget, circa 1870]]\nViolet Paget was born in France on 14 October<ref>Paget, Violet.

Colby College, Waterville, ME.</ref> 1856, at Château St Leonard, [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], to British expatriate parents, Henry Ferguson Paget and Matilda Lee-Hamilton (née Abadam). Violet Paget was the half-sister of [[Eugene Lee-Hamilton|Eugene Jacob Lee-Hamilton]] (1845–1907)<ref>{{cite wikisource|title=Lee-Hamilton, Eugene Jacob (DNB12)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}</ref> by her mother's first marriage, and from whose surname she adapted her own [[pseudonym]]. Although she primarily wrote for an English readership and made many visits to London, she spent the majority of her life on the continent, particularly in Italy. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nHer longest residence was just outside [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] in the Palmerino villa from 1889 until her death at San Gervasio, with a brief interruption during [[World War I]]. Her library was left to the British Institute of Florence and can still be inspected by visitors. In Florence she knit lasting friendships with the painter [[Telemaco Signorini]] and the learned [[Mario Praz]], and she encouraged his love of learning and English literature.\n\nAn engaged feminist, she always dressed à la garçonne. During the [[First World War]],Lee adopted strong [[pacifist]] views,<ref>{{cite book |quote=Her [Lee's] strong pacifist views during World War One earned her few friends in England. |first=Patricia |last=Pulham |title=Art and the Transitional Object in Vernon Lee's Supernatural Tales |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd. |year=2008 |isbn=0-7546-5096-0 |page=xi }}</ref> and was a member of the [[anti-militarist]] organisation, the [[Union of Democratic Control]].<ref>Mario Praz, Vernon Lee, 1935{{full citation needed|date=October 2014}}</ref> She was also a lesbian, and had long-term passionate friendships with three women, Mary Robinson, Kit Anstruther-Thomson, and British author [[Amy Levy]].<ref name=\"lesbian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2010/09/empathy-lee-moral-study-others|title=You have to be kind to be cruel|publisher=New Statesman|work=Society |date=6 September 2010|accessdate=3 January  2013|author=Vernon, Mark}}</ref>\n\nShe played the harpsichord and her appreciation of music animates her first major work, ''Studies of the Eighteenth Century in Italy'' (1880). In her preface to the second edition of 1907, she recalled her excitement as a girl when she came across a bundle of 18th-century music. She was so nervous that it wouldn't live up to her expectations that she escaped to the garden and listened rapturously through an open window as her mother worked out the music on the piano. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Along with Pater and [[John Addington Symonds]], she was considered an authority on the Italian [[Renaissance]], and wrote two works that dealt with it explicitly, ''Euphorion'' (1884) and ''Renaissance Fancies and Studies'' (1895).<ref>Fraser, Hilary (1992). \"Studies in the History of the Renaissance\", ''The Victorians and Renaissance Italy'', Oxford: Blackwell.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n[[File:Violet Paget - Vernon Lee 001.jpg|thumb|300px|Violet Paget (unknown year)]]\n\nHer short fiction explored the themes of haunting and possession. The most famous were collected in ''Hauntings'' (1890) and her story \"Prince Alberic and the Snake Lady\" (1895) was first printed in the notorious ''[[The Yellow Book]]''. She was instrumental in the introduction of the German concept of 'Einfühlung', or '[[empathy]]' into the study of [[aesthetics]] in the English-speaking world.<ref>Wispé, Lauren. \"History of the Concept of Empathy.\" ''Empathy and Its Development'', ed. Nancy Eisenberg and Janet Strayer (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 18. <!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nShe developed her own theory of psychological aesthetics in collaboration with her lover, Kit Anstruther-Thomson, based on previous works by [[William James]], [[Theodor Lipps]], and [[Karl Groos]]. She claimed that spectators \"empathise\" with works of art when they call up memories and associations and cause often unconscious bodily changes in posture and breathing.<ref name=\"lesbian\"/><ref>Rene Wellek (1970), \"Vernon Lee, Bernard Berenson, and Aesthetics,\" ''Discriminations: Further Concepts of Criticism'', New Haven: Yale UP</ref>\n\nShe was known for her numerous essays about travel in Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland, which attempted to capture the psychological effects of places rather than to convey any particular piece of information. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Like her friend [[Henry James]], she wrote critically about the relationship between writers and their audience, pioneering the idea of critical assessment among all the arts as relating to an audience's personal response. She was a proponent of the [[Aesthetic movement]], and after a lengthy written correspondence met the movement's effective leader, [[Walter Pater]], in England in 1881, just after encountering one of Pater's most famous disciples, [[Oscar Wilde]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe English writer and translator [[Montague Summers]] described Vernon Lee as \"the greatest [...] of modern exponents of the supernatural in fiction.\"<ref>Summers,Introduction to ''The Supernatural Omnibus'' (1931)</ref> [[E.
