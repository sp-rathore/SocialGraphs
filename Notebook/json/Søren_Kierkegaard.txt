It wants to be proclaimed by witnesses—that is, by persons who proclaim the teaching and also existentially express it.  The modern notion of a pastor as it is now is a complete misunderstanding.  Since pastors also presumably should express the essentially Christian, they have quite rightly discovered how to relax the requirement, abolish the ideal.  What is to be done now? Yes, now we must prepare for another tactical advance. First a detachment of poets; almost sinking under the demands of the ideal, with the glow of a certain unhappy love they set forth the ideal. Present-day pastors may now take second rank.  These religious poets must have the particular ability to do the kind of writing that helps people out into the current.  When this has happened, when a generation has grown up that from childhood on has received the pathos-filled impression of an existential expression of the ideal, the monastery and the genuine witnesses of the truth will both come again. This is how far behind the cause of Christianity is in our time. The first and foremost task is to create pathos, with the superiority of intelligence, imagination, penetration, and wit to guarantee pathos for the existential, which ‘the understanding’ has reduced to the ludicrous. | title = JP VI 6521  Pap.

Kierkegaard loved to walk them. In 1848, Kierkegaard wrote, \"I had real Christian satisfaction in the thought that, if there were no other, there was definitely one man in Copenhagen whom every poor person could freely accost and converse with on the street; that, if there were no other, there was one man who, whatever the society he most commonly frequented, did not shun contact with the poor, but greeted every maidservant he was acquainted with, every manservant, every common laborer.\"<ref>''The Point of View of My Work as An Author'': ''A Report to History'' by Søren Kierkegaard, written in 1848, published in 1859 by his brother Peter Kierkegaard Translated with introduction and notes by Walter Lowrie, 1962, Harper Torchbooks, pp. 48–49</ref> [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Our Lady's Church]] was at one end of the city, where [[Jacob Peter Mynster|Bishop Mynster]] preached the Gospel.

After Cato committed suicide, Caesar is supposed to have said, \"There Cato wrested from me my most beautiful victory, for I would have forgiven him.\" ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong p. 384, 481-485 he wrote more about this in 1847 and linked forgiveness to self-denial. <blockquote>In eternity you will not be asked how large a fortune you are leaving behind-the survivors ask about that; or about how many battles you won, about how sagacious you were, how powerful your influence-that after all, becomes your reputation for posterity. No, eternity will not ask about what worldly things you leave behind you in the world. But it will ask about what riches you have gathered in heaven, about how often you conquered your own mind, about what control you have exercised over yourself or whether you have been a slave, about how often you have mastered yourself in self-denial or whether you have never done so, about how often you in self-denial have been willing to make a sacrifice for a good cause or whether you were never willing, about how often you in self-denial have forgiven your enemy, whether seven times or seventy times seven times, about how often you have suffered, not for your own sake, for your own selfish interests’ sake, but what you in self-denial have suffered for God’s sake.

Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of You when it wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but of how You did save us!\"\n\nIn 1830, Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, Østre Borgerdyd Gymnasium, when the school was situated in Klarebodeme, where he studied Latin and history among other subjects. He went on to study theology at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He had little interest in historical works, philosophy dissatisfied him, and he couldn't see \"dedicating himself to [[Continental philosophy|Speculation]].\"<ref>Johannes Climacus by Søren Kierkegaard, p. 29</ref> He said, \"What I really need to do is to get clear about \"[[Praxis (process)|what am I to do]]\", not [[Knowledge|what I must know]].\" He wanted to \"lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge.\"<ref>Kierkegaard's Journals Gilleleie, 1 August 1835.

When Søren Kierkegaard was a little boy he \"was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He used to be called ‘fork’ by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaard’s house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an 'old-fashioned hospitality'\" (1876).<ref>Thomas H. Croxall, ''Glimpses & Impressions of Kierkegaard'', 1959, James Nisbet & Co. Ltd.

His question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant. He wrote the following in his ''Concluding Postscript'': \"With regard to the essential truth, a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable. If such a relation is assumed, it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit.\"<ref>''Concluding Postscript'', Hong trans., p. 247</ref> Goethe had said the same thing earlier in his book [[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]], \"Faust: Thou, who around the wide world wendest, Thou busy Spirit, how near I feel to thee!\nSpirit: Thou'rt like the Spirit which thou comprehendest, Not me!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14591/14591-h/14591-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Faust, by AUTHOR.|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nKierkegaard's journals were the source of many [[aphorism]]s credited to the philosopher. The following passage, from 1 August 1835, is perhaps his most oft-quoted aphorism and a key quote for existentialist studies:\n{{quote|\"What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\"}}\n\nHe wrote this way about indirect communication in the same journal entry.\n<blockquote>One must first learn to know himself before knowing anything else ([[Know thyself|γνῶθι σεαυτόν]]). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion — that irony of life, which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, \"After all, things cannot be otherwise,\" only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation's power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As in the case of a man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.\n*(Søren Kierkegaard's Journals & Papers IA Gilleleie, 1 August 1835)</blockquote>\n\nAlthough his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: \"Were I to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Dru|1938|p=354}}</ref>\n\n===Regine Olsen and graduation (1837–1841)===\n{{Main|Regine Olsen}}\n[[File:Regine Olsen (Emil Bærentzen).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of a young lady, over a black background.

Kierkegaard and Olsen met on 8 May 1837 and were instantly attracted to each other, but sometime around 11 August 1838 he had second thoughts. In his journals, Kierkegaard wrote idealistically about his love for her:\n{{Quote|You, sovereign queen of my heart, Regina, hidden in the deepest secrecy of my breast, in the fullness of my life-idea, there where it is just as far to heaven as to hell—unknown divinity! O, can I really believe the poets when they say that the first time one sees the beloved object he thinks he has seen her long before, that love like all knowledge is recollection, that love in the single individual also has its prophecies, its types, its myths, its Old Testament. Everywhere, in the face of every girl, I see features of your beauty...

He soon felt disillusioned about his prospects. He broke off the engagement on 11 August 1841, though it is generally believed that the two were deeply in love. In his journals, Kierkegaard mentions his belief that his \"melancholy\" made him unsuitable for marriage, but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear.<ref name=\"GarffBio\">{{harvnb|Garff|2005}}</ref><ref name=\"HannayBio\">{{harvnb|Hannay|2003}}</ref><ref>See ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong trans., p. 195ff and 423ff Here he wrote about his conflict with his own guilt.

What then is my guilt? That I did not understand it sooner. What is your responsibility? Every possible consequence of her life. Why every possible one, for this certainly seems to be exaggeration? Because here it is not a matter of an event but of an act and an ethical responsibility, the consequence of which I do not dare to arm against by being courageous, for courage in this case means opening oneself to them. What can serve as your excuse? ...<blockquote>Think of the first word and the hyphen of a compound word, and now suppose that you do not know any more about how it hangs together-what will you say then? You will say that the word is not finished, something is lacking. It is the same with the one who loves. That the relationship came to a break cannot be directly seen; it can be known only in the sense of the past. But the one who loves does not want to know the past, because he abides, and to abide is in the direction of the future. Therefore the one who loves expresses that the relationship, which the other call a break, is a relationship that has not yet finished. But it is still not a break because something is missing. Therefore it depends on how the relationship is viewed, and the one who loves-abides. So it came to a break. It was a quarrel that separated the two; yet one of them made the break, saying, \"It is all finished between us.\" But the one who loves abides, saying, \"It is not all finished between us; we are still in the middle of the sentence; it is only the sentence that is not finished.\" Is this not the way it is? What is the difference between a fragment and an unfinished sentence? In order to call something a fragment, one must know that nothing more is coming; If one does not know this, one says that the sentence is not yet finished. When from the angle of the past it is settled that there is no more to come, we say, \"It is a fragment\"; from the angle of the future, waiting for the next part, we say, \"The sentence is not finished; something is still missing.\" …. Get rid of the past, drown it in the oblivion of eternity by abiding in love-then the end is the beginning, and there is no break!

Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard's central writings on religion have included ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]'', the latter of which is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author's own; examples include the writers of the [[Federalist Papers]] and the [[Anti-Federalist Papers]].  Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{cite book|last1=Meister|first1=edited by Chad|last2=Copan|first2=Paul|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of religion|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=9780415782951|edition=Second Edition.}}</ref>  After ''[[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]'', his 1841 [[doctoral thesis]] under {{ill|da|Frederik Christian Sibbern}},<ref>Jon Stewart, [http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle/j$002fkier.1997.1997.issue-1$002f9783110243994.117$002f9783110243994.117.xml \"Kierkegaard's Phenomenology of Despair in The Sickness Unto Death\"], ''Kierkegaard Studies Yearbook'' 1997:117–143.</ref> he wrote his first book under the pseudonym \"Johannes Climacus\" (after [[John Climacus]]) between 1841–1842.

Kierkegaard stressed the \"how\" of Christianity as well as the \"how\" of book reading in his works rather than the \"what\".<ref>''The Racine Daily Journal'', Saturday Afternoon, 11 November 1905, p. 7</ref>\n\nThree months after the publication of ''Either/Or'', 16 May 1843, he published ''[[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'' and continued to publish discourses along with his [[pseudonymous]] books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard's own name and are available as ''[[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses]]'' today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the ''Edifying Discourses''; however, in 1990, [[Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library|Howard V. and Edna H. Hong]] translated the works again but called them the ''Upbuilding Discourses''. The word \"upbuilding\" was more in line with Kierkegaard's thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian [[deliberations]]<ref>See Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'' 1847 for a more thorough discussion of what he meant by deliberating. Pages 306ff Hong translation</ref> about [[Works of Love|works of love]].<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 trans., p. 3, 210ff,  301-303</ref> An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn't the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be \"upbuilding\", which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down in order to build up. Kierkegaard said: \"Although this little book (which is called \"[[Conversation|discourses]],\" not [[sermon]]s, because its author does not have [[Sacred tradition|authority]] to ''preach'', \"upbuilding discourses,\" not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a ''teacher'') wishes to be only what it is, a [[wiktionary:superfluity|superfluity]], and desires only to remain in hiding\".<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Søren Kierkegaard 1843–1844, 1990 by Howard V. Hong, Princeton University Press, p. 5</ref>\n\nOn 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio, was about Abraham wishing he did not have to sacrifice his son, [[Isaac]], to show his love for God. Kierkegaard compared Abraham's situation with that of [[Agamemnon]] who saw it as his duty to sacrifice his daughter, [[Iphigenia]], to show his love for the Greek state. Abraham couldn't understand how sacrificing Isaac would be a good gift while Agamemnon was certain that sacrificing Iphigenia would be a good gift to the Greek state. ''[[Repetition (Kierkegaard)|Repetition]]'' is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl ([[Regine Olsen]]) to God. He tries to see if the new science of [[psychology]] can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'' under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others.<ref>''Fear and Trembling'', Hong trans., 1983, Translator's introduction, p. xiv</ref> These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.\n\nKierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, \"it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon ''how'' one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is [[Temperament|constituted]] is indeed decisive.\"<ref>Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, p. 59-60</ref> God's love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'', p. 122-123, ''Concluding Postscript'', pp. 322–323, 242, ''Works of Love'', Hong trans., p. 13.</ref>\n\nDuring 1844, he published [[Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|two]], [[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|three]], and [[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844|four]] more [[Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses|upbuilding discourses]] just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, [[philosophers]] and [[historians]] were all engaged in [[debating]] about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the \"single individual\" who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for \"that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call ''my'' reader\"<ref>''Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses'', Hong trans., p. 295</ref> The single individual must put what is [[understood]] to use or it will be lost. [[Human self-reflection|Reflection]] can take an individual only so far before the [[imagination]] begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.\n\nHe also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', ''[[Prefaces]]'' and ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'' and finished the year up with ''[[Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844]]''. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an [[opinion]] held by one group and differently by another no matter how many [[Scientific demonstration|demonstrations]] are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the [[fruit of the Holy Spirit]] real because love and joy are always just possibilities. [[Christendom]] wanted to define God's [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes]] once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong trans., pp. 363–368.</ref>\n\nKierkegaard believed \"each [[generation]] has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being [[Theory of everything#Theory of everything and philosophy|everything]] to previous and succeeding generations\".<ref>''The Concept of Anxiety'', p. 7, 20 and ''Either/Or Part II'', Hong trans., p. 342</ref> In an earlier book he had said, \"to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning\",<ref>''Either/Or Part II'', Hong trans., p. 31</ref> and in another, \"no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning\", \"no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.\"<ref>Fear and Trembling, pp. 121–123.</ref> He was against the [[Hegelian]] idea of [[Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies)|mediation]]<ref>''Either/Or Part II'', Hong trans., pp. 170–176, ''The Concept of Anxiety'', p. 11-13 including note,  Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 33, 105, 198, 369, 400ff, Mediation looks fairly good on paper.

Respecting the nature of the two, he expressly declared himself in this work, where he once more adopts a Fichtian starting-point: “All knowledge rests on the harmony of an objective with a subjective” In the common sense of the words this would be allowed; absolute unity, where the Notion and the reality are undistinguished in the perfected Idea, is the Absolute alone, or God; all else contains an element of discord between the objective and subjective. “We may give the name of nature to the entire objective content of our knowledge the entire subjective content, on the other hand, is called the ego or intelligence.” They are in themselves identical and presupposed as identical. The relation of nature to intelligence is given by Schelling thus: “Now if all knowledge has two poles which mutually presuppose and demand one another, there must be two fundamental sciences, and it must be impossible to start from the one pole without being driven to the other”. Thus nature is impelled to spirit, and spirit to nature; either may be given the first place, and both must come to pass. “If the objective is made the chief” we have the natural sciences as result, and; “the necessary tendency” the end, of all natural science thus is to pass from nature to intelligence. This is the meaning of the effort to connect natural phenomena with theory. The highest perfection of natural science would be the perfect spiritualization of all natural laws into laws of intuitive perception and thought.\" Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) [https://archive.org/stream/lectureshistoryp03hegeuoft#page/514/mode/2up  ''Lectures on the Philosophy of History Vol 3'' 1837 translated by ES Haldane and Francis H. Simson) first translated 1896 p. 516-517]</blockquote></ref> These are the \"magnitudes\" of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847, Hong p. 306-308; Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong trans., pp. 301, 160–161, 225ff.</ref> This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: {{Quotation|Thinking for one’s self is to seek the chief touchstone of truth in one’s self (''id est'', in one’s own reason); and the maxim, to think for one’s self at all times is Enlightening. Thereto belongs not just so much, as those may imagine who take knowledge, to be enlightening; as it is rather a negative principle in the use of one’s cognoscitive faculty, and he, who is very rich in knowledge, is often the least enlightened in the use of  it. To exercise one’s own reason, means nothing more, than, relatively to every thing which one is to suppose, to question one’s self. Immanuel Kant, ''What it Means to Orient One’s Self In Thinking'' 1786\n\nWorldly worry always seeks to lead a human being into the small-minded unrest of comparisons, away from the lofty calmness of simple thoughts. To be clothed, then, means to be a human being-and therefore to be well clothed. Worldly worry is preoccupied with clothes and dissimilarity of clothes.  Should not the invitation to [[Matthew 6:28|learn from the lilies]] be welcome to everyone just as the reminder is useful to him! Alas, those great, uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts, are more and more forgotten, perhaps entirely forgotten in the weekday and worldly life of comparisons. The one human being compares himself with others, the one generation compares itself with the other, and thus the heaped up pile of comparisons overwhelms a person. As the ingenuity and busyness increase, there come to be more and more in each generation who slavishly work a whole lifetime far down in the low underground regions of comparisons. Indeed, just as miners never see the light of day, so these unhappy people never come to see the light: those uplifting, simple thoughts, those first thoughts about how glorious it is to be a human being. And up there in the higher regions of comparison, smiling vanity plays its false game and deceives the happy ones so that they receive no impression from those lofty, simple thoughts, those first thoughts.\n*Søren Kierkegaard, (1847) ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong 188-189}}\n\n===Hidden inwardness===\nKierkegaard believed God comes to each individual mysteriously.<ref>''Concluding Unscientific Postscript'', Hong trans., 1992, p. 243</ref><ref>''Journals of Søren Kierkegaard'' VIII1A4</ref> Kierkegaard published ''[[Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions]]'' (first called ''Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life'', in David F.

The ''Stages'' is a rewrite of ''Either/Or'' which Kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in ''Stages'' he predicted \"that two-thirds of the book's readers will quit before they are halfway through, out of boredom they will throw the book away.\"<ref>''Stages on Life's Way'', Hong trans., p. 398</ref> He knew he was writing books but had no idea who was reading them.

In 1851 he further explained himself in his ''Journal''. \"What I have understood as the task of the authorship has been done.

You can keep the secret to yourself also when you profess your faith with bold confidence, and when you lie weak on your sickbed and cannot move a limb when you cannot even move your tongue, you can still have the secret within you. But the originality of faith is related in turn to the originality of Christianity.

Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 279-280, 277</blockquote><blockquote>How much that is hidden may still reside in a person, or how much may still reside hidden! How inventive is hidden inwardness in hiding itself and in deceiving or evading others, the hidden inwardness that preferred that no one would suspect its existence, modestly afraid of being seen and mortally afraid of being entirely disclosed! Is it not so that the one person never completely understands the other? But if he does not understand him completely, then of course it is always possible that the most indisputable thing could still have a completely different explanation that would, note well, be the true explanation, since an assumption can indeed explain a great number of instances very well and thereby confirm its truth and yet show itself to be untrue as soon as the instance comes along that it cannot explain-and it would indeed be possible that this instance or this somewhat more precise specification could come even at the last moment. Therefore all calm and, in the intellectual sense, dispassionate observers, who eminently know how to delve searchingly and penetratingly into the inner being, these very people judge with such infinite caution or refrain from it entirely because, enriched by observation, they have a developed conception of the enigmatic world of the hidden, and because as observers they have learned to rule over their passions. Only superficial, impetuous passionate people, who do not understand themselves and for that reason naturally are unaware that they do not know others, judge precipitously. Those with insight, those who know never do this.

A person makes Christian humility and self-denial empty when he indeed denies himself in one respect but does not have the courage to do it decisively, and therefore he takes care to be understood in his humility and self-denial – which certainly is not self-denial. Therefore, in order to be able to praise love, self-denial is required inwardly and self-sacrificing outwardly. If, then, someone undertakes to praise love and is asked whether it is actually out of love on his part that he does it, the answer must be: “No one else can decide this for certain; it is possible that it is vanity, pride-in short, something bad, but it is also possible that it is love.”  Soren Kierkegaard, 1847, ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 374</blockquote>}}\n \nKierkegaard wrote his ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'' in 1846 and here he tried to explain the intent of the first part of his authorship.<ref name=\"PtView\">''The Point of View of My Work as An Author'': Lowrie, pp. 142–143</ref><ref>See also ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments'', Volume I by Johannes Climacus, edited by Søren Kierkegaard, 1846 – Edited and Translated by Howard V.

The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he would ever be able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. Møller was also a contributor to and editor of ''[[Corsaren|The Corsair]]'', a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing.

A critique of the novel ''Two Ages'' (in some translations ''Two Generations'') written by [[Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd]], Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of [[modernity]] and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that \"the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion [...] The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|2001|p=86}}</ref> In this, Kierkegaard attacked the [[conformism|conformity]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of individuals into \"the crowd\"<ref name=\"LitRev\">{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|2001}}</ref> which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame?<ref>Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 81-83</ref>  {{Quotation|A useless and perhaps futile conflict goes on often enough in the world, when the poor person says to the wealthy person, \"Sure, it’s easy for you-you are free from worry about making a living.\" Would to God that the poor person would really understand how the Gospel is much more kindly disposed to him, is treating him equally and more lovingly. Truly, the Gospel does not let itself be deceived into taking sides with anyone against someone else, with someone who is wealthy against someone who is poor, or with someone who is poor against someone who is wealthy. Among individuals in the world, the conflict of disconnected comparison is frequently carried on about dependence and independence, about the happiness of being independent and the difficulty of being dependent. And yet, yet human language has not ever, and thought has not ever, invented a more beautiful symbol of independence than the poor bird of the air. And yet, yet no speech can be more curious than to say that it must be very bad and very heavy to be-light as the bird! To be dependent on one’s treasure-that is dependence and hard and heavy slavery; to be dependent on God, completely dependent-that is independence.  Søren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 180-181}}\n\nAs part of his analysis of the \"crowd\", Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had \"lost its way\" by recognizing \"the crowd,\" as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to \"the truth.\" Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn't love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual.

His first work in this period was ''[[Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits]]'' which was made up of three parts.<ref name=\"HannayBio\" /> It included ''[[Søren Kierkegaard bibliography|Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing]]'', ''What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air'',<ref>This book was rewritten May 14, 1849</ref> and ''The Gospel of Sufferings''. These questions are asked, What does it mean to be a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from \"upbuilding ([[Edification|Edifying]]) discourses\" to \"[[wiktionary:Christian|Christian]] [[discourse]]s\", however, he still maintains that these are not \"''[[sermon]]s''\".<ref>Upbuilding (Edifying) Discourses in Various Spirits, Christian Discourses'' p. 213ff</ref>  A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 230-247, 248-288</ref> Later, in 1849, he wrote [[wikt:devotion#English|devotional]] discourses and Godly discourses.<blockquote>Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one’s might-but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God-for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do-only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness. ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p. 277</blockquote>\n\n{{Quotation|While the Savior of the world sighs, \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me,\" the [[Penitent thief|repentant robber]] humbly understands, but still also as a relief, that it is not God who has abandoned him, but it is he who has abandoned God, and, repenting, he says to the one crucified with him: Remember me when you come into your kingdom. It is a heavy human suffering to reach for God’s mercy in the anxiety of death and with belated repentance at the moment of despicable death, but yet the repentant robber finds relief when he compares his suffering with the superhuman suffering of being abandoned by God. To be abandoned by God, that indeed means to be without a task. It means to be deprived of the final task that every human being always has, the task of patience, the task that has its ground in God’s not having abandoned the sufferer. Hence Christ’s suffering is superhuman and his patience superhuman, so that no human being can grasp either the one or the other. Although it is beneficial that we speak quite humanly of Christ’s suffering, if we speak of it merely as if he were the human being who has suffered the most, it is blasphemy, because although his suffering is human, it is also superhuman, and there is an eternal chasmic abyss between his suffering and the human being’s.  Søren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', Hong p.280}}\n\n''[[Works of Love]]''<ref>Kierkegaard wrote Works of Love in two series; just as he had his Either/Or and either/or category at the beginning of his writings so he kept to the same category throughout his writings. The first series, ending on page 204 Hong 1995 translation, is parallel to his first writings 1843-1846 and the second is his serious address to single individuals interested in striving to become a Christian. (1847-1855)</ref> followed these discourses on (September 29, 1847). Both books were authored under his own name. It was written under the themes \"Love covers a multitude of sins\" and \"Love builds up.\" ([[1 Peter]] 4:8 and [[1 Corinthians 8]]:1) Kierkegaard believed that \"all human speech, even divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] is essentially [[metaphorical]] speech\".<ref>''Works of Love'', Hong p. 209ff</ref> \"To build up\" is a metaphorical expression. One can never be all human or all spirit, one must be both. {{Quotation|\nWhen it is said, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” this contains what is presupposed, that every person loves himself. Thus, Christianity which by no means begins, as do those high flying thinkers, without presuppositions, nor with a flattering presupposition, presupposes this. Dare we then deny that it is as Christianity presupposes? But on the other hand, it is possible for anyone to misunderstand Christianity, as if it were its intention to teach what worldly sagacity unanimously-alas, and yet contentiously-teaches, “that everyone is closest to himself.” Is it possible for anyone to misunderstand this, as if it were Christianity’s intention to proclaim self-love as a prescriptive right? Indeed on the contrary, it is Christianity’s intention to wrest self-love away from us human beings. Soren Kierkegaard ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 17\n\nAll human speech, even the divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical [''overfot'', carried over] speech. And this is quite in order or in the order of things and of existence,  since a human being, even if from the moment of birth his is a spirit, still does not become conscious of himself as a spirit until later and thus has sensately-psychically acted out a certain part of his life prior to this. But this first portion is not to be cast aside when the spirit awakens any more than the awakening of the spirit in contrast to the sensate-physical announces itself in a sensate-physical way. On the contrary, the first portion is taken over –[''overtage''] by the spirit  and, used in this way, is thus made the basis –it becomes the metaphorical. Therefore, the spiritual person and the sensate person say the same thing; yet there is an infinite difference, since the latter has no intimation of the secret of the metaphorical words although he is using the same words, but not in their metaphorical sense.\n\nThere is a world of difference between the two; the one has made the transition or let himself be carried over to the other side, while the other remains on this side; yet they have the connection that both are using the same words. The person in whom the spirit has awakened does not as a consequence abandon the visible-world. Although conscious of himself as spirit, he continues to remain in the visible world and to be visible to the senses, in the same way he also remains in the language, except that his language is the metaphorical language!\n\nBut the metaphorical words are of course not brand-new words but are the already given words. Just as the spirit is invisible, so also is its language a secret, and the secret lies in its using the same words as the child and the simpleminded person but using them metaphorically, whereby the spirit denies the sensate or sensate-physical way. The difference is by no means a noticeable difference. For this reason we rightfully regard it as a sign of false spirituality to parade a noticeable difference-which is merely sensate, whereas  the spirit’s manner is the metaphor’s quiet, whispering secret – for the person who has ears to hear. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847, Hong 1995 p. 209-210\n\nLove builds up by [[presupposition|presupposing]] that love is present. Have you not experienced this yourself, my listener? If anyone has ever spoken to you in such a way or treated in in such a way that you really felt built up, this was because you very vividly perceived how he presupposed love to be in you. Wisdom is a being-for-itself quality; power, talent, knowledge, etc. are likewise being-for-itself qualities. To be wise does not mean to presuppose that others are wise; on the contrary, it may be very wise and true if the truly wise person assumes that far from all people are wise. But love is not a being-for-itself quality but a quality by which or in which you are for others. Loving means to presuppose love in others. Soren Kierkegaard ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 222-224}}\n\nLater, in the same book, Kierkegaard deals with the question of sin and forgiveness. He uses the same text he used earlier in ''[[Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843]]'' ''Love hides a multitude of sins''. ([[1 Peter]] 4:8). He asks if \"one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins\".<ref>Works of Love, Hong p. 288ff</ref> {{Quotation|But the one who takes away the consciousness of sin and gives the consciousness of forgiveness instead-he indeed takes away the heavy burden and gives the light one in its place. Soren Kierkegaard, 1847 ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirit''s,  Hong p. 246\n\nThe one who loves sees the sin he forgives, but he believes that forgiveness takes it away. This cannot be seen, whereas the sin can indeed be seen; on the other hand, if the sin did not exist to be seen, it could not be forgiven either. Just as one by faith believes the unseen into what is seen, so the one who loves by forgiveness believes away what is seen. Both are faith. Blessed is the believer, he believes what he cannot see; blessed is the one who loves, he believes away that which he indeed can see! Who can believe this? The one who loves can do it. But why is forgiveness so rare? Is it not because faith in the power of forgiveness is so meager and so rare? Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', 1847 Hong p. 289-295}}\n\nIn 1848 he published ''[[Christian Discourses]]'' under his own name and ''[[The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress]]'' under the pseudonym Inter et Inter. ''[[Christian Discourses]]'' deals the same theme as ''[[The Concept of Anxiety]]'', [[angst]]. The text is the Gospel of [[Matthew 6]] verses 24-34. This was the same passage he had used in his ''What We Learn From the Lilies in the Field and From the Birds of the Air'' of 1847. He wrote: {{Quotation|A man who but rarely, and then only cursorily, concerns himself with his relationship to God, hardly thinks or dreams that he has so closely to do with God, or that God is so close to him, that there exists a reciprocal relationship between him and God, the stronger a man is, the weaker God is, the weaker a man is, the stronger God is in him. Every one who assumes that a God exists naturally thinks of Him as the strongest, as He eternally is, being the Almighty who creates out of nothing, and for whom all the creation is as nothing; but such a man hardly thinks of the possibility of a reciprocal relationship. And yet for God, the infinitely strongest, there is an obstacle; He has posited it Himself, yea, He has lovingly, with incomprehensible love posited it Himself; for He posited it and posits it every time a man comes into existence, when He in His love makes to be something directly in [[apposition]] to Himself. Oh, marvelous omnipotence of love! A man cannot bear that his ‘creations’ should be directly in apposition to Himself, and so he speaks of them in a tone of disparagement as his ‘creations’. But God who creates out of nothing, who almightily takes from nothing and says, ‘[[Copula (linguistics)|Be]]’, lovingly adjoins, ‘Be something even in apposition to me.’ Marvellous love, even His omnipotence is under the sway of love! Soren Kierkegaard, ''Christian Discourses'', 1848 Lowrie 1940, 1961 p. 132}}\n\nKierkegaard tried to explain his prolific use of pseudonyms again in ''[[The Point of View of My Work as an Author]]'', his autobiographical explanation for his writing style. The book was finished in 1848, but not published until after his death by his brother Christian Peter Kierkegaard.  [[Walter Lowrie (author)|Walter Lowrie]] mentioned Kierkegaard's \"profound religious experience of Holy Week 1848\" as a turning point from \"indirect communication\" to \"direct communication\" regarding Christianity.<ref>''Christian Discourses'', translated by Walter Lowrie 1940, 1961 Author's Preface, p. v and Point of View, Lowrie p. 83-84</ref> However, Kierkegaard stated that he was a religious author throughout all of his writings and that his aim was to discuss \"the problem ‘of becoming a Christian’, with a direct [[polemic]] against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom.\"<ref>POV p. 5-6 Introduction Lowrie</ref> He expressed the illusion this way in his 1848 \"Christian [[Public speaking|Address]]\", ''Thoughts Which Wound From Behind – for Edification''. {{Quotation|Oh, in the customary course of life there is so much to lull a man to sleep, to teach him to say, ‘Peace and no danger.’ It is for this cause we go into the house of God, to be awakened out of sleep and to be riven away from the enchantments. But then again when there is so much in the house of God to lull us! Even that which in itself is arousing, such as thoughts, reflections, ideas, can by custom and monotony lose all their significance, just as a spring can lose the resilience which makes it what it is. So, then (to approach nearer to the subject of this discourse), it is right, reasonable, and a plain duty, to invite men, over and over again, to come to the house of the Lord, to summon them to it. But one may become so accustomed to hearing this invitation that one may lose all sense of its significance, so that at last one steps away and it ends with the invitation preaching the church empty. Or one may become so accustomed to hearing this invitation that it develops false ideas in those that come, makes us self-important in our own thoughts, that we are not as they who remain away, makes us self-satisfied, secure, because it envelops us in a delusion, as though, since we are so urgently invited, God were in need of us, as though it were not we who in fear and trembling should reflect what He may require of us, as though it were not we who should sincerely thank God that He will have dealings with us, that He will suffer and permit us to approach Him, suffer that we presume to believe that He cares for us, that without being ashamed He will be known as one who is called our God and our Farther. So concerning this matter let us for once talk differently, in talking of these words of the preacher: ''Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of the Lord''.

He wrote ''The Lily in the Field and the Bird of the Air. Three Devotional Discourses'', ''Three Discourses at the Communion on Fridays'' and ''Two Ethical-Religious Essays.'' The first thing any child finds in life is the external world of nature. This is where God placed his natural teachers. He's been writing about confession and now openly writes about [[Holy Communion]] which is generally preceded by confession. This he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in ''[[Either/Or]]'' and the highest good [[peace]] in the discourse of that same book. His goal has always been to help people become religious but specifically Christian religious. He summed his position up earlier in his book, ''The Point of View of My Work as an Author'', but this book was not published until 1859. {{Quotation|In the month of December 1845 the manuscript of the ''Concluding Postscript'' was completely finished, and, as my custom was, I had delivered the whole of it at once to Lune [the printer]-which the suspicious do not have to believe on my word, since Luno’s account-book is there to prove it. This work constitutes the turning-point in my whole activity as an author, inasmuch as it presents the ‘problem’, how to become a Christian.\n\nIn a Christian sense simplicity is not the point of departure from which one goes on to become interesting, witty, profound, poet, philosopher, &c. No, the very contrary. Here is where one begins (with the interesting, &c.) and becomes simpler and simpler, attaining simplicity.

No, my contention has been this: I know what Christianity is, my imperfection as a Christian I myself fully recognize-but I know what Christianity is.

Such a person protests, perhaps in even stronger terms, how this relapse tortures and torments him, how it brings him to despair: he swears, 'I will never forgive myself.'

Therefore one can ask an apostle, one can ask a Christian, \"What is truth?\" and in answer to the question the apostle and the Christian will point to Christ and say: Look at him, learn from him, he was the truth. This means that truth in the sense in which Christ is the truth is not a sum of statements, not a definition etc., but a life. The being of truth is not the direct redoubling of being in relation to thinking, which gives only thought-being, safeguards thinking only against being a brain-figment that is not, guarantees validity to thinking, that what is thought is-that is, has validity. No, the being of truth is the redoubling of truth within yourself, within me, within him, that your life, my life, his life is approximately the being of the truth in the striving for it, just as the truth was in Christ a life, for he was the truth. And therefore, Christianly understood, truth is obviously not to know the truth but to be the truth. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Practice in Christianity'', Hong p. 205 (1850)}}\n\nHe now pointedly referred to the acting single individual in his next three publications; ''[[For Self-Examination]]'', ''[[Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays]]'', and in 1852 ''[[Judge for Yourselves!]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowrie|1942|pp=6–9, 24, 30, 40, 49, 74–77, 89}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lowrie|1968}}</ref> ''Judge for Yourselves''! was published posthumously in 1876.\n\nKierkegaard began his 1843 book ''Either/Or'' with a question: \"Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?\"<ref>Either/Or Part I Swenson title page</ref> He didn't want to devote himself to [[Thought]] or [[Speculative reason|Speculation]] like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins the process of education with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or a balance between the two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong trans., pp. 95–96.</ref> He was against endless reflection with no [[Passion (emotion)|passion]] involved. But at the same time he did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his ''Journals''.<ref name=\"Søren Kierkegaard 1851\"/>\n\nSchelling put Nature first and Hegel put Reason first but Kierkegaard put the human being first and the choice first in his writings. He makes an argument against Nature here and points out that most single individuals begin life as spectators of the visible world and work toward knowledge of the invisible world. {{Quotation|<blockquote>Is it a perfection on the part of the bird that in hard times it sits and dies of hunger and knows of nothing at all to do, that, dazed, it lets itself fall to the ground and dies? Usually we do not talk this way. When a sailor lies down in the boat and lets matters take their course in the storm and knows nothing to do, we do not speak of his perfection. But when a doughty sailor knows how to steer, when he works against the storm with ingenuity, with strength, and with perseverance, when he works himself out of the danger, we admire him. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits'', 1847, Hong p. 198</blockquote><blockquote>Suppose that it were not one man who traveled from [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Jericho to Jerusalem]], but there were two, and both of them were assaulted by robbers and maimed, and no traveler passed by. Suppose, then, that one of them did nothing but moan, while the other forgot and surmounted his own suffering in order to speak comfortingly, friendly words or, what involved great pain, dragged himself to some water in order to fetch the other a refreshing drink. Or suppose that they were both bereft of speech, but one of them in his silent prayer sighed to God also for the other-was he then not merciful? If someone has cut off my hands, then I cannot play the zither, and if someone has cut off my feet, then I cannot dance, and if I lie crippled on the shore, then I cannot throw myself into the sea in order to rescue another person’s life, and if I myself am lying with a broken arm or leg, then I cannot plunge into the flames to save another’s life-but I can still be merciful. I have often pondered how a painter might portray mercifulness, but I have decided that it cannot be done. As soon as a painter is to do it, it becomes dubious whether it is [[Mercy|mercifulness]] or it is something else.\n*Soren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong 1995 p. 324 \n</blockquote>''Seek Ye First God’s Kingdom And His Righteousness'' [[Matthew 6:33]]\nBut what does this mean, what have I to do, or what sort of effort is it that can be said to seek or pursue the kingdom of God? Shall I try to get a job suitable to my talents and powers in order thereby to exert an influence? No, thou shalt ''first'' seek God’s kingdom. Shall I then give all my fortune to the poor? No, thou shalt ''first'' seek God’s kingdom. Shall I then go out to proclaim this teaching to the world? No, thou shalt ''first'' seek God’s kingdom. But then in a certain sense it is nothing I shall do. Yes, certainly, in a certain it is nothing, thou shalt in the deepest sense make thyself nothing, become nothing before God, learn to keep silent; in this silence is the beginning, which is, ''first'' to seek God’s kingdom. In this wise, a godly wise, one gets to the beginning by going, in a sense, backwards. The beginning is not that with which one begins, but at which one arrives at the beginning backwards. The beginning is this art of ''becoming'' silent; for to be silent, as nature is, is not an art. It is man’s superiority over the beasts to be able to speak; but in relation to God it can easily become the ruin of man who is able to speak that he is too willing to speak. God is love, man is (as one says to a child) a silly little thing, even so far as his own wellbeing is concerned. Only in much [[fear and trembling]] can a man walk with God; in much fear and trembling. But to talk in much fear and trembling is difficult for as a sense of dread causes the bodily voice to fail; so also does much fear and trembling render the voice mute in silence. This the true man of prayer knows well, and he who was not the true man of prayer learned precisely this by [[praying]]. \n* Søren Kierkegaard, ''Christian Discourses'', 1848 Lowrie 1940, 1961 p. 322</blockquote>}}\n\n[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] makes a related argument against reason in his 1945 book ''The Divine and the Human''.<ref>''The Divine and the Human'', by Nicolai Berdyaev 1945 p. 30.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/divinehuman00berd#page/n35/mode/2up|title=Divine and the human|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Attack upon the State Church and death===\n[[File:Rundetårn view 2 new version.jpg|thumb|alt=A building. \"Vor Frue Kirke\" (completed 1829) The Lutheran Catedral in Copenhagen.|Kierkegaard mounted an attack on Christian institutions in his final years.

These pamphlets are now included in Kierkegaard's ''Attack Upon Christendom''<ref>''Attack Upon Christendom'' by Søren Kierkegaard, 1854–1855, translated by Walter Lowrie, 1944, 1968, Princeton University Press</ref> ''The Instant'', was translated into German as well as other European languages in 1861 and again in 1896.<ref>''Attack Upon Christendom'' Translated by Walter Lowrie 1944, 1968 introduction page xi</ref>\n\nKierkegaard first moved to action after Professor (soon bishop) [[Hans Lassen Martensen]] gave a speech in church in which he called the recently deceased Bishop [[Jacob Peter Mynster]] a \"truth-witness, one of the authentic truth-witnesses.\"<ref name=\"Elmer\" /> Kierkegaard explained, in his first article, that Mynster's death permitted him—at last—to be frank about his opinions. He later wrote that all his former output had been \"preparations\" for this attack, postponed for years waiting for two preconditions: 1) both his father and bishop Mynster should be dead before the attack and 2) he should himself have acquired a name as a famous theologic writer.<ref>For instance in \"Hvad Christus dømmer om officiel Christendom.\" 1855.</ref> Kierkegaard's father had been Mynster's close friend, but Søren had long come to see that Mynster's conception of Christianity was mistaken, demanding too little of its adherents. Kierkegaard strongly objected to the portrayal of Mynster as a 'truth-witness'.\n\nKierkegaard described the hope the witness to the truth has in 1847. {{Quotation|When the concepts are shaken in an upheaval that is more terrible than an earthquake, when the truth is hated and its witness persecuted-what then? Must the witness submit to the world? Yes. But does that mean all is lost? No, on the contrary. We remain convinced of this, and thus no proof is needed, for if it is not so, then such a person is not a witness to the truth either. Therefore we are reassured that even in the last moments such a person has retained a youthful recollection of what the youth expected, and he therefore has examined himself and his relationship before God to see whether the defect could lie in him, whether it was not possible for it to become, as the youth had expected, something he perhaps now desired most for the sake of the world-namely, that truth has the victory and good has its reward in the world.  Woe to the one who presumptuously, precipitously, and impetuously brings the horror of confusion into more peaceable situations; but woe, also, to the one who, if it was necessary, did not have the bold confidence to turn everything around the second time when it was turned around the first time!

He stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He said to Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.<ref name=\"HannayBio\" /><ref>Søren Kierkegaard ''Attack Upon \"Christendom\"'', 1854–1855, Lowrie 1944, pp. 37, 6, 31, 27–28.</ref>\n\n[[File:KierkegaardGrave.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of a grave, with trees, bushes, and a fence in the background and foreground.

He was interred in the [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Kirkegård]] in the [[Nørrebro]] section of Copenhagen. At Kierkegaard's funeral, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting Kierkegaard's burial by the official church. Lund maintained that Kierkegaard would never have approved, had he been alive, as he had broken from and denounced the institution. Lund was later fined for his disruption of a funeral.<ref name=\"GarffBio\" />\n\nKierkegaard's pamphlets and polemical books, including ''The Moment'', criticized several aspects of church formalities and politics.<ref>{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|1998b}}</ref> According to Kierkegaard, the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to God. He stressed that \"Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual.\"<ref name=\"Malik\">{{harvnb|Kirmmse|2000}}</ref> Furthermore, since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State's bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members.

The Church noted that dissent was \"something foreign to the national mind.\" On 5 April 1855 the Church enacted new policies: \"every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman, and is not, as formerly, bound to the one whose parishioner he is\". In March 1857, compulsory infant [[baptism]] was abolished. Debates sprang up over the King's position as the head of the Church and over whether to adopt a constitution. [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]] objected to having any written rules. Immediately following this announcement the \"agitation occasioned by Kierkegaard\" was mentioned. Kierkegaard was accused of [[Valentin Weigel|Weigelianism]] and [[John Nelson Darby|Darbyism]], but the article continued to say, \"One great truth has been made prominent, viz (namely): That there exists a worldly-minded clergy; that many things in the Church are rotten; that all need daily repentance; that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the Church or her pastors.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>''Evangelical Christendom'', Volumes 11–12 J.S.

This is, however, far from the case. For those views which upheld the category of existence and personality, in opposition to this abstract idealism, did not do this in the sense of an either—or, but in that of a both—and.

We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given conditions.\" William James, ''A Pluralistic Universe'', 1909, p. 244<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/apluralisticuni01jamegoog#page/n258/mode/2up William James, ''A Pluralistic Universe'', 1909] Longmans, Green, and Co.

The one who says, \"I will, sir,\" is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing in the direction of the good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if he took a step forward, and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking a step backward. The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Works of Love'', Hong p. 93-94 (1850)</blockquote>\n\nOne thing James did have in common with Kierkegaard was respect for the single individual, and their respective comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: \"A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone's power to become what he is, a single individual; no one is prevented from being a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a crowd around oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual.\"<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''On the Dedication to \"That Single Individual\"''</ref> In his book ''A Pluralistic Universe'', James stated that, \"Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label.

Some philosophers think of it as having one meaning: the sense in which we say that this book exists, that God does or does not exist, that there exist odd numbers between 8 and 20, that a characteristic like redness exists as well as things that are red, that the American government exists as well as the physical building in which the government is housed, that minds exist as well as bodies. And when the word “exists” is construed in this unambiguous way, many famous disputes in the history of philosophy and theology appear to be quite straightforward. Theists affirm that God exists while atheists deny the very same statement; materialists say that matter exists while some idealists think that it is illusory; nominalists, as they are called, deny the existence of characteristics like redness while platonic realists affirm it; some kinds of behaviorists deny that there are minds inside bodies. There is, however, a tendency among some philosophers, to insist that the word “exists” is ambiguous and therefore that some of these disputes are not disputes at all but merely the results of mutual misunderstanding, of a failure to see that certain things are said to exist in one sense while others exist in another. One of the outstanding efforts of this kind in the twentieth century occurs in the early writings of realists who maintained that only concrete things in space and time exist, while abstract characteristics of things or relations between them should be said to subsist. This is sometimes illustrated by pointing out that while Chicago and St. Louis both exist at definite places, the relation ''more populous than'' which holds between them exists neither in Chicago nor in St. Louis nor in the area between them, but is nevertheless something about which we can speak, something that is usually assigned to a timeless and spaceless realm like that of which Plato spoke. On this view, however, human minds or personalities are also said to exist in spite of being non-material. In short, the great divide is between abstract subsistents and concrete existents, but both human personalities and physical objects are existents and do not share in the spacelessness and timelessness of platonic ideas.\n\nSo far as one can see, Kierkegaard too distinguishes different senses of “exists,” except that he appears to need at least ''three'' distinct senses for which he should supply three distinct words. First of all he needs one for statements about God, and so he says that God ''is''. Secondly, and by contrast, persons or personalities are said to ''exist''. It would appear then that he needs some third term for physical objects, which on his view are very different from God and persons, but since existentialists don’t seem to be very interested in physical objects or “mere” things, they appear to get along with two. The great problem for Kierkegaard is to relate God’s ''is-ness'', if I may use that term for the moment, to human existence, and this he tries to solve by appealing to the Incarnation. Christ’s person is the existent outgrowth of God who is. By what is admittedly a mysterious process the abstract God enters a concrete existent. We must accept this on faith and faith alone, for clearly it cannot be like the process whereby one existent is related to another; it involves a passage from one realm to another which is not accessible to the human mind, Christians who lacked this faith and who failed to live by it were attacked by Kierkegaard; this was the theological root of his violent criticism of the Established Church of Denmark. It is one source of his powerful influence on contemporary theology.\n*''20th Century Philosophers, The Age of Analysis'', selected with introduction and commentary by Morton White 1955 p. 118-121 Houghton Mifflin Co}}\n\n[[Mortimer J. Adler]] wrote the following about Kierkegaard in 1962:  <blockquote>For Kierkegaard, man is essentially an individual, not a member of a species or race; and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision-through subjectivity, not objectivity. Systems of thought and a dialectic such as Hegel’s are matters merely of thought, which cannot comprise individual existence and decision. Such systems leave out, said Kierkegaard, the unique and essential “spermatic point, the individual, ethically and religiously conceived, and existentially accentuated.” Similarly in the works of the American author Henry David Thoureau, writing at the same time as Kierkegaard, there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility, who, when he is right, carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state, government, and a united public opinion, when they are wrong. The solitary individual with right on his side is always “a majority of one.” ''Ethics, the study of moral values'', by Mortimer J. Adler and Seymour Cain. Pref. by William Ernest Hocking. 1962 p. 252</blockquote>\n\nIn 1964 Life Magazine traced the history of existentialism from [[Heraclitus]] (500BC) and [[Parmenides]] over the argument over The Unchanging One as the real and the state of flux as the real. From there to the Old Testament Psalms and then to Jesus and later from [[Jacob Boehme]] (1575–1624) to [[Rene Descartes]] (1596–1650) and [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662) and then on to Nietzsche and Paul Tillich. Dostoevski and Camus are attempts to rewrite Descartes according to their own lights and Descartes is the forefather of Sartre through the fact that they both used a \"literary style.\" The article goes on to say, {{Quotation| But the orthodox, textbook precursor of modern existentialism was the Danish theologian Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855), a lonely, hunchbacked writer who denounced the established church and rejected much of the then-popular German idealism – in which thought and ideas, rather than things perceived through the senses, were held to constitute reality. He built a philosophy based in part on the idea of permanent cleavage between faith and reason. This was an existentialism which still had room for a God whom Sartre later expelled, but which started the great pendulum-swing toward the modern concepts of the absurd. Kierkegaard spent his life thinking existentially and converting remarkably few to his ideas. But when it comes to the absurdity of existence, war is a great convincer; and it was at the end of World War I that two German philosophers, [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], took up Kierkegaard’s ideas, elaborated and systematized them. By the 1930s Kierkegaard’s thinking made new impact on French intellectuals who, like Sartre, were nauseated by the static pre-Munich hypocrisy of the European middle class. After World War II, with the human condition more precarious than ever, with humanity facing the mushroom-shaped ultimate absurdity, existentialism and our time came together in [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].\n*''Existentialism'', Life, November 6, 1964, Volume 57, No. 19 ISSN 0024-3019 Published by Time Inc.

The early Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard’s works: ''[[Practice in Christianity]]'', ''The Moment'', and an ''Anthology'' from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had an important role in ''The Epistle to the Romans'' can be found in ''Practice in Christianity''. The concept of the indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment of ''Practice in Christianity'', in particular, confirmed and sharpened Barth’s ideas on contemporary Christianity and the Christian life.\n\nWilhelm Pauk wrote in 1931 (''Karl Barth Prophet Of A New Christianity'') that Kierkegaard's use of the Latin phrase ''Finitum Non Capax Infiniti'' (the finite does not (or cannot) comprehend the infinite) summed up Barth's system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/karlbarthprophet012001mbp|title=Karl Barth Prophet Of A New Christianity|work=Internet Archive|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref> David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth's relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, ''The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings'' (1934) and ''Karl Barth and Christian Unity'' (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others. But Kierkegaard always referred to the equality of all in the world of the spirit where there is neither \"sport\" nor \"spook\" or anyone who can shut you out of the world of the spirit except yourself. All are chosen by God and equal in His sight. ''The Expectancy of Faith'',\" Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed. So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith. Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law. You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. ''The Bible – NIV\" Galatians 3:23–29''; \"In the world of spirit to become one’s own master, is the highest – and in love to help someone toward that, to become himself, free, independent, his own master, to help him stand alone – that is the greatest beneficence. The greatest beneficence, to help the other to stand alone, cannot be done directly.\"<ref>Soren Kierkegaard, Works of Love, 1847, Hong p. 1995 p. 274</ref> \"If a person always keeps his soul sober and alert in this idea, he will never go astray in his outlook on life and people or \"combine respect for status of persons with his faith.\" Show no partiality as you hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ.

He was fascinated by the revelation of the power of the Holy Spirit when it once touched a man; at the completeness with which it overwhelms and keeps its chosen ones loyal. He conceived of Paul as one upon whom God had laid His hand' Barth writes: \"The man Paul evidently sees and hears something which is above everything, which is absolutely beyond the range of my observation and measure of my thought.\" Following this observation Barth too became a \"listener\" and in that moment was born the \"Theology of Crisis.\" Besides affecting Barth deeply, the philosophy of Kierkegaard has found voice in the works of Ibsen, Unamuno, and Heidegger, and its sphere of influence seems to be growing in ever widening circles. The principle contribution of Kierkegaard to Barth is the dualism of time and eternity which Kierkegaard phrases: \"The infinite qualitative difference between time and eternity.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/thereligiouseduc00king Kingman, G. David, ''The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth's Teachings''] 1934 p. 15-17</ref>\nWherever Kierkegaard is understood, opposition is aroused to organized ecclesiasticism, to the objective treatment of religious questions, to the sovereignty of man, whether it be called idealism or theology of mystical experience. In this Kierkegaard circle of young pastors and pupils of Geismar there arose not only resistance against the teacher himself, whom they accused of failing to present Kierkegaard’s ideas as sufficiently radical, but also against the prevalent work of the church as such. The work with the youth, the work with Home Missions appears as superficial church business. In [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvigianism]] they frequently saw secularized piety, which had gone over to a concern with all sorts of cultural possessions. The majesty of God seemed to have been preserved too little and the institution of the church seemed to have taken over the meaning of the existential meeting with the transcendent God. In this opposition to the prevalent church life the thoughts of Kierkegaard have certainly remained alive. However, they became effective only when their reinforced echo from foreign lands reached Denmark. This effect was more marked when Barthianism became known. Into this group of dissatisfied, excited radicals Barthian thought penetrated with full force. The inward distress, the tension and the preparation of Kierkegaard made them receptive to the new. A magazine entitled the ''Tidenverv'' (''The Turn of the Times''), has been their journal since 1926. Especially the Student Christian Movement became the port of invasion for the new thought. But this invasion has been split completely into two camps which vehemently attack each other. Indictment was launched against the old theology. The quiet work of the church was scorned as secularization of the message or as emotional smugness, which had found a place in Home Missions despite all its call to repentance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/karlbarthandchri008799mbp#page/n147/mode/2up|title=Karl Barth And Christian Unity The Influence Of The Barthian Movement Upon The Churches Of The World|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nKierkegaard and the early Barth think that in Christianity, direct communication is impossible because Christ appears incognito.<ref>[[Philosophical Fragments]] Swenson p. 47-48; [[Practice in Christianity]] 124ff Hong</ref> For them Christ is a paradox, and therefore one can know him only in indirect communication. They are fully aware of the importance of the moment when the human being stands before God, and is moved by him alone from time to eternity, from the earth to which (s)he belongs to the heaven where God exists. But Kierkegaard stressed the single individual in the presence of God in time in his early discourses and wrote against speculative arguments about whether or not one individual, no matter how gifted, can ascertain where another stood in relation to God as early as his ''Two Upbuilding Discourses of 1843'' where he wrote against listening to speculative Christians: {{Quotation|The expectation of faith is then victory, and this expectation cannot be disappointed unless a man disappoints himself by depriving himself of expectation; like the one who foolishly supposed that he had lost faith, or foolishly supposed that some individual had taken it from him; or like the one who sought to delude himself with the idea that there was some special power which could deprive a man of his faith; who found satisfaction in the vain thought that this was precisely what had happened to him, found joy in frightening others with the assurance that some such power did exist that made sport of the noblest in man, and empowered the one who was thus tested to ridicule others. Søren Kierkegaard, ''Two Edifying Discourses 1843'', Swenson trans., 1943 p. 30}}\n\nBarth endorses the main theme from Kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and transforms the details. Barth expands the theory of indirect communication to the field of Christian ethics; he applies the concept of unrecognizability to the Christian life. He coins the concept of the \"paradox of faith\" since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to the concept of indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B.

Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God.<ref>{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|1992|pp=21–57}}</ref> Kierkegaard writes, \"doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world\".<ref>{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|1976|p=399}}</ref><ref>Elsewhere, Kierkegaard uses the Faith/Offense dichotomy. In this dichotomy, doubt is the middle ground between faith and taking offense. Offense, in his terminology, describes the threat faith poses to the rational mind. He uses Jesus' words in Matthew 11:6: ''\"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me\"''. In ''[[Practice in Christianity]]'', Kierkegaard writes: \"Just as the concept of \"faith\" is an altogether distinctively Christian term, so in turn is \"offense\" an altogether distinctively Christian term relating to faith. The possibility of offense is the crossroad, or it is like standing at the crossroad. From the possibility of offense, one turns either to offense or to faith, '''''but one never comes to faith except from the possibility of offense'''''\" (p. 80).\n\nIn the footnote, he writes, \"in the works of some pseudonymous writers it has been pointed out that in modern philosophy there is a confused discussion of doubt where the discussion should have been about despair. Therefore one has been unable to control or govern doubt either in scholarship or in life. \"Despair,\" however, promptly points in the right direction by placing the relation under the rubric of personality (the single individual) and the ethical. But just as there is a confused discussion of \"doubt\" instead of a discussion of \"despair\", So also the practice has been to use the category \"doubt\" where the discussion ought to be about \"offense.\" '''''The relation, the relation of personality to Christianity, is not to doubt or to believe, but to be offended or to believe'''''. All modern philosophy, both ethically, and Christianly, is based upon frivolousness. Instead of deterring and calling people to order by speaking of being despairing and being offended, it has waved to them and invited them to become conceited by doubting and having doubted. Modern philosophy, being abstract, is floating in metaphysical indeterminateness. Instead of explaining this about itself and then directing people (individual persons) to the ethical, the religious, the existential, philosophy has given the appearance that people are able to speculate themselves out of their own skin, as they so very prosaically say, into pure appearance.\" (''Practice in Christianity'', trans. Hong, 1991, p. 80.)\n\nHe writes that the person is either offended that Christ came as a man, and that God is too high to be a lowly man who is actually capable of doing very little to resist. Or Jesus, a man, thought himself too high to consider himself God (blasphemy). Or the historical offense where God a lowly man comes into collision with an established order. Thus, this offensive paradox is highly resistant to rational thought.</ref>\n\nKierkegaard also stresses the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in ''[[Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments]]'' that \"subjectivity is truth\" and \"truth is subjectivity.\" This has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in ''some sense'' believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor.<ref>{{harvnb|Pattison|2005}}</ref> This is how Kierkegaard put it: \"What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the ''de te narratur fabula'' [the tale is told about you] of antiquity. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]] so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life.\"<ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''[[Stages on Life's Way]]'' (1845) p. 479–480 and ''Either/Or Part I'', p. 5 Swenson.</ref><ref>Søren Kierkegaard, ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments Vol. I'' (1846) p. 231–232.</ref> In other words, Kierkegaard says: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life -- or the learner who should put it to use?\"<ref>Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Works of Love.'' Harper & Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62.</ref> This is how it was summed up in 1940. {{Quotation|Kierkegaard does not deny the fruitfulness or validity of abstract thinking (science, logic, and so on), but he does deny any superstition which pretends that abstract theorizing is a sufficient concluding argument for human existence. He holds it to be unforgiveable pride or stupidity to think that the impersonal abstraction can answer the vital problems of human, everyday life. Logical theorems, mathematical symbols, physical-statistical laws can never become patters of human existence. To be human means to be concrete, to be this person here and now in this particular and decisive moment, face to face with this particular challenge.  C Svere Norborg, ''David F. Swenson, scholar, teacher, friend.''  P. 20-21 Minneapolis, The University of Minnesota, 1940}}\n\nKierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed ''likely'' to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.<ref name=\"Conclude\">{{harvnb|Kierkegaard|1992}}</ref>\n\n===Philosophical criticism===\nKierkegaard's famous philosophical 20th century critics include [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]]. Non-religious philosophers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] supported many aspects of Kierkegaard's philosophical views,<ref>A recent study touches specifically on the ontological aspects of ''angst'' from a Heideggerian standpoint in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], ‘Variations ontologiques autour du concept d’angoisse chez Kierkegaard’, in ''Kierkegaard notre contemporain paradoxal'', ed. N. Hatem (Beirut, 2013), pp. 83–95</ref> but rejected some of his religious views.<ref name=\"Sartrehum\">{{harvnb|Sartre|1946}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dreyfus|1998}}</ref> One critic wrote that Adorno's book ''Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic'' is \"the most irresponsible book ever written on Kierkegaard\"<ref>{{harvnb|Westphal|1996|p=9}}</ref> because Adorno takes Kierkegaard's pseudonyms literally, and constructs a philosophy which makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible. Another reviewer says that \"Adorno is [far away] from the more credible translations and interpretations of the Collected Works of Kierkegaard we have today.\"<ref name=\"Marcia\" />\n\nLevinas' main attack on Kierkegaard focused on his ethical and religious stages, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Levinas criticises the leap of faith by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of violence (the \"leap of faith\" of course, is presented by a pseudonym, thus not representing Kierkegaard's own view, but intending to prompt the exact kind of discussion engaged in by his critics). He states: \"Kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage, the domain of belief. But belief no longer sought external justification. Even internally, it combined communication and isolation, and hence violence and passion. That is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led, through Nietzsche, to the amoralism of recent philosophies.\"<ref>Emmanuel Levinas, ''Existence and Ethics'', (1963) (as cited in Lippitt, 2003, p. 136).</ref>\n\nLevinas pointed to the [[Judeo-Christian]] belief that it was God who first commanded [[Abraham]] to sacrifice [[Isaac]] and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, he would not have listened to the angel's command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, \"transcending ethics\" seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable.<ref name=\"Katz\">{{harvnb|Katz|2001}}</ref> One interesting consequence of Levinas' critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent.<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchens|2004}}</ref> However, one of Kierkegaard's central points in ''Fear and Trembling'' was that the religious sphere ''entails'' the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always in one way or another ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn't tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in ''Stages on Life's Way''. <blockquote>I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, “These things I said not unto you from the beginning … I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now” – so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth. Soren Kierkegaard, Quidam’s Diary from ''Stages on Life’s Way'',  1845 Lowrie translation  1967 p. 217-218</blockquote>\n\nSartre objected to the [[existence of God]]: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre's phrasing is that God would be a ''[[Pour soi|pour-soi]]'' (a being-for-itself; a consciousness) who is also an ''en-soi'' (a being-in-itself; a thing) which is a contradiction in terms.<ref name=\"Sartrehum\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Sartre|1969|p=430}}</ref> Critics of Sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional Christian view of God.<ref>Swinburne Richard, The Coherence of Theism.</ref> Kierkegaard has Judge Vilhelm express the Christian hope this way in ''Either/Or'', <blockquote>Either, “the first” contains promise for the future, is the forward thrust, the endless impulse. Or, “the first” does not impel the individual; the power which is in the first does not become the impelling power but the repelling power, it becomes that which thrusts away. .... Thus – for the sake of making a little philosophical flourish, not with the pen but with thought-God only once became flesh, and it would be vain to expect this to be repeated. Soren Kierkegaard, ''Either – Or II'' 1843, p. 40-41 Lowrie Translation 1944, 1959, 1972</blockquote>\n\nSartre agreed with Kierkegaard's analysis of Abraham undergoing anxiety (Sartre calls it anguish), but claimed that God told Abraham to do it. In his lecture, ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', Sartre wondered whether Abraham ought to have doubted whether God actually spoke to him.<ref name=\"Sartrehum\" /> In Kierkegaard's view, Abraham's certainty had its origin in that 'inner voice' which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another (\"The problem comes as soon as Abraham wants to be understood\").<ref>''[[Fear and Trembling]]'', 1843 – Søren Kierkegaard – Kierkegaard's Writings; 6 – 1983 – Howard V. Hong, pp. 13–14.</ref> To Kierkegaard, every external \"proof\" or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject.<ref>{{harvnb|Stern|1990}}</ref> Kierkegaard's proof for the immortality of the soul, for example, is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever.<ref>{{harvnb|Kosch|1996}}</ref>\n\nFaith was something that Kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career; under both his real name and behind pseudonyms, he explored many different aspects of faith. These various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal, the historical orientation of faith (particularly toward Jesus Christ), faith being a gift from God, faith as dependency on a historical object, faith as a passion, and faith as a resolution to personal despair. Even so, it has been argued that Kierkegaard never offers a full, explicit and systematic account of what faith is.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/> ''[[Either/Or]]'' was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard's stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling's ''Philosophy of Revelation''. According to the ''Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Religion'', Either/Or (vol. 1) consists of essays of literary and music criticism, a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, a whimsical essay on how to avoid boredom, a panegyric on the unhappiest possible human being, a diary recounting a supposed seduction, and (vol. II) two enormous didactic and hortatory ethical letters and a sermon.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> This opinion is a reminder of the type of controversy Kierkegaard tried to encourage in many of his writings both for readers in his own generation and for subsequent generations as well.\n\nKierkegaardian scholar Paul Holmer<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v33.n3/story24.html Paul Holmer from ''The Yale Bulletin'']</ref> described Kierkegaard's wish in his introduction to the 1958 publication of Kierkegaard's ''Edifying Discourses'' where he wrote: {{Quotation|Kierkegaard’s constant and lifelong wish, to which his entire literature gives expression, was to create a new and rich subjectivity in himself and his readers. Unlike any authors who believe that all subjectivity is a hindrance, Kierkegaard contends that only some kinds of subjectivity are a hindrance. He sought at once to produce subjectivity if it were lacking, to correct it if it were there and needed correction, to amplify and strengthen it when it was weak and undeveloped, and, always, to bring subjectivity of every reader to the point of eligibility for Christian inwardness and concern. But the ''Edifying Discourses'', though paralleling the pseudonymous  works, spoke a little more directly, albeit without authority. They spoke the real author’s conviction and were the purpose of Kierkegaard’s lifework. Whereas all the rest of his writing was designed to get the readers out of their lassitude and mistaken conceptions, the discourses, early and late, were the goal of the literature.

They start where the reader finds himself, in immanent ethical possibilities, aesthetic repetitions, and are themselves vulnerable to the lure of poetic sirens. They force the dialectical movements of the making and unmaking of the self before God to undergo lyrical imitations of meditation while the clefts, rifts, abysses, are everywhere to be seen. \n*Noami Lebowitz, ''Kierkegaard A Life of Allegory'' 1985 p.157}}\n\n==Influence==\n{{Main|Influence and reception of Søren Kierkegaard}}\n[[File:Royal Library Garden - Søren Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A statue.
