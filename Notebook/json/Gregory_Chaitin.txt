Beginning in the late 1960s, Chaitin made contributions to [[algorithmic information theory]] and [[metamathematics]], in particular a computer-theoretic result equivalent to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. He is considered to be one of the founders of what is today known as Kolmogorov (or Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity together with [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] and [[Ray Solomonoff]]. Today, [[algorithmic information theory]] is a common subject in any computer science curriculum.\n\n==Mathematics and computer science==\nHe attended the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and [[City College of New York]], where he (still in his teens) developed the theory that led to his independent discovery of [[Kolmogorov complexity]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Li |last2=Vitanyi |title=An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its Applications |publisher=Springer |year=1997 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LKEmB_GQ53QC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=snippet&f=false |page=92 |quote=G.J.Chaitin had finished the Bronx High School of Science, and was an 18-year-old undergraduate student at City College of the City University of New York, when he submitted two papers....

Ω has the mathematical property that it is [[Definable number|definable]] but not [[computability theory (computation)|computable]].\n\nChaitin's early work on algorithmic information theory followed after the work of [[Solomonoff]], [[Kolmogorov]], and [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]].\n\nChaitin is also the originator of using [[graph coloring]] to do [[register allocation]] in compiling, a process known as [[Chaitin's algorithm]].<ref>G.J. Chaitin, ''Register Allocation and Spilling via Graph Coloring'', [http://www.google.com/patents/US4571678 US Patent 4,571,678] (1986) [cited from [http://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/PhDTheses/Hoflehner/index.html ''Register Allocation on the Intel® Itanium® Architecture''], p.155]</ref>\n\nHe was formerly a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York and remains an emeritus researcher. He has written more than 10 book titles that have been translated to about 15 languages. He is today interested in questions of [[metabiology]] and information-theoretic formalizations of the theory of evolution.\n\n==Other scholarly contributions==\nChaitin also writes about [[philosophy]], especially [[metaphysics]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]] (particularly about epistemological matters in mathematics). In metaphysics, Chaitin claims that [[algorithmic information theory]] is the key to solving problems in the field of [[biology]] (obtaining a formal definition of 'life', its origin and [[evolution]]) and  [[neuroscience]] (the problem of [[consciousness]] and the study of the mind).\n\nIn recent writings, he defends a position known as [[digital philosophy]]. In the [[epistemology]] of mathematics, he claims that his findings in [[mathematical logic]] and algorithmic information theory show there are \"mathematical facts that are true for no reason, they're true by accident. They are random mathematical facts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ithistory.org/honor-roll/professor-gregory-john-chaitin|title=Professor Gregory John Chaitin|publisher=[[IT History Society]]|accessdate=2016-07-12}}</ref> Chaitin proposes that mathematicians must abandon any hope of proving those mathematical facts and adopt a [[quasi-empirical]] methodology.\n\n==Honors==\nIn 1995 he was given the degree of doctor of science ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the [[University of Maine]]. In 2002 he was given the title of honorary professor by the [[University of Buenos Aires]] in Argentina, where his parents were born and where Chaitin spent part of his youth. In 2007 he was given a [[Leibniz Medal (Wolfram Research)|Leibniz Medal]]<ref>Zenil, Hector \"Leibniz medallion comes to life after 300 years\"\n[http://www.mathrix.org/liquid/archives/the-history-of-the-chaitin-leibniz-medallion ''Anima Ex Machina'', The Blog of Hector Zenil], November 3rd, 2007.</ref> by [[Wolfram Research]]. In 2009 he was given the degree of doctor of philosophy ''honoris causa'' by the [[National University of Córdoba]]. He was formerly a researcher at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]] and is now a professor at the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]].\n\n==Criticism==\n{{criticism|date=July 2016}}<!--See talk-->\nSome philosophers and logicians strongly disagree with the philosophical conclusions that Chaitin has drawn from his theorems.<ref>Panu Raatikainen, \"Exploring Randomness and The Unknowable\"\n[http://www.ams.org/notices/200109/rev-panu.pdf ''Notices'' of the American Mathematical Society] Book Review October 2001.</ref>\nThe logician [[Torkel Franzén]]<ref>{{Citation |first=Torkel |last=Franzén |authorlink=Torkel Franzén |title=Gödel's Theorem: An Incomplete Guide to its Use and Abuse |location=Wellesley, Massachusetts |publisher=[[A K Peters, Ltd.]] |year=2005 |isbn=1-56881-238-8}}</ref> criticized Chaitin’s interpretation of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and the alleged explanation for it that Chaitin’s work represents.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Digital philosophy]]\n* [[Halting problem]]\n* [[Algorithmic information theory]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Information, Randomness & Incompleteness'' ([[World Scientific]] 1987) ([http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dDbE2lNiHjkC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=Chaitin+G.J.+%281975%29+Randomness+and+Mathematical+Proof.&ots=7nfsY_Ky05&sig=W7V6gCyj6YGPYXUgyJ6uWYihHTM#v=onepage&q=Chaitin%20G.J.%20%281975%29%20Randomness%20and%20Mathematical%20Proof.&f=false online])\n*''Algorithmic Information Theory'' ([[Cambridge University Press]] 1987) [http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/cup.pdf online]\n*''Information-theoretic Incompleteness'' ([[World Scientific]] 1992) ([http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/ps3.pdf online])\n*''The Limits of Mathematics'' ([[Springer-Verlag]] 1998)\n*''The Unknowable'' ([[Springer-Verlag]] 1999)\n*''Exploring Randomness'' ([[Springer-Verlag]] 2001)\n*''Conversations with a Mathematician'' ([[Springer-Verlag]] 2002)\n*''From Philosophy to Program Size'' ([http://ioc.ee/ Tallinn Cybernetics Institute] 2003)\n*''Meta Math!: The Quest for Omega'' ([[Pantheon Books]] 2005) (reprinted in UK as ''Meta Maths: The Quest for Omega'', [[Atlantic Books]] 2006) ([[arXiv]] [http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404335.pdf preprint])\n*''Teoria algoritmica della complessit&agrave;'' ([http://www.giappichelli.it/ G.
