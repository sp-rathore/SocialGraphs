At the beginning of the twentieth century he founded an esoteric spiritual movement, [[anthroposophy]], with roots in [[German idealism|German idealist philosophy]] and [[theosophy]]; other influences include [[Goethean science]] and [[Rosicrucianism]].\n\nIn the first, more philosophically oriented phase of this movement, Steiner attempted to find a synthesis between [[science]] and [[spirituality]].<ref>R. Bruce Elder, ''Harmony and dissent: film and avant-garde art movements in the early twentieth century'', ISBN 978-1-55458-028-6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ408vKWZ14C&pg=PA32 p. 32]</ref> His philosophical work of these years, which he termed \"[[spiritual science]]\", sought to apply the clarity of thinking characteristic of Western philosophy to spiritual questions,<ref name=RAMcD/>{{rp|291}} differentiating this approach from what he considered to be vaguer approaches to mysticism. In a second phase, beginning around 1907, he began working collaboratively in a variety of artistic media, including drama, the movement arts (developing a new artistic form, [[eurythmy]]) and architecture, culminating in the building of the [[Goetheanum]], a cultural centre to house [[Gesamtkunstwerk|all the arts]]. In the third phase of his work, beginning after [[World War I]], Steiner worked to establish various [[#Breadth of activity|practical endeavors]], including [[Waldorf education]], [[Biodynamic Agriculture|biodynamic agriculture]], and [[anthroposophical medicine]].<ref name=\"CL\">Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, ISBN 3-499-50500-2, pp. 123–6</ref>\n\nSteiner advocated a form of ethical [[individualism]], to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual approach. He based his [[epistemology]] on [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]'s world view, in which \"Thinking… is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear.

Johann became a telegraph operator on the Southern Austrian Railway, and at the time of Rudolf's birth was stationed in ''[[Donji Kraljevec|Kraljevec]]'' in the ''[[Muraköz]]'' region, then part of the [[Austrian Empire]] (present-day Donji Kraljevec, [[Medjimurje|Međimurje]] region, northernmost [[Croatia]]). In the first two years of Rudolf's life, the family moved twice, first to [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], and then, through the promotion of his father to stationmaster, to [[:de:Pottschach|Pottschach]], located in the foothills of the eastern Austrian [[Alps]] in [[Lower Austria]].<ref name=\"CL\"/>\n\nSteiner entered the village school; following a disagreement between his father and the schoolmaster, he was briefly educated at home. In 1869, when Steiner was eight years old, the family moved to the village of [[:de:Neudörfl|Neudörfl]] and in October 1872 Steiner proceeded from the village school there to the [[realschule]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]].<ref name=Auto>Rudolf Steiner [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/English/APC1928/GA028_index.html Autobiography: Chapters in the Course of My Life: 1861–1907], Lantern Books, 2006</ref>{{rp|Chap. 2}}\n\nIn 1879, the family moved to [[Inzersdorf (Vienna)|Inzersdorf]] to enable Steiner to attend the [[Vienna University of Technology|Vienna Institute of Technology]],<ref>In Austria passing the ''[[matura]]'' examination at a [[Gymnasium (school)]] was required for entry to the University.[http://www.superfarm.net/pedagogika/images/stories/2007-5-eng/2007_05_eng_07-dr_tadej_vidmar-the_gymnasium_as_a_general.pdf]</ref> where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[biology]], literature, and philosophy on an academic scholarship from 1879 to 1883, at the end of which time he withdrew from the institute without graduating.<ref name=Zander2>Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', Göttingen, 2007, ISBN 3-525-55452-4.</ref>{{rp|446}}<ref name=ZanderBio>{{cite book|last=Zander|first=Helmut|title=Rudolf Steiner: Die Biografie|year=2011|publisher=Piper|location=Munich}}</ref>{{rp|29}} In 1882, one of Steiner's teachers, [[:de:Karl Julius Schröer|Karl Julius Schröer]],<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c03.html Chap. 3]}} suggested Steiner's name to Joseph Kürschner, chief editor of a new edition of Goethe's works,<ref>Geoffrey Ahern, Sun at Midnight, Publ.

''Esoteric Lessons 1904–1909''. SteinerBooks, 2007.</ref> Steiner later related that as a child he felt \"that one must carry the knowledge of the spiritual world within oneself after the fashion of geometry ... [for here] one is permitted to know something which the mind alone, through its own power, experiences.  In this feeling I found the justification for the spiritual world that I experienced ... I confirmed for myself by means of geometry the feeling that I must speak of a world 'which is not seen'.\"<ref name=Auto/>\n\nSteiner believed that at the age of 15 he had gained a complete understanding of the concept of time, which he considered to be the precondition of spiritual [[clairvoyance]].<ref name=\"CorrDoc\"/> At 21, on the train between his home village and [[Vienna]], Steiner met a herb gatherer, Felix Kogutzki, who spoke about the spiritual world \"as one who had his own experience therein\".<ref name=\"Auto\"/>{{rp|39–40}}<ref>Steiner, GA 262, pp. 7–21.</ref> Kogutzki conveyed to Steiner a knowledge of nature that was non-academic and spiritual.\n\n=== Writer and philosopher ===\n[[File:Rudolf Steiner um 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner around 1891/92, etching by Otto Fröhlich]]\nIn 1888, as a result of his work for the Kürschner edition of [[Goethe]]'s works, Steiner was invited to work as an editor at the Goethe archives in [[Weimar]]. Steiner remained with the archive until 1896. As well as the introductions for and commentaries to four volumes of Goethe's scientific writings, Steiner wrote two books about Goethe's philosophy: ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886),<ref>[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/ \"Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception\"], also translated as ''Goethe's Theory of Knowledge, An Outline of the Epistemology of His Worldview''</ref> which Steiner regarded as the [[epistemological]] foundation and justification for his later work,<ref>Preface to 1924 edition of [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA002/English/AP1985/GA002_pre1924.html ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception, with Specific Reference to Schiller''], in which Steiner also wrote that the way of knowing he presented in this work opened the way from the sensory world to the spiritual one.</ref> and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897).<ref>Rudolf Steiner, ''Goethean Science'', Mercury Press, 1988 ISBN 0-936132-92-2, ISBN 978-0-936132-92-1, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA001/English/MP1988/GA001_index.html link]</ref> During this time he also collaborated in complete editions of the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and the writer [[Jean Paul]] and wrote numerous articles for various journals.\n\nIn 1891, Steiner received a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Rostock]], for his dissertation discussing \n[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte's]] concept of the ego,<ref name=RAMcD/><ref>His thesis title was ''Die Grundfrage der Erkenntnistheorie mit besonderer Rücksicht auf Fichte's [[Wissenschaftslehre (Fichte)|Wissenschaftslehre]] – Prolegomena zur Verständigung des philosophierenden Bewusstseins mit sich selbst''.</ref> submitted to [[:de:Heinrich von Stein|Heinrich von Stein]], whose ''Seven Books of Platonism'' Steiner esteemed.<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c14.html Chap. 14]}} Steiner's dissertation was later published in expanded form as ''Truth and Knowledge: Prelude to a Philosophy of Freedom'' ({{lang-de|Wahrheit und Wissenschaft – Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Freiheit''}}), with a dedication to [[Eduard von Hartmann]].<ref>[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA003/index.php ''Truth and Knowledge'' (full text)]</ref> Two years later, he published ''Die Philosophie der Freiheit'' (''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]'' or ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity''—Steiner's preferred English title) (1894), an exploration of [[epistemology]] and ethics that suggested a way for humans to become spiritually free beings. Steiner later spoke of this book as containing implicitly, in philosophical form, the entire content of what he later developed explicitly as [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Sergei Prokofieff, ''May Human Beings Hear It!'', Temple Lodge, 2004. p. 460</ref>\n[[File:Steiner Berlin 1900 big.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudolf Steiner 1900]]\n\nIn 1896, Steiner declined an offer from [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] to help organize the Nietzsche archive in [[Naumburg]]. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Her brother]] by that time was ''[[non compos mentis]]''. Förster-Nietzsche introduced Steiner into the presence of the [[catatonic]] philosopher; Steiner, deeply moved, subsequently wrote the book ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom''.<ref>Rudolf Steiner, ''Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom'' Garber Communications; 2nd revised edition (July 1985) ISBN  978-0893450335. Online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA005/English/GC1985/GA005_index.html]</ref>  Steiner later related that:\n\n:\"My first acquaintance with Nietzsche's writings belongs to the year 1889. Previous to that I had never read a line of his. Upon the substance of my ideas as these find expression in ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'', Nietzsche's thought had not the least influence....Nietzsche's ideas of the '[[Ewige Wiederkunft|eternal recurrence]]' and of '[[Übermensch]]' remained long in my mind. For in these was reflected that which a personality must feel concerning the evolution and essential being of humanity when this personality is kept back from grasping the spiritual world by the restricted thought in the philosophy of nature characterizing the end of the 19th century....What attracted me particularly was that one could read Nietzsche without coming upon anything which strove to make the reader a 'dependent' of Nietzsche's.\"<ref name=Auto/>{{rp|[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA028/TSoML/GA028_c18.html Chap. 18]}}\n\nIn 1897, Steiner left the [[Weimar]] archives and moved to Berlin. He became part owner of, chief editor of, and an active contributor to the literary journal ''Magazin für Literatur'', where he hoped to find a readership sympathetic to his philosophy. Many subscribers were alienated by Steiner's unpopular support of [[Émile Zola]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]]<ref name=\"GL\">Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Tarcher/Penguin 2007.</ref> and the journal lost more subscribers when Steiner published extracts from his correspondence with anarchist [[John Henry Mackay]].<ref name=\"GL\"/> Dissatisfaction with his editorial style eventually led to his departure from the magazine.\n\nIn 1899, Steiner married Anna Eunicke; the couple separated several years later. Anna died in 1911.\n\n=== The Theosophical Society ===\n[[File:Marie Steiner.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Marie Steiner 1903]]\n{{Main article|Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society}}\nIn 1899, Steiner published an article, \"Goethe's Secret Revelation\", discussing the esoteric nature of Goethe's fairy tale ''[[The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily]]''. This article led to an invitation by the Count and Countess Brockdorff to speak to a gathering of [[Theosophy|Theosophists]] on the subject of Nietzsche. Steiner continued speaking regularly to the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], becoming the head of its newly constituted German section in 1902 without ever formally joining the society.<ref name=RAMcD/><ref name=Ravagli/> It was also in connection with this society that Steiner met and worked with [[Marie von Sivers]], who became his second wife in 1914. By 1904, Steiner was appointed by [[Annie Besant]] to be leader of the Theosophical ''Esoteric Society'' for Germany and Austria.\n\nIn contrast to mainstream Theosophy, Steiner sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his [[spiritual science]]. During this period, Steiner maintained an original approach, replacing [[H. P. Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]'s terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of [[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater]] and [[Annie Besant|Besant]]'s claim that [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] was the vehicle of a new ''Maitreya'', or world teacher,<ref>See Lutyens, Mary (2005). J. Krishnamurti: A Life. New Delhi: Penguin Books India. ISBN 0-14-400006-7</ref> led to a formal split in 1912/13,<ref name=RAMcD/> when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the [[Anthroposophical Society]]. (Steiner took the name \"Anthroposophy\" from the title of a work of the Austrian philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann]], published in Vienna in 1856.<ref>Zimmermann's ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft.: Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage'': Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'',  11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html]. Steiner took the name but not the limitations on knowledge which Zimmerman proposed. Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, \"Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]</ref>)\n\n=== The Anthroposophical Society and its cultural activities ===\n[[File:First Goetheanum.jpg|left|thumb|First Goetheanum]]\n[[File:Edith Maryon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|English sculptor [[Edith Maryon]] belonged to the innermost circle of founders of anthroposophy and was appointed to head the Section of Sculptural Arts at the Goetheanum.]]\nThe Anthroposophical Society grew rapidly. Fueled by a need to find an artistic home for their yearly conferences, which included performances of plays written by [[Edouard Schuré]] and Steiner, the decision was made to build a theater and organizational center. In 1913, construction began on the first [[Goetheanum]] building, in [[Dornach]], Switzerland. The building, designed by Steiner, was built to a significant part by volunteers who offered craftsmanship or simply a will to learn new skills. Once World War I started in 1914, the Goetheanum volunteers could hear the sound of cannon fire beyond the Swiss border, but despite the war, people from all over Europe worked peaceably side by side on the building's construction.\n\nSteiner's lecture activity expanded enormously with the end of the war. Most importantly, from 1919 on Steiner began to work with other members of the society to found numerous [[#Breadth of activity|practical institutions and activities]], including the first [[Waldorf schools|Waldorf school]], founded that year in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. At the same time, the Goetheanum developed as a wide-ranging cultural centre. On New Year's Eve, 1922/1923, the building burned to the ground; contemporary police reports indicate arson as the probable cause.<ref name=CL/>{{rp|752}}<ref name=GA259>{{Cite book|author=Rudolf Steiner |title=Das Schicksalsjahr 1923 in der Geschichte der Anthroposophischen Gesellschaft: vom Goethanumbrand zur Weihnachtstagung: Ansprachen, Versammlungen, Dokumente, Januar bis Dezember 1923 |publisher=Rudolf Steiner Verlag |pages=750–790 (esp. 787)|year=1991 |isbn=978-3-7274-2590-5}}</ref>{{rp|796}} Steiner immediately began work designing a [[Goetheanum|second Goetheanum]] building - this time made of concrete instead of wood - which was completed in 1928, three years after his death.\n\nAt a \"Foundation Meeting\" for members held at the Dornach center during Christmas, 1923, Steiner spoke of laying a new [[:Wikisource:Foundation Stone meditation|Foundation Stone]] for the society in the hearts of his listeners. At the meeting, a new \"General Anthroposophical Society\" was established with a new executive board. At this meeting, Steiner also founded a School of Spiritual Science, intended as an \"organ of initiative\" for research and study and as \"the 'soul' of the Anthroposophical Society\".<ref>Johannes Kiersch, ''A History of the School of Spiritual Science''.

In response to the catastrophic situation in post-war Germany, he proposed extensive social reforms through the establishment of a [[Threefold Social Order]] in which the cultural, political and economic realms would be largely independent. Steiner argued that a fusion of the three realms had created the inflexibility that had led to catastrophes such as [[First World War|World War I]]. In connection with this, he promoted a radical solution in the disputed area of [[Upper Silesia]], claimed by both Poland and Germany; his suggestion that this area be granted at least provisional independence led to his being publicly accused of being a traitor to Germany.<ref>''Frankfurter Zeitung'', 4 March 1921</ref>\n\nSteiner opposed [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s proposal to create new European nations based around ethnic groups, which he saw as opening the door to rampant nationalism. Steiner proposed as an alternative \"'social territories'  with democratic institutions that were accessible to all inhabitants of a territory whatever their origin while the needs of the various ethnicities would be met by independent cultural institutions.\"<ref>Uwe Werner (2011), \"Rudolf Steiner zu Individuum und Rasse: Sein Engagement gegen Rassismus und Nationalismus\", in ''Anthroposophie in Geschichte und Gegenwart''. trans.

He nonetheless continued to lecture widely, and even to travel; especially towards the end of this time, he was often giving two, three or even four lectures daily for courses taking place concurrently.

He continued work on his autobiography during the last months of his life; he died on 30 March 1925.\n\n=== Spiritual research ===\nSteiner first began speaking publicly about spiritual experiences and phenomena in his 1899 lectures to the Theosophical Society. By 1901 he had begun to write about spiritual topics, initially in the form of discussions of historical figures such as the [[mysticism|mystics]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. By 1904 he was expressing his own understanding of these themes in his essays and books, while continuing to refer to a wide variety of historical sources.\n\n\"A world of spiritual perception is discussed in a number of writings which I have published since this book appeared. ''The Philosophy of Freedom'' forms the philosophical basis for these later writings. For it tries to show that the experience of thinking, rightly understood, is in fact an experience of spirit.\" (Steiner, Philosophy of Freedom, Consequences of Monism)\n\nSteiner aimed to apply his training in [[mathematics]], science, and philosophy to produce rigorous, verifiable presentations of those experiences.<ref>Lindenberg, \"Schritte auf dem Weg zur Erweiterung der Erkenntnis\", pp. 77ff</ref> He believed that through freely chosen [[ethics|ethical]] disciplines and [[meditation|meditative training]], anyone could develop the ability to experience the [[spirit|spiritual world]], including the higher nature of oneself and others.<ref name=\"GL\"/> Steiner believed that such [[discipline]] and training would help a person to become a more [[morality|moral]], [[creativity|creative]] and [[Freedom (philosophy)|free]] [[individuality|individual]] – free in the sense of being capable of actions motivated solely by love.<ref name = \"Schneider\"/> His philosophical ideas were affected by [[Franz Brentano]],<ref name=\"GL\"/> with whom he had studied,<ref>Steiner described Brentano's ''Psychology from the Empirical Standpoint'' (1870) as symptomatic of the weakness of a psychology that intended to follow the method of natural science but lacked the strength and elasticity of mind to do justice to the demand of modern times: Steiner, ''The Riddles of Philosophy'' (1914), Chapter VI, \"Modern Idealistic World Conceptions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA018/English/AP1973/GA018_p02c06.html]</ref> as well as by Fichte, [[Hegel]], Schelling, and Goethe's [[Goethean science|phenomenological approach to science]].<ref name=\"GL\"/><ref>Bockemühl, J., ''Toward a Phenomenology of the Etheric World'' ISBN 0-88010-115-6</ref><ref>Edelglass, S. et al., ''The Marriage of Sense and Thought'', ISBN 0-940262-82-7</ref>\n\nSteiner followed [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] in using the term ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'', usually translated as \"spiritual science\".<ref>Dilthey had used this term in the title of one of the works listed in the Introduction to Steiner's ''Truth and Science'' (the doctoral dissertation) as concerned with the theory of cognition in general: ''Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften, usw.'', (Introduction to the Spiritual Sciences, etc.) published in 1883.[http://sigbus.pvtridvs.net/pool/miscbooks/Rudolf_Steiner_-_Truth_and_Knowledge_v1.5.pdf].</ref> Steiner used the term spiritual science to describe a discipline treating the spirit as something actual and real, starting from the premise that it is possible for human beings to penetrate behind what is sense-perceptible.<ref>Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0058/19091014p01.html  \"The Mission of Spiritual Science\"], lecture 1 of ''Metamorphoses of the Soul: Paths of Experience'', Vol. 1</ref> He proposed that psychology, history, and the humanities generally were based on the direct grasp of an ideal reality,<ref>''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'', ch XIX</ref> and required close attention to the particular period and culture which provided the distinctive character of religious qualities in the course of the evolution of consciousness.

He founded a number of schools, the first of which was known as the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf school]],<ref>IN CONTEXT No. 6, Summer 1984</ref> which later evolved into a worldwide school network. He also founded a system of organic agriculture, now known as [[biodynamic agriculture]], which was one of the very first forms of, and has contributed significantly to the development of, modern [[organic farming]].<ref>[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/biodynamic.html ATTRA – National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service]</ref> His [[Anthroposophic medicine|work in medicine]] led to the development of a broad range of complementary medications and supportive artistic and biographic therapies.<ref>Evans, M. and Rodger, I.

Steiner's writings, published in about forty volumes, include books, essays, [[Rudolf Steiner's Mystery Dramas|four plays]] ('mystery dramas'), mantric verse, and an autobiography. His collected lectures, making up another approximately 300 volumes, discuss an extremely wide range of themes.

Out of these lectures came a new school, the Waldorf school. In 1922, Steiner presented these ideas at a conference called for this purpose in [[Oxford]] by Professor [[Millicent Mackenzie]]. This conference led to the founding of the first Waldorf schools in Britain.<ref>Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/18835/1/Paull2011OxfordEJES.pdf Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain].

Plant or animal disease is seen as a symptom of problems in the whole organism. Steiner also suggested timing such agricultural activities as sowing, weeding, and harvesting to utilize the influences on plant growth of the [[moon]] and [[planets]]; and the application of natural materials prepared in specific ways to the [[soil]], [[composting|compost]], and crops, with the intention of engaging non-physical beings and elemental forces. He encouraged his listeners to verify his suggestions [[scientific method|empirically]], as he had not yet done.<ref name=\"Koberwitz\"/>\n\n=== Anthroposophical medicine ===\n{{Main article|Anthroposophical medicine}}\nFrom the late 1910s, Steiner was working with doctors to create a new approach to medicine. In 1921, [[pharmacist]]s and physicians gathered under Steiner's guidance to create a pharmaceutical company called [[Weleda]] which now distributes natural medical products worldwide. At around the same time, Dr. [[Ita Wegman]] founded a first anthroposophic medical clinic (now the Ita Wegman Clinic) in [[Arlesheim]].\n\n=== Social reform===\n{{main article|Threefold Social Order}}\nFor a period after World War I, Steiner was active as a lecturer on social reform. A petition expressing his basic social ideas was widely circulated and signed by many cultural figures of the day, including [[Hermann Hesse]].\n\nIn Steiner's chief book on [[social reform]], ''Toward Social Renewal'', he suggested that the cultural, political and economic spheres of society need to work together as consciously cooperating yet independent entities, each with a particular task: political institutions should establish [[Equality before the law|political equality]] and protect [[human rights]]; cultural institutions should nurture the free and unhindered development of science, art, education and religion; and economic institutions should enable producers, distributors and consumers to cooperate to provide efficiently for society's needs.<ref name=\"Essential\">Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', Harper San Francisco 1984 ISBN 0-06-065345-0</ref> He saw such a division of responsibility, which he called the [[Threefold Social Order]], as a vital task which would take up consciously the historical trend toward the mutual independence of these three realms. Steiner also gave suggestions for many specific social reforms.\n\nSteiner proposed what he termed a \"fundamental law\" of social life:\n\n{{Quote|The well-being of a community of people working together will be the greater, the less the individual claims for himself the proceeds of his work, i.e. the more of these proceeds he makes over to his fellow-workers, the more his own needs are satisfied, not out of his own work but out of the work done by others.|Steiner|The Fundamental Social Law<ref name=Fundamental>Steiner (1917), [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Articles/FuSoLa_index.html \"The Fundamental Social Law\"], translated in ''Selected writings\nof Rudolf Steiner'' (1993), Richard Seddon (Ed.), Rudolf Steiner Press, Bristol.

These two buildings, built in Dornach, Switzerland, were intended to house significant theater spaces as well as a \"school for spiritual science\".

His last public lecture course, given in 1924, was on speech and drama.  Anthroposophic speech trainings generally last four years and offer an accredited diploma. Topics include: differentiating the styles of [[epic poetry|epic]], [[lyric poetry|lyric]], [[dramatic poetry]], the language of gesture, and speech; variously known as ''creative speech'' or ''speech formation'' ([[:de:Sprachgestaltung|Sprachgestaltung]]). Graduates receive the Goetheanum diploma which allows them the option to pursue a training in Anthroposophical ''Therapeutic Speech''.\n\nThe Russian actor and director [[Michael Chekhov]] based significant aspects of his ''method'' of acting on Steiner's work.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ojs-prod.library.usyd.edu.au/index.php/LA/article/viewFile/5054/5759 |title=On Rudolf Steiner's Impact on the Training of the Actor |author=Anderson, Neil |journal=Literature & Aesthetics |date=June 2011 |volume=21|number=1}}</ref><ref>Richard Solomon, [http://www.library.umaine.edu/theses/pdf/solomonr2002.pdf Michael Chekhov and His Approach to Acting in Contemporary Performance Training], MA thesis University of Maine, 2002</ref>\n\nTogether with [[Marie von Sivers]], Rudolf Steiner also developed the art of [[eurythmy]], sometimes referred to as \"visible speech and song\". According to the principles of eurythmy, there are archetypal movements or gestures that correspond to every aspect of speech – the sounds (or [[phonemes]]), the rhythms, and the grammatical function – to every \"soul quality\" – joy, despair, tenderness, etc. – and to every aspect of music – tones, intervals, rhythms, and harmonies.\n\n== Philosophical ideas==\n\n=== Goethean science <!--linked from 'Goethean science'-->===\n{{See also|Goethean science}}\nIn his commentaries on Goethe's scientific works, written between 1884 and 1897, Steiner presented Goethe's approach to science as essentially [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] in nature, rather than theory- or model-based. He developed this conception further in several books, ''The Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception'' (1886) and ''Goethe's Conception of the World'' (1897), particularly emphasizing the transformation in Goethe's approach from the physical sciences, where experiment played the primary role, to plant biology, where both accurate perception and imagination were required to find the biological archetypes (''Urpflanze''), and postulated that Goethe had sought but been unable to fully find the further transformation in scientific thinking necessary to properly interpret and understand the animal kingdom.<ref name=Hemleben>Johannes Hemleben, ''Rudolf Steiner: A documentary biography'', Henry Goulden Ltd, 1975, ISBN 0-904822-02-8, pp. 37–49 and pp. 96–100 (German edition: Rowohlt Verlag, 1990, ISBN 3-499-50079-5)</ref> Steiner emphasized the role of evolutionary thinking in Goethe's discovery of the [[intermaxillary segment|intermaxillary bone]] in human beings; Goethe expected human anatomy to be an evolutionary transformation of animal anatomy.<ref name=Hemleben/>\n\nSteiner defended [[Goethe's theory of color|Goethe's qualitative description of color]] as arising synthetically from the polarity of light and darkness, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s particle-based and analytic conception.\n\n=== Knowledge and freedom ===\n{{See also|Philosophy of Freedom}}\nSteiner approached the philosophical questions of [[epistemology|knowledge]] and [[Free will|freedom]] in two stages. In his dissertation, published in expanded form in 1892 as ''Truth and Knowledge'', Steiner suggests that there is an inconsistency between Kant's philosophy, which posits that all knowledge is a representation of an essential verity inaccessible to human consciousness, and modern science, which assumes that all influences can be found in the sensory and mental world to which we have access. Steiner considered Kant's philosophy of an inaccessible beyond (\"Jenseits-Philosophy\") a stumbling block in achieving a satisfying philosophical viewpoint.<ref>[[Anthony Storr]], ''Feet of Clay'', Free Press-Simon and Schuster, 1996. Storr quotes Steiner p72, \"If, however, we regard the sum of all percepts as the one part and contrast with this a second part, namely the things-in-themselves, then we are philosophising into the blue. We are merely playing with concepts.\"</ref>\n\nSteiner postulates that the world is essentially an indivisible unity, but that our [[consciousness]] divides it into the [[senses|sense]]-perceptible appearance, on the one hand, and the formal nature accessible to our [[thinking]], on the other. He sees in thinking itself an element that can be strengthened and deepened sufficiently to penetrate all that our senses do not reveal to us. Steiner thus considered what appears to human experience as a division between the spiritual and natural worlds to be a conditioned result of the structure of our consciousness, which separates [[perception]] and thinking. These two faculties give us not two worlds, but two complementary views of the same world; neither has primacy and the two together are necessary and sufficient to arrive at a complete understanding of the world. In thinking about [[perception]] (the path of natural science) and perceiving the process of thinking (the path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] training), it is possible to discover a hidden inner unity between the two poles of our experience.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>{{rp|Chapter 4}} [[Truth]], for Steiner, is paradoxically both an objective discovery and yet \"a free creation of the human spirit, that never would exist at all if we did not generate it ourselves. The task of understanding is not to replicate in conceptual form something that already exists, but rather to create a wholly new realm, that together with the world given to our senses constitutes the fullness of reality.\"<ref>Steiner, Rudolf, ''Truth and Science'', Preface.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'', Steiner further explores potentials within thinking: freedom, he suggests, can only be approached gradually with the aid of the creative activity of thinking. Thinking can be a free deed; in addition, it can liberate our will from its subservience to our [[instinct]]s and [[motivation|drive]]s. Free deeds, he suggests, are those for which we are fully conscious of the motive for our action; freedom is the spiritual activity of penetrating with consciousness our own nature and that of the world,<ref>\"To be conscious of the laws underlying one's actions is to be conscious of one's freedom. The process of knowing ... is the process of development towards freedom.\" Steiner, GA3, pp. 91f, quoted in Rist and Schneider, p. 134</ref> and the real activity of acting in full consciousness.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>{{rp|133–4}} This includes overcoming influences of both heredity and environment: \"To be free is to be capable of thinking one's own thoughts – not the thoughts merely of the body, or of society, but thoughts generated by one's deepest, most original, most essential and spiritual self, one's individuality.\"<ref name=RAMcD/>\n\nSteiner affirms [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s and [[Haeckel]]'s [[evolution]]ary perspectives but extended this beyond its [[materialism|materialistic]] consequences; he sees human [[consciousness]], indeed, all human culture, as a product of natural evolution that transcends itself. For Steiner, nature becomes self-conscious in the human being. Steiner's description of the nature of human consciousness thus closely parallels that of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]]:<ref>Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', ISBN 0-7126-7332-6.

Solovyov: \"In human beings, the absolute subject-object appears ''as such'', i.e. as pure spiritual activity, containing all of its own objectivity, the whole process of its natural manifestation, but containing it totally ideally – in consciousness....The subject knows here only its own activity as an objective activity (sub specie object). Thus, the original identity of subject and object is restored in philosophical knowledge.\" (''The Crisis of Western Philosophy'', Lindisfarne 1996 pp. 42–3)</ref>\n\n=== Spiritual science ===\n{{See also|Anthroposophy|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}\nIn his earliest works, Steiner already spoke of the \"natural and spiritual worlds\" as a unity.<ref name=\"GL\"/> From 1900 on, he began lecturing about concrete details of the spiritual world(s), culminating in the publication in 1904 of the first of several systematic presentations, his ''Theosophy: An Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and in the Cosmos''. As a starting point for the book Steiner took a quotation from Goethe, describing the method of natural scientific observation,<ref>[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/RSP1965/GA009_c01.html ''Theosophy'', Chapter I: The Essential Nature of Man]</ref> while in the Preface he made clear that the line of thought taken in this book led to the same goal as that in his earlier work, ''The Philosophy of Freedom''.<ref>''Theosophy'',\nfrom the Prefaces to the First, Second, and Third Editions [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA009/English/AP1971/GA009_c01.html]</ref>\n\nIn the years 1903–1908 Steiner maintained the magazine \"Lucifer-Gnosis\" and published in it essays on topics such as initiation, reincarnation and karma, and knowledge of the supernatural world.<ref>[http://www.rsarchive.org/Articles/GA034/ Articles from \"Lucifer-Gnosis,\" 1903–1908]</ref>  Some of these were later collected and published as books, such as ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' (1904/5) and ''Cosmic Memory''. The book ''An Outline of Esoteric Science'' was published in 1910. Important themes include:\n* the human being as body, [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]];\n* the path of spiritual development;\n* spiritual influences on world-evolution and history; and\n* [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]].\n\nSteiner emphasized that there is an objective natural and spiritual world that can be known, and that perceptions of the spiritual world and incorporeal beings are, under conditions of training comparable to that required for the natural sciences, including self-discipline, replicable by multiple observers. It is on this basis that [[spiritual science]] is possible, with radically different epistemological foundations than those of natural science. He believed that natural science was correct in its methods but one-sided for exclusively focusing on sensory phenomena, while mysticism was vague in its methods, though seeking to explore the inner and spiritual life. Anthroposophy was meant to apply the systematic methods of the former to the content of the latter<ref>Steiner, ''Christianity as Mystical Fact and the Mysteries of Antiquity'', Anthroposophic Press 2006 ISBN 0880104368</ref><ref>One of Steiner's teachers, Franz Brentano, had famously declared that \"The true method of philosophy can only be the method of natural science\" (Walach, Harald, \"Criticism of Transpersonal Psychology and Beyond\", in The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology, ed. H. L. Friedman and G. Hartelius. P. 45.)</ref>\n\nFor Steiner, the cosmos is permeated and continually transformed by the creative activity of non-physical processes and spiritual beings. For the human being to become conscious of the objective reality of these processes and beings, it is necessary to creatively enact and reenact, within, their creative activity. Thus objective spiritual knowledge always entails creative inner activity.<ref name=\"GL\"/> Steiner articulated three stages of any creative deed:<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>{{rp|Pt II, Chapter 1}}\n* Moral intuition: the ability to discover or, preferably, develop valid ethical principles;\n* Moral imagination: the imaginative transformation of such principles into a concrete intention applicable to the particular situation ([[situational ethics]]); and\n* Moral technique: the realization of the intended transformation, depending on a mastery of practical skills.\n\nSteiner termed his work from this period onwards ''[[Anthroposophy]]''. He emphasized that the spiritual path he articulated builds upon and supports individual freedom and independent [[judgment]]; for the results of spiritual research to be appropriately presented in a modern context they must be in a form accessible to [[logic]]al understanding, so that those who do not have access to the spiritual experiences underlying anthroposophical research can make independent evaluations of the latter's results.<ref name=\"Schneider\">Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädagogik'', ISBN 3-608-93006-X</ref> Spiritual training is to support what Steiner considered the overall purpose of human evolution, the development of the mutually interdependent qualities of love and [[free will|freedom]].<ref name=RAMcD>Robert A. McDermott, \"Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy\", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', ISBN 0-8245-1444-0, p. 288ff</ref>\n\n=== Steiner and Christianity ===\nIn 1899 Steiner experienced what he described as a life-transforming inner encounter with the being of Christ; previously he had little or no relation to Christianity in any form. Then and thereafter, his relationship to Christianity remained entirely founded upon personal experience, and thus both non-denominational and strikingly different from conventional religious forms.<ref name=RAMcD/> Steiner was then 38, and the experience of meeting the Christ occurred after a tremendous inner struggle. To use Steiner's own words, the \"experience culminated in my standing in the spiritual presence of the Mystery of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] in a most profound and solemn festival of knowledge.\"<ref>Autobiography, Chapters In The Course Of My Life: 18611907, Rudolf Steiner, SteinerBooks, 2006</ref>\n\n==== Christ and human evolution ====\nSteiner describes Christ as the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and human history, redeeming [[The Fall of Man|the Fall]] from [[Paradise]].<ref name=\"Willmann\">Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', Kölner Veröffentlichungen zur Religionsgeschichte, Volume 27, ISBN 3-412-16700-2, especially Chapters 1.3, 1.4</ref> He understood the Christ as a being that unifies and inspires all religions, not belonging to a particular religious faith. To be \"Christian\" is, for Steiner, a search for balance between polarizing extremes<ref name=\"Willmann\"/>{{rp|102–3}} and the ability to manifest love in freedom.<ref name=RAMcD/>\n\nCentral principles of his understanding include:\n*The being of Christ is central to ''all'' religions, though called by different names by each.\n*Every religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born.\n*Historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed in our times in order to meet the ongoing evolution of humanity.\n\nIn Steiner's [[esoteric cosmology]], the spiritual development of humanity is interwoven in and inseparable from the cosmological development of the universe. Continuing the evolution that led to humanity being born out of the natural world, the Christ being brings an impulse enabling human consciousness of the forces that act creatively, but unconsciously, in nature.<ref>An Outline of Esoteric Science, Anthroposophic, SteinerBooks, 1997</ref>\n\n==== Divergence from conventional Christian thought ====\nSteiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include gnostic elements.<ref name=Hemleben/> However, unlike many gnostics, Steiner affirms the unique and actual physical Incarnation of Christ in Jesus at the beginning of the Christian era.\n\nOne of the central points of divergence with conventional Christian thought is found in [[Anthroposophy#Nature of the human being|Steiner's views on reincarnation and karma]].\n\nSteiner also posited two different Jesus children involved in the Incarnation of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]; the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"Essential\"/> He references in this regard the fact that the [[genealogy|genealogies]] in these two gospels list twenty-six (Luke) to forty-one (Matthew) completely different ancestors for the generations from [[King David|David]] to Jesus. See [[Genealogy of Jesus]] for alternative explanations of this radical divergence.\n\nSteiner's view of the [[second coming]] of Christ is also unusual. He suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but rather, meant that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, in the \"[[Etheric plane|etheric]] realm\" – i.e. visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life – for increasing numbers of people, beginning around the year 1933. He emphasized that the future would require humanity to recognize this Spirit of Love in all its genuine forms, regardless of how this is named. He also warned that the traditional name, \"Christ\", might be used, yet the true essence of this Being of Love ignored.<ref name=Hemleben/>\n\n==== The Christian Community ====\nIn the 1920s, Steiner was approached by [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], a [[Lutheran]] pastor with a congregation in Berlin, who asked if it was possible to create a more modern form of Christianity. Soon others joined Rittelmeyer – mostly Protestant pastors and theology students, but including several Roman Catholic priests. Steiner offered counsel on renewing the spiritual potency of the sacraments while emphasizing [[freedom of thought]] and a personal relationship to religious life. He envisioned a new synthesis of Catholic and Protestant approaches to religious life, terming this \"modern, [[John the Evangelist|Johannine Christianity]]\".<ref name=\"Essential\"/>\n\nThe resulting movement for religious renewal became known as \"[[The Christian Community]]\". Its work is based on a free relationship to the Christ, without dogma or policies. Its priesthood, which is open to both men and women, is free to preach out of their own spiritual insights and creativity.\n\nSteiner emphasized that the resulting movement for the renewal of Christianity was a personal gesture of help to a movement founded by Rittelmeyer and others independently of his anthroposophical work.<ref name=\"Essential\"/> The distinction was important to Steiner because he sought with Anthroposophy to create a scientific, not [[faith]]-based, spirituality.<ref name=\"Willmann\"/> He recognized that for those who wished to find more traditional forms, however, a renewal of the traditional religions was also a vital need of the times.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{see also|Anthroposophy#Reception}}\nSteiner's work has influenced a broad range of noted personalities.
