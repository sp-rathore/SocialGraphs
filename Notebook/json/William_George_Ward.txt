A [[Roman Catholic]] convert, his career illustrates the development of religious opinion at a time of crisis in the history of English religious thought.\n\n==Life==\nHe was the son of [[William Ward (cricketer)|William Ward]] and Emily Combe.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Ward, William (1787-1849)}}</ref> He was educated at [[Winchester College]]<ref>{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Ward, William George}}; [[John Firth (cricketer)|J. D'E. E. Firth]], ''Winchester College''.</ref> and went up to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], in 1830, but his father's financial difficulties forced him in 1833 to try for a scholarship at [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], which he succeeded in obtaining. Ward had a gift for [[pure mathematics]] but for history, [[applied mathematics]] or anything outside the exact sciences, he felt contempt. He was endowed with a strong sense of humour and a love of [[paradox]] carried to an extreme. His examination for mathematical honours exhibited some of the peculiarities of his character and mental powers. Four out of his five papers on applied mathematics were sent up absolutely blank. Honours, however, were not refused him, and in 1834 he obtained an open fellowship at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]].\n\nIn the previous year the [[tractarianism|Tractarian movement]] had been launched: Ward was attracted to it by his hatred of moderation and what he called \"respectability\". He was repelled by the conception he had formed of [[John Henry Newman]], whom he regarded as a mere antiquary. When, however, he was at length persuaded by a friend to go and hear Newman preach, he at once became a disciple. But he had, as Newman afterwards said of him, \"struck into the movement at an angle.\" He had no taste for historical investigations. He treated the question at issue as one of pure [[logic]]: disliking the Reformers, the right of private judgment which [[Protestant]]s claimed, and the somewhat prosaic uniformity of the English Church, he flung himself into a general campaign against [[Protestantism]] in general and the [[Anglican]] form of it in particular. He nevertheless took deacon's orders in 1838 and priest's orders in 1840.\n\n[[File:Bust of Ward by Raggi.jpg|thumb|220px|Bust of Ward, by [[Mario Raggi]].]]\nIn 1839 Ward became editor{{citation needed|date = January 2011}} of the ''[[British Critic]]'', the organ of the Tractarian party, and he excited suspicion among the adherents of the party by his violent denunciations of the Church to which he still belonged. In 1841 he urged the publication of the celebrated ''[[Tract 90]]'', and wrote in defence of it. From that period Ward and his associates worked undisguisedly for union with the Church of Rome, and in 1844 he published his ''Ideal of a Christian Church'', in which he openly contended that the only hope for the [[Church of England]] lay in submission to the Church of Rome. This publication brought to a height the storm which had long been gathering. The [[University of Oxford]] was invited, on 13 February 1845, to condemn ''[[Tract 90]]'', to censure the ''Ideal'', and to deprive Ward from his degrees. The two latter propositions were carried with Ward being deprived of his tutorship and ''[[Tract 90]]'' only escaped censure by the ''non placet'' of the proctors, Guillemard and Church.\n\nWard left the Church of England in September 1845, and was followed by many others, including [[John Henry Newman|Newman]] himself. After his reception into the Church of Rome, Ward devoted himself to [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]] and [[moral philosophy]]. He wrote articles on [[free will]], the philosophy of [[theism]], on science, prayer and miracles for the ''Dublin Review''. He also dealt with the condemnation of [[Pope Honorius I]], carried on a controversial correspondence with [[John Stuart Mill]], and took a leading part in the discussions of the [[Metaphysical Society]],<ref>Hutton, R.H. (1885). [https://archive.org/stream/twentiethcentury18londuoft#page/176/mode/2up \"The Metaphysical Society: A Reminiscence\"], ''The Nineteenth Century'', Vol. XVIII, No. 102, pp. 177–196.</ref> founded by [[James Thomas Knowles (1831-1908)|James Knowles]], of which [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T H Huxley]] and [[James Martineau]] were also prominent members. He was an opponent of Liberal Catholicism and defender of papal authority.\n\nIn 1851 he became professor of moral philosophy at [[St Edmund's College (Ware)|St Edmund's College]], [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], and the following year he was appointed to the chair of dogmatic theology. In 1863 he became editor of the [[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|Dublin Review]] (1863–1878). He supported the promulgation of the [[dogma]] of [[Papal Infallibility]] in 1870. After his admission into the Roman Catholic Church he had married, and for a time had to struggle with poverty. But his circumstances later improved.\n\n==Family==\nWard was the grandnephew of [[Robert Plumer Ward]], the nephew of Sir [[Henry George Ward]], and the son of [[William Ward (cricketer)|William Ward]].\n\nHe was the father of Newman's biographer, [[Wilfrid Philip Ward]]; a grandfather of Father Leo Ward,<ref>Not to be confused with Leo L. Ward, [[Congregation of the Holy Cross|CSC]], or Leo R.
