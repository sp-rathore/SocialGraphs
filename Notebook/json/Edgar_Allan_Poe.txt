Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and the [[macabre]].  He is widely regarded as a central figure of [[Romanticism]] in the United States and American literature as a whole, and he was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the short story. Poe is generally considered the inventor of the [[detective fiction]] genre and is further credited with contributing to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]].<ref>{{harvnb|Stableford|2003|pp=18–19}}</ref> He was the first well-known American writer to try to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.<ref name = Meyers138/>\n\nPoe was born in [[Boston]], the second child of two actors. His father abandoned the family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned, the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They never formally adopted him, but Poe was with them well into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by gambling, and the cost of secondary education for the young man. Poe attended the [[University of Virginia]] for one semester but left due to lack of money. Poe quarreled with Allan over the funds for his education and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name. It was at this time that his publishing career began, albeit humbly, with the anonymous collection of poems ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'' (1827), credited only to \"a Bostonian\". With the death of Frances Allan in 1829, Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement. However, Poe later failed as an officer cadet at [[West Point]], declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he ultimately parted ways with John Allan.\n\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]]. In Richmond in 1836, he married [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], his 13-year-old cousin. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"[[The Raven]]\" to instant success. His wife died of [[tuberculosis]] two years after its publication. For years, he had been planning to produce his own journal ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), though he died before it could be produced. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7, 1849, at age 40; the cause of his death is unknown and has been variously attributed to alcohol, brain congestion, [[cholera]], drugs, heart disease, [[rabies]], suicide, tuberculosis, and other agents.<ref name=\"Meyers256\"/>\n\nPoe and his works influenced literature in the United States and around the world, as well as in specialized fields such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]. Poe and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The [[Mystery Writers of America]] present an annual award known as the [[Edgar Award]] for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe Birthplace Boston.jpg|thumb|This plaque in [[Boston]] marks the ''approximate'' location<ref name=\"RavenRet\"/> where Edgar Poe was born.]]\n\nHe was born Edgar Poe in [[Boston]] on January 19, 1809, the second child of English-born actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]] and actor [[David Poe, Jr.]]. He had an elder brother [[William Henry Leonard Poe]], and a younger sister Rosalie Poe.<ref name=Allen>{{harvnb|Allen|1927|p=}}</ref> Their grandfather David Poe Sr. had emigrated from [[County Cavan|Cavan]], Ireland to America around the year 1750.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=13}}</ref> Edgar may have been named after a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', a play that the couple were performing in 1809.<ref>{{harvnb|Nelson|1981|p=65}}</ref> His father abandoned their family in 1810,<ref>{{harvnb|Canada|1997|p=}}</ref> and his mother died a year later from consumption ([[pulmonary tuberculosis]]). Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful Scottish merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]] who dealt in a variety of goods, including tobacco, cloth, wheat, tombstones, and [[slavery|slaves]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=8}}</ref> The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\",<ref name=Meyers9>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=9}}</ref> though they never formally adopted him.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=61}}</ref>\n\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.<ref name=Meyers9/> The family sailed to Britain in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]], Scotland (where John Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of London.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=16–18}}</ref>\n\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond, Virginia in 1820. In 1824, Poe served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as Richmond [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|celebrated the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette]].<ref>{{harvnb|PoeMuseum.org|2006}}</ref> In March 1825, John Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt, said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond, died,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=20}}</ref> leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000. By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick home named Moldavia.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=27–28}}</ref>\n\nPoe may have become engaged to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] before he registered at the one-year-old [[University of Virginia]] in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=29–30}}</ref><ref>University of Virginia.

It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=21–22}}</ref> During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=32–34}}</ref> Poe gave up on the university after a year, not feeling welcome in Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer.<ref name=Meyers32>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=32}}</ref> At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le Rennet.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=41}}</ref>\n\n===Military career===\n[[File:FtIndependence2.jpg|left|thumb|Poe was first stationed at Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] while in the army.]]\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a private on May 27, 1827 using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". He claimed that he was {{nowrap|22 years old}} even though he was 18.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=13}}</ref> He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five&nbsp;dollars a month.<ref name=Meyers32/> That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry entitled ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50&nbsp;copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=33–34}}</ref> Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for [[artillery]], and had his monthly pay doubled.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=35}}</ref> He served for two&nbsp;years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a noncommissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. He revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer Lieutenant Howard. Howard would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with John Allan and wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic. Several months passed and pleas to Allan were ignored; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, John Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|pp=43–47}}</ref>\n\nPoe finally was discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=38}}</ref> Before entering West Point, Poe moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|pp=13–14}}</ref> Meanwhile, Poe published his second book ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'' in Baltimore in 1829.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=5}}</ref>\n\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.<ref>{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=32}}</ref> In October 1830, John Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2002|p=14}}</ref> The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=54–55}}</ref> Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. Poe tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=49–51}}</ref>\n\nHe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems.'' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75&nbsp;cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|pp=50–51}}</ref> It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition,\" and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \"Tamerlane\" and \"Al Aaraaf\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \"[[To Helen]]\", \"[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Israfel (1831)|Israfel]]\", and \"[[The City in the Sea]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hecker|2005|pp=53–54}}</ref> He returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831.

They were married for eleven years until her early death, which may have inspired some of his writing.]]\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose. He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''. The ''[[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]'' awarded Poe a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=162}}</ref> The story brought him to the attention of [[John P. Kennedy]], a Baltimorean of considerable means. He helped Poe place some of his stories, and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=225}}</ref> but was discharged within a few weeks for having been caught drunk by his boss.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=73}}</ref> Returning to Baltimore, Poe obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\">{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=124}}</ref> He was 26 and she was 13.\n\nHe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.<ref name=Allen/> He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=85}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838.<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=137}}</ref> In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the ''Southern Literary Messenger''. Also in 1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two&nbsp;volumes, though he made little money off of it and it received mixed reviews.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=113}}</ref> Poe left ''Burton's'' after about a year and found a position as assistant at ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|pp=39, 99}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1840, Poe published a prospectus announcing his intentions to start his own journal called ''[[The Stylus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=119}}</ref> Originally, Poe intended to call the journal ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia. In the June 6, 1840 issue of Philadelphia's ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', Poe bought advertising space for his prospectus: ''\"Prospectus of the Penn Magazine, a Monthly Literary journal to be edited and published in the city of Philadelphia by Edgar A.

It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. [[T. S. Eliot]] said: \"It is difficult for us to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hoffman|1998|p=76}}</ref> Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as \"a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization\".<ref>{{harvnb|Krutch|1926|p=98}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Raven Manet D2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Illustration by French impressionist [[Édouard Manet]] for the [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] translation of \"[[The Raven]]\", 1875. Digitally restored.]]\n\n===Literary influence===\nDuring his lifetime, Poe was mostly recognized as a literary critic. Fellow critic [[James Russell Lowell]] called him \"the most discriminating, philosophical, and fearless critic upon imaginative works who has written in America\", suggesting—rhetorically—that he occasionally used [[prussic acid]] instead of ink.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=432}}</ref> Poe's caustic reviews earned him the reputation of being a \"tomahawk man\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Rhetoric and Style|last=Zimmerman|first=Brett|year=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=0-7735-2899-7|pages=85–87}}</ref> A favorite target of Poe's criticism was Boston's acclaimed poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], who was often defended by his literary friends in what was later called \"The Longfellow War\". Poe accused Longfellow of \"the heresy of the didactic\", writing poetry that was preachy, derivative, and thematically plagiarized.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Paul|title=Quoth the detective: Edgar Allan Poe's case against the Boston literati|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2011/03/06/quoth_the_detective/?page=full|work=boston.com|publisher=Globe Newspaper Company|accessdate=2013-04-09|date=March 6, 2011}}</ref> Poe correctly predicted that Longfellow's reputation and style of poetry would decline, concluding, \"We grant him high qualities, but deny him the Future\".<ref name=BosLitHist>{{cite web|title=Longfellow's Serenity and Poe's Prediction|url=http://www.bostonliteraryhistory.com/chapter-5|work=Forgotten Chapters of Boston's Literary History|publisher=The Trustees of Boston College|accessdate=2012-05-22|format=Exhibition at Boston Public Library and Massachusetts Historical Society|date=March 28 – July 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPoe was also known as a writer of fiction and became one of the first American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States.<ref name=Meyers258>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=258}}</ref> Poe is particularly respected in France, in part due to early translations by [[Charles Baudelaire]]. Baudelaire's translations became definitive renditions of Poe's work throughout Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Harner|1990|p=218}}</ref>\n\nPoe's early [[detective fiction]] tales featuring [[C. Auguste Dupin]] laid the groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] said, \"Each [of Poe's detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=103}}</ref> The [[Mystery Writers of America]] have named their awards for excellence in the genre the \"[[Edgar Award|Edgars]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2002|p=206}}</ref> Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably [[Jules Verne]], who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' called ''[[An Antarctic Mystery]]'', also known as ''The Sphinx of the Ice Fields''.<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=364}}</ref> Science fiction author [[H. G. Wells]] noted, \"''Pym'' tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Magistrale|1997|p=372}}</ref>\n\nLike many famous artists, Poe's works have spawned imitators.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=281}}</ref> One trend among imitators of Poe has been claims by [[clairvoyance|clairvoyants]] or [[psychics]] to be \"channeling\" poems from Poe's spirit. One of the most notable of these was Lizzie Doten, who published ''Poems from the Inner Life'' in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit. The compositions were re-workings of famous Poe poems such as \"[[The Bells (poem)|The Bells]]\", but which reflected a new, positive outlook.<ref>{{harvnb|Carlson|1996|p=476}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe 2 retouched and transparent bg.png|upright|thumb|1848 \"Ultima Thule\" [[daguerreotype]] of Poe]]\nEven so, Poe has received not only praise, but criticism as well. This is partly because of the negative perception of his personal character and its influence upon his reputation.<ref name=Meyers258/> [[William Butler Yeats]] was occasionally critical of Poe and once called him \"vulgar\".<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=274}}</ref> [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] reacted to \"The Raven\" by saying, \"I see nothing in it\",<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=265}}</ref> and derisively referred to Poe as \"the jingle man\".<ref>{{harvnb|New York Times|1894}}</ref> [[Aldous Huxley]] wrote that Poe's writing \"falls into vulgarity\" by being \"too poetical\"—the equivalent of wearing a diamond ring on every finger.<ref>{{harvnb|Huxley|1967|p=32}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that only 12 copies have survived of Poe's first book ''Tamerlane and Other Poems''. In December 2009, one copy sold at [[Christie's]], New York for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.<ref>{{harvnb|New York Daily News|2009}}</ref>\n\n===Physics and cosmology===\n''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem]]'', an essay written in 1848, included a cosmological theory that presaged the [[Big Bang]] theory by 80 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Cappi|1994}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rombeck|2005}}</ref> as well as the first plausible solution to [[Olbers' paradox]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|1987|p=}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Smoot|Davidson|1994|p=}}</ref>\nPoe eschewed the scientific method in ''Eureka'' and instead wrote from pure [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]].<ref name=Meyers214>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=214}}</ref> For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science,<ref name=Meyers214/> but insisted that it was still true<ref>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=399}}</ref> and considered it to be his career masterpiece.<ref>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=219}}</ref> Even so, ''Eureka'' is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored [[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian principles]] regarding the density and rotation of planets.<ref>{{harvnb|Sova|2001|p=82}}</ref>\n\n===Cryptography===\nPoe had a keen interest in [[cryptography]]. He had placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper ''Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger'', inviting submissions of [[cipher]]s which he proceeded to solve.<ref name=Silverman152>{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=152}}</ref> In July 1841, Poe had published an essay called \"A Few Words on Secret Writing\" in ''[[Graham's Magazine]]''. Capitalizing on public interest in the topic, he wrote \"[[The Gold-Bug]]\" incorporating ciphers as an essential part of the story.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|pp=2, 6}}</ref> Poe's success with cryptography relied not so much on his deep knowledge of that field (his method was limited to the simple [[Substitution cipher|substitution cryptogram]]) as on his knowledge of the magazine and newspaper culture. His keen analytical abilities, which were so evident in his detective stories, allowed him to see that the general public was largely ignorant of the methods by which a simple substitution cryptogram can be solved, and he used this to his advantage.<ref name=Silverman152/> The sensation that Poe created with his cryptography stunts played a major role in popularizing cryptograms in newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Friedman|1993|pp=40–41}}</ref>\n\nPoe had an influence on cryptography beyond increasing public interest during his lifetime. [[William Friedman]], America's foremost cryptologist, was heavily influenced by Poe.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|p=15}}</ref> Friedman's initial interest in cryptography came from reading \"The Gold-Bug\" as a child, an interest that he later put to use in deciphering Japan's [[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]] code during [[World War II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenheim|1997|p=146}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n===As a character===\n{{Main article|Edgar Allan Poe in popular culture|Edgar Allan Poe in television and film}}\nThe historical Edgar Allan Poe has appeared as a fictionalized character, often representing the \"mad genius\" or \"tormented artist\" and exploiting his personal struggles.<ref>{{harvnb|Neimeyer|2002|p=209}}</ref> Many such depictions also blend in with characters from his stories, suggesting that Poe and his characters share identities.<ref>{{harvnb|Gargano|1967|p=165}}</ref> Often, fictional depictions of Poe use his mystery-solving skills in such novels as ''[[The Poe Shadow]]'' by [[Matthew Pearl]].<ref>{{harvnb|Maslin|2006}}</ref>\n\n===Preserved homes, landmarks, and museums===\n{{anchor|Preserved homes, landmarks, and museums}}\n[[File:PoeNHS.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site]] in Philadelphia is one of several preserved former residences of Poe.]]\nNo childhood home of Poe is still standing, including the Allan family's Moldavia estate. The oldest standing home in Richmond, the Old Stone House, is in use as the [[Edgar Allan Poe Museum (Richmond)|Edgar Allan Poe Museum]], though Poe never lived there. The collection includes many items that Poe used during his time with the Allan family, and also features several rare first printings of Poe works. 13 West Range is the dorm room that Poe is believed to have used while studying at the University of Virginia in 1826; it is preserved and available for visits. Its upkeep is now overseen by a group of students and staff known as the [[Raven Society]].<ref>{{harvnb|The Raven Society|2014}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest surviving home in which Poe lived is in Baltimore, preserved as the [[Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum]].

Of the several homes that Poe, his wife Virginia, and his mother-in-law Maria rented in Philadelphia, only the last house has survived.
