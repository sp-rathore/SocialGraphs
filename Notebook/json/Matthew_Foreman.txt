He has made notable contributions in [[set theory]] and in [[ergodic theory]].\n\n==Biography==\n\nBorn in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], Foreman earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley in 1980 under [[Robert M. Solovay]]. His\ndissertation title was ''Large Cardinals and Strong Model Theoretic Transfer\nProperties''.\n\nIn addition to his mathematical work, Foreman is an avid sailor. He and his family\nsailed their sailboat  ''Veritas'' (a C&C 44 [[C&C Yachts]]) from North America to\nEurope in 2000. From 2000&ndash;2008 they sailed Veritas to the Arctic, the Shetland\nIslands, Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, North Africa and Italy. Notable\nhigh points were Fastnet Rock, Irish and Celtic seas and many passages including the\nMaelstrom, Stad, Pentland Firth, Loch Ness, the Corryveckan and the Irish Sea.\nFurther south they sailed through the Chenal du Four and Raz de Sein, across the Bay\nof Biscay and around Cape Finisterre.  After entering Gibraltar, Foreman and his\nfamily circumnavigated the Western Mediterranean with notable stops in Barcelona,\nMorocco, Tunisia, Sicily, Naples, Sardinia and Corsica. In 2009, Foreman and his son\nand guest crew circumnavigated Newfoundland.<ref>Foreman, Zachary (2007) \"Under\nWay\", Cruising World Magazine, October 2007</ref> Foreman has been recognized for\nhis sailing by twice winning the Ullman Trophy.<ref>Tailwind, [[Balboa Yacht Club]]\n\"Annual Awards\", 2003, 2011</ref>\n\n==Work==\nForeman began his career in set theory. His early work with [[W. Hugh Woodin|Hugh Woodin]] included\nshowing that it is consistent that the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) (see\n[[Continuum Hypothesis]]) fails at every infinite cardinal.<ref>Foreman, M.;\nWoodin, W. Hugh: The generalized continuum hypothesis can fail everywhere, \n''Ann. of Math.'', (2) '''133'''(1991), no. 1, 1&ndash;35</ref>\nIn joint work with [[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]] and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] he formulated [[Martin's maximum]], a provably\nmaximal form of [[Martin's axiom]] and showed its consistency. <ref>Foreman, M.;\nMagidor, M.; Shelah, S.: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals, and nonregular\nultrafilters. I, ''[[Annals of Mathematics|Ann. of Math.]]'' (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 1, 1&ndash;47</ref>\n<ref>Foreman, M.; Magidor, M.; Shelah, S: Martin's maximum, saturated ideals and\nnonregular ultrafilters. II, ''Ann. of Math.'', (2), '''127'''(1988), no. 3, 521&ndash;545.</ref>\nForeman's later work in set theory was primarily concerned with developing the\nconsequences of generic large cardinal axioms.<ref>Foreman, M.; Ideals and generic\nelementary embeddings. Handbook of Set Theory, Vol 2, pp. 885-1147, Springer, 2010.\n</ref> He also worked on classical \"Hungarian\" [[Infinitary combinatorics|partition relations]], mostly with\n[[András Hajnal]].<ref>Foreman, M; Hajnal, A.: A partition relation for successors of large\ncardinals, ''[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]]'', '''325'''(2003), no. 3, 583–623.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s Foreman became interested in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] theory and [[ergodic theory]]. With [[Randall Dougherty]] he settled the Marczewski problem (1930) by showing\nthat there is a Banach-Tarski decomposition of the unit ball in which all pieces\nhave the property of Baire (see [[Banach-Tarski paradox]]).<ref>Dougherty, R;\nForeman, M. Banach-Tarski decompositions using sets with the property of Baire. J.\nAmer. Math. Soc. 7 (1994), no. 1, 75–124</ref> A consequence is the existence of a\ndecomposition of an open dense subset of the unit ball into disjoint open\nsets that can be rearranged by isometries to form two open dense subsets of the unit ball. With F. Wehrung, Foreman showed that the [[Hahn-Banach theorem]] implied the\nexistence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set, even in the absence of any other form of\nthe [[axiom of choice]].<ref>Foreman, M.; Wehrung, F. The Hahn-Banach theorem\nimplies the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set. Fund. Math. 138 (1991), no.\n1, 13–19.</ref>\n\nThis naturally led to attempts to apply the tools of [[descriptive set theory]] to\nclassification problems in [[ergodic theory]]. His first work in this direction,\nwith F. Beleznay,<ref>Beleznay, F.; Foreman, M. The collection of distal flows is\nnot Borel. Amer. J. Math. 117 (1995), no. 1, 203–239.</ref> showed that classical\ncollections were beyond the [[Borel hierarchy]] in complexity. This was followed\nshortly by a proof of the analogous results for measure preserving transformations\nwith generalized discrete spectrum. In a collaboration with [[Benjamin Weiss]]\n<ref>Foreman, M.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]]: An anti-classification theorem for ergodic measure\npreserving transformations, ''[[Journal of the European Mathematical Society|J. Eur. Math. Soc.]]'' (JEMS), '''6'''(2004), no. 3,\n277&ndash;292.</ref> and Daniel Rudolph <ref>Foreman, M.; Rudolph, D. J.; [[Benjamin Weiss|Weiss, B.]] The\nconjugacy problem in ergodic theory. Ann. of Math. (2) 173 (2011), no. 3,\n1529–1586.</ref> Foreman showed that no residual class of measure preserving\ntransformations can have algebraic invariants and that the isomorphism relation on\nergodic measure preserving transformations in not Borel. This negative result\nfinished a program proposed by von Neumann in the 1932.<ref>von Neumann, J. Zur\nOperatorenmethode in der klassischen Mechanik. Ann. of Math. (2), 33(3):587–642,\n1932</ref> This result was extended by Foreman and Weiss to show that smooth area\npreserving diffeomorphisms of the 2-torus are unclassifiable.\n\nForeman's work in set theory continued during this period. He co-edited (with [[Akihiro Kanamori|Kanamori]]) the \n''Handbook of Set Theory''  and showed that various combinatorial properties of ω<sub>2</sub> and\nω<sub>3</sub> are equiconsistent with [[huge cardinal]]s.<ref>Foreman, Matthew: [[Smoke and mirrors]]: combinatorial properties of small cardinals equiconsistent with huge cardinals, ''[[Advances in Mathematics|Adv. Math.]]'', '''222'''(2009), no. 2, 565&ndash;595.\n</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foreman, Matthew}}\n[[Category:American logicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:1957 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:University of California, Irvine faculty]]\n[[Category:Set theorists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Matthew Foreman"}}}}
