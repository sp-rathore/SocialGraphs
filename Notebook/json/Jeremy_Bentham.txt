He trained as a lawyer and, though he never practised, was called to the [[Bar (law)|bar]] in 1769.

Although the prison was never built, the concept had an important influence on later generations of thinkers. Twentieth-century French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] argued that the Panopticon was paradigmatic of several 19th-century \"disciplinary\" institutions.<ref>{{cite book |first=Michel |last=Foucault |title=Discipline and Punish:  the Birth of the Prison |translator=Alan Sheridan |publisher=Penguin |place=Harmondsworth |year=1977 |ISBN=9780140137224 |pages=200, 249–56}}</ref>\n\nBentham became convinced that his plans for the Panopticon had been thwarted by the King and an aristocratic elite acting in their own interests. It was largely because of his brooding sense of injustice that he developed his ideas of \"sinister interest\" – that is, of the vested interests of the powerful conspiring against a wider public interest – which underpinned many of his broader arguments for reform.<ref>Schofield 2009, pp. 90–93.</ref>\n\nMore successful was his cooperation with [[Patrick Colquhoun]] in tackling the corruption in the [[Pool of London]].

[[Adam Smith]], for example, opposed free interest rates before he was made aware of Bentham's arguments on the subject. As a result of his correspondence with [[Honoré Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] and other leaders of the [[French Revolution]], Bentham was declared an honorary citizen of France.<ref>Bentham, Jeremy, Philip Schofield, Catherine Pease-Watkin, and Cyprian Blamires (eds), ''Rights, Representation, and Reform: Nonsense upon Stilts and Other Writings on the French Revolution'', Oxford: Oxford UP, 2002, p. 291.</ref> He was an outspoken critic of the revolutionary discourse of [[natural rights]] and of the violence that arose after the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] took power (1792). Between 1808 and 1810, he held a personal friendship with [[Latin American wars of independence|Latin American Independence]] Precursor [[Francisco de Miranda]] and paid visits to Miranda's Grafton Way house in London.\n\nIn 1823, he co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for the \"[[Historical radicalism#Political reform|Philosophical Radicals]]\"{{spaced ndash}}a group of younger disciples through whom Bentham exerted considerable influence in British public life.<ref>Joseph Hamburger, ''Intellectuals in politics: John Stuart Mill and the Philosophical Radicals'' (Yale University Press, 1965); William Thomas, ''The philosophic radicals: nine studies in theory and practice, 1817–1841'' (Oxford, 1979)</ref> One was [[John Bowring]], to whom Bentham became devoted, describing their relationship as \"son and father\": he appointed Bowring political editor of the ''Westminster Review'', and eventually his [[literary executor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bartle|1963}}</ref> Another was [[Edwin Chadwick]], who wrote on hygiene, sanitation and policing and was a major contributor to the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]]: Bentham employed Chadwick as a secretary and bequeathed him a large legacy.<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1968|p=94}}</ref>\n\nAn insight into his character is given in Michael St. John Packe's ''The Life of John Stuart Mill'':\n{{quote| During his youthful visits to [[Bowood House]], the country seat of his patron [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Lansdowne]], he had passed his time at falling unsuccessfully in love with all the ladies of the house, whom he courted with a clumsy jocularity, while playing chess with them or giving them lessons on the harpsichord.

He had continued to write up to a month before his death, and had made careful preparations for the [[dissection]] of his body after death and its preservation as an auto-icon. As early as 1769, when Bentham was 21 years old, he made a will leaving his body for dissection to a family friend, the physician and chemist [[George Fordyce]], whose daughter, Maria Sophia (1765–1858), married Jeremy's brother [[Samuel Bentham]].<ref name=\"Jeremy Bentham\">{{cite ODNB|id=2153|title=Bentham, Jeremy|origyear=2004|year=2014|last=Rosen|first=F.}}</ref> A paper written in 1830, instructing [[Thomas Southwood Smith]] to create the auto-icon, was attached to his last will, dated 30 May 1832.<ref name=\"Jeremy Bentham\"/>\n\nOn 8 June 1832, two days after his death, invitations were distributed to a select group of friends, and on the following day at 3 p.m., Southwood Smith delivered a lengthy oration over Bentham's remains in the Webb Street School of Anatomy & Medicine in [[Southwark]], London.

However, Southwood Smith's experimental efforts at mummification, based on practices of the indigenous people of [[New Zealand]] and involving placing the head under an air pump over sulphuric acid and simply drawing off the fluids, although technically successful, left the head looking distastefully macabre, with dried and darkened skin stretched tautly over the skull.<ref name=\"Jeremy Bentham\"/> The Auto-icon was therefore given a [[wax]] head, fitted with some of Bentham's own hair.

He not only proposed many legal and social reforms, but also expounded an underlying moral principle on which they should be based. This philosophy of [[utilitarianism]] took for its \"fundamental axiom\", ''it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong''\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=A Fragment on Government |place=London |year=1776 }}, Preface (2nd para.).</ref> Bentham claimed to have borrowed this concept from the writings of [[Joseph Priestley]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=On the Liberty of the Press, and Public Discussion |place=London |year=1821 |page=24 }}</ref> although the closest that Priestley in fact came to expressing it was in the form \"the good and happiness of the members, that is the majority of the members of any state, is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Priestley |first=Joseph |title=An Essay on the First Principles of Government |place=London |year=1768 |page=17 }}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[greatest happiness principle]]\", or the principle of utility, forms the cornerstone of all Bentham's thought. By \"happiness\", he understood a predominance of \"pleasure\" over \"pain\". He wrote in ''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'':\n\n{{quote|Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do. On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne. They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think ...<ref>{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=The Principles of Morals and Legislation |year=1789 |page=1 }} (Chapter I)</ref>}}\n\nBentham and Thomas Hobbes were the only major figures in the history of philosophy to endorse psychological egoism.<ref>http://www.iep.utm.edu/psychego/</ref>  As to religious values, however, while Hobbes was an avowed Anglican, Bentham was a determined opponent of religion.  Crimmins observes:  \"Between 1809 and 1823 Jeremy Bentham carried out an exhaustive examination of religion with the declared aim of extirpating religious beliefs, even the idea of religion itself, from the minds of men.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Crimmins|first=James E.|title=Bentham on Religion:  Atheism and the Secular Society|date=1986|volume=47|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|page=95 at 95}}</ref>\n\nBentham suggested a procedure for estimating the moral status of any action, which he called the Hedonistic or [[felicific calculus]]. Utilitarianism was revised and expanded by Bentham's student [[John Stuart Mill]]. In Mill's hands, \"Benthamism\" became a major element in the [[classical liberalism|liberal]] conception of state policy objectives.\n\nIn his exposition of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, by which we might test the \"happiness factor\" of any action.<ref>Bentham, Jeremy. ''The Principles of Morals and Legislation'' (1789) Ch IV.</ref> Nonetheless, it should not be overlooked that Bentham's \"hedonistic\" theory (a term from [[J.J.C. Smart]]), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of [[justice]]. In ''Bentham and the Common Law Tradition'', Gerald J. Postema states: \"No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion...\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerald J. |last=Postema |title=Bentham and the Common Law Tradition |place=Oxford |year=1986 |page=148 }}</ref> Thus, some critics{{who|date=January 2013}} object, it would be acceptable to [[torture]] one person if this would produce an amount of happiness in other people outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in ''Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law'', Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law \"provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being\".<ref>{{cite book |first=P. J. |last=Kelly |year=1990 |title=Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law |place=Oxford |page=81 }}</ref> It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows \"[[expectation utilities]]\" to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many.\n\nBentham's ''[[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]'' focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. His principle of utility regards \"good\" as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure and the minimum amount of pain and \"evil\" as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society. He lays down a set of criteria for measuring the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create.\n\nThe criteria are divided into the categories of intensity, duration, certainty, proximity, productiveness, purity, and extent. Using these measurements, he reviews the concept of punishment and when it should be used as far as whether a punishment will create more pleasure or more pain for a society. He calls for legislators to determine whether punishment creates an even more evil offence. Instead of suppressing the evil acts, Bentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with, and calls upon legislators to measure the pleasures and pains associated with any legislation and to form laws in order to create the greatest good for the greatest number. He argues that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared \"right\", because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for a society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintain the maximum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest number of people.\n\n=== Economics ===\n[[File:Bentham - Defence of usury, 1788 - 5231094.tif|thumb|''Defence of usury'', 1788]]\n{{Hedonism}}Bentham's opinions about [[money|monetary economics]] were completely different from those of [[David Ricardo]]; however, they had some similarities to those of [[Henry Thornton (abolitionist)|Henry Thornton]]. He focused on [[monetary expansion]] as a means of helping to create [[full employment]]. He was also aware of the relevance of forced saving, [[propensity to consume]], the saving-investment relationship, and other matters that form the content of modern income and employment analysis. His monetary view was close to the fundamental concepts employed in his model of utilitarian decision making. His work is considered to be an early precursor of modern [[welfare economics]].\n\nBentham stated that pleasures and pains can be ranked according to their value or \"dimension\" such as intensity, duration, certainty of a pleasure or a pain. He was concerned with maxima and minima of pleasures and pains; and they set a precedent for the future employment of the maximisation principle in the economics of the consumer, the firm and the search for an optimum in welfare economics.<ref>Spiegel (1991). ''The Growth of Economic Thought'', Ed.3. Duke University. ISBN 0-8223-0973-4. p. 341–343.</ref>\n\n=== Law reform ===\nBentham was the first person to aggressively advocate for the [[codification (law)|codification]] of ''all'' of the [[common law]] into a coherent set of statutes; he was actually the person who coined the verb \"to codify\" to refer to the process of drafting a legal code.<ref name=\"morriss\">Andrew P. Morriss, ''Codification and Right Answers,'' 74 Chic.-Kent L. Rev. 355 (1999).</ref> He lobbied hard for the formation of codification commissions in both England and the United States, and went so far as to write to President [[James Madison]] in 1811 to volunteer to write a complete legal code for the young country. After he learned more about American law and realized that most of it was state-based, he promptly wrote to the governors of every single state with the same offer.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Bentham's codification efforts were completely unsuccessful. Even today, they have been completely rejected by almost every common law jurisdiction, including England. However, his writings on the subject laid the foundation for the moderately successful codification work of [[David Dudley Field II]] in the United States a generation later.<ref name=\"morriss\" />\n\n=== Animal rights ===\nBentham is widely regarded as one of the earliest proponents of [[animal rights]], and has even been hailed as \"the first patron saint of animal rights\".<ref>Benthall, Jonathan.

Latest edition: Adamant Media Corporation, 2005.</ref> In 1789, alluding to the limited degree of legal protection afforded to [[slave]]s in the [[French West Indies]] by the [[Code Noir]], he wrote:\n\n{{quote|The day has been, I am sad to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day ''may'' come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs, the [[Hair follicle|villosity]] of the skin, or the termination of the ''[[Sacrum|os sacrum]]'' are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of [[Speech communication|discourse]]? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they ''reason''? nor, Can they ''talk''? but, Can they ''suffer''?<ref name=Benthamch17>Bentham, Jeremy. ''[http://www.econlib.org/library/Bentham/bnthPML18.html Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]'', second edition, 1823, chapter 17, footnote.</ref>}}\n\nEarlier in that paragraph, Bentham makes clear that he accepted that animals could be killed for food, or in defence of human life, provided that the animal was not made to suffer unnecessarily. Bentham did not object to [[Animal testing|medical experiments]] on animals, providing that the experiments had in mind a particular goal of benefit to humanity, and had a reasonable chance of achieving that goal. He wrote that otherwise he had a \"decided and insuperable objection\" to causing pain to animals, in part because of the harmful effects such practices might have on human beings. In a letter to the editor of the ''Morning Chronicle'' in March 1825, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I never have seen, nor ever can see, any objection to the putting of dogs and other inferior animals to pain, in the way of medical experiment, when that experiment has a determinate object, beneficial to mankind, accompanied with a fair prospect of the accomplishment of it. But I have a decided and insuperable objection to the putting of them to pain without any such view. To my apprehension, every act by which, without prospect of preponderant good, pain is knowingly and willingly produced in any being whatsoever, is an act of cruelty; and, like other bad habits, the more the correspondent habit is indulged in, the stronger it grows, and the more frequently productive of its bad fruit. I am unable to comprehend how it should be, that to him to whom it is a matter of amusement to see a dog or a horse suffer, it should not be matter of like amusement to see a man suffer; seeing, as I do, how much more morality as well as intelligence, an adult quadruped of those and many other species has in him, than any biped has for some months after he has been brought into existence; nor does it appear to me how it should be, that a person to whom the production of pain, either in the one or in the other instance, is a source of amusement, would scruple to give himself that amusement when he could do so under an assurance of impunity.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle| page=2 |newspaper=Morning Chronicle |location=London |date=9 March 1825 |url=http://find.galegroup.com/bncn/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&scale=1.00&orientation=&sort=DateAscend&docLevel=FASCIMILE&prodId=BNWS&tabID=T012&subjectParam=Locale%2528en%252C%252C%2529%253ALQE%253D%2528jn%252CNone%252C6%2529%25221ZUA%2522%253AAnd%253ALQE%253D%2528da%252CNone%252C10%252903%252F09%252F1825%2524&searchId=R5&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=4&qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3ALQE%3D%28jn%2CNone%2C6%29%221ZUA%22%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C10%2903%2F09%2F1825%24&retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&subjectAction=DISPLAY_SUBJECTS&inPS=true&userGroupName=ucl_ttda&sgCurrentPosition=0&docId=BC3207301704&docId=&docLevel=FASCIMILE&workId=&relevancePageBatch=&contentSet=LTO&callistoContentSet=&docPage=article&mcode=&issueNum=&recNum=CT3207301703&newScale=0.33&newOrientation=0BA3207301703}}{{subscription}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Gender and sexuality ===\nBentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose, at the age of eleven, the career of a reformist.<ref>Miriam Williford, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2709019 Bentham on the rights of Women]</ref> Bentham spoke for a complete equality between sexes.\n\nThe essay [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html ''Offences Against One's Self,''] argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexual sex.<ref>Boralevi, ''Bentham and the Oppressed.'' p. 40</ref> The essay remained unpublished during his lifetime for fear of offending public morality.

For example, journalism puts power-holders under moral scrutiny. However, Bentham wanted such transparency to apply to everyone.

His direct involvement was limited to his buying a single £100 share in the new University, making him just one of over a thousand shareholders.<ref name=\"Harte\">Harte, Negley \"The owner of share no. 633: Jeremy Bentham and University College London\", in Catherine Fuller (ed.), ''The Old Radical: representations of Jeremy Bentham'' (London: UCL, 1998), pp. 5–8.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Four founders of UCL.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry Tonks]]' imaginary scene of Bentham approving the building plans of London University]]\nBentham and his ideas can nonetheless be seen as having inspired several of the actual founders of the University. He strongly believed that education should be more widely available, particularly to those who were not wealthy or who did not belong to the established church; in Bentham's time, membership of the [[Church of England]] and the capacity to bear considerable expenses were required of students entering the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. As the University of London was the first in England to admit all, regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], creed or political belief, it was largely consistent with Bentham's vision. There is some evidence that, from the sidelines, he played a \"more than passive part\" in the planning discussions for the new institution, although it is also apparent that \"his interest was greater than his influence\".<ref name=\"Harte\" /> He failed in his efforts to see his disciple [[John Bowring]] appointed professor of English or History, but he did oversee the appointment of another pupil, [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]], as the first professor of [[Jurisprudence]] in 1829.\n\nThe more direct associations between Bentham and UCL{{spaced ndash}}the College's custody of his Auto-icon (see above) and of the majority of his surviving papers{{spaced ndash}}postdate his death by some years: the papers were donated in 1849, and the Auto-icon in 1850. A large painting by [[Henry Tonks]] hanging in UCL's [[John Flaxman|Flaxman Gallery]] depicts Bentham approving the plans of the new university, but it was executed in 1922 and the scene is entirely imaginary. Since 1959 (when the Bentham Committee was first established) UCL has hosted the Bentham Project, which is progressively publishing a definitive edition of Bentham's writings.\n\nUCL now endeavours to acknowledge Bentham's influence on its foundation, while avoiding any suggestion of direct involvement, by describing him as its \"spiritual founder\".<ref name=\"UCL Academic Figures\" />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham House.jpg|thumb|upright|Jeremy Bentham House in [[Bethnal Green]], [[East London]]; a modernist apartment block named after the philosopher]]\n\nBentham was an obsessive writer and reviser, but was constitutionally incapable, except on rare occasions, of bringing his work to completion and publication.<ref>Lucas and Sheeran 2006, pp. 26–7.</ref> Most of what appeared in print in his lifetime (see this [http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/bentham/benbib.htm list of published works]) was prepared for publication by others.

The edition was described by the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' on first publication as \"incomplete, incorrect and ill-arranged\", and has since been repeatedly criticised both for its omissions and for errors of detail; while Bowring's memoir of Bentham’s life included in volumes 10 and 11 was described by Sir [[Leslie Stephen]] as \"one of the worst biographies in the language\".<ref>{{harvnb|Bartle|1963|p=27}}</ref> Nevertheless, Bowring's remained the standard edition of most of Bentham's writings for over a century, and is still only partially superseded: it includes such interesting writings on international<ref name=\"neologisms\">a word [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Bentham-Project/tools/neologisms Bentham himself coined]</ref> relations as Bentham's [[A Plan for an Universal and Perpetual Peace]] written 1786–89, which forms part IV of the [[Principles of International Law]].\n\n==== Stark (1952–54) ====\nIn 1952–54, [[Werner Stark]] published a three-volume set, ''Jeremy Bentham's Economic Writings'', in which he attempted to bring together all of Bentham's writings on economic matters, including both published and unpublished material.

[[Transcribe Bentham]] is an award-winning [[crowdsourced]] manuscript transcription project, run by [[University College London]]'s Bentham Project,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bentham-project |title=The Bentham Project |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> in partnership with UCL's [[UCL Centre for Digital Humanities]], UCL Library Services, UCL Learning and Media Services, the [[University of London Computer Centre]], and the online community. The project was launched in September 2010 and is making freely available, via a specially designed transcription interface, digital images of UCL's vast Bentham Papers collection – which runs to some 60,000 manuscript folios – to engage the public and recruit volunteers to help transcribe the material. Volunteer-produced transcripts will contribute to the Bentham Project's production of the new edition of ''The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham'', and will be uploaded to UCL's digital Bentham Papers repository,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/bentham |title=UCL digital Bentham collection |publisher=Ucl.ac.uk |date=20 August 1996 |accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref> widening access to the collection for all and ensuring its long-term preservation.
