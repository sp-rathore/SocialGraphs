His translations of Shakespeare turned the English dramatist's works into German classics.<ref name=\"colliers\"/> Schlegel was also the first professor of [[Sanskrit]] in Continental Europe and produced a translation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Domenico Quaglio Marktkirche Hannover.jpg|thumb|links|Die Marktkirche Anfang des 19.&nbsp;Jahrhunderts;<br />\nÖlgemälde nach [[Domenico Quaglio the Younger|Domenico Quaglio]] von 1832]]\n\nSchlegel was born in [[Hanover]], where his father, [[Johann Adolf Schlegel]], was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor. He was educated at the Hanover gymnasium and at the [[University of Göttingen]].{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} Initially studying theology, he received a thorough philological training under [[Christian Gottlob Heyne|Heyne]] and became an admirer and friend of [[Gottfried August Bürger|Bürger]], with whom he was engaged in an ardent study of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Petrarch]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Schlegel met with [[Caroline Schelling|Caroline Böhmer]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]. In 1790 his brother [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]] came to Göttingen. Both were influenced by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]], [[Johann Winckelmann]] and [[Karl Theodor von Dalberg]]. From 1791 to 1795, Schlegel was tutor for the children of Mogge Muilman, a Dutch banker, who lived at the prestigious Herengracht in [[Amsterdam]].\n\nIn 1796, soon after his return to Germany, Schlegel settled in [[Jena]], following an invitation of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]].{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}} That year he married [[Caroline Schelling|Caroline]], the widow of the physician Böhmer.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} She assisted Schlegel in some of his literary productions, and the publication of her correspondence in 1871 established for her a posthumous reputation as a German letter writer. She separated from Schlegel in 1801 and became the wife of the philosopher Schelling soon after.{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}}\n\nIn Jena, Schlegel made critical contributions to [[Die Horen (Schiller)|Schiller's ''Horen'']], to that author's ''[[Musen-Almanach]]'',{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} and wrote around 300 articles for the ''Jenaer Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung''. He also did translations from Dante and Shakespeare. This work established his literary reputation and gained for him in 1798 an extraordinary professorship at the [[University of Jena]]. His house became the intellectual headquarters of the \"romanticists\", and was visited at various times between 1796 and 1801 by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], whose ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]'' was studied intensively, his brother Friedrich, who moved in with his wife [[Dorothea Schlegel|Dorothea]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]], [[Novalis]] and others.{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}}\n\n{{quote|It is widely accepted that the Romantic Movement in Germany emerged, on the one hand, as a reaction against the aesthetical ideals defended in [[Classicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]], and on the other, as a deviation from the rational principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] with the consequent regression to the irrational spirit of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">Hay, Katia D., \"August Wilhelm von Schlegel\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N.

With his brother, Schlegel founded ''[[Athenaeum (German magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' (1798–1800), the organ of the Romantic school, in which he dissected disapprovingly the immensely popular works of the sentimental novelist [[August Lafontaine]].<ref name=Zeitlaeufte>Dirk Sangmeister, [http://www.zeit.de/1999/31/Der_Lieblingsdichter_der_Nation_ Der Lieblingsdichter der Nation...], article in German newspaper ''Die Zeit'' no. 31, 1999.</ref> He also published a volume of poems, and carried on a rather bitter controversy with [[August von Kotzebue|Kotzebue]]. At this time the two brothers were remarkable for the vigour and freshness of their ideas, and commanded respect as the leaders of the new Romantic criticism. A volume of their joint essays appeared in 1801 under the title ''Charakteristiken und Kritiken''. His playwright ''Ion'', performed in Weimar in January 1802, supported by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], became a failure.\n\n{{quote|When the work of art appears as if all its elements had been consciously chosen by a power above the artist, it has style; when the artist has not transcended his/her individuality, then s/he is categorized as a mannerist artist (SW III, 309–312).<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/>}}\n\nIn 1801 Schlegel went to [[Berlin]], where he delivered lectures on art and literature; and in the following year he published ''Ion'', a tragedy in [[Euripides|Euripidean]] style, which gave rise to a suggestive discussion on the principles of dramatic poetry. This was followed by ''Spanisches Theater'' (2 vols, 1803/1809), in which he presented admirable translations of five of [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]]'s plays; and in another volume, ''Blumensträusse italienischer, spanischer und portugiesischer Poesie'' (1804), he gave translations of [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] lyrics; his translations included works by [[Dante Aligheri|Dante]] and [[Luís de Camões|Camões]].{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}<ref name=\"colliers\"/>\n\nSchlegel's translation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], begun in Jena, was ultimately completed, under the superintendence of [[Ludwig Tieck]], by Tieck's daughter [[Dorothea Tieck|Dorothea]] and [[Wolf Heinrich Graf von Baudissin]]. This rendering is considered one of the best poetical translations in German, or indeed in any language.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} Schlegel's sister-in-law (his brother Friedrich's wife) was an aunt of composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]].<ref>[http://www.portlandchamberorchestra.org/2006_2007_Season/March/felix-mendelssohn.htm Portland Chamber Orchestra] {{wayback|url=http://www.portlandchamberorchestra.org/2006_2007_Season/March/felix-mendelssohn.htm |date=20080807161256 }}</ref> In 1826, Mendelssohn, at the age of 17, was inspired by August Wilhelm's translation of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' to write his [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|concert overture for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'']].\n\nAfter divorcing his wife Caroline, in 1804, Schlegel traveled in France, Germany, Italy and other countries with [[Madame de Staël]], as tutor to her sons and adviser in her literary work. She owed to him many of the ideas which she embodied in her work, ''De l'Allemagne''. In 1807 he attracted much attention in France by an essay in the [[French language]], ''Comparaison entre la Phèdre de Racine et celle d'Euripide'', in which he attacked French classicism from the standpoint of the Romantic school. His lectures on dramatic art and literature (''Über dramatische Kunst und Literatur'', 1809–1811), which have been translated into most European languages, were delivered at [[Vienna]] in 1808.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}}\n\n{{quote|For Schlegel, the magic of a work of art is that it brings us into a different world, with all its own internal coherence, and this is why it needs to become organic and complete unto itself. Therefore, its purpose should not be to reflect the real world with naturalism, but rather to create its own world, which could never be a question of applying a set of rules and principles to a particular matter (paintings, words, marble), such as classicist principles seemed to do.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/>}}\n\nFrom 1813 to 1817, he acted as secretary of the crown prince of Sweden, through whose influence the right of his family to noble rank was revived. After this, he joined again the household of Mme. de Staël until her death in 1817. Schlegel was made a professor of literature at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1818, and during the remainder of his life occupied himself chiefly with oriental studies. He founded a special printing office for [[Sanskrit]]. As an orientalist, he was unable to adapt himself to the new methods opened by [[Franz Bopp|Bopp]].{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}} He corresponded with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], a linguist.\n\nHe continued to lecture on art and literature, in 1827 published ''On the Theory and History of the Plastic Arts'',<ref name=\"colliers\">{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Schlegel, August Wilhelm von}}</ref> and in 1828 issued two volumes of critical writings (''Kritische Schriften''). In 1823-1830 he published the journal ''Indische Bibliothek'' and edited (1823) the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' with a [[Latin]] translation, and (1829) the ''Ramayana''. This was followed by his 1832 work ''Reflections on the Study of the Asiatic Languages''.<ref name=\"colliers\"/>{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nAfter the death of Madame de Staël, Schlegel married (1818) a daughter of [[Heinrich Paulus]], but this union was dissolved in 1821.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}}\n\nIn 1835, Schlegel became head of the committee organising a monument to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in [[Bonn]]. He died in Bonn in 1845,{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} three months before the official unveiling of the [[Beethoven Monument, Bonn|Beethoven Monument]].\n\n==Evaluations==\nIn the opinion of the anonymous author of the Schlegel article in the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]]:\n{{quote| \nAs an original poet Schlegel is unimportant, but as a poetical translator he has rarely been excelled, and in criticism he put into practice the Romantic principle that a critic's first duty is not to judge from the standpoint of superiority, but to understand and to “characterize” a work of art.{{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} }}\n\nTraugott Böhme, in his article for the 1920 [[Encyclopedia Americana]], gives the following thoughts:\n{{quote|\nAs a critic [Schlegel] carried on the tradition of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. Without possessing Lessing's power of style and personality, [Schlegel] commanded a wider range of artistic susceptibility. His unerring linguistic and historical scholarship and the calm objectivity of his judgment enabled him to carry out, even more successfully than Herder himself, Herder's demand that literary criticism should be based on a sympathetic penetration into the specific individuality of each poetic production rather than on the application of preconceived aesthetic standards.\n\nSchlegel established models for the new method of analytical and interpretative criticism in his essays on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Hermann and Dorothea]]'' and on [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. His Vienna lectures ''On Dramatic Art and Literature'' were translated into most of the languages of Europe and stand as a permanent contribution to critical literature; his definition of the terms “classic” and “romantic” met with general recognition; his views on the so-called “three unities” and on the “correctness” of Shakespeare evoked an especially strong echo in England and finally made the [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]ian attitude toward Shakespeare appear obsolete.\n\nFormal perfection of language is the chief merit of his poems, which suffer from a lack of originality. In his drama ''Ion'', he vainly attempted to rival Goethe's [[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|''Iphigenie'']]. He prided himself on being “model and master in the art of sonnets” among the Germans. He is at his best in sparkling literature parodies such as ''Ehrenpforte und Triumphbogen für Kotzebue'' (1801).{{sfn|Traugott Böhme|1920}} }}\n\nThe 1905 [[New International Encyclopedia]], in its article on Schlegel, gives the following opinions:\n{{quote|\nThe Schlegel-Tieck translation is universally considered better than any other rendering of Shakespeare in a foreign language. Thanks to Schlegel and Tieck, Shakespeare has become a national poet of Germany.\n\n. . .\n\n[Schlegel's] ''Spanisches Theater'' (1803-09), consisting of five pieces of Calderon's, admirably translated, . . . [made] that poet a favorite with the German people, and his ''Blumensträusse der italienischen, spanischen und portugiesischen Poesie'' (Berlin, 1804), a charming collection of southern lyrics, [marks] the appearance of . . . the naturalization in German verse of the metrical forms of the Romanic races.\n\n. . .\n\nSchlegel was quarrelsome, jealous, and ungenerous in his relations with literary men, and did not even shrink from slander when his spleen was excited.}}\n\n==Honors==\n* Elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1836.<ref>[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlists American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]</ref>\n\n==Portraits==\n* ''Portrait of A.
