He wrote several novels and collections of poetry such as ''[[Poems and Ballads]]'', and contributed to the famous [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Eleventh Edition]] of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. A controversial figure at the time, Swinburne was a [[sado-masochist]] and alcoholic and was obsessed with the [[Middle Ages]] and [[lesbianism]].<ref name=to>{{cite news|author1=John O‘Connell|title=Sex and books: London's most erotic writers|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/books/sex-and-books-londons-most-erotic-writers|accessdate=26 November 2015|work=Time Out|date=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nSwinburne wrote about many [[taboo]] topics, such as lesbianism, [[cannibalism]], [[sado-masochism]], and [[anti-theism]].

E. Housman]], a more measured and even somewhat hostile critic, had great praise for his rhyming ability:\n\n:[Swinburne] possessed an altogether unexampled command of rhyme, the chief enrichment of modern verse. The English language is comparatively poor in rhymes, and most English poets, when they have to rhyme more than two or three words together, betray their embarrassment. They betray it, for instance, when they write sonnets after the strict Petrarchian rule: the poetical inferiority of most English sonnets, if compared with what their own authors have achieved in other forms of verse, is largely though not entirely the result of this difficulty. [...] To Swinburne the sonnet was child’s play: the task of providing four rhymes was not hard enough, and he wrote long poems in which each stanza required eight or ten rhymes, and wrote them so that he never seemed to be saying anything for the rhyme’s sake.<ref name=Housman>{{cite news | author=[[A.E.

This is at least somewhat contextual, as it tends to mirror the popular and academic consensus regarding his work, although his ''Poems and Ballads, First Series'' and his ''Atalanta in Calydon'' have never been out of critical favour. ''Atalanta in Calydon'' in particular has been lauded as one of his best early works, written in 1865, before the passionate excesses of later works earned him a sordid reputation for blasphemy and depravity among contemporary critics.<ref name=\"Algernon Swinburne: The Critical Heritage\">{{cite book|last=Hyder|first=Clyde|title=Algernon Swinburne: The Critical Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1134781725|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[T.

Writing on Swinburne in 'The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism', Eliot said, of Swinburne, he had mastered his material, writing 'he is more reliable to them than [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], or [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Lamb]]: and his perception of relative values is almost always correct'. However, Eliot judged Swinburne did not master it to the extent of being able to take liberties with it, which is everything.<ref>Eliot T.S. ''Reflections on Vers Libre'' New Statesman 1917</ref> Furthermore, Eliot disliked Swinburne's prose, about which he wrote \"the tumultuous outcry of adjectives, the headstrong rush of undisciplined sentences, are the index to the impatience and perhaps laziness of a disorderly mind.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Eliot|first=T.

Also featured in this volume are \"[[Hymn to Proserpine]]\", \"[[The Triumph of Time]]\" and \"[[Dolores (Notre-Dame des Sept Douleurs)]]\".\n\nSwinburne devised the poetic form called the [[Roundel (poem)|roundel]], a variation of the French [[Rondeau (poetry)|Rondeau]] form, and some were included in ''A Century of Roundels'' dedicated to [[Christina Rossetti]].  Swinburne wrote to [[Edward Burne-Jones]] in 1883: \"I have got a tiny new book of songs or songlets, in one form and all manner of metres ... just coming out, of which Miss Rossetti has accepted the dedication. I hope you and Georgie ''[his wife Georgiana, one of the [[MacDonald sisters]]]'' will find something to like among a hundred poems of nine lines each, twenty-four of which are about babies or small children\". Opinions of these  poems vary between those who find them captivating and brilliant, to those who find them merely clever and contrived.  One of them, ''A Baby's Death'', was set to music by the English composer [[Sir Edward Elgar]] as the song ''[[Roundel: The little eyes that never knew Light]]''.\n\nSwinburne was influenced by the work of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Catullus]], [[William Morris]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Robert Browning]], [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Maxwell |first=Catherine |year=2012| title=Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |publication-place=Cambridge |page= |url= http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/CCOL9780521895156.018 |accessdate=4 December 2015 }}</ref> While he was popular in England during his life, Swinburne's influence has greatly decreased since his death.\n\nAfter the first ''Poems and Ballads'', Swinburne's later poetry was devoted more to philosophy and politics, including the unification of Italy, particularly in the volume ''[[Songs before Sunrise]]''.
