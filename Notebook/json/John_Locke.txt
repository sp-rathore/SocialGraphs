Locke was the first to define the self through a continuity of ''[[consciousness]]''. He postulated that, at birth, the [[mind]] was a blank slate or ''[[tabula rasa]]''. Contrary to [[Descartes|Cartesian]] philosophy based on pre-existing concepts, he maintained that we are born without [[innate ideas]], and that [[knowledge]] is instead [[empiricism|determined only by experience]] derived from [[the senses|sense]] [[perception]].<ref>{{Citation |last1 =Baird |first1 =Forrest E | first2 =Walter | last2 = Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year= 2008 |location= Upper Saddle River, [[New Jersey|NJ]] |pages = 527–29 |isbn = 0-13-158591-6}}</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\nLocke's father, also called John, was a [[country lawyer]] and clerk to the Justices of the Peace in [[Chew Magna]],<ref>{{Citation | last =Broad | first = CD |year=2000 |title=Ethics And the History of Philosophy |publisher = Routledge |location=UK|isbn=0-415-22530-2}}</ref> who had served as a captain of cavalry for the [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces during the early part of the [[English Civil War]]. His mother was Agnes Keene. Both parents were [[Puritan]]s. Locke was born on 29 August 1632, in a small thatched [[cottage]] by the church in [[Wrington]], Somerset, about 12 miles from [[Bristol]]. He was [[baptism|baptised]] the same day. Soon after Locke's birth, the family moved to the [[market town]] of [[Pensford]], about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] house in [[Belluton]].\n\nIn 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious [[Westminster School]] in London under the sponsorship of [[Alexander Popham]], a member of Parliament and his father's former commander. After completing studies there, he was admitted to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], in the autumn of 1652 at the age of twenty. The dean of the college at the time was [[John Owen (theologian)|John Owen]], vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found the works of modern philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], more interesting than the [[classics|classical]] material taught at the university. Through his friend [[Richard Lower (physician)|Richard Lower]], whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the [[Royal Society]], of which he eventually became a member.\n\nLocke was awarded a [[bachelor's degree]] in February 1656 and a master's degree in June 1658.<ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=locke |title=John Locke |last=Uzgalis |first=William}}</ref> He obtained a [[bachelor of medicine]] in February 1675,<!---older sources give 1674-->{{Sfn | Waldron | 1997 | p = 116}} having studied medicine extensively during his time at Oxford and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as [[Robert Boyle]], [[Thomas Willis]], [[Robert Hooke]] and Richard Lower. In 1666, he met Lord [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a [[liver]] infection. Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.\n\nLocke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury's home at Exeter House in London, to serve as Lord Ashley's personal physician. In London, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of [[Thomas Sydenham]]. Sydenham had a major effect on Locke's natural philosophical thinking{{spaced ndash}}an effect that would become evident in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]].''\n\nLocke's medical knowledge was put to the test when Shaftesbury's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo surgery (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.\n\nDuring this time, Locke served as Secretary of the [[Board of Trade|Board of Trade and Plantations]] and Secretary to the [[Lords Proprietor|Lords Proprietor of Carolina]], which helped to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John Locke]]\nShaftesbury, as a founder of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] movement, exerted great influence on Locke's political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Shaftesbury became [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1672. Following Shaftesbury's fall from favour in 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across France as tutor and medical attendant to [[Caleb Banks]].<ref name=Henning>{{Citation|url= https://books.google.com/?id=HW1_upECKUwC&pg=PA590&lpg=PA590&dq=%22Caleb+Banks%22+Aylesford#v=onepage&q=%22Caleb%20Banks%22%20Aylesford&f=false | first = Basil Duke | last = Henning | title = The House of Commons, 1660–1690 | volume = 1 |publisher= Google |accessdate= 28 August 2012|isbn= 9780436192746|date= 1983-01-01}}</ref> He returned to England in 1679 when Shaftesbury's political fortunes took a brief positive turn. Around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury's prompting, Locke composed the bulk of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. While it was once thought that Locke wrote the ''Treatises'' to defend the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, recent scholarship has shown that the work was composed well before this date.{{Sfn | Laslett | 1988 | loc = III. ''Two Treatises of Government'' and the Revolution of 1688}} The work is now viewed as a more general argument against [[absolute monarchy]] (particularly as espoused by [[Robert Filmer]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]]) and for individual consent as the basis of [[political legitimacy]]. Although Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about [[natural and legal rights|natural rights]] and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.\n\nLocke fled to the [[Netherlands]] in 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the [[Rye House Plot]], although there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme. The philosopher and novelist [[Rebecca Newberger Goldstein]] argues that during his five years in Holland, Locke chose his friends \"from among the same freethinking members of dissenting Protestant groups as [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]] small group of loyal confidants. [Baruch Spinoza had died in 1677.] Locke almost certainly met men in Amsterdam who spoke of the ideas of that renegade Jew who... insisted on identifying himself through his religion of reason alone.\" While she says that \"Locke's strong empiricist tendencies\" would have \"disinclined him to read a grandly metaphysical work such as Spinoza's ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', in other ways he was deeply receptive to Spinoza's ideas, most particularly to the rationalist's well thought out argument for political and religious tolerance and the necessity of the separation of church and state.\"<ref>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, ''Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew Who Gave Us Modernity'', New York: Schocken Books (2006), pp. 260–61</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the ''Essay'' and composing the ''Letter on Toleration.'' Locke did not return home until after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. Locke accompanied [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s wife back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke's publishing took place upon his return from exile{{spaced ndash}}his aforementioned ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', the ''Two Treatises of Civil Government'' and ''[[A Letter Concerning Toleration]]'' all appearing in quick succession.\n\nLocke's close friend [[Lady Masham]] invited him to join her at the Mashams' country house in Essex. Although his time there was marked by variable health from [[asthma]] attacks, he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as [[John Dryden]] and [[Isaac Newton]].\n\nHe died on 28 October 1704, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of [[High Laver]],<ref>{{Citation | title = Britannica Online | contribution = John Locke}}.</ref> east of [[Harlow]] in Essex, where he had lived in the household of Sir Francis Masham since 1691. Locke never married nor had children.\n\nEvents that happened during Locke's lifetime include the [[English Restoration]], the [[Great Plague of London]] and the [[Great Fire of London]]. He did not quite see the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], though the thrones of England and Scotland were held in [[personal union]] throughout his lifetime. [[Constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary democracy]] were in their infancy during Locke's time.\n\n==Influence==\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Locke's ''Two Treatises'' were rarely cited. Historian Julian Hoppit said of the book, \"except among some Whigs, even as a contribution to the intense debate of the 1690s it made little impression and was generally ignored until 1703 (though in Oxford in 1695 it was reported to have made 'a great noise')\".<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty? England. 1689–1727'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2000), p. 195.</ref> [[John Philipps Kenyon|John Kenyon]], in his study of British political debate from 1689 to 1720, has remarked that Locke's theories were \"mentioned so rarely in the early stages of the [Glorious] Revolution, up to 1692, and even less thereafter, unless it was to heap abuse on them\" and that \"no one, including most Whigs, [were] ready for the idea of a notional or abstract contract of the kind adumbrated by Locke\".<ref>John Kenyon, ''Revolution Principles. The Politics of Party. 1689–1720'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 200.</ref> In contrast, Kenyon adds that [[Algernon Sidney]]'s ''Discourses Concerning Government'' were \"certainly much more influential than Locke's ''Two Treatises''\".<ref>Kenyon, p. 51. Kenyon adds: \"Any unbiassed study of the position shows in fact that it was Filmer, not Hobbes, Locke or Sidney, who was the most influential thinker of the age\". Kenyon, p. 63.</ref>\n\nIn the 50 years after Queen Anne's death in 1714, the ''Two Treatises'' were reprinted only once (except in the collected works of Locke). However, with the rise of American resistance to British taxation, the ''Second Treatise'' gained a new readership; it was frequently cited in the debates in both America and Britain. The first American printing occurred in 1773 in Boston.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=16885|title=Locke, John (1632–1704)|origyear=2004|year=2008|last=Milton|first=John R.}}</ref>\n\nLocke exercised a profound influence on political philosophy, in particular on modern liberalism. Michael Zuckert has argued that Locke launched liberalism by tempering Hobbesian absolutism and clearly [[separation of church and state|separating the realms of Church and State]]. He had a strong influence on [[Voltaire]] who called him \"''le sage'' Locke\". His arguments concerning [[liberty]] and the [[social contract]] later influenced the written works of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]]. In fact, one passage from the ''Second Treatise'' is reproduced verbatim in the Declaration of Independence, the reference to a \"long train of abuses\". Such was Locke's influence that Thomas Jefferson wrote: \"[[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]... I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".<ref>{{cite web | title = The Three Greatest Men | url = http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm033.html | accessdate  = 13 June 2009 | quote = Jefferson identified [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], Locke, and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] as \"the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception\".

Locke redefined subjectivity, or self, and intellectual historians such as [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and Jerrold Seigel argue that Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690) marks the beginning of the modern Western conception of the self.<ref>Seigel, Jerrold. ''The Idea of the Self: Thought and Experience in Western Europe since the Seventeenth Century.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2005).</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Charles | last = Taylor | title = Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity | place = Cambridge | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1989}}.</ref>\n\n===Theories of religious tolerance===\nLocke, writing his ''Letters Concerning Toleration'' (1689–92) in the aftermath of the [[European wars of religion]], formulated a classic reasoning for religious tolerance. Three arguments are central: (1) Earthly judges, the state in particular, and human beings generally, cannot dependably evaluate the truth-claims of competing religious standpoints; (2) Even if they could, enforcing a single \"true religion\" would not have the desired effect, because belief cannot be compelled by violence; (3) Coercing religious uniformity would lead to more social disorder than allowing diversity.<ref>[[Alister McGrath|McGrath, Alister]]. 1998. ''Historical Theology, An Introduction to the History of Christian Thought.'' Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. pp. 214–5.</ref>\n\nWith regard to his position on religious tolerance, Locke was influenced by [[Baptist]] theologians like [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]] and [[Thomas Helwys]], who had published tracts demanding freedom of conscience in the early 17th century.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 18}}<ref>{{Citation | language = German | first = H | last = Stahl | contribution = Baptisten | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1957}}, 3. Auflage, Band I, col. 863</ref>  Baptist theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] founded the colony [[Rhode Island]] in 1636, where he combined a democratic constitution with unlimited religious freedom. His tract ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of Conscience]]'' (1644), which was widely read in the mother country, was a passionate plea for absolute religious freedom and the total separation of church and state.{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | pp = 102–5}}  Freedom of conscience had had high priority on the theological, philosophical and political agenda, since [[Martin Luther]] refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at Worms in 1521, unless he would be proved false by the Bible.{{Sfn | Olmstead | 1960 | p = 5}}\n\n===Constitution of Carolina===\nAppraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of liberalism in general, and to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that (in 1671) he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the [[Royal African Company]]. In addition, he participated in drafting the ''[[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]]'' while [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]'s secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves. For example, [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] notes that Locke, as a secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations (1673–4) and a member of the Board of Trade (1696–1700), was in fact, \"one of just half a dozen men who created and supervised both the colonies and their iniquitous systems of servitude\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Martin | last = Cohen | title = Philosophical Tales | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2008 | page = 101}}.</ref> Some see his statements on [[enclosure|unenclosed]] [[property]] as having been intended to justify the displacement of the Native Americans.<ref>{{Citation | first = James | last = Tully | title = An Approach to Political Philosophy: Locke in Contexts | place = New York | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007|page=128|isbn=978-0521436380}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | doi= 10.1177/0090591786014002005 | title= I.

Collectively, these documents are known as the [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]].\n\n===Theory of value and property===\nLocke uses the word ''property'' in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues that property is a natural right and it is derived from [[manual labour|labour]].\n\nIn Chapter V of his ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise]]'', Locke argues that the individual ownership of goods and property is justified by the labour exerted to produce those goods or utilise property to produce goods beneficial to human society.<ref name=labortheory>{{Citation|last=Vaughn|first=Karen|title=John Locke and the Labor Theory of Value|journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=1978|volume=2|issue=4|pages=311–326|url=https://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_3.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nLocke stated his belief, in his ''Second Treatise'', that nature on its own provides little of value to society, implying that the labour expended in the creation of goods gives them their value. This position can be seen as a [[labour theory of value]].<ref name=labortheory/>\n\nFrom this premise, Locke developed a [[labour theory of property]], namely that ownership of [[property]] is created by the application of labour. In addition, he believed that property precedes government and government cannot \"dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily.\" [[Karl Marx]] later critiqued Locke's theory of property in his own social theory.\n\n===Political theory===\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n{{See also|Two Treatises of Government}}\nLocke's political theory was founded on [[social contract]] theory. Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], Locke believed that [[human nature]] is characterised by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed people to be selfish. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a [[State of nature#Locke's view on the state of nature|natural state]] all people were equal and independent, and everyone had a natural right to defend his \"Life, health, Liberty, or Possessions\".<ref name = \"locke\">{{Citation | last = Locke | first = John | title = Second Treatise of Government | edition = 10th | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] | year = 1690 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/7370/7370-h/7370-h.htm | accessdate =25 March 2012}}</ref> Most scholars trace the phrase \"[[life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]],\" in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|American Declaration of Independence]], to Locke's theory of rights,<ref>{{Citation | last = Zuckert |first=Michael|title=The Natural Rights Republic|year= 1996|publisher= Notre Dame University Press|pages = 73–85}}</ref> though other origins have been suggested.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wills|first=Garry|title=Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co|year= 2002}}</ref>\n\nLike Hobbes, Locke assumed that the sole right to defend in the state of nature was not enough, so people established a [[civil society]] to resolve conflicts in a civil way with help from government in a state of society. However, Locke never refers to Hobbes by name and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day.<ref>{{Citation | last = Skinner | first = Quentin | title = Visions of Politics | place = Cambridge}}.</ref> Locke also advocated governmental [[separation of powers]] and believed that revolution is not only a [[Right of revolution|right]] but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]].\n\n====Limits to accumulation====\n{{See also|Lockean proviso}}\nAccording to Locke, unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature,<ref>{{Citation|last= Locke | first = John|title= Two Treatises on Government: A Translation Into Modern English|year= 2009|publisher= Industrial Systems Research |isbn= 978-0-906321-47-8| page= 81| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S3eB0IgzJjoC&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=John+Locke+unused+property+waste+offence+against+nature#v=onepage&q=unused%20property&f=false}}</ref>  but, with the introduction of \"durable\" goods, men could exchange their excessive perishable goods for goods that would last longer and thus not offend the natural law. In his view, the introduction of money marks the culmination of this process, making possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage.<ref>{{cite web | title = John Locke: Inequality is inevitable and necessary | url = http://www0.hku.hk/philodep/courses/ac/Phil1003-2008/Locke2.ppt|publisher=Department of Philosophy The University of Hong Kong| accessdate = 1 September 2011 | format = MS PowerPoint}}</ref>  He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be \"hoarded up without injury to anyone,\"<ref>{{cite web| first =John | last = Locke | title = Second Treatise | at = §§ 25–51, 123–26|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch16s3.html|publisher= The Founders Constitution|accessdate=1 September 2011}}</ref> since they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor. In his view, the introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property. Locke is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth; he does not identify which principles that government should apply to solve this problem. However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, [[labour theory of value]] of the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in a letter he wrote titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''. Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.<ref>{{cite web | first1 = Cobb | last1 = Cliff | first2 = Fred | last2 = Foldvary | title = John Locke on Property|url= http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/cobb-cliff-and-fred-foldvary_john-locke-on-property-1999.html |publisher=The School of Cooperative Individualism|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===On price theory===\nLocke's general theory of value and price is a [[supply and demand]] theory, which was set out in a letter to a Member of Parliament in 1691, titled ''Some Considerations on the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money''.<ref>{{Citation | first = John | last = Locke | year = 1691 | url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/locke/contents.htm | title = Some Considerations on the consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising of the Value of Money | publisher = Marxists}}.</ref> He refers to supply as \"quantity\" and demand as \"[[Economic rent|rent]]\". \"The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers,\" and \"that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.\" The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on \"money answers all things\" (Ecclesiastes) or \"rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough,\" and \"varies very little...\" Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity, regardless of whether the [[demand for money]] is unlimited or constant. He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, he explains the value of goods as based on their scarcity and ability to be exchanged and consumed. He explains demand for goods as based on their ability to yield a flow of income. Locke develops an early theory of [[Capital (economics)|capitalisation]], such as land, which has value because \"by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income.\" He considers the demand for money as almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange. As a medium of exchange, he states that \"money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life,\" and for loanable funds, \"it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income... or interest.\"\n\n====Monetary thoughts====\nLocke distinguishes two functions of money, as a \"counter\" to measure value, and as a \"pledge\" to lay claim to [[good (economics)|goods]]. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.\n\nLocke argues that a country should seek a favourable [[balance of trade]], lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock. Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. He considers the latter less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country's [[money supply|money stock]], if it is large relative to that of other countries, he says it will cause the country's exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.\n\nHe also prepares estimates of the [[cash]] requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers). In each group he posits that the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers&nbsp;– middlemen&nbsp;– whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders, have a negative influence on both personal and the public economy to which they supposedly contribute.\n\n===The self===\nLocke defines the self as \"that conscious thinking thing, (whatever substance, made up of whether spiritual, or material, simple, or compounded, it matters not) which is sensible, or conscious of pleasure and pain, capable of happiness or misery, and so is concerned for itself, as far as that consciousness extends\".{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 307}}  He does not, however, ignore \"substance\", writing that \"the body too goes to the making the man.\"{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 306}}\n\nIn his ''Essay'', Locke explains the gradual unfolding of this conscious mind. Arguing against both the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] view of man as [[original sin|originally sinful]] and the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions, Locke posits an \"empty\" mind, a ''tabula rasa'', which is shaped by experience; [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] and [[human self-reflection|reflections]] being the two sources of '''all''' our [[idea]]s.<ref>{{Citation | title = The American International Encyclopedia | publisher = JJ Little Co | place = New York | year = 1954 | volume = 9}}.</ref>\n\nLocke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' is an outline on how to educate this mind: he expresses the belief that education maketh the man, or, more fundamentally, that the mind is an \"empty cabinet\", with the statement, \"I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education.\"{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}\n\nLocke also wrote that \"the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences.\"{{Sfn | Locke | 1996 | p = 10}}  He argued that the \"[[Association of Ideas|associations of ideas]]\" that one makes when young are more important than those made later because they are the foundation of the self: they are, put differently, what first mark the ''tabula rasa''. In his ''Essay'', in which both these concepts are introduced, Locke warns against, for example, letting \"a foolish maid\" convince a child that \"goblins and sprites\" are associated with the night for \"darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other.\"{{Sfn | Locke | 1997 | p = 357}}\n\nThis theory came to be called \"associationism\", and it strongly influenced 18th-century thought, particularly [[education theory|educational theory]], as nearly every educational writer warned parents not to allow their children to develop negative associations. It also led to the development of [[psychology]] and other new disciplines with [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]]'s attempt to discover a biological mechanism for associationism in his ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749).\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nSome scholars have seen Locke's political convictions as deriving from his religious beliefs.<ref>{{Citation | first = Greg | last = Forster | title = John Locke's politics of moral consensus | year = 2005}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Kim Ian | last = Parker | title = The biblical politics of John Locke | year = 2004 | publisher = Canadian Corporation for Studies in Religion}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = John | last = Locke | title = Writings on religion | editor-first = Victor | editor-last = Nuovo | place = Oxford | year = 2002}}.</ref> Locke's religious trajectory began in [[Calvinist]] [[trinitarianism]], but by the time of the ''Reflections'' (1695) Locke was advocating not just [[Socinianism|Socinian]] views on tolerance but also Socinian Christology.<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 426\">{{Citation | first = John | last = Marshall | title = John Locke: resistance, religion and responsibility | place = Cambridge | year = 1994 | page = 426}}.</ref> However Wainwright (1987) notes that in the posthumously published ''Paraphrase'' (1707) Locke's interpretation of one verse, Ephesians 1:10, is markedly different from that of Socinians like [[John Biddle (Unitarian)|Biddle]], and may indicate that near the end of his life Locke returned nearer to an [[Arian]] position, thereby accepting Christ's pre-existence.{{Sfn | Locke | 1987 | p = 806}}  In fact, historian [[John Marshall (historian)|John Marshall]] suggests that Locke's view of Christ ended, \"somewhere between Socianism and Arianism.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 426\"/>\nLocke was at times not sure about the subject of [[original sin]], so he was accused of Socianism, Arianism, or Deism.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 27, 223}}  But he did not deny the reality of evil. Man was capable of waging unjust wars and committing crimes. Criminals had to be punished, even with the death penalty.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 145}}  With regard to the Bible Locke was very conservative. He retained the doctrine of the [[verbal inspiration]] of the Scriptures.{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}  The miracles were proofs of the divine nature of the biblical message. Locke was convinced that the entire content of the Bible was in agreement with human reason (''The reasonableness of Christianity'', 1695).<ref>{{Citation | first = D | last = Henrich | contribution = Locke, John | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1960 | language = German}}, 3. Auflage, Band IV, Spalte 426</ref>{{Sfn | Heussi | 1956}}  Although Locke was an advocate of tolerance, he urged the authorities not to tolerate [[atheism]], because he thought the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 217 ff}}  That excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises, for example, man's \"autonomy or dignity or human flourishing\".{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}  In Locke's opinion the [[cosmological argument]] was valid and proved God's existence. His political thought was based on \"a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions.\"{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 13}}<ref>{{Citation | quote = [The ''Two Treatises of Government'' are] saturated with Christian assumptions. | first = John | last = Dunn | year = 1969 | title = The Political Thought of John Locke: A Historical Account of the Argument of the 'Two Treatises of Government' | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge, UK | page = 99}}.</ref>\n\nLocke's concept of man started with the belief in creation. We have been \"sent into the World by [God's] order, and about his business, [we] are his Property, whose Workmanship [we] are, made to last during his, not one anothers Pleasure.\"{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 142}}  Like the two other very influential natural-law philosophers, [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]], Locke equated [[natural law]] with the biblical [[revelation]], since in their view both had originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.<ref>{{Citation | first = M | last = Elze | contribution = Grotius, Hugo | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1958 | language = German}}, 3. Auflage, Band II, col. 1885–1886</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = H | last = Hohlwein | title = Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart | year = 1961 | language = German | contribution = Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von}}, 3. Auflage, Band V, col. 721</ref> \"As a philosopher, Locke was intensely interested in Christian doctrine, and in the ''Reasonableness'' he insisted that most men could not hope to understand the detailed requirements of the law of nature without the assistance of the teachings and example of Jesus.\"{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 12}}  Locke derived the fundamental concepts of his political theory from biblical texts, in particular from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1 and 2 ([[Genesis creation narrative|creation]]), the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20), the [[Golden Rule]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=  Matthew 7:12]), the teachings of [[Jesus]] (e.g. his doctrine of [[charity (virtue)|charity]], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search= Matthew 19:19]), and the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 22–43, 45–46, 101, 153–58, 195, 197}}  The Decalogue (Ten Commandments) puts a person's life, his or her honourable reputation (i.e. honour and dignity), and property under God's protection. Freedom is another major theme in the Old Testament. For instance, God's actions in liberating the Israelites from Egyptian slavery in the Decalogue's prologue ([http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search= Exodus 20:2]) were the precondition for the following commandments. Moreover, Locke derived basic human equality, including the [[equality of the sexes]] (\"Adam and Eve\") from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26-28&version=NIV Genesis 1:26–28], the starting point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | pp = 21–43}}  To Locke, one of the consequences of the principle of equality was that all humans were created equally free and therefore governments needed the consent of the governed.{{Sfn | Waldron | 2002 | p = 136}}  Only when Locke had derived the fundamental aspects of his concept of man and ethics from the biblical texts – life, equality, private property, etc. –, did he examine as a philosopher which consequences they had in the abovementioned way. Following Locke, the American Declaration of Independence founded [[human rights]] partially on the biblical belief in creation: \"All men are ''created'' equal, (...) they are endowed by their ''Creator'' with certain unalienable rights, (...) life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Locke's doctrine that governments need the consent of the governed is also central to the Declaration of Independence.<ref>[[Carl L.
