He entered the Jesuit order in 1685, and was ordained as a priest in 1694. He taught philosophy at [[Turin]] from 1694 to 1697, and philosophy, theology, and mathematics at [[Pavia]] from 1697 until his death. He was a protégé of the mathematician [[Tommaso Ceva]] and published several works including ''Quaesita geometrica'' (1693), ''Logica demonstrativa'' (1697), and ''Neo-statica'' (1708).\n\nHe is primarily known today for his last publication, in 1733 shortly before his death. Now considered the second work in [[non-Euclidean geometry]], ''Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus'' (''Euclid Freed of Every Flaw'') languished in obscurity until it was rediscovered by [[Eugenio Beltrami]] in the mid-19th century.\n\nMany of Saccheri's ideas have a precedent in the 11th Century Persian polymath [[Omar Khayyám]]'s ''Discussion of Difficulties in Euclid'' (''Risâla fî sharh mâ ashkala min musâdarât Kitâb 'Uglîdis''), a fact ignored in most Western sources until recently.\n\nIt is unclear whether Saccheri had access to this work in translation, or developed his ideas independently. The [[Saccheri quadrilateral]] is now sometimes referred to as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral.\n\nThe intent of Saccheri's work was ostensibly to establish the validity of Euclid by means of a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' proof of any alternative to [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]].  To do this he assumed that the parallel postulate was false, and attempted to derive a contradiction.  \nSince Euclid's postulate is equivalent to the statement that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is 180°, he considered both the hypothesis that the angles add up to more or less than 180°.\n\nThe first led to the conclusion that straight lines are finite, contradicting Euclid's second postulate. So Saccheri correctly rejected it. However, today this principle is accepted as the basis of [[elliptic geometry]], where both the second and fifth postulates are rejected.\n\nThe second possibility turned out to be harder to refute. In fact he was unable to derive a logical contradiction and instead derived many non-intuitive results; for example that triangles have a maximum finite area and that there is an absolute unit of length. He finally concluded that: \"the hypothesis of the acute angle is absolutely false; because it is repugnant to the nature of straight lines\". Today, his results are theorems of [[hyperbolic geometry]].\n\nThere is some minor argument on whether Saccheri really meant this, as he published his work in the final year of his life, came extremely close to discovering non-Euclidean geometry and was a logician. Some believe Saccheri only concluded in such way in an intent to avoid criticism that might come from seemingly illogical aspects of hyperbolic geometry.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Saccheri–Legendre theorem]]\n*[[Hyperbolic geometry]]\n*[[Parallel postulate]]\n*[[List of Jesuit scientists]]\n*[[List of Roman Catholic cleric–scientists]]\n\n==References==\n* [[Martin Gardner]], ''Non-Euclidean Geometry'', Chapter 14 of ''The Colossal Book of Mathematics'', W.
