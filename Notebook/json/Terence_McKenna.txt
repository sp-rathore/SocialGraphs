If you do that, you know the marble will roll down the side of the bowl, down, down, down – until eventually it comes to rest at the lowest energy state, which is the bottom of the bowl. That's precisely my model of human history. I'm suggesting that the universe is pulled toward a complex attractor that exists ahead of us in time, and that our ever-accelerating speed through the phenomenal world of connectivity and novelty is based on the fact that we are now very, very close to the attractor.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= McKenna |first= Terence |title= Approaching Timewave Zero |url= http://www.fractal-timewave.com/articles/approaching_twz.htm |magazine= Magical Blend |issue= 44 |date= 1994|accessdate= 15 June 2015}}{{verify source|type=reprint|date=February 2014}}{{copyvio link}}</ref> Therefore, according to McKenna's final interpretation of the data and positioning of the graph, on December 21, 2012 we would have been in the unique position in time where maximum novelty would be experienced.<ref name=Mavericks /><ref name=Jenkins /><ref name=Wired /> An event he described as a \"concrescence\",<ref name=Pinchbeck2003pp232-5 /> a \"tightening '[[gyre]]'\" with everything flowing together.

Other purported dates do not fit the actual time frames: the date claimed for the emergence of ''Homo sapiens'' is inaccurate by 70,000 years, and the existence of the ancient [[Sumer]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilisations contradict the date he gave for the beginning of \"historical time\". Some projected dates have been criticised for having seemingly arbitrary labels, such as the \"height of the age of mammals\"{{r|normark}} and McKenna's analysis of historical events has been criticised for having a [[eurocentric]] and [[cultural bias]].<ref name=EsquireJacobson /><ref name=shroom />\n\n====The Watkins Objection====\nIn 1994, the British mathematician Matthew Watkins of [[Exeter University]] (then a [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] PhD student) conducted a mathematical analysis of the ''Time Wave''.  Watkins claimed there were various mathematical flaws in the construction of the wave. He stated that when the mathematics was accurately performed a more trivial and uninteresting waveform was created, which was not fractal but a complex [[piecewise]] linear progression.<ref name=shroom />\n\n==Critical reception==\nOne expert on drug treatment attacked McKenna for popularizing \"dangerous substances\". Judy Corman, vice president of Phoenix House of New York, a drug treatment center, said in a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1993:<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/>  \"Surely the fact that Terence McKenna says that the psilocybin mushroom 'is the megaphone used by an alien, intergalactic Other to communicate with mankind' is enough for us to wonder if taking LSD has done something to his mental faculties.\"\n\nOthers had trouble with his self-consciously cosmic literary style. \"I suffered hallucinatory agonies of my own while reading his shrilly ecstatic prose,\" Peter Conrad wrote in ''The New York Times'' in a 1993 review of Mr. McKenna's book ''True Hallucinations''.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/>\n\nBut some praised his \"scholarly\" approach.  Biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]], of [[Harvard University]], wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' in a 1993 review of McKenna's book ''Food of the Gods'', that it was; \"a masterpiece of research and writing\" and that it \"should be read by every specialist working in the multifarious fields involved with the use of psychoactive drugs.\" Concluding that \"It is, without question, destined to play a major role in our future considerations of the role of the ancient use of psychoactive drugs, the historical shaping of our modern concerns about drugs and perhaps about man's desire for escape from reality with drugs.\"<ref name=\"American scientist food of the gods review\">{{cite news |last= Schultes |first= Richard Evans |authorlink= Richard Evans Schultes |title= Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge by Terence McKenna |department= Life Sciences |type= Book review |magazine= [[American Scientist]] |year= 1993 |volume= 81 |issue= 5 |pages= 489–90 |jstor= 29775027 }}</ref>\n\n[[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] in a 2012 blog post for ''[[Scientific American]]'' also commented that, ''Food of the Gods'' was \"a rigorous argument...that mind-expanding plants and fungi catalyzed the transformation of our brutish ancestors into cultured modern humans.\"<ref name=ScientificAHorgan />\n\nHis outpouring of unique thoughts was a marvel to many. \"To write him off as a crazy hippie is a rather lazy approach to a man not only full of fascinating ideas but also blessed with a sense of humor and self-parody,\" Tom Hodgkinson wrote in ''The New Statesman and Society'' in 1994.<ref name=\"NYT Obit\"/>\n\nSome found his writing captivating. [[Mark Jacobson]] said of ''True Hallucinations'', in a 1992 issue of ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'' that, \"it would be hard to find a drug narrative more compellingly perched on a baroquely romantic limb than this passionate Tom-and-Huck-ride-great-mother-river-saga of brotherly bonding,\" adding \"put simply, Terence is a hoot!\"<ref name=EsquireJacobson />\n\n''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' called him a \"charismatic talking head\" who was \"brainy, eloquent, and hilarious\"<ref name=Wired/> and [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] also said that he was \"the only person who has made a serious effort to objectify the psychedelic experience.\"<ref name= \"NYT Obit\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |year= 1975 |title= The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching |author1-link= Dennis McKenna |last1= McKenna |first1= Dennis |last2= McKenna |first2= Terence |author2mask= 1 |location= New York |publisher= Seabury |isbn= 9780816492497}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1976 |title= Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide |last1= McKenna |first1= Dennis |author1-link= Dennis McKenna |last2= McKenna |first2= Terence |authormask2= 1 |last3= under the pseudonyms OT Oss and ON Oeric |publisher= And/Or Press |isbn= 9780915904136 |location= Berkeley, CA |ref= {{SfnRef|McKenna & McKenna|1976}}}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1992 |last= McKenna |first= Terence |authormask=0 |title= The Archaic Revival: Speculations on Psychedelic Mushrooms, the Amazon, Virtual Reality, UFOs, Evolution, Shamanism, the Rebirth of the Goddess, and the End of History |publisher= [[HarperCollins#Defunct|Harper San Francisco]] |location= San Francisco |isbn= 9780062506139 |ref= {{SfnRef|McKenna|1992a}}}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1992 |title= Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge – A Radical History of Plants, Drugs, and Human Evolution |last= McKenna |first= Terence |authormask= 0 |location= New York |publisher= Bantam |isbn=  9780553078688 |ref= {{SfnRef|McKenna|1992b}}}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1992 |title= Synesthesia |others= Illustrated by [[Timothy Ely|Ely, Timothy C.]] |last= McKenna |first= Terence |authormask= 0 |publisher= Granary Books |location= New York |isbn= 9781887123044 |oclc= 30473682}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1992 |title= Trialogues at the Edge of the West: Chaos, Creativity, and the Resacralization of the World |first1= Ralph H. |last1= Abraham |author1-link= Ralph Abraham |last2= McKenna |first2= Terence |authormask2= 1 |first3= Rupert |last3= Sheldrake |author3-link= Rupert Sheldrake |others= Forward by Houston, Jean |publisher= Bear & Company |isbn= 9780939680979 |ref= {{SfnRef|Abraham, McKenna & Sheldrake|1992}}}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1993 |title= True Hallucinations: Being an Account of the Author’s Extraordinary Adventures in the Devil's Paradise |publisher= [[HarperCollins#Defunct|Harper San Francisco]] |location= San Francisco |last= McKenna |first= Terence |authormask= 0 |isbn= 9780062505453 |ref= {{SfnRef|McKenna|1993}}}}\n* {{cite book |year= 1998 |title=  The Evolutionary Mind: Conversations on Science, Imagination & Spirit  |first1= Ralph H. |last1= Abraham |author1-link= Ralph Abraham |last2= McKenna |first2= Terence |authormask2= 1 |first3= Rupert |last3= Sheldrake |author3-link= Rupert Sheldrake |publisher= Monkfish Book Publishing |isbn= 0974935972 |ref= {{SfnRef|Abraham, McKenna & Sheldrake|1998}}}}\n\n==Spoken word==\n* ''History Ends in Green: Gaia, Psychedelics and the Archaic Revival'', 6 audiocassette set, Mystic Fire audio, 1993, ISBN 1-56176-907-X (recorded at the [[Esalen Institute]], 1989)\n* ''TechnoPagans at the End of History'' (transcription of rap with [[Mark Pesce]] from 1998)\n* ''Psychedelics in the Age of Intelligent Machines'' (1999) (DVD) HPX/SurrealStudio\n* ''Conversations on the Edge of Magic'' (1994) (CD & Cassette) [[Association for Consciousness Exploration|ACE]]\n* ''Rap-Dancing into the Third Millennium'' (1994) (Cassette) (Re-issued on CD as ''The Quintessential Hallucinogen'') [[Association for Consciousness Exploration|ACE]]\n* ''Packing For the Long Strange Trip'' (1994) (Audio Cassette) [[Association for Consciousness Exploration|ACE]]\n* ''Global Perspectives and Psychedelic Poetics'' (1994) (Cassette) Sound Horizons Audio-Video, Inc.\n* ''The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge'' (1992) (Cassette) [[Sounds True]]\n* ''The Psychedelic Society'' (DVD & Video Cassette) Sound Photosynthesis\n* ''True Hallucinations Workshop'' (Audio/Video Cassette) Sound Photosynthesis\n* ''The Vertigo at History's Edge: Who Are We?
