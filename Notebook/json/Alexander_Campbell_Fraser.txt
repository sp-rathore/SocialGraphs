However, he did not find [[Glasgow]] to his liking as a city and stayed there only one year. He completed his studies at [[University of Edinburgh]], graduating at Divinity Hall in 1843. This was a tumultuous year in the Scottish church and Fraser decided to join the Free Church following the [[Disruption of 1843|Disruption]]. He was ordained in 1844 and became minister of the small parish of [[Cramond]] on the [[Firth of Forth]] just on the outer edge of Edinburgh. Remaining in [[Edinburgh]] he succeeded Sir William Hamilton  as Professor of Logic at [[New College, Edinburgh|New College]] in 1846 and remained in this role until 1856. \n\nHe edited the ''[[North British Review]]'' from 1850 to 1857, and in 1856, having previously been a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister, he succeeded [[William Hamilton (metaphysician)|Sir William Hamilton]] as professor of Logic and [[Metaphysics]] at Edinburgh University. In 1859 he became Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the university and retained this role for 30 years.\n\nIn 1831 Sir William Hamilton was appointed to the chair of Logic and [[Metaphysics]], and Fraser became his pupil. He himself said \"I owe more to Hamilton than to any other influence.\" It was about this time also that he began his study of Berkeley and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], and deserted his early [[phenomenalism]] for the conception of a spiritual will as the universal cause. In the ''Biographia'' this \"Theistic faith\" appears in its full development (see the concluding chapter), and is especially important as perhaps the nearest approach to [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] ethics made by original English philosophy. Apart from the philosophical interest of the ''Biographia'', the work contains valuable pictures of the Lam of Lorne and Argyllshire society in the early 19th century, of university life in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and a history of the ''North British Review''.\n\nIn 1858 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his proposer being [[Philip Kelland]].<ref>{{cite book|title=BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF FORMER FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\nFraser devoted himself to the study of British and Irish philosophers, especially [[George Berkeley]], and published:\n* ''Collected Edition of the Works of Bishop Berkeley with Annotations, etc.'' (1871; enlarged 1901). [[Charles Peirce]] praised this edition for both including some writing not in other editions, and offering a more carefully edited texts. While Peirce praised the book for the provision of useful introductions, he opined that the explanatory notes disfigured every page in an unnecessary and useless manner.<ref>{{Citation\n|publisher = University of North Carolina Press\n|isbn = 0807819921\n|publication-place = Chapel Hill\n|title = Peirce on Signs\n|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1566312M/Peirce_on_signs\n|author = Charles Sanders Peirce\n|edition = \n|publication-date = 1991\n|oclc = 23462965\n|id = 0807819921\n}}</ref> \n* ''Biography of Berkeley'' (1881),\n* ''Annotated Edition of Locke's Essay'' (1894),\n* ''Philosophy of Theism'' (1896)\n* a biography of ''[[Thomas Reid]]'' (1898) in the [[List of books for the \"Famous Scots Series\"|\"Famous Scots Series\"]].

From this work and from his [[Gifford Lectures]] (1894-6) we learn objectively what had previously been inferred from his critical work. After a childhood spent in an austerity which stigmatized as unholy even the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]], he began his college career at the age of fourteen at a time when [[John Wilson (Scottish writer)|Christopher North]] and [[David George Ritchie|Dr Ritchie]] were lecturing on [[Moral Philosophy]] and Logic. His first philosophical advance was stimulated by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]]'s ''Cause and Effect'', which introduced him to the problems which were to occupy his thought. From this point he embraced the [[scepticism]] of [[David Hume]].\n\nHe received an [[Honorary doctorate|honorary]] [[Doctor of Letters|Doctorate of Letters]] (D.Litt.) from the [[University of Dublin]] in June 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=2 June 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36783| }}</ref>\n\nUntil his wife's death in 1907 he lived at a house in [[Hawthornden Castle|Hawthornden]] near [[Lasswade]].<ref>http://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/alexander-campbell-fraser</ref> Thereafter he lived at 34 Melville Street in [[Edinburgh]]'s fashionable West End.<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1910-11</ref>\n\nFraser is buried in the small northern cemetery at [[Lasswade]] with his wife, Jemima Gordon (1819-1907), against the north boundary.\n\n==Family==\n\nIn 1850 he married Jemima Gordon Dyce (d.1907).<ref>{{cite book|title=BIOGRAPHICAL INDEX OF FORMER FELLOWS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHis eldest son Hugh John Edward Fraser (1851-1908) was an advocate.\n\nHis younger son, Patrick Alexander Campbell Fraser, married Kalitza Spurway, daughter of Marcus Spurway in 1961.<ref>http://www.thepeerage.com/p7203.htm</ref>\n\n==Artistic Recognition==\n\nFraser's portrait, by [[George Reid (Scottish artist)|George Reid]] PRSA, hangs in the Old College in [[Edinburgh University]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{wikisource author-inline}}\n* [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=66 Fraser's Gifford Lectures on ''Philosophy of Theism'']\n* {{1911}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fraser, Alexander Campbell}}\n[[Category:1819 births]]\n[[Category:1914 deaths]]\n[[Category:Scottish philosophers]]\n[[Category:British ethicists]]\n[[Category:George Berkeley scholars]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Alexander Campbell Fraser"}}}}
