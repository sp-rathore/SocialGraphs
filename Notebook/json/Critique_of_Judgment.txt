Sometimes referred to as the '''third Critique''', the ''Critique of Judgment'' follows the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781) and the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788).\n\n== Foundations ==\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''Critique of Judgment'' completes the Critical project begun in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' and the ''Critique of Practical Reason'' (the ''first'' and ''second Critiques'', respectively). The book is divided into two main sections: the ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgment'' and the ''Critique of Teleological Judgment'', and also includes a large overview of the entirety of Kant's Critical system, arranged in its final form. The so-called ''First Introduction'' was not published during Kant's lifetime, for Kant wrote a replacement for publication.\n\nThe Critical project, that of exploring the limits and conditions of knowledge, had already produced the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in which Kant argued for a [[Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]], an approach to the problems of perception in which [[space]] and [[time]] are argued not to be objects but ways in which the observing subject's mind organizes and structures the sensory world. The end result of this inquiry is that there are certain fundamental antinomies in human Reason, most particularly that there is a complete inability to favor on the one hand the argument that all behavior and thought is determined by external causes, and on the other that there is an actual \"spontaneous\" causal principle at work in human behavior.\n\nThe first position, of [[causal determinism]], is adopted, in Kant's view, by empirical scientists of all sorts; moreover, it led to the Idea (perhaps never fully to be realized) of a final science in which all empirical knowledge could be synthesized into a full and complete causal explanation of all events possible to the world.\n\nThe second position, of [[spontaneous causality]], is implicitly adopted by all people as they engage in moral behavior; this position is explored more fully in the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]''.\n\nThe ''Critique of Judgment'' constitutes a discussion of the place of Judgment itself, which must overlap both the Understanding (which operates from within a deterministic framework) and Reason (which operates on the grounds of freedom).\n\n==Aesthetics==\n\nThe first part of the book, the ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgment'', discusses the four possible \"reflective judgments\": the agreeable, the [[beauty|beautiful]], the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], and the [[Goodness and value theory#Kant: hypothetical and categorical goods|good]]. Kant makes it clear that these are the only four possible reflective judgments, as he relates them to the Table of Judgments from the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.\n\n\"Reflective judgments\" differ from determinative judgments (those of the first two critiques).  In reflective judgment we seek to find unknown universals for given particulars; whereas in determinative judgment, we just subsume given particulars under universals that are already known, as Kant puts it:\n\n{{quote|text=It is then one thing to say, “the production of certain things of nature or that of collective nature is only possible through a cause which determines itself to action according to design”; and quite another to say, “I can according to the peculiar constitution of my cognitive faculties judge concerning the possibility of these things and their production, in no other fashion than by conceiving for this a cause working according to design, i.e. a Being which is productive in a way analogous to the causality of an intelligence.” In the former case I wish to establish something concerning the Object, and am bound to establish the objective reality of an assumed concept; in the latter, Reason only determines the use of my cognitive faculties, conformably to their peculiarities and to the essential conditions of their range and their limits. Thus the former principle is an objective proposition for the determinant Judgment, the latter merely a subjective proposition for the reflective Judgment, i.e. a maxim which Reason prescribes to it.<ref>Kant, Critique of Judgment, section 75.</ref>}}\n\nThe agreeable is a purely sensory judgment — judgments in the form of \"This steak is good,\" or \"This chair is soft.\" These are purely subjective judgments, based on inclination alone.\n\nThe good is essentially a judgment that something is [[ethical]] — the judgment that something conforms with moral law, which, in the Kantian sense, is essentially a claim of modality — a coherence with a fixed and absolute notion of reason. It is in many ways the absolute opposite of the agreeable, in that it is a purely objective judgment — things are either moral or they are not, according to Kant.\n\nThe remaining two judgments — the beautiful and the sublime — differ from both the agreeable and the good. They are what Kant refers to as \"subjective universal\" judgments. This apparently oxymoronic term means that, in practice, the judgments are subjective, and are not tied to any absolute and determinate concept. However, the judgment that something is beautiful or sublime is made with the belief that other people ought to agree with this judgment — even though it is known that many will not. The force of this \"ought\" comes from a reference to a ''[[sensus communis]]'' — a community of taste. [[Hannah Arendt]], in her ''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'', suggests the possibility that this ''sensus communis'' might be the basis of a political theory that is markedly different from the one that Kant lays out in the ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals|Metaphysic of Morals]]''.\n\nThe central concept of Kant's analysis of the judgment of beauty is what he called the ″free play″ between the cognitive powers of imagination and understanding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Guyer|first1=Paul|title=Values of Beauty|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}</ref> We call an object beautiful, because its form fits our cognitive powers and enables such a ″free play″ (§22) the experience of which is pleasurable to us. The judgment that something is beautiful is a claim that it possesses the \"form of finality\" — that is, that it appears to have been designed with a purpose, even though it does not have any apparent practical function. We also do not need to have a determinate concept for an object in order to find it beautiful (§9). In this regard, Kant further distinguishes between ''free'' and ''adherent'' beauty. Whereas judgments of ''free beauty'' are made without having one determinate concept for the object being judged (e.g. an ornament or well-formed line), a judgment of beauty is ''adherent'' if we do have such a determined concept in mind (e.g. a well-built horse that is recognized as such). The main difference between these two judgments is that purpose or use of the object plays no role in the case of free beauty. In contrast, adherent judgments of beauty are only possible if the object is not ill-suited for its purpose.\n\nThe judgment that something is sublime is a judgment that it is beyond the limits of comprehension — that it is an object of fear. However, Kant makes clear that the object must not actually be threatening — it merely must be recognized as deserving of fear.\n\nKant's view of the beautiful and the sublime is frequently read as an attempt to resolve one of the problems left following his depiction of moral law in the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' — namely that it is impossible to prove that we have [[free will]], and thus impossible to prove that we are bound under [[moral law]]. The beautiful and the sublime both seem to refer to some external [[noumenon|noumenal]] order — and thus to the possibility of a noumenal self that possesses free will.\n\nIn this section of the critique Kant also establishes a faculty of mind that is in many ways the inverse of judgment — the faculty of [[genius]]. Whereas judgment allows one to determine whether something is beautiful or sublime, genius allows one to produce what is beautiful or sublime.\n\n==Teleology==\n\nThe second half of the Critique discusses [[teleological]] judgement. This way of judging things according to their ends (''telos'': [[Greek language|Greek]] for end) is logically connected to the first discussion at least regarding beauty but suggests a kind of (self-) purposiveness (that is, meaningfulness known by one's self).\n\nKant writes about the [[Teleonomy|biological as teleological]], claiming that there are things, such as living beings, whose parts exist for the sake of their whole and their whole for the sake of their parts. This allows him to open a gap in the physical world: since these \"organic\" things cannot be brought under the rules that apply to all other appearances, what are we to do with them?\n\nKant says explicitly that while efficiently causal explanations are always best (x causes y, y is the effect of x), there \"will never be a [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] for a blade of grass\", and so the organic must be explained “as if” it were constituted as teleological. This portion of the Critique is, from some modern theories, where Kant is most radical; he posits man as the ultimate end, that is, that all other forms of nature exist for the purpose of their relation to man, directly or not, and that man is left outside of this due to his faculty of reason. Kant claims that culture becomes the expression of this, that it is the highest teleological end, as it is the only expression of human freedom outside of the laws of nature. Man also garners the place as the highest teleological end due to his capacity for morality, or practical reason, which falls in line with the ethical system that Kant proposes in the ''Critique of Practical Reason ''and the ''Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals''.\n\nKant attempted to legitimize purposive categories in the life sciences, without a theological commitment. He recognized the concept of purpose has epistemological value for finality, while denying its implications about creative intentions at life and the universe's source. Kant described natural purposes as organized beings, meaning that the [[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge|principle of knowledge]] presupposes living creatures as purposive entities. He called this supposition the finality concept as a [[Norm (philosophy)|regulative use]], which satisfies living beings specificity of knowledge.<ref>Use as a regulative principle contrasts to that of a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructive principle]].</ref> This heuristic framework claims there is a teleology principle at purpose's source and it is the mechanical devices of the individual original organism, including its heredity. Such entities appear to be [[self-organizing]] in patterns. Kant's ideas allowed [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] and his followers to formulate the science of types (morphology) and to justify its autonomy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Understanding Purpose |last=Huneman |first=Philippe |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location= |isbn= 1-58046-265-0 |pages= 1–37 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nKant held that there was no purpose represented in the [[Aesthetics#Aesthetic judgment|aesthetic judgement]] of an object's [[beauty]]. A pure aesthetic judgement excludes the object's purpose.<ref>{{cite book |title=A history of philosophy: the enlightenment Voltaire to Kant, Volume 6 |last=Copleston |first=Frederick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1960 |publisher=Continuum |location= |isbn= 0826469477 |pages= 360–361 |url= |accessdate=}}\"Beauty is the form of the purposefulness of an object, so far as this is perceived without any representation of a purpose.\"</ref>\n\n==Influences==\n\nThough Kant consistently maintains that the human mind is not an \"[[intuitive understanding]]\"—something that creates the phenomena which it cognizes—several of his readers (starting with [[Fichte]], culminating in [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]) believed that it must be (and often give Kant credit).\n\nKant’s discussions of [[Schema (Kant)|schema]] and [[symbol]] late in the first half of the Critique of Judgement also raise questions about the way the mind represents its objects to itself, and so are foundational for an understanding of the development of much late 20th century [[continental philosophy]]: [[Jacques Derrida]] is known to have studied the book extensively.\n\nThe core of modern aesthetics utilized the Kantian critique of judgement as a framework in which aesthetic questions could be debated.\n\nIn ''[[Truth and Method]]'' (1960), [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] rejects Kantian aesthetics as ahistorical in his development of a historically-grounded [[hermeneutics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gadamer|first=Hans-Georg|title=Truth and Method|year=1960|publisher=Continuum|isbn=082647697X|page=36|edition=2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gadamer-aesthetics/|title=Gadamer's Aesthetics|first=Nicholas|last=Davey|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24338-gadamer-and-the-legacy-of-german-idealism/|title=Review: Gadamer and the Legacy of German Idealism by Kristin Gjesdal|first=Robert|last=Dorstal|year=2010|work=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|publisher=University of Notre Dame}}</ref>\n\n==Schopenhauer’s comments==\n[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] noted that Kant was concerned with the analysis of abstract concepts, rather than with perceived objects. \n\"…he does not start from the beautiful itself, from the direct, beautiful object of perception, but from the ''judgement'' [someone’s statement] concerning the beautiful….\"<ref name=Schopenhauer>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix, p. 531</ref>\n\nKant was strongly interested, in all of his critiques, with the relation between mental operations and external objects.\n\"His attention is specially aroused by the circumstance that such a judgement is obviously the expression of something occurring in the subject, but is nevertheless as universally valid as if it concerned a quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not the beautiful itself.\"<ref name=Schopenhauer/>\n\nThe book’s form is the result of concluding that beauty can be explained by examining the concept of ''suitableness''. Schopenhauer stated that  “Thus we have the queer combination of the knowledge of the beautiful with that of the suitableness of natural bodies into ''one'' faculty of knowledge called ''power of judgement'', and the treatment of the two heterogeneous subjects in one book.”<ref name=Schopenhauer/>\n\nKant is inconsistent, according to Schopenhauer, because “…after it had been incessantly repeated in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that the understanding is the ability to judge, and after the forms of its judgements are made the foundation&ndash;stone of all philosophy, a quite peculiar power of judgement now appears which is entirely different from that ability.”<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix, p 531 f.</ref>\n\nWith regard to teleological judgement, Schopenhauer claimed that Kant tried to say only this: \"&hellip;although organized bodies necessarily seem to us as though they were constructed according to a conception of purpose which preceded them, this still does not justify us in assuming it to be objectively the case.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix, p. 532</ref> This is in accordance with Kant's usual concern with the correspondence between subjectivity (the way that we think) and objectivity (the external world).  Our minds want to think that natural bodies were made by a purposeful intelligence, like ours.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}\n;Books\n* ''[[Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime]]''\n* ''[[The Differend]]''\n{{Col-break}}\n;People\n* [[Jean-François Lyotard]]\n{{Col-break}}\n;Topics\n* [[Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata]]\n* [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Judgment'', Translated by J.
