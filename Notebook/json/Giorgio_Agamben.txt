The concept of [[biopolitics]] (borrowed and adapted from [[Michel Foucault]]) informs many of his writings.\n\n== Biography ==\nAgamben was educated at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], where in 1965 he wrote an unpublished [[laurea]] thesis on the political thought of [[Simone Weil]]. Agamben participated in [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[Le Thor]] seminars (on [[Heraclitus]] and [[Hegel]]) in 1966 and 1968.<ref>See Martin Heidegger, ''Four Seminars'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana UP, 2003).</ref> In the 1970s, he worked primarily on linguistics, philology, poetics, and topics in medieval culture. During this period, Agamben began to elaborate his primary concerns, although their political bearings were not yet made explicit. In 1974–1975 he was a fellow at the [[Warburg Institute]], [[University of London]], due to the courtesy of [[Frances Yates]], whom he met through [[Italo Calvino]]. During this fellowship, Agamben began to develop his second book, ''Stanzas'' (1977).\n\nAgamben was close to the poets [[Giorgio Caproni]] and [[José Bergamín]], and to the Italian novelist [[Elsa Morante]], to whom he devoted the essays \"The Celebration of the Hidden Treasure\" (in ''The End of the Poem'') and \"Parody\" (in ''Profanations''). He has been a friend and collaborator to such eminent intellectuals as [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (in whose ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]'' he played the part of [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]), [[Italo Calvino]] (with whom he collaborated, for a short while, as advisor to the publishing house [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Einaudi]] and developed plans for a journal), [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others.\n\nHis strongest influences include [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Agamben edited Benjamin's collected works in Italian translation until 1996, and called Benjamin's thought \"the antidote that allowed me to survive Heidegger\".<ref>Leland de la Durantaye, ''Giorgio Agamben: A Critical Introduction'' (Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 2009), p. 53.</ref> In 1981, Agamben discovered several important lost manuscripts by Benjamin in the archives of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. Benjamin had left these manuscripts to [[Georges Bataille]] when he fled Paris shortly before his death. The most relevant of these to Agamben's own later work were Benjamin's manuscripts for his theses ''On the Concept of History''.<ref>See de la Durantaye, pp. 148-49.</ref> Agamben has engaged since the nineties in a debate with the political writings of the German jurist [[Carl Schmitt]], most extensively in the study ''State of Exception'' (2003). His recent writings also elaborate on the concepts of Michel Foucault, whom he calls \"a scholar from whom I have learned a great deal in recent years\".<ref>''The Signature of All Things: On Method'' (New York: Zone, 2009), p. 7.</ref>\n\nAgamben's political thought was originally founded on his readings of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Politics'', ''Nicomachean Ethics'', and treatise ''On the Soul'', as well as the exegetical traditions concerning these texts in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. In his later work, Agamben intervenes in the theoretical debates following the publication of Nancy's essay ''La communauté désoeuvrée'' (1983),<ref>Nancy's essay responded to a proposal by [[Jean-Christophe Bailly]], who put the word and concept of ''community'', then relatively neglected in French philosophical discourse, up for discussion. Bailley's contribution was \"The community, the number,\" a topic for an issue of the French magazine ''[[Aléa]]'', which was edited at that time by [[Christian Bourgois]]. Cf. Jean-Luc Nancy, ''La communauté désoeuvrée'' (Paris: Christian Bourgois, 1983). In English transl., ''The Inoperative Community'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991).</ref> and [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s response, ''La communauté inavouable'' (1983). These texts analyzed the notion of [[community]] at a time when the [[European Community]] was under debate. Agamben proposed his own model of a community which would not presuppose categories of identity in ''The Coming Community'' (1990). At this time, Agamben also analyzed the ontological condition and \"political\" attitude of [[Bartleby, the Scrivener|Bartleby]] (from [[Herman Melville]]'s short story) — a ''scrivener'' who does not react, and \"prefers not\" to write.\n\nCurrently, Agamben is teaching at [[Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio]] ([[Università della Svizzera Italiana]]) and has taught at the [[University Iuav of Venice|Università IUAV di Venezia]], the [[Collège International de Philosophie]] in Paris, and the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], Switzerland; he previously taught at the [[University of Macerata]] and at the [[University of Verona]], both in Italy.<ref>See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/giorgio-agamben/biography/ Giorgio Agamben] Faculty profile at [[European Graduate School]]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} He also has held visiting appointments at several American universities, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to [[Northwestern University]], and at [[Heinrich Heine University]], Düsseldorf.

This does not mean, however, that humans are not, and do not have to be, something, that they are simply consigned to nothingness and therefore can freely decide whether to be or not to be, to adopt or not to adopt this or that destiny (nihilism and decisionism coincide at this point). There is in effect something that humans are and have to be, but this is not an essence nor properly a thing: ''It is the simple fact of one's own existence as possibility or potentiality...''|<ref>''The Coming Community'' (1993), section 11.</ref>}}\n\nThe reduction of life to 'biopolitics' is one of the main threads in Agamben's work, in his critical conception of a ''homo sacer'', reduced to 'bare life', and thus deprived of any rights. Agamben's concept of the ''homo sacer'' rests on a crucial distinction in Greek between \"bare life\" (''la vita nuda'' or '''''zoe'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|oʊ|i}}; Gk. ζωή ''zoê'') and \"a particular mode of life\" or \"qualified life\" ('''''bios'''''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|aɪ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|aɪ|oʊ|s}}; Gk. βίος ''bios''). In Part III, section 7 of ''Homo Sacer'', “The Camp as the 'Nomos' of the Modern”, he evokes the [[concentration camps]] of World War II. “The camp is the space that is opened when the state of exception begins to become the rule.” Agamben says that \"What happened in the camps so exceeds (is outside of) the juridical concept of crime that the specific juridico-political structure in which those events took place is often simply omitted from consideration.\" The conditions in the camps were \"''conditio inhumana'',\" and the incarcerated somehow defined outside the boundaries of humanity, under the exception laws of ''[[Schutzhaft]]''. Where law is based on vague, unspecific concepts such as \"race\" or \"good morals,\" law and the personal subjectivity of the judicial agent are no longer distinct.\n\n“In United States criminal law, people accused of committing crimes cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves verbally, but can be compelled to incriminate themselves physically.”<ref>{{cite book|last=Agamben|first=Giorgio|title=The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World|year=1985|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=0195049969|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NEaz8I0KAk4C&pg=PA111 }}</ref>\n\nIn the process of creating a state of exception these effects can compound. In a realized state of exception, one who has been accused of committing a crime, within the legal system, loses the ability to use his voice and represent themselves. The individual can not only be deprived of their citizenship, but also of any form of agency over their own life. “Agamben identifies the state of exception with the power of decision over life.”<ref>[[Jacques Ranciere]]. Who is the Subject of the Rights of Man? ''South Atlantic Quarterly'', 2004, 103(2–3):297–310.</ref> \n\nWithin the state of exception, the distinction between ''bios'' (the life of the citizen) and ''zoe'' (the life of ''homo sacer'') is made by those with judicial power. For example, Agamben would argue that [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]] exemplifies the concept of 'the state of exception' in the United States following 9–11.\n\nAgamben mentions that basic universal [[human rights]] of Taliban individuals while captured in Afghanistan and sent to Guantánamo Bay in 2001 were negated by US laws. In reaction to the removal of their basic human rights, detainees of Guantánamo Bay prison went on [[Guantanamo hunger strike|hunger strike]]s. Within a state of exception, when a detainee is placed outside of the law, he is according to Agamben, reduced to \"bare life\" in the eyes of the judicial powers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Here, one can see why such measures as hunger strikes can occur in such places as prisons. Within the framework of a system that has deprived the individual of power, and their individual basic human freedoms, the hunger strike can be seen as a weapon or form of resistance. “The body is a model which can stand for any bounded system. Its boundaries can represent any boundaries which are threatened or precarious.”<ref>Mary Douglas. ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo'' (1966) London: Ark Paperbacks, 1984, p. 116</ref> Within a state of exception the boundaries of power are precarious and threaten to destabilize not only the law, but one’s humanity, as well as their choice of life or death. Forms of resistance to the extended use of power within the state of exception as suggested in Guantánamo Bay prison also operate outside of the law. In the case of the hunger strike, the prisoners were threatened and endured force feeding not allowing them to die. During the [[hunger strikes]] at Guantánamo Bay prison, accusations and founded claims of forced feedings began to surface in the autumn of 2005. In February 2006, ''The New York Times'' reported that prisoners were being force fed in Guantánamo Bay prison and in March 2006, more than 250 medical experts, as reported by the BBC,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4790742.stm \"Doctors attack US over Guantanamo\"]</ref> voiced their opinions of the forced feedings stating that this was a breach of the government’s power and was against the rights of the prisoners.\n\n===''The Coming Community'' (1993)===\nIn ''The Coming Community'', published in Italian in 1990 and translated into English by longtime admirer [[Michael Hardt]] in 1993, Agamben describes the social and political manifestation of his philosophical thought. Employing diverse short essays he describes the nature of “whatever singularity” as that which has an “inessential commonality, a solidarity that in no way concerns an essence”. It is important to note his understanding of “whatever” not as being indifference but based on the Latin “quodlibet ens”<ref>Carlo Salzani - [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/474289/pdf Quodlibet: Giorgio Agamben's Anti-Utopia]</ref> translated as “being such that it always matters”.\n\nAgamben starts off by describing ''“The Lovable”''\n\n{{quotation|Love is never directed toward this or that property of the loved one (being blond, being small, being tender, being lame), but neither does it neglect the properties in favor of an insipid generality (universal love): The lover wants the loved one ''with all of its predicates'', its being such as it is.|<ref>''The Coming Community'' (1993), page 2.</ref>}}\n\nIn the same sense, Agamben talks about \"ease\" as the \"place\" of love, or \"rather love as the experience of taking-place in a whatever singularity\", which resonates his use of the concept \"use\" in the later works.\n\n{{quotation|In this sense, ease names perfectly that \"free use of the proper\" that, according to an expression of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s, is \"the most difficult task.\"  |<ref>''The Coming Community'' (1993), page 25.</ref>}}\n\nFollowing the same trend, he employs, among others, the following to describe the “watershed of whatever”:\n\n*Example – particular and universal\n*Limbo – blessed and damned\n*Homonym – concept and idea\n*Halo – potentiality and actuality\n*Face – common and proper, genus and individual\n*Threshold – inside and outside\n*Coming community – state and non-state (humanity)<ref name=\"The Coming Community 1993\">''The Coming Community'' (1993){{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOther themes addressed in ''The Coming Community'' include the commodification of the body, evil, and the messianic.\n\nUnlike other continental philosophers he does not reject the age-old dichotomies of subject/object and potentiality/actuality outright, but rather turns them inside-out, pointing out the zone where they become indistinguishable.\n\n{{quotation|Matter that does not remain beneath form, but surrounds it with a halo|<ref name=\"The Coming Community 1993\"/>}}\n\nThe political task of humanity, he argues, is to expose the innate potential in this zone of indistinguishability. And although criticised as dreaming the impossible by certain authors,<ref>Tony Simoes da Silva. [http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_2/dasilva.htm Strip It Bare – Agamben’s Message For A More Hopeful World.] Book Review. 2005</ref> he nonetheless shows a concrete example of ''whatever singularity'' acting politically:\n\n{{quotation|Whatever singularity, which wants to appropriate belonging itself, its own being-in-language, and thus rejects all identity and every condition of belonging, is the principal enemy of the State.

Under the Roman Empire, a man who committed a certain kind of crime was banned from society and all of his rights as a [[citizenship|citizen]] were revoked. He thus became a ''\"[[homo sacer]]\"'' (sacred man). In consequence, he could be killed by anybody, while his life on the other hand was deemed \"sacred\", so he could not be sacrificed in a ritual ceremony.\n\nRoman law no longer applied to someone deemed a ''Homo sacer'', although they would remain \"under the spell\" of law. Agamben defines it as \"human life...included in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be killed)\". ''Homo sacer'' was therefore ''excluded'' from law itself, while being ''included'' at the same time. This figure is the exact mirror image of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] (''[[basileus]]'') — a king, emperor, or president — who stands, on the one hand, ''within'' law (so he can be condemned, e.g., for treason, as a natural person) and ''outside of'' the law (since as a [[body politic]] he has power to suspend law for an indefinite time).\n\nGiorgio Agamben draws on Carl Schmitt's definition of the Sovereign as the one who has the power to decide the state of exception (or ''[[justitium]]''), where law is indefinitely \"suspended\" without being abrogated. But if Schmitt's aim is to include the necessity of state of emergency under the rule of law, Agamben on the contrary demonstrates that all life cannot be subsumed by law. As in ''Homo sacer'', the state of emergency is the inclusion of life and necessity in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion.{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}\n\nSince its origins, Agamben notes, law has had the power of defining what \"bare life\" — ''zoe'', as opposed to ''bios'', that is 'qualified life' — is by making this exclusive operation, while at the same time gaining power over it by making it the subject of political control. The power of law to actively separate \"political\" beings (citizens) from \"bare life\" (bodies) has carried on from [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] to [[Modernity]] — from, literally, [[Aristotle]] to [[Auschwitz]]. Aristotle, as Agamben notes, constitutes political life via a simultaneous inclusion and exclusion of \"bare life\": as Aristotle says, man is an animal born to life (Gk. ζῆν, ''zen''), but existing with regard to the [[Eudaimonia|good life]] (εὖ ζῆν, ''eu zen'') which can be achieved through politics.<ref>''Homo Sacer'', Stanford UP, 1998, p. 66.</ref> Bare life, in this ancient conception of politics, is that which must be transformed, via the State, into the \"good life\"; that is, bare life is that which is supposedly excluded from the higher aims of the state, yet is included precisely so that it may be transformed into this \"good life\". Sovereignty, then, is conceived from ancient times as the power which determines what or who is to be incorporated into the political body (in accord with its ''bios'') by means of the more originary exclusion (or exception) of what is to remain outside of the political body—which is at the same time the source of that body's composition (''zoe'').<ref>\"Sovereign violence is in truth founded not on a pact but on the exclusive inclusion of bare life in the state.\" (''Homo Sacer'', Stanford UP, 1998, p. 107)</ref> According to Agamben, [[biopower]], which takes the bare lives of the citizens into its political calculations, may be more marked in the modern state, but has essentially existed since the beginnings of sovereignty in the West, since this structure of ''ex-ception'' is essential to the core concept of sovereignty.<ref>Of course, this understanding of \"biopower\" is distinct from Foucault's use of the term.</ref>\n\nAgamben would continue to expand the theory of the state of exception first introduced in ''\"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life\"'', ultimately leading to the ''\"State of Exception\"'' in 2005. Instead of leaving a space between law and life, the space where human action is possible, the space that used to constitute politics, he argues that politics has “contaminated itself with law” in the state of exception. Because “only human action is able to cut the relationship between violence and law”, it becomes increasingly difficult within the state of exception for humanity to act against the State.\n\n=== ''State of Exception'' (2005) ===<!--Linked from 'Auctoritas'-->\nIn this book, Giorgio Agamben traces the concept of '[[state of exception]]' (''Ausnahmezustand'') used by Carl Schmitt to Roman ''[[justitium]]'' and ''[[auctoritas]]''. This leads him to a response to Carl Schmitt's definition of [[sovereignty]] as the power to proclaim the exception.\n\nAgamben’s text ''State of Exception'' investigates the increase of power by governments which they employ in supposed times of crisis. Within a state of emergency, Agamben refers to the states of exception, where constitutional rights can be diminished, superseded and rejected in the process of claiming this extension of power by a government.\n\nThe state of exception invests one person or government with the power and voice of authority over others extended well beyond where the law has existed in the past. “In every case, the state of exception marks a threshold at which [[logic]] and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] blur with each other and a pure violence without ''logos'' claims to realize an enunciation without any real reference\" (Agamben, pg 40). Agamben refers a continued state of exception to the Nazi state of Germany under Hitler’s rule. “The entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that lasted twelve years. In this sense, modern totalitarianism can be defined as the establishment, by means of the state of exception, of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination not only of political adversaries but of entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system\" (Agamben, pg 2).\n\nThe political power over others acquired through the state of exception, places one government — or one form or branch of government — as all powerful, operating outside of the laws. During such times of extension of power, certain forms of knowledge shall be privileged and accepted as true and certain voices shall be heard as valued, while of course, many others are not. This oppressive distinction holds great importance in relation to the production of knowledge. The process of both acquiring knowledge, and suppressing certain knowledge, is a violent act within a time of crisis.\n\nAgamben’s ''State of Exception'' investigates how the suspension of laws within a state of emergency or crisis can become a prolonged state of being. More specifically, Agamben addresses how this prolonged state of exception operates to deprive individuals of their citizenship. When speaking about the military order issued by President George W. Bush on 13 November 2001, Agamben writes, “What is new about President Bush’s order is that it radically erases any legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and unclassifiable being. Not only do the Taliban captured in Afghanistan not enjoy the status of POW’s(prisoner of war) as defined by the [[Geneva Convention]], they do not even have the status of people charged with a crime according to American laws\" (Agamben, pg 3). Many of the individuals captured in Afghanistan were taken to be held at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]] without trial. These individuals were termed as “[[enemy combatants]].” Until 7 July 2006, these individuals had been treated outside of the Geneva Conventions by the United States administration.\n\n==== ''Auctoritas'', \"charisma\" and ''Führertum'' doctrine ====\nAgamben shows that ''auctoritas'' and ''[[potestas]]'' are clearly distinct — although they form together a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] system\".<ref>''State of Exception'' (2005){{page needed|date=December 2013}}</ref> He quotes [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], who explains that ''auctoritas'' is \"less than an [[General order|order]] and more than an advice\".<ref>[[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Römisches Staatsrecht'' (\"Roman Constitutional Law\", volume III) (Graz, 1969)</ref>\n\nWhile ''potestas'' derives from social function, ''auctoritas'' \"immediately derives from the ''patres'' personal condition\". As such, it is akin to [[Max Weber]]'s concept of [[charismatic authority|charisma]]. This is why the tradition ordered, at the king's death, the creation of the sovereign’s wax-double in the ''funus imaginarium'', as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] demonstrated in ''The King's Two Bodies'' (1957). Hence, it is necessary to distinguish two bodies of the sovereign in order to assure the continuity of ''dignitas'' (term used by Kantorowicz, here a synonym of ''auctoritas''). Moreover, in the person detaining ''auctoritas'' — the sovereign — [[Public sphere|public life]] and [[Private sphere|private life]] have become inseparable. [[Augustus]], the first Roman emperor who claimed ''auctoritas'' as the basis of ''[[princeps]]'' status in a famous passage of ''Res Gestae'', had opened up his house to public eyes.\n\nThe concept of ''auctoritas'' played a key-role in fascism and [[Nazism]], in particular concerning Carl Schmitt's theories, argues Agamben:\n\n{{quotation|To understand modern phenomena such as the fascist ''[[Duce]]'' or the Nazi ''[[Führer]]'', it is important not to forget their continuity with the principle of ''auctoritas principis'' {Agamben refers here to Augustus's ''Res Gestae''}. {...} Neither does the ''Duce'' nor the ''Führer'' represent constitutionally defined public charges – even though Mussolini and Hitler endorsed respectively the charge of head of government and Reich's chancellor, just as Augustus endorsed the ''imperium consulare'' or the ''potestas tribunicia''. The ''Duce''’s or the ''Führer''’s qualities are immediately related to the physical person and belong to the [[biopolitical]] tradition of ''auctoritas'' and not to the juridical tradition of ''potestas''|<ref>''State of Exception'', chapter 6: \"''Auctoritas'' and ''potestas''\", §7.</ref>}}\n\nThus, Agamben opposes Foucault's concept of \"[[biopolitics]]\" to right (law), as he defines the state of exception, in ''Homo sacer'', as the inclusion of life by right under the figure of ex-ception, which is simultaneously inclusion and exclusion. Following Walter Benjamin's lead, he explains that our task would be to radically differentiate \"pure violence\" from right, instead of tying them together, as did Carl Schmitt.\n\nAgamben concludes his chapter on \"''Auctoritas'' and ''potestas''\" writing:\n\n{{quotation|It is significative that modern specialists were so inclined to admit that ''auctoritas'' was inherent to the living person of the ''pater'' or the ''princeps''. What was evidently an ideology or a ''fictio'' aiming to be the groundwork of ''auctoritas'' ' preeminence or, at least, specific rank compared to ''potestas'' thus became a figure of right's {law – \"droit\"} [[immanence]] to life. (...) Although it is evident that there can't be an eternal human type that would incarnate itself each time in Augustus, Napoleon, Hitler, but only more or less comparable (\"semblables\") mechanisms {\"dispositif\", a term often used by Foucault} – the state of exception, ''justitium'', the ''auctoritas principis'', the ''Führertum'' -, put in use in more or less different circumstances, in the 1930s – overall, but not only – in Germany, the power that Weber had defined as \"charismatic\" is related to the concept of ''auctoritas'' and elaborated in a ''[[Führertum]]'' doctrine as the original and personal power of a leader. In 1933, in a short article intending to define the fundamental concepts of national-socialism, Schmitt defines the ''Führung'' principle by the \"root identity between the leader and his entourage\" {\"''identité de souche entre le chef et son entourage\"''} (we shall note the use of weberian concepts).|<ref>''State of Exception'', chapter 6, §8.</ref>}}\n\nAgamben’s thoughts on the state of emergency leads him to declare that the difference between dictatorship and democracy is thin indeed, as [[rule by decree#Giorgio Agamben's critique of the use of decrees-law|rule by decree]] became more and more common, starting from World War I and the reorganization of constitutional balance. Agamben often reminds that [[Hitler]] never ''abrogated'' the [[Weimar Constitution]]: he ''suspended'' it for the whole duration of the [[Third Reich]] with the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], issued on 28 February 1933. Indefinite suspension of law is what characterizes the state of exception. Thus, Agamben connects Greek political philosophy through to the [[concentration camps]] of 20th century fascism, and even further, to detainment camps in the likes of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo Bay]] or immigration detention centers, such as [[Bari]], Italy, where asylum seekers have been imprisoned in football stadiums. In these kinds of camps, entire zones of exception are being formed: the state of exception becomes a status under which certain categories of people live, a ''capture'' of life by right. Sovereign law makes it possible to create entire areas in which the application of the law itself is held suspended, which is the basis of [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s definition of an \"[[unlawful combatant|enemy combatant\"]].\n\n===''The Highest Poverty'' (2011)===\n\nThe English edition was translated by Adam Kotsko. In this study of medieval monastic rules, Agamben offers a genealogical approach to several concepts that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] established in his late philosophy, primarily the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'': [[rule-following]], [[Form of life (philosophy)|form-of-life]], and the central importance of '[[Use theory|use]]' (for Wittgenstein: 'the meaning of a word is its use in language', and he uses 'language' not just to speak of word-language but any understandable behaviour). Agamben traces earlier versions of the term 'form-of-life' throughout the development of monastic life, beginning with the establishment of a genre of written rules in the fourth century.<ref name=\"Giorgio Agamben 2013\">Giorgio Agamben. The Highest Poverty: Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life. Translated by Adam Kotsko. Stanford CA: Stanford University Press 2013, p.xiii.</ref> The aim of the book is to differentiate between 'law' and a particular use of rule that is opposite to the implementation of law. In order to sketch out the potential of this concept, we would need 'a theory of use – of which Western philosophy lacks even the most elementary principles'.<ref name=\"Giorgio Agamben 2013\"/> Agamben turns to the Franciscans to survey a unique historical incident of a group organising itself with a rule that ''is'' their life, and thinking of their own lives not as their own possession but as a communal 'use'; he looks at the ways in which this idea developed and how it eventually lapsed into the church's law.\nAccording to reviewer [[Nathan Schneider]], \"''The Highest Poverty'' examines two medieval Christian attempts, in the name of eternal life, to live this life beyond the reach of ordinary politics: several centuries of monasticism, and then the brief and momentous epiphany in the movement founded by Francis of Assisi. Each, according to Agamben, fails in revealing ways.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Commies for Christ|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|publisher=The New Inquiry|date=December 13, 2013|url=http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/commies-for-christ/}}</ref>\n\n=== Criticism of US response to 9/11 ===\nGiorgio Agamben is particularly critical of the United States' response to [[11 September 2001 attacks|11 September 2001]], and its instrumentalization as a permanent condition that legitimizes a \"[[state of exception]]\" as the dominant paradigm for governing in contemporary politics. He warns against a \"generalization of the state of exception\" through laws like the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which means a permanent installment of [[martial law]] and [[emergency powers]]. In January 2004, he refused to give a lecture in the United States because under the [[US-VISIT]] he would have been required to give up his [[biometric]] information, which he believed stripped him to a state of \"bare life\" (''zoe'') and was akin to the [[tattooing]] that the [[Nazis]] did during World War II.<ref>{{fr icon}} Giorgio Agamben. {{cite news |title=''Non au tatouage biopolitique'' \"No to Bio-Political Tattooing\" |date=10 January 2004 |publisher=[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/totalControl.html \"No to Bio-Political Tattooing\"] by Giorgio Agamben, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], 10 January 2004</ref>\n\nHowever, Agamben's criticisms target a broader scope than the US \"[[war on terror]]\". As he argues in ''State of Exception'' (2005), [[rule by decree]] has become common since World War I in all modern states, and has been since then generalized and abused. Agamben points out a general tendency of modernity, recalling for example that when [[Francis Galton]] and [[Alphonse Bertillon]] invented \"judicial photography\" for \"[[anthropometric]] identification\", the procedure was reserved to criminals; to the contrary, today's society is tending toward a generalization of this procedure to all citizens, placing the population under permanent suspicion and [[surveillance]]: \"The political body thus has become a criminal body\". And Agamben notes that the [[Jews deportation]] in [[Vichy France|France]] and other occupied countries was made possible by the photos taken from [[identity cards]].<ref>{{fr icon}} Giorgio Agamben. {{cite news|title=''Non à la biométrie'' (\"No to Biometrics\")|date=5 December 2005|publisher=''[[Le Monde]]''|url=http://souriez.info/article.php3?id_article=283}}</ref> Furthermore, Agamben's political criticisms open up in a larger philosophical [[critique]] of the concept of sovereignty itself, which he argues is intrinsically related to the state of exception.\n\n==Bibliography==\nAgamben's major books are listed in order of first Italian publication (with the exception of ''Potentialities'', which first appeared in English), and English translations are listed where available.
