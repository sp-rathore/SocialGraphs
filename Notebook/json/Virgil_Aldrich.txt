He studied at [[Oxford University]] in 1927 and then went on to earn a ''[[Diplôme d'Études Supérieures]] de Philosophie'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1928 before completing his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of California Berkeley]] in 1931. He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich.\n\n==Academic career==\nAldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an [[professor|instructor]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Rice University]] in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at [[Yale University]] in 1931-32. Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946. Appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1962-63. In 1965, he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he remained until his retirement in 1972.  On his retirement, he moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he became an adjunct professor at the [[University of Utah]].\n\nAldrich served as Director of the [[Kyoto American Studies Institute]] in [[Japan]] and for short periods was visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], and [[the University of Texas]].  He served as trustee and president of the [[American Society of Aesthetics]] and president of [[American Philosophical Association]].\n\n==Some Meanings of Vague (1937)==\n\nIn his article ''Some Meanings of Vague'',<ref>Analysis, Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.</ref> Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]], and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.\n\n==Honors==\n* [[L.H.D.]], [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], 1963\n* [[L.H.D.]], [[Kenyon College]], 1972\n\n==Writings==\n'''Books''':\n* ''Language and philosophy'' ([Kyoto]: Kyoto American Studies Seminar, 1955)\n* ''Philosophy of Art'', (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., Prentice-Hall, 1963)\n* ''The Body of a Person'', (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988)\n* ''My Century'', Nantucket, Massachusetts, EditAndPublishYourBook.com/Lulu, November 20, 2010\n* ''Philosophical Reflections'', Nantucket, Massachusetts, EditAndPublishYourBook.com/Lulu, \nDecember 11, 2010\n\n'''Contributions''':\n* ''Readings in Philosophical Analysis'' (1951)\n* ''Reflections on Art'' (1958)\n* ''Religious Experience and Truth'' (1961)\n* ''Faith and the Philosophers'' (1962)\n* ''World Perspectives on Philosophy'' (1967)\n* [http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Aldrich%20Design,%20Composition,%20and%20Symbol%20JAAC%201969.htm \"Design, Composition, and Symbol\"], ''The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' (Vol. 27, No. 4, Summer, 1969), pp.&nbsp;379–388.\n* ''Studies in philosophy: a symposium on Gilbert Ryle'', Edited by Konstantin Kolenda.
