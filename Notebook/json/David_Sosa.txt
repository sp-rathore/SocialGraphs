He received his [[undergraduate degree]] from [[Brown University]] and a doctorate in philosophy from [[Princeton University]]. His [[PhD]] dissertation, completed in 1996 under the supervision of [[Mark Johnston (philosopher)]], was titled \"Representing Thoughts and Language\".  Before moving to [[Texas]], Sosa was a post-doctoral fellow at [[U.C. Berkeley]] and an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Dartmouth College]].  He is the son of the philosopher [[Ernest Sosa]].\n\nSosa appeared in [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Waking Life]]'',<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1102267/</ref> in which he performed a short monologue on the implications of discoveries in [[physics]] on the problem of [[free will]]. He explained the view, often called ''[[hard determinism]]'', which holds that there is no place for free action in a world governed by physical laws since human beings, like everything else in the physical world, are physical things and are thus subject to these same laws.\n\n== Sample publications ==\n\n===Authored===\n*'Consequences of Consequentialism' ([[Mind (journal)|Mind]], 1993)\n*'Reference from a Perspective versus Reference' (Philosophical Issues, 1995)\n*'The Import of the Puzzle About Belief' ([[Philosophical Review]], 1996)\n*'Meaningful Explanation' (Philosophical Issues, 1997)\n*'Perception and Reason' ([[Philosophical Review]], 1998)\n*'Getting Clear on the Concept' (Philosophical Issues, 1998)\n*'Pathetic Ethics' (''Objectivity in Law and Morals'', 2000)\n*'Rigidity in the Scope of Russell's Theory' ([[Noûs]], 2001)\n*'A Big, Good Thing' ([[Noûs]], 2004)\n*'Skepticism about Intuition' (Philosophy, 2006)\n*'Scenes Seen' (Philosophical Books, 2006)\n*'The Conditional Fallacy' ([[Philosophical Review]], 2006) with D.
