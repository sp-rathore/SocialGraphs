Along with [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[On Kawara]], [[Hanne Darboven]] and others, Kosuth gives special prominence to language.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (July 15, 2014), [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/design/on-kawara-conceptual-artist-who-found-elegance-in-every-day-dies-at-81.html On Kawara, Artist Who Found Elegance in Every Day, Dies at 81] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> His art generally strives to explore the nature of [[art]] rather than producing what is traditionally called \"art\". Kosuth's works are frequently [[self-referential]]. He remarked in 1969:\n:\"The 'value' of particular artists after [[Duchamp]] can be weighed according to how much they questioned the nature of art.\"<ref name=\"Kosuth1\">Kosuth J., (1969), [http://www.ubu.com/papers/kosuth_philosophy.html ''Art after Philosophy'']</ref>\n\nKosuth's works frequently reference [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psycho-analysis]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s philosophy of language.<ref name=\"secession.at\"/>\n\nHis first conceptual work ''Leaning Glass'', consisted of an object, a photograph of it and dictionary definitions of the words denoting it.<ref name=\"tate.org.uk\"/> In 1966 Kosuth also embarked upon a series of works entitled ''Art as Idea as Idea'', involving texts, through which he probed the condition of art. The works in this series took the form of photostat reproductions of dictionary definitions<ref name=\"skny.com\">[http://www.skny.com/exhibitions/2008-10-25_neither-appearance-nor-illusion/pressrelease/ neither appearance nor illusion, A Selection of Early Works from the 1960's by Joseph Kosuth, October 25 - December 6, 2008] Sean Kelly Gallery, New York.</ref> of words such as \"water\", \"meaning\", and \"idea\".

The piece features a physical chair, a photograph of that chair, and the text of a dictionary definition of the word \"chair\".  The photograph is a representation of the actual chair situated on the floor, in the foreground of the work. The definition, posted on the same wall as the photograph, delineates in words the concept of what a chair is, in its various incarnations. In this and other, similar works, ''Five Words in Blue Neon'' and ''Glass One and Three'', Kosuth forwards tautological statements, where the works literally are what they say they are.<ref>Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson, ''Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology'', MIT Press, 1999, pxl.

He visited the [[Trobriand Islands]] in the South Pacific (made famous in studies by the anthropologist [[Bronislaw Malinowski]]), and the Huallaga Indians in the Peruvian Amazon.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/>\n\nHung on walls painted his signature dark gray, Kosuth's later, large photomontages trace a kind of artistic and intellectual autobiography. Each consists of a photograph of one of the artist's own older works or installations, overlaid in top and bottom corners by two passages of philosophical prose quoted from intellectuals identified only by initials (they include [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Martin Buber]] and [[Julia Kristeva]]).<ref>\nKen Johnson (November 17, 2000), [http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/17/arts/art-in-review-joseph-kosuth.html ART IN REVIEW; Joseph Kosuth] ''[[New York Times]]''.\n</ref>\n\n===Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Kosuth designed the album cover for ''[[Fragments of a Rainy Season]]'' by [[John Cale]]. For the installation of his 2007 exhibition at La Casa Encendida in Madrid, he collaborated with fellow artist [[Juan Francisco Casas]].\n\n===Commissions===\nSince 1990 Kosuth has also begun working on various permanent public commissions.<ref>[http://www.adamartgallery.org.nz/past-exhibitions/rules-and-meanings-te-kore/ Guests and Foreigners, Rules and Meanings (Te Kore), 2 March - 30 April 2000] Adam Art Gallery, Wellington</ref> In the early 1990s, he designed a Government-sponsored monument to the Egyptologist [[Jean Francois Champollion]] who deciphered the [[Rosetta Stone]] in [[Figeac]]; in Japan, he took on the curatorship of a show celebrating the Tokyo opening of [[Barneys New York]]; and in Frankfurt, Germany, and in Columbus, Ohio, he conceived neon monuments to the German cultural historian [[Walter Benjamin]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In 1994, for the city of [[Tachikawa]], Kosuth designed ''Words of a Spell, for Noëma'', a 136-foot-long mural composed of quotes from [[Michiko Ishimure]] and [[James Joyce]].<ref>Henry Scott-Stokes (October 30, 1994), [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/30/arts/art-japan-plunges-into-public-art.html Japan Plunges Into Public Art] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\nAfter projects at public buildings such as the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] (1997), the [[Parliament House, Stockholm]] (1998), and the [[Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region]] (1999), Kosuth was commissioned to design a floor installation of texts by [[Ricarda Huch]] and [[Thomas Mann]] for the newly renovated [[Bundestag]] in 2001.<ref name=\"secession.at\"/> In 2003, he created three installations in the [[Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum]] in Boston, employing text, archival material, and objects from the museum's collection to comment on the politics and philosophy behind museum collections.<ref name=\"Joseph Kosuth\"/> In 2009, Kosuth's exhibition entitled ''ni apparence ni illusion'' (''Neither Appearance Nor Illusion''), an installation work throughout the 12th century walls of the Louvre Palace, opened at the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris and will become a permanent work in October 2012. In 2011, celebrating the work of [[Charles Darwin]], Kosuth created a commission in the library where Darwin was inspired to pursue his evolutionary theory. His work on the façade of the [[Council of State of the Netherlands]] will be inaugurated in October 2011 and he is currently working on a permanent work for the four towers of the façade of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, expected to be completed in 2012.<ref>Joseph Kosuth, ''The Mind's Image of Itself #3'', September 10 - October 1, 2011, [[Sprüth Magers]], London</ref>\n\n===Lecturer===\nKosuth has taught widely, as a guest lecturer and as a member of faculties at the School of Visual Arts, New York City (1967–85); [[Hochschule für bildende Künste Hamburg]] (1988–90); Staatliche Akademie der bildenden Künste, Stuttgart (1991–97); and the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] (2001–06). Currently Professor at [[University Iuav of Venice|Istituto Universitario di Architettura]], Venice, Kosuth has functioned as visiting professor and guest lecturer at various universities and institutions for nearly forty years, some of which include: [[Yale University]]; [[Cornell University]]: [[New York University]]; [[Duke University]]; [[UCLA]]; [[Cal Arts]]; [[Cooper Union]]; [[Pratt Institute]]; The Museum of Modern Art, New York, Art Institute of Chicago, Royal Academy, Copenhagen; [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford University; University of Rome, Berlin Kunstakademie; [[Royal College of Art]], London; [[Glasgow School of Art]]; [[Hayward Gallery]], London; [[Sorbonne]], Paris; and the Sigmund Freud Museum, Vienna.<ref>[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/events/2011/spring/feb08_friendslecture.shtml Global Conceptualism, Art as An Installation — Some History and Some Theory, 8 February 2011] [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London.</ref> His students have included, among others, [[Michel Majerus]].\n\n===Writings===\nKosuth became the American editor of the [[Art & Language]] journal in 1969.<ref name=\"skny.com\"/> He later was coeditor of The Fox magazine in 1975–76 and art editor of Marxist Perspectives in 1977–78.<ref name=\"Joseph Kosuth\"/> In addition, he has written several books on the nature of art and artists, including ''Artist as Anthropologist''. In his essay \"Art after Philosophy\" (1969),<ref name=\"Kosuth1\"/> he argued that art is the continuation of [[philosophy]], which he saw at an end. He was unable to define art in so far as such a definition would destroy his private self-referential definition of art. Like the [[Situationists]], he rejected [[Formalism (art)|formalism]] as an exercise in [[aesthetics]], with its function to be aesthetic.  Formalism, he said, limits the possibilities for art with minimal creative effort put forth by the formalist.  Further, since concept is overlooked by the formalist, \"Formalist criticism is no more than an analysis of the physical attributes of particular objects which happen to exist in a morphological context\".  He further argues that the \"change from 'appearance' to 'conception' (which begins with Duchamp's first unassisted readymade) was the beginning of 'modern art' and the beginning of '[[conceptual art]]'.\"<ref name=\"Kosuth1\"/> Kosuth explains that works of conceptual art are analytic propositions.  They are linguistic in character because they express definitions of art.  This makes them [[tautology (logic)|tautological]]. Art After Philosophy and After Collected Writings, 1966-1990 reveals between the lines a definition of \"art\" of which Joseph Kosuth meant to assure us. \"Art is an analytical proposition of context, thought, and what we do that is intentionally designated by the artist by making the implicit nature of culture, of what happens to us, explicit - internalizing it's 'explicitness' (making it again, 'implicit') and so on, for the purpose of understanding that is continually interacting and socio-historically located. These words, like actual works of art, are little more than historical curiosities, but the concept becomes a machine that makes the art beneficial, modest, rustic, contiguous, and humble.\"\n\n==Exhibitions==\nIn 1969 Kosuth held his first solo exhibition at [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]], New York.<ref>[http://www.skny.com/artists/joseph-kosuth/ Joseph Kosuth] Sean Kelly Gallery, New York.</ref> That same year, he organized an exhibition of his work, Fifteen Locations, which took place simultaneously at fifteen museums and galleries worldwide; he also participated in the seminal exhibition of Conceptual art at the [[Seth Siegelaub|Seth Siegelaub Gallery]], New York.<ref name=\"Joseph Kosuth\"/> In 1973, the Kunstmuseum Luzern presented a major retrospective of his art that traveled in Europe. In 1981, the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]] and the [[Kunsthalle Bielefeld]] organized another major Kosuth retrospective. He was invited to exhibit at [[documenta]]s V, VI, VII and IX (1972, 1978, 1982, 1992) and the [[Biennale di Venezia]] in 1976, 1993 and 1999.\n\n===Curator===\nFor 'Fifteen People Present Their Favorite Book', a show mounted at Lannis Gallery, New York, in 1967, Kosuth assembled fellow artists [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Sol Lewitt]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Carl Andre]], [[Robert Ryman]], among others. That same year, he founded the Museum of Normal Art, New York. After giving a work in 1989 to the [[Sigmund Freud Museum (Vienna)|Sigmund Freud Museum]], Vienna, Kosuth, heavily influenced by Freud, invited other artists to do likewise; today the museum owns 13 works by 13 Freud-influenced Conceptualists.<ref>Grace Glueck (June 16, 2006), [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/arts/design/16gall.html Art in Review] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> Also in 1989 Kosuth curated the show 'Le Jeu de l'Indicible: Ludwig Wittgenstein et l'Art du Xxe Siècle' to commemorate the 100th birthday of the philosopher, in which he showed numerous works by fellow artists.<ref name=\"secession.at\"/>  The exhibition was shown at the [[Wiener Secession]], Vienna, and the [[Palais des Beaux-Arts]], Brussels.\n\nIn response to the debate surrounding conservative attacks on the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in 1990,<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> Kosuth organized an exhibition entitled \"A Play of the Unmentionable\" focusing on issues of censorship and using works from the permanent collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.margoleavingallery.com/exhibitions/113?artist=60 Joseph Kosuth: Double Reading: An Allegory of Limits, October 23 - December 18, 1993] Margo Leavin Gallery, Los Angeles.</ref> He culled objects from nearly every department of the museum, including religious paintings, many depictions of nudes, social satire and some erotica; among the selected works, therew were sculptures by [[Auguste Rodin]] of lesbians embracing, and furniture from the [[Bauhaus]], the avant-garde German design school closed down by the [[Nazis]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> These were then juxtaposed with pithy and frequently moving observations from a number of writers in a way that emphasizes how perceptions of art are constantly changing. The works' sometimes extensive labels were written by their curators, while the larger type statements emanated from various art historians, philosophers and social critics.<ref>[[Roberta Smith]] (November 11, 1990), [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/11/arts/art-view-unmentionable-art-through-the-ages.html 'Unmentionable' Art Through the Ages] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\nKosuth was awarded a Cassandra Foundation Grant in 1968, at the age of 23, as the choice of [[Marcel Duchamp]] one week before he died.  In 1993, he received the Menzione d'Onore at the [[Venice Biennale]] and was named a [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Chevalier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In 1999, in honour of his work, the French government issued a 3-franc postage stamp in Figeac. In 2001, he received the Laurea Honoris Causa doctorate in Philosophy and Letters from the [[University of Bologna]]. In 2003, Kosuth was awarded the Austrian Republic's highest honour for accomplishments in science and culture, the [[Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria|Decoration of Honour in Gold]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/AB/AB_10542/imfname_251156.pdf | title = Reply to a parliamentary question | language = German | page=1582 | trans_title = | format = pdf | accessdate = 4 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>Joseph Kosuth, ''The Mind's Image of Itself #3'', September 10 - October 1, 2011, [[Sprüth Magers (art gallery)|Sprüth Magers]], London.</ref>  Other awards include the Brandeis Award (1990) and the [[Frederick R.
