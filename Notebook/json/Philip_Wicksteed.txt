He was also an English\n[[Christian Unitarianism|Unitarian theologian]], [[classicist]], [[medievalist]], and [[literary critic]].\n\n==Family background==\nHe was the son of [[Charles Wicksteed]] (1810–1885) and his wife Jane (1814–1902), and was named after his distant ancestor, [[Philip Henry]] (1631–1696), the [[Nonconformist]] clergyman and diarist.<ref>THE DESCENDANTS OF REV.

PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION. TORONTO, CANADA: The Brown-Searle Printing Co. 1899</ref>\n\nHis father was a clergyman within the same tradition of [[English Dissenters|English Dissent]]. His mother was born into the [[Lupton family]], a socially progressive, politically active dynasty of businessmen and traders, long established in [[Leeds]], a city both prosperous and squalid with the rapid growth of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In 1835 Wicksteed had taken up the ministry of the Unitarian place of worship, [[Mill Hill Chapel]], right on [[Leeds City Square|the city's central square]], and two years later the couple married. In 1841 his sister Elizabeth married Jane's brother Arthur (1819–1867), also a Unitarian minister; Uncle Arthur was, according to a family history, \"The Achilles of the Leeds Complete Suffrage Association\"<ref name=lupton55>Lupton, C.A. , ''The Lupton Family in Leeds'', Wm. Harrison and Son 1965, p. 55</ref>– in other words, a [[Achilles|tragic champion]] of the fight for [[universal suffrage]]; see [[Chartism]] and [[Henry Vincent]] for more on the CSA. One of their children, a first cousin to Philip, was the maverick MP and mining engineer [[Arnold Lupton]]. Jane was described as impractical but accomplished (sketching, painting, reciting poetry, etc.) and both the Wicksteed siblings as \"Unitarians of vigorous mind and keen intelligence\".<ref name=lupton39>Lupton, C.A. , ''The Lupton Family in Leeds'', Wm. Harrison and Son 1965, page 39</ref>\n\nPhilip was one of nine children, including Janet, who wrote, as Mrs Lewis, a memoir including her parents; [[Hartley Wicksteed|(Joseph) Hartley]], president of the [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]];<ref>[http://heritage.imeche.org/Biographies/HartleyWicksteed Institute of Mechanical Engineers heritage site.

Rank. ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', Volume 11, (MUP), 1988]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nWicksteed was educated at [[University College, London]] and [[Manchester New College]], the seminary for nonconformist ministers. In 1867 he received his master's degree with a gold medal in [[classics]]. Following his father into the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian ministry]] that year, Wicksteed embarked on an extraordinarily broad range of scholarly and theological explorations.\n\nHis [[theology|theological]] and ethical writings continued long after he left the pulpit (in 1897), and appear to have been a starting point for many of his other fields of scholarly inquiry. These included his interest in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], which not only produced a remarkable list of publications, but also built Wicksteed's reputation as one of the foremost [[medievalists]] of his time. It was Wicksteed's theologically driven interest in and concern for the ethics of modern commercial society, with its disturbing inequalities of wealth and income, which appear to have led him into his economic studies (following on his reading of [[Henry George]]'s 1879 ''Progress and Poverty'').\n\nPerhaps it was just by circumstance that economics entered Wicksteed's field of scholarly vision, as only one of a number of areas of his interest (to most of which he was committed for years before he began his economics) and in the middle of the fourth decade of his life. This led [[Joseph Schumpeter]] to remark that Wicksteed \"stood somewhat outside of the economics profession\".\n\nYet, within a few years Wicksteed was to publish significant economic work of his own, carefully expounding on the theory he learned from [[William Stanley Jevons]], and to become for many years a lecturer on economics for the [[University of London]] [[extension lectures]] (a kind of [[adult education]] program initiated in the 1870s to extend \"the teaching of the universities, to serve up some of the crumbs from the university tables, in a portable and nutritious form, for some of the multitude who had no chance of sitting there\").\n\nIn 1894, Wicksteed published his celebrated ''An Essay on the Co-ordination of the Laws of Distribution'', in which he sought to prove mathematically that a [[Distribution (economics)|distributive system]] which rewarded factory owners according to [[marginal productivity]] would exhaust the total product produced. But it was his 1910 ''The Common Sense of Political Economy'' which most comprehensively presents Wicksteed's [[economic system]]. The 1932 work by [[Lionel Robbins]], ''[[An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science]]'', picked up and developed his ideas.\n\nHe married [[Emily Wicksteed|Emily Solly]],<ref>Ian Steedman, 'Wicksteed, Philip Henry (1844–1927)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38802, accessed 12 Aug 2013]</ref> a daughter of [[Henry Solly|Henry]], a Unitarian minister and social reformer.<ref>Alan Ruston, 'Solly, Henry (1813–1903)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37991, accessed 12 Aug 2013]</ref> The library of [[University College London]] contains correspondence between Emily and [[Maria Sharpe Pearson]], the wife of [[Karl Pearson]].<ref>[[Helga Hacker]] papers, Box 11</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Ian Steedman (1987). \"Wicksteed, Philip Henry,\"  ''The [[New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', pp.&nbsp;919–15.\n* Philip H.
