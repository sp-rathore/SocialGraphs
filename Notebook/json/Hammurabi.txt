The name ''Hammurabi'' derives from the [[Amorite language|Amorite]] term ''ʻAmmurāpi'' (\"the kinsman is a healer\"), itself from ''ʻAmmu'' (\"paternal kinsman\") and ''Rāpi'' (\"healer\").\n\n== Reign and conquests ==\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in c. 1792 BC and upon his death in c. 1750 BC]]\n[[File:Royal portrait - Hamurabi - King of Babylon -1900 before JC -.JPG|thumb|left|upright|This bust, known as the \"Head of Hammurabi\", is now thought to predate Hammurabi by a few hundred years<ref>http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/royal-head-known-head-hammurabi</ref> (''[[Louvre]]'')]]\nHammurabi was an [[Amorite]] [[First Babylonian Dynasty|First Dynasty]] king of the [[city-state]] of Babylon, and inherited the power from his father, [[Sin-Muballit]], in c. 1792 BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=1}}</ref> Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile [[agriculture|agricultural]] land.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop |2005|pp=1–2}}</ref> Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the [[literacy|literate]] classes throughout the [[Middle East]] under Hammurabi.<ref name=\"VM3\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=3}}</ref> The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as [[Elam]], [[Assyria]], [[Isin]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]] for a century or so after its founding. However his father [[Sin-Muballit]] had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian [[hegemony]] and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of [[Borsippa]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], and [[Sippar]].<ref name=\"VM3\" />\n\nThus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] situation. The powerful kingdom of [[Eshnunna]] controlled the upper Tigris River while [[Larsa]] controlled the river delta.  To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]] which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia.  In northern Mesopotamia, the [[Assyria]]n king [[Shamshi-Adad I]], who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in [[Asia Minor]], had expanded his territory into the [[Levant]] and central [[Mesopotamia]],<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=3–4}}</ref> although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe first few decades of Hammurabi's reign were quite peaceful.  Hammurabi used his power to undertake a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=43}}</ref> In c. 1801 BC, the powerful kingdom of [[Elam]], which straddled important [[trade]] routes across the [[Zagros Mountains]], invaded the Mesopotamian plain.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=15–16}}</ref> With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of [[Eshnunna]], destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=17}}</ref> In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of [[Larsa]].<ref name=\"VM18\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=18}}</ref> Hammurabi and the king of [[Larsa]] made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort.<ref name=\"VM18\" /> Angered by Larsa's failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c. 1763 BC.<ref name=\"VM31\">{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAs Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north such as [[Yamhad]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]], the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest.<ref name=\"VM31\" /> Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=40–41}}</ref>  Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon's former ally Mari, although it is possible that the 'conquest' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict.<ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp=54–55}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Van De Mieroop|2005|pp= 64–65}}</ref><ref name=\"Ar45\">{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=45}}</ref>\n\nHammurabi entered into a protracted war with [[Ishme-Dagan I]] of [[Assyria]] for control of Mesopotamia, with both kings making alliances with minor states in order to gain the upper hand. Eventually Hammurabi prevailed, ousting Ishme-Dagan I just before his own death. [[Mut-Ashkur]] the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.\n\nIn just a few years, Hammurabi had succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule.<ref name=\"Ar45\" /> The Assyrian kingdom survived but was forced to pay tribute during his reign, and of the major city-states in the region, only [[Yamhad|Aleppo]] and [[Qatna]] to the west in the [[Levant]] maintained their independence.<ref name=\"Ar45\" /> However, one stele of Hammurabi has been found as far north as [[Diyarbekir]], where he claims the title \"King of the Amorites\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Empire of the Amorites|author=Clay, Albert Tobias|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1919|pages=97}}</ref>\n\nVast numbers of contract [[Clay tablet|tablets]], dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors, have been discovered, as well as 55 of his own letters.<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|p=129}}</ref> These letters give a glimpse into the daily trials of ruling an empire, from dealing with floods and mandating changes to a flawed [[calendar]], to taking care of Babylon's massive herds of livestock.<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|pp=129–130}}</ref> Hammurabi died and passed the reins of the empire on to his son [[Samsu-iluna]] in c. 1750 BC, under whose rule the Babylonian empire began to quickly unravel.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|2005|p=42}}</ref>\n\n== Code of laws ==\n{{Main|Code of Hammurabi}}\n[[File:P1050763 Louvre code Hammurabi face rwk.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Code of Hammurabi]] stele. [[The Louvre|Louvre Museum]], Paris]]\nThe Code of Hammurabi was inscribed on a [[stele]] and placed in a public place so that all could see it, although it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, [[Susa]]; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in [[Iran]] and is now in the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]]. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by [[scribe]]s on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Breasted|2003|p=141}}</ref>\n\nThe structure of the code is very specific, with each offense receiving a specified punishment. The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, or the use of the \"[[Eye for an Eye|Eye for eye, tooth for tooth]]\" ([[An eye for an eye|Lex Talionis]] \"Law of Retaliation\") philosophy.<ref>\"Review: The Code of Hammurabi,\" J.

Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to [[Moses]] and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two.

In northern Mesopotamia, both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from [[Assyria]] by [[Puzur-Sin]] a native [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-speaking ruler, circa 1740 BC. Around the same time, native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia, creating the [[Sealand Dynasty]], in more or less the region of ancient Sumer. Hammurabi's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as [[Adasi]] and [[Bel-ibni]], as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south, [[Elam]] to the east, and to the [[Kassites]] from the northeast. Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding.<ref>Georges Roux – Ancient Iraq</ref> The ''coup de grace'' for the Hammurabi's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC, when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful [[Hittite Empire]], thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia.<ref name=\"D19\">{{harvnb|DeBlois|1997|p=19}}</ref> However, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites did not remain, turning over Babylon to their [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, a people speaking a [[language isolate]], from the [[Zagros mountains]] region.
