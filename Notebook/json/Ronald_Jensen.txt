His supervisor was [[Gisbert Hasenjaeger]]. Jensen taught at [[Rockefeller University]], 1969–71, and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], 1971-73. The balance of his academic career was spent in Europe at the\n[[University of Bonn]], the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Oxford]], and the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]], from which he retired in 2001. He now resides in [[Berlin]].\n\nIn 2015 the European Set Theory Society awarded him and [[John R. Steel]] the ''Hausdorff medal'' for their paper \"K without a measurable\".\n\n==Results==\nJensen's better-known results include the:\n* [[Axiomatic set theory]] [[New Foundations|NFU]], a variant of [[New Foundations]] (NF) where extensionality is weakened to allow several sets with no elements, and the proof of NFU's [[consistency]] relative to [[Peano arithmetic]];\n* Fine structure theory of the [[constructible universe]] '''L'''. This work led to his being awarded in 2003 the [[Leroy P Steele Prize|Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research]] of the [[American Mathematical Society]] for his 1972 paper titled \"The fine structure of the constructible hierarchy\";\n*Definitions and proofs of various [[Infinitary combinatorics|infinitary combinatorial principle]]s in '''L''', including [[diamondsuit|diamond]] <math>\\diamondsuit</math>, [[global square|square]], and [[morass (set theory)|morass]];\n* [[Jensen's covering theorem]] for '''L''';\n* General theory of [[core model]]s and the construction of the [[Dodd–Jensen core model]];\n* Consistency of CH plus [[Suslin's hypothesis]].\n* Technique of [[coding the universe by a real]].\n\n==External links==\n*Jensen's [http://www-irm.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~raesch/org/jensen.html page] at the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]].\n*[http://kgs.logic.at/index.php?id=42 Brief biographies] of past presidents of the [[Kurt Gödel Society]].\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jensen, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American logicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American University alumni]]\n[[Category:Set theorists]]\n[[Category:University of Bonn alumni]]\n[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Ronald Jensen"}}}}
