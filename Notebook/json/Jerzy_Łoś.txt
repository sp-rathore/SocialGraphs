He is especially known for his work in [[Model Theory]], in particular for \"[[Ultraproduct#.C5.81o.C5.9B.27_theorem|&#321;o&#347;'s theorem]]\", which states that any [[first-order predicate calculus|first-order]] formula is true in an ultraproduct if and only if it is true in \"most\" factors (see [[ultraproduct]] for details). In Model Theory he also proved many preservation theorems, but he gave significant contributions, as well, to [[Foundations of Mathematics]], [[Abelian group|Abelian group theory]] and [[Universal algebra]]. In the 60's he turned his attention to [[Mathematical economics]], focusing mainly on production processes and dynamic decision processes.\n\nHe was faculty at academies in Wrocław, Toruń, and Warsaw.\n\nIn 1996 Łoś suffered from a severe brain stroke. He was thenceforward ill until his death in 1998. \n\n==Selected publications==\n*Łoś, Jerzy (1955) Quelques remarques, théorèmes et problèmes sur les classes définissables d'algèbres.
