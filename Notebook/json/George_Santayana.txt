Originally from Spain, Santayana was raised and educated in the United States from the age of eight and identified himself as an American, although he always kept a valid Spanish passport.<ref>George Santayana, \"Apologia Pro Mente Sua,\" in P. A. Schilpp, ''The Philosophy of George Santayana'', (1940), 603.</ref> He wrote in English and is generally considered an American [[man of letters]]. At the age of forty-eight, Santayana left his position at Harvard and returned to Europe permanently, never to return to the United States. His last wish was to be buried in the Spanish pantheon in Rome.\n\nSantayana is popularly known for aphorisms, such as \"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\",<ref>George Santayana (1905) ''Reason in Common Sense'', p. 284, volume&nbsp;1 of ''[[The Life of Reason]]''</ref> \"Only the dead have seen the end of war\",<ref>George Santayana (1922) ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies'', number 25</ref> and the definition of beauty as \"pleasure objectified\".<ref>http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/artbook.html/c8023.htm</ref> Although an atheist, he always treasured the Spanish Catholic values, practices, and worldview in which he was raised. Santayana was a broad-ranging cultural critic spanning many disciplines.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana y Borrás on December 16, 1863, in [[Madrid]], he spent his early childhood in [[Ávila, Spain|Ávila]], Spain. His mother, Josefina Borrás, was the daughter of a Spanish official in the [[Philippines]], and Jorge was the only child of her second marriage. She was the widow of [[Russell Sturgis (1805–1887)|George Sturgis]], a [[Boston]] merchant with whom she had five children, two of whom died in infancy. She lived in Boston for a few years following her husband's death in 1857, but in 1861 moved with her three surviving children to live in Madrid. There she encountered Agustín Ruiz de Santayana, an old friend from her years in the Philippines. They married in 1862. A [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[civil servant]], Ruiz de Santayana was also a painter and minor [[intellectual]].\n\nThe family lived in Madrid and Ávila until 1869, when Josefina Borrás de Santayana returned to Boston with her three Sturgis children, as she had promised her first husband to raise the children in the United States. She left the six-year-old Jorge with his father in Spain. Jorge and his father followed her in 1872, but his father, finding neither Boston nor his wife's attitude to his liking, soon returned alone to Ávila. He remained there the rest of his life. Jorge did not see him again until he entered [[Harvard College]] and took his summer vacations in Spain. Sometime during this period, [[Jorge]]'s first name was anglicized as [[George (given name)|George]], the English equivalent.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hollis Hall, Harvard University.JPG|alt=Hollis Hall: a four-story red brick building with white trim in a courtyard.|thumb|Santayana lived in [[Hollis Hall]] as a student at [[Harvard]].]]\nSantayana attended [[Boston Latin School]] and [[Harvard College]], where he studied under the philosophers [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]] and was involved in eleven clubs as an alternative to athletics. He was founder and president of the Philosophical Club, a member of the literary society known as the O.K., an editor and cartoonist for ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'', and co-founder of the literary journal ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.<ref>Parri, Alice ''Two Harvard Friends: Charles Loeser and George Santayana''[http://berenson.itatti.harvard.edu/berenson/items/show/3028]</ref> In December, 1885, he played the role of Lady Elfrida in the Hasty Pudding theatrical ''Robin Hood'', followed by the production ''Papillonetta'' in the spring of his senior year.<ref>Garrison, Lloyd McKim, ''An Illustrated History of the Hasty Pudding Club Theatricals'', Cambridge, Hasty Pudding Club, 1897.</ref>\n\nAfter graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from Harvard<ref>[http://www.pbk.org/infoview/PBK_InfoView.aspx?t=&id=59 Who Belongs To Phi Beta Kappa], ’Phi Beta Kappa website’’, accessed Oct 4, 2009</ref> in 1886, Santayana studied for two years in [[Berlin]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=SANTAYANA, George|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1555}}</ref> He then returned to Harvard to write his dissertation on [[Hermann Lotze]] and teach philosophy, becoming part of the Golden Age of the Harvard philosophy department. Some of his Harvard students became famous in their own right, including [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. [[Wallace Stevens]] was not among his students but became a friend.<ref>Lensing, George S. (1986). Wallace Stevens: A Poet's Growth. LSU Press. 313 pp. ISBN 0807112976. p.12-13.</ref> From 1896 to 1897, Santayana studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{acad|id=SNTN896G|name=Santayana, George}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1912, Santayana resigned his position at Harvard to spend the rest of his life in Europe. He had saved money and been aided by a legacy from his mother. After some years in Ávila, Paris and [[Oxford]], after 1920, he began to winter in [[Rome]], eventually living there year-round until his death. During his forty years in Europe, he wrote nineteen books and declined several prestigious academic positions. Many of his visitors and correspondents were Americans, including his assistant and eventual literary executor, [[Daniel Cory]]. In later life, Santayana was financially comfortable, in part because his 1935 novel, ''[[The Last Puritan]]'', had become an unexpected best-seller. In turn, he financially assisted a number of writers, including [[Bertrand Russell]], with whom he was in fundamental disagreement, philosophically and politically.\n\nSantayana never married. His romantic life, if any, is not well understood. Some evidence, including a comment Santayana made late in life comparing himself to [[A. E. Housman]], and his friendships with people who were openly [[homosexual]] and [[bisexual]], has led scholars to speculate that Santayana was perhaps homosexual or bisexual himself, but it remains unclear whether he had any actual heterosexual or homosexual relationships.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/santayana/#1</ref>\n\n==Philosophical work and publications==\n[[File:Egotism in German Philosophy (1916).djvu|alt=The first page of Egotism in German Philosophy|thumb|upright|Although schooled in [[German idealism]], Santayana was critical of it and made an effort to distance himself from its [[epistemology]].]]\n\nSantayana's main philosophical work consists of ''[[The Sense of Beauty]]'' (1896), his first book-length monograph and perhaps the first major work on [[aesthetics]] written in the United States; ''[[The Life of Reason]]'' five volumes, 1905–6, the high point of his Harvard career; ''[[Skepticism and Animal Faith|Scepticism and Animal Faith]]'' (1923); and ''[[The Realms of Being]]'' (4 vols., 1927–40). Although Santayana was not a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] in the mold of [[William James]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], or [[John Dewey]], ''The Life of Reason'' arguably is the first extended treatment of [[pragmatism]] written.\n\nLike many of the classical pragmatists, and because he was well-versed in [[evolutionary theory]], Santayana was committed to [[metaphysical naturalism]]. He believed that human [[cognition]], cultural practices, and social institutions have evolved so as to harmonize with the conditions present in their environment. Their value may then be adjudged by the extent to which they facilitate human happiness. The alternate title to ''The Life of Reason'', \"the Phases of Human Progress,\" is indicative of this [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] stance.\n\nSantayana was an early adherent of [[epiphenomenalism]], but also admired the classical [[materialism]] of [[Democritus]] and [[Lucretius]] (of the three authors on whom he wrote in ''Three Philosophical Poets'', Santayana speaks most favorably of Lucretius). He held [[Spinoza]]'s writings in high regard, calling him his \"master and model.\"<ref>The Letters of George Santayana: Book Eight, 1948–1952 By George Santayana p 8:39</ref>\n\nAlthough an [[atheist]],<ref>\"My atheism, like that of Spinoza, is true piety towards the universe, and denies only gods fashioned by men in their own image, to be servants of their human interests.\" George Santayana, \"On My Friendly Critics,\" in ''Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies'', 1922 (from Rawson's Dictionary of American Quotations via credoreference.com). Accessed August 1, 2008.</ref><ref>\"Santayana playfully called himself 'a Catholic atheist,' but in spite of the fact that he deliberately immersed himself in the stream of Catholic religious life, he never took the sacraments. He neither literally regarded himself as a Catholic nor did Catholics regard him as a Catholic.\" Empiricism, Theoretical Constructs, and God, by Kai Nielsen, The Journal of Religion, Vol. 54, No. 3 (Jul., 1974), pp. 199-217 (p. 205), published by The University of Chicago Press.</ref> he held a fairly benign view of religion, in contrast to [[Bertrand Russell]] who held that religion was harmful. Santayana's views on religion are outlined in his books ''Reason in Religion'', ''The Idea of Christ in the Gospels'', and ''Interpretations of Poetry and Religion''. Santayana described himself as an \"[[aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]].\" He spent the last decade of his life at the Convent of the Blue Nuns of the Little Company of Mary on the [[Celian Hill]] at 6 Via Santo Stefano Rotondo in Rome, where he was cared for by the Irish sisters.\n\n==Man of letters==\n[[File:Santayana 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Santayana early in his career]]\nSantayana's one novel, ''[[The Last Puritan]]'', is a ''[[bildungsroman]]'', centering on the personal growth of its protagonist, Oliver Alden. His ''Persons and Places'' is an [[autobiography]]. These works also contain many of his sharper opinions and ''bons mots''. He wrote books and essays on a wide range of subjects, including philosophy of a less technical sort, literary criticism, the history of ideas, politics, human nature, morals, the influence of religion on culture and social psychology, all with considerable wit and humor.\n\nWhile his writings on technical philosophy can be difficult, his other writings are far more accessible and pithy. He wrote poems and a few plays, and left an ample correspondence, much of it published only since 2000.\n\nLike [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], Santayana observed American culture and character from a foreigner's point of view. Like [[William James]], his friend and mentor, he wrote philosophy in a literary way. [[Ezra Pound]] includes Santayana among [[List of cultural references in The Cantos|his many cultural references in]] ''[[The Cantos]]'', notably in \"Canto LXXXI\" and \"Canto XCV\". Santayana is usually considered an American writer, although he declined to become an American citizen, resided in fascist Italy for decades, and said that he was most comfortable, intellectually and aesthetically, at [[Oxford University]].\n\n==Awards==\n* Royal Society of Literature Benson Medal, 1925.<ref>http://www.rslit.org/benson-medal</ref>\n* Columbia University Butler Gold Medal, 1945.<ref>George Santayana; William G.

His philosophy has not fared quite as well. He is regarded by most as an excellent prose stylist, and Professor [[John Lachs]] (who is sympathetic with much of Santayana's philosophy) writes, in ''On Santayana'', that his eloquence may ironically be the very cause of this neglect.\n\nSantayana influenced those around him, including [[Bertrand Russell]], who Santayana single-handedly steered away from the ethics of [[G. E. Moore]].<ref>Michael K. Potter. ''Bertrand Russell’s Ethics''. London and New York: Continuum, 2006. Pp. xiii, 185.
