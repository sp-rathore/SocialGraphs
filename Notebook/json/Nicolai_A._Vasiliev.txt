He was a forerunner of [[Paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]] and [[multi-valued logic]]s.\n\n==Early years==\nVasiliev was born on June 29 [[Old Style|O.S.]], 1880 in [[Kazan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. His father, Professor Alexander V. Vasiliev, was a fairly well known mathematician, his grandfather was the outstanding sinologist Professor [[Vassily P. Vasiliev]],  and his great grandfather was the prominent astronomer Ivan M. Simonov, who was a close colleague of [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky|Nikolai Lobachevsky]].\n\nWanting to  be a psychologist, Vasiliev studied at the medical faculty and  the historico-philological faculty of [[Kazan University]] (1906), where he was offered the position of privat-dozent. \n\nAs a university student, Vasiliev was enthusiastic about [[Symbolism (arts)#Literary world|symbolist style poetry]] and  published some books of verses of his own (for example,''\"The longing  for  eternity\"'')  and  translations  of the poetry of [[Emile Verhaeren]]  and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]].\n\n==Work in logic==\nAlthough Vasiliev outlined an abstract to the article on the \"logic of relatives\"  by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as early as in 1897, it was only in 1908 that he entirely devoted himself to logic.\n\nOn May 18, 1910  Vasiliev presented a lecture (published in October that same year) ''\"On Partial Judgements,  on the Triangle of Opposites,  on  the  Law  of Excluded Third\"'' in which he put forward for the first time ever the idea of (non-Aristotelian)  logic,  free  of  the [[Law of excluded middle|laws  of excluded middle]] and [[Law of noncontradiction|contradiction]].  Reasoning by analogy with the [[Non-Euclidean geometry|\"imaginary\" geometry]] of Lobachevsky, Vasiliev called  his  novel  logic \"imaginary\", for he assumed it was valid for the worlds where the above-mentioned laws did not hold, worlds with beings having other types of sensations. He distinguished levels of logical reasoning, and introduced the notion of metalogic.\n\nVasiliev spent 1912-13 in [[Western Europe]] (mostly [[Germany]])  and published his  salient  works  ''\"Logic  and  Metalogic\"''  and ''\"Imaginary (non-Aristotelian) logic\"''.  Vasiliev constructed  [[non-Aristotelian logic]] using  the concepts, and even the manner of reasoning, common\nto [[Aristotelian logic]].  He was aware of the achievement in mathematical logic (and even carefully studied [[Ernst Schröder]]'s works) but did not make an attempt to formalise \"imaginary\" logic.\n\nHis only work in a foreign language (English) - a concise abstract of his \"imaginary logic\" -  was published in [[Naples]] in 1924.\n\n==Late years==\nIn 1914, when  [[World War I]] broke out, Vasiliev was drafted into the army, where he became seriously [[Mental illness|mentally ill]].  Nevertheless, he  returned  to teaching at Kazan University, but in 1922 was forcibly retired by the new [[Bolshevik]] administration. This act aggravated his  ailment:  Vasiliev spent most of the following 20 years in a mental hospital, thus rescued from the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] regime.  He died  on  December 31, 1940. The place where he was buried is unknown.\n\nThe pioneer ideas of Vasiliev  were  rediscovered in  the  early 1960s, and formed a basis mainly for [[paraconsistent logic]]. Some well-known scholars in the 1960s considered his work to be the precursor of [[multi-valued logic]].  The informal style and conceptual riches of Vasiliev's works make them especially valuable. In 2012 an international conference on Vasiliev's work was held in Moscow where a number of important modern paraconsistent logicians contributed.<ref name=\"2012 Vasiliev Conference\">{{cite web|url=http://vasiliev-logic.ru/pages/program/ |title=2012 Vasiliev Conference }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n; Works\n* Vasiliev, N.A., ''Imaginary Logic''.
