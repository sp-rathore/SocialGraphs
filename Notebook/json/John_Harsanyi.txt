He also made important contributions to the use of game theory and economic reasoning in political and moral philosophy (specifically [[utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]]<ref>[http://emlab.berkeley.edu/facdir/harsanyi.html Economics Faculty Directory<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>) as well as contributing to the study of [[equilibrium selection]]. For his work, he was a co-recipient along with [[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]] and [[Reinhard Selten]] of the 1994 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]].\n\n==Early life==\nHarsanyi was born on May 29, 1920 in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], the son of Alice (Gombos) and Charles Harsanyi, a pharmacy owner.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830905727.html</ref> His parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism a year before he was born.<ref>http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/jharsanyi.pdf</ref> He attended high school at the [[Fasori Gimnázium|Lutheran Gymnasium]] in Budapest. In high school, he became one of the best problem solvers of the [[KöMaL]], the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools. Founded in 1893, this periodical is generally credited with a large share of Hungarian students' success in mathematics. He also won the first prize in the Eötvös mathematics competition for high school students.<ref name=\"nobelbio\">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1994/harsanyi-autobio.html John C. Harsanyi, \"Autobiography\"], in ''Les Prix Nobel. The Nobel Prizes 1994'', Editor Tore Frängsmyr, [Nobel Foundation], Stockholm, 1995</ref>\n\nAlthough he wanted to study mathematics and philosophy, his father sent him to [[France]] in 1939 to enroll in [[chemical engineering]] at the [[University of Lyon]]. However, because of the start of [[World War II]], Harsanyi returned to Hungary to study pharmacology at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] (today: Eötvös Loránd University), earning a diploma in 1944.<ref name=\"weymark\">{{cite journal |first=John A. |last=Weymark |year=2006 |title=John Charles Harsanyi |work=Working Paper No. 06-W07 |publisher=Vanderbilt University |url=http://www.accessecon.com/pubs/VUECON/vu06-w07.pdf }}</ref> As a pharmacology student, Harsanyi escaped conscription into the [[Hungarian Army]] which, as a person of [[Jewish]] [[cultural heritage|descent]], would have meant forced labor.\n\nHowever, in 1944 (after the fall of the [[Miklós Horthy|Horthy]] regime and the seizure of power by the [[Arrow Cross Party]]) his military deferment was cancelled and he was compelled to join a forced labor unit on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/><ref name=\"obituary\">[http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/news/harsanyi.html \"Nobel Laureate John C. Harsanyi, UC Berkeley economist and game theory pioneer, dies at 80\"], ''HAAS News'', UC at Berkeley</ref> After seven months of forced labor, when the German authorities decided to deport his unit to a [[concentration camp]] in [[Austria]], John Harsanyi managed to escape and found sanctuary for the rest of the war in a [[Jesuit]] house.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/><ref name=\"weymark\"/><ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/harsanyi.html \"John Harsanyi (1920–2000)\" by Ariel Scheib], Jewish Virtual Library''</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\nAfter the end of the war, Harsanyi returned to the University of Budapest for graduate studies in philosophy and sociology, earning his Ph.D. in both subjects in 1947. Then a devout [[Catholic]], he simultaneously studied theology, also joining lay ranks of the [[Dominican Order]]. He later abandoned Catholicism, becoming an [[atheist]] for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"weymark\"/> Harsanyi spent the academic year 1947–1948 on the faculty of the Institute of Sociology of the University of Budapest, where he met Anne Klauber, his future wife. He was forced to resign the faculty because of openly expressing his anti-[[Marxist]] opinions, while Anne faced increasing peer pressure to leave him for the same reason.\n\nHarsanyi remained in Hungary for the following two years attempting to sell his family's pharmacy without losing it to the authorities. After it became apparent that the communist party would confiscate the pharmacy in 1950, he fled with Anne and her parents by illegally crossing the border with Austria and then going to [[Australia]] where Klauber's parents had some friends.<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/><ref name=\"weymark\"/><ref name=\"livesofthelaurates\">{{cite book |last=Breit |first=William |first2=Barry T. |last2=Hirsch |title=Lives of the Laureates |edition=4th |location=Cambridge, Mass |publisher=The MIT Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-262-02562-0 }}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\nThe two did not marry until they arrived in Australia because Klauber's immigration papers would need to be changed to reflect her married name. The two arrived with her parents on December 30, 1950 and they looked to marry immediately. Harsanyi and Klauber were married on January 2, 1951. Neither spoke much English and understood little of what they were told to say to each other. Harsanyi later explained to his new wife that she had promised to cook better food than she usually did.<ref name=\"livesofthelaurates\"/>\n\nHarsanyi's Hungarian degrees were not recognized in Australia, but they earned him credit at the [[University of Sydney]] for a [[master's degree]]. Harsanyi worked in a factory during the day and studied [[economics]] in the evening at the [[University of Sydney]], finishing with a M.A. in 1953. While studying in Sydney, he started publishing research papers in economic journals, including the ''Journal of Political Economy'' and the ''Review of Economic Studies''. The degree allowed him to take a teaching position in 1954 at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Brisbane]].<ref name=\"weymark\"/> While in Brisbane, Harsanyi's wife became a [[fashion]] designer for a small factory.<ref name=\"livesofthelaurates\"/>\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1956, Harsanyi received a [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller scholarship]] that enabled him and Anne to spend the next two years in the [[United States]], at [[Stanford University]] and, for a semester, at the [[Cowles Foundation]]. At Stanford Harsanyi wrote a dissertation in [[game theory]] under the supervision of [[Kenneth Arrow]], earning a second PhD in economics in 1959, while Anne earned an MA in psychology. Harsanyi's student visa expired in 1958 and the two returned to Australia.\n\nAfter working for a short time as a researcher at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]], Harsanyi became frustrated with the lack of interest in game theory in Australia. With the help of Kenneth Arrow and [[James Tobin]], he was able to move to the [[United States]], taking a position as professor of economics at the [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]] between 1961–1963. In 1964, he moved to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]], he remained at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] until retiring in 1990. Shortly after arriving in Berkeley, he and Anne had a child, Tom. While teaching at Berkeley, John Harsanyi did extensive research in [[game theory]]. From 1966 to 1968, Harsanyi was part of a team of game theorists tasked with advising the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in collaboration with Mathematica, a consulting group from [[Princeton University]] led by [[Harold Kuhn]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]].<ref name=\"nobelbio\"/><ref name=\"weymark\"/>\n\nJohn Harsanyi died on August 9, 2000 from a [[heart attack]] in Berkeley, California, after he suffered from [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=\"weymark\"/>\n\n==Publications==\nHarsanyi began researching [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian ethics]] while at the [[University of Queensland]] in [[Brisbane]]. He published two papers explaining that before understanding moral problems, the difference between people's personal preferences and their moral preferences must be distinguished.<ref name=\"livesofthelaurates\"/>\n\nAfter Nash's publications on game theory, Harsanyi became increasingly interested in the topic.<ref name=\"livesofthelaurates\"/>\n* {{cite journal | last = Harsanyi | first = John C. | title = Cardinal utility in welfare economics and in the theory of risk-taking | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 434–435 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi= 10.1086/257416 | jstor = 1827289 | date = October 1953 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/257416 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://darp.lse.ac.uk/papersdb/Harsanyi_%28JPolE_53%29.pdf Pdf.]\n* {{cite journal | last = Harsanyi | first = John C. | title = Cardinal welfare, individualistic ethics, and interpersonal comparisons of utility | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 309–321 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press|Chicago Journals]] | doi= 10.1086/257678 | jstor = 1827128 | date = August 1955 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/257678 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://econdse.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Harsanyi_JPolE_55.pdf Pdf.]\n* {{cite journal | last = Harsanyi | first = John C. | title = Bargaining in ignorance of the opponent's utility function | journal = [[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–38 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi= 10.1177/002200276200600104 | jstor = 172875 | date = March 1962 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/002200276200600104 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Harsanyi | first = John C. | title = Games with incomplete information played by \"Bayesian\" players, I-III. part I.
