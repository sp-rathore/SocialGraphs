In 1942, he was murdered by the [[Nazi]]s during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|Occupation of France]].\n\nBorn in [[Saint-Petersburg]], he left the [[USSR]] in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the [[Lycée Henri IV]] and the [[Sorbonne]] University. A pupil of French philosopher [[Victor Basch]], he worked on [[aesthetics]] and wrote an essay, ''L'Esthétique française contemporaine'' (''French contemporan aesthetic''), Félix Alcan, 1936.\n\nInvolved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the [[Front populaire]] and the [[Spanish Republic]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1937. Among his friends were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Gaston Bachelard]] and [[Georges Politzer]]. In September 1939, he volunteered for the [[French Army]] despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in [[Rethel]], he began to write his ''Journal de guerre'' in January 1940 in the middle of the [[Phoney War]].

He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the [[French Resistance]]. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, [[Rouen]] and [[Paris]]. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationnist [[Vichy regime]] and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper ''L'Avenir normand'' in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review ''[[La Pensée libre]]'', supervised by [[Georges Politzer]], [[Jacques Decour]] and [[Jacques Solomon]].

Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Valentin Feldman was executed by a firing squad on July 27, 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: '''\" Imbecile, it is for you that I die! \"'''<ref>Valentin Feldman, ''Journal de guerre, 1940-1941'', Farrago, 2006, p. 7.</ref>\n\nHis last words inspired numerous French writers : [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Aragon]] were among them.<ref>Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Cahiers pour une morale'', Gallimard, 1983, p. 212 ; Louis Aragon, ''L'Homme communiste'', Gallimard, 1946, p. 42.</ref> These words are also known outside France.
