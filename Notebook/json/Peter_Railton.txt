Lewis]]. Although his dissertation concerned scientific explanation, on which he has published several articles, his main research since centers on contemporary [[metaethics]] and [[normative ethics]], especially [[consequentialism]]. He is the author of the book ''Facts, Norms, and Values'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), a collection of his major papers in ethics, and a co-editor (with [[Stephen Darwall]] and [[Allan Gibbard]]) of ''Moral Discourse and Practice: Some Philosophical Approaches'' (Oxford University Press, 1996).\n\nA public lecture he gave concerning his own struggles with depression attracted widespread notice and praise in the academic community.<ref>https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/02/25/professors-reflections-his-battle-depression-touch-many-recent-disciplinary-meeting</ref>\n\n==Moral Realism==\n\nRailton has playfully described himself as a \"stark, raving moral realist\".<ref>\n\"Moral Realism\", ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 95, No. 2 (April 1986), p. 165</ref> However, unlike some moral realists, he thinks moral facts that make moral statements true are natural facts.\n\n==Selected publications==\n* 1984, \"Alienation, Consequentialism, and the Demands of Morality,\" ''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', Vol. 13, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;134–171.\n* 1986, \"Moral Realism,\" ''The Philosophical Review'', Vol. 95, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;163–207.\n* 1991, \"Moral Theory As A Moral Practice,\" ''Noûs'', Vol. 25, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;185–190.\n* 1992, \"Some Questions About the Justification of Morality,\" ''Philosophical Perspectives'', Vol. 6, pp.&nbsp;27–53.\n* 1992, \"Pluralism, Determinacy, and Dilemma,\" ''Ethics'', Vol. 102, No. 4, pp.&nbsp;720–742.\n* 1993, \"Noncognitivism about Rationality: Benefits, Costs, and an Alternative,\" ''Philosophical Issues'', Vol. 4, pp.&nbsp;36–51.\n* 1994, \"Truth, Reason, and the Regulation of Belief,\" ''Philosophical Issues'', Vol. 5, pp.&nbsp;71–93. \n* 1996, \"Moral Realism: Prospects and Problems,\" in Sinnott-Armstrong and Timmons (eds.), ''Moral Knowledge?'', Oxford University Press.\n* 1996, ''Moral Discourse and Practice'' (co-edited with Stephen Darwall and Allan Gibbard), Oxford University Press.\n* 2003, ''Facts, Values, and Norms'', Cambridge University Press.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0304/May10_04/08.shtml 4 U-M scholars named AAAS fellows]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/13443 Video interview/discussion with Railton] on Bloggingheads.tv\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Railton, Peter}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Consequentialists]]\n[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:21st-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:American philosophy academics]]\n[[Category:Moral philosophers]]\n[[Category:University of Michigan faculty]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n\n\n{{US-philosopher-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Peter Railton"}}}}
