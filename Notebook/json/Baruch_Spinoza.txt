His books were also later put on the Catholic Church's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.\n\nSpinoza lived an outwardly simple life as a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] grinder, turning down rewards and honours throughout his life, including prestigious teaching positions. He died at the age of 44 allegedly of a lung illness, perhaps [[tuberculosis]] or [[silicosis]] exacerbated by fine glass dust inhaled while grinding optical lenses.

They were expelled in 1615 and moved to [[Rotterdam]], where Isaac died in 1627.\n\nSpinoza's father, Miguel (Michael), and his uncle, Manuel, then moved to Amsterdam where they resumed the practice of Judaism.

Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 47</ref> Although he wrote in Latin, Spinoza learned Latin late in his youth.\n\nSpinoza had a traditional Jewish upbringing, attending the Keter Torah [[yeshiva]] of the Amsterdam Talmud Torah congregation headed by the learned and traditional senior Rabbi [[Saul Levi Morteira]]. His teachers also included the less traditional Rabbi [[Manasseh ben Israel]], \"a man of wide learning and secular interests, a friend of [[Gerardus Vossius|Vossius]], [[Hugo Grotius|Grotius]], and [[Rembrandt]]\".<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.8.</ref>  While presumably a star pupil, and perhaps considered as a potential rabbi, Spinoza never reached the advanced study of the Torah in the upper levels of the curriculum.<ref name=\"See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1\">See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1</ref> Instead, at the age of 17, after the death of his elder brother, Isaac, he cut short his formal studies in order to begin working in the family importing business.<ref name=\"See Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1\"/>\n\nIn 1653, at age 20, Spinoza began studying Latin with Francis van den Enden ([[Franciscus van den Enden]]), a notorious free thinker, former Jesuit, and radical democrat who likely introduced Spinoza to scholastic and [[modern philosophy]], including that of Descartes.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, pp.20-21; Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.27, n.27, p.189.</ref> (A decade later, in the early 1660s, Van den Enden was considered to be a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] and [[atheist]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/fvde/Bio3.htm |title= Franciscus van den Enden/Biography |author=Frank Mertens, Ghent University |date=30 June 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref> and his books were put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Catholic Index of Banned Books]].)\n\nSpinoza's father, Miguel, died in 1654 when Spinoza was 21.

If he succeeds, I shall at once admit defeat, and he will be my mighty Apollo. For I confess that all my efforts over a long period have resulted in no such discovery.

For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch.1, p.21.</ref> He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting \"Heretic!\" He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.21.</ref>\n\nAfter his father's death in 1654, Spinoza and his younger brother Gabriel (Abraham).<ref name=\"Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.1\"/> ran the family importing business. The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]. In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.25.</ref> In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid).<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.26-27.</ref>\n\nSpinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by [[Descartes]], and to optics.\n\n===Expulsion from the Jewish community===\nOn 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: {{hebrew|חרם}}, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23-year-old Spinoza.<ref>Scruton 1986 (2002 ed.), ch. 1, p.21.</ref> The following document translates the official record of the censure:<ref name=\"ts66\">Steven Nadler, Spinoza: A Life, Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (23 April 2001), ISBN 978-0-521-00293-6, Page: 120</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe Lords of the ma'amad, having long known of the evil opinions and acts of Baruch de Espinoza, have endeavoured by various means and promises, to turn him from his evil ways. But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable ''chachamin'' [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel. By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in. The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law. But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day. We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him.</blockquote>\n\nThe Talmud Torah congregation issued censure routinely, on matters great and small, so such an edict was not unusual.<ref>Yitzhak Melamed, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University, speaking at an Artistic Director's Roundtable, Theater J, Washington D.C., 18 March 2012. See also Nadler 2001, ch. 1, p.7.</ref> \n[[File:Espinoza estatua.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Statue of Spinoza, near his house on the Paviljoensgracht in [[The Hague]].]] \nThe language of Spinoza's censure is unusually harsh, however, and does not appear in any other censure known to have been issued by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.1, p.2.</ref> The exact reason for expelling Spinoza is not stated.<ref>Steven B. Smith, ''Spinoza's book of life: freedom and redemption in the Ethics'', Yale University Press (1 December 2003), p.xx/Introduction [https://books.google.com/books?id=j0dMphwIwQ8C&pg=PT19&lpg=PT19&dq=cherem+-+spinoza+-+unknown&source=bl&ots=OPBy3G58Jj&sig=B4K5gEHFfPBwKtnK0kPxfqeE2mY&hl=en&ei=LlJITLe9FMT7lweKpMWbCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=cherem%20-%20spinoza%20-%20unknown&f=false google books]</ref> The censure refers only to the \"abominable heresies that he practised and taught,\" to his \"monstrous deeds,\" and to the testimony of witnesses \"in the presence of the said Espinoza.\" There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure.\n\nFirst, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public. As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: \"No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises. In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews. Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?\"<ref>Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato.standord.eu]</ref>\n\nSecond, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former \"conversos\" who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren. This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion.<ref>Nadler 2001, ch. 2, pp. 17–22.</ref> There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But \"in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law.\"<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.19.</ref> Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might \"disturb the liberty we enjoy.\"<ref>Nadler 2001, ch.2, p.20.</ref> Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.<ref>See Nadler 2001, ch.2, pp.19-21.</ref>\n\nThird, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'' that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves.

This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#4</ref><ref>''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part IV, preface: \"''Deus seu Natura''\".</ref> Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>http://philosophy.lander.edu/intro/spinoza.shtml</ref><ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/#3</ref> Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against \"received authority.\" He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,<ref name=tws9912/> namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning \"that which stands beneath\" rather than \"matter\") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser \"entities\" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics.''<ref name=tws908/> Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do.\n\nSpinoza contends that \"''Deus sive Natura''\" is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two. His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance. It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors. He directly contests dualism. The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects. This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind–body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]. Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part. Spinoza argues that \"things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,\";<ref>Baruch Spinoza. ''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans. by Samuel Shirley and ed. by Michael L. Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33.</ref> he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe. Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change. No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God. Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them.\nNot only is it impossible for two infinite substances to exist (two infinities being absurd),<ref>''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6.</ref> God—being the ultimate substance—cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental substance.\n\nSpinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[necessity]]. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do. By forming more \"adequate\" ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.\nTherefore, humans have no free will. They believe, however, that their will is free. This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes. Humans think they are free but they ″dream with their eyes open″. For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses. In his letter to G. H. Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: \"men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined.\"<ref>''Ethics'', Pt. I, Prop. XXXVI, Appendix: \"[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.\"</ref>\n\nThis picture of Spinoza's determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in ''Ethics'': ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″<ref>''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2.</ref> Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness. However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion. On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion. For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not. He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]].<ref>Roger Scruton, ''Spinoza, A very Short Introduction'', p.86</ref>\n\n===Ethical philosophy===\nSpinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing.<ref>http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html</ref> Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good. Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity. Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans. Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which \"All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection.\" Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]].\n\n===Spinoza's ''Ethics''===\n{{Main|Ethics (Spinoza)}}\nIn the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature. According to Spinoza, reality is perfection. If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality. While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence. Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth. His concept of \"[[conatus]]\" states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine. According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe.\n\nAlso in the \"Ethics\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics}}</ref> Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be “mutilated, confused, and without order.” {{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1–5}} Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.\nSpinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions. He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue. \nSpinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind. In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence. This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue. {{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1–5}}\n\nIn the final part of the \"[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]\", his concern with the meaning of \"true blessedness\", and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s. His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal.\n\nGiven Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where \"necessity\" reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning. The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception.\n\n==History of reception==\n\n===Pantheist, panentheist, or atheist?===\n{{Main|Spinozism}}{{see also|Pantheism controversy}}\n[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|left|An unfavorable engraving depiction of philosopher Spinoza, captioned in Latin, \"A Jew and an Atheist\".]]\nIt is a widespread belief that Spinoza equated God with the material universe.

Allanson, \"Pantheism: Its Story and Significance\", 1905</ref> and \"prince\"<ref>Fraser, Alexander Campbell \"Philosophy of Theism\", William Blackwood and Sons, 1895, p 163</ref> and most eminent expounder of [[pantheism]]. More specifically, in a letter to Henry Oldenburg he states, \"as to the view of certain people that I identify God with Nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\".<ref>Correspondence of Benedict de Spinoza, Wilder Publications (26 March 2009), ISBN 978-1-60459-156-9, letter 73</ref> For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a ''mode'' under two ''attributes'' of Thought and [[Extension (metaphysics)|Extension]]. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world.\n\nAccording to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]] (1883–1969), when Spinoza wrote in ''{{lang|la|Deus sive Natura}}'' (Latin for 'God or Nature'), Spinoza meant God was ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturans]]}}'' (nature doing what nature does; literally, 'nature naturing'), not ''{{lang|la|[[natura naturata]]}}'' (nature already created; literally, 'nature natured'). Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence.<ref name=\"ts64\">Karl Jaspers, Spinoza (Great Philosophers), Harvest Books (23 October 1974), ISBN 978-0-15-684730-8, Pages: 14 and 95</ref> Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course \"divisible\"; it has parts. But Spinoza said, \"no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided\", meaning that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance. He also said, \"a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible\" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13).<ref name=\"ts65\">Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), ISBN 978-0-415-10782-2, Page: 40</ref> Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula \"One and All\" would apply to Spinoza only if the \"One\" preserves its transcendence and the \"All\" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.<ref name=ts64/>\n\n[[Martial Guéroult]] (1891–1976) suggested the term \"[[panentheism]]\", rather than \"pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \"in\" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God.<ref name=ts65/> However, American panentheist philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] (1897–2000) insisted on the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe Spinoza's view.<ref>Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, \"Philosophers Speak of God,\" Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4</ref>\n\nIn 1785, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Gotthold Lessing]] was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a \"Spinozist\", which was the equivalent in his time of being called an [[atheist]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism. The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.\n\nThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late 18th-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\n* the unity of all that exists;\n* the regularity of all that happens;\n* the identity of spirit and nature.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, & Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>\nBy 1879, Spinoza’s pantheism was praised by many, but was considered by some to be alarming and dangerously inimical.<ref>\"The Pantheism of Spinoza Dr. Smith regarded as the most dangerous enemy of Christianity, and as he announced his conviction that it had gained the control of the schools, press and pulpit of the Old World [Europe], and was rapidly gaining the same control of the New [United States], his alarm and indignation sometimes rose to the eloquence of genuine passion.\" ''Memorial of the Rev. Henry Smith, D.D., LL D., Professor of Sacred Rhetoric and Pastoral Theology in [[Lane Theological Seminary]], Consisting of Addresses on Occasion of the Anniversary of the Seminary, May 8th, 1879, Together with Commemorative Resolutions'', p. 26.</ref>\n\nSpinoza's \"God or Nature\" (''Deus sive Natura'') provided a living, natural God, in contrast to [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[first cause argument]] and the dead mechanism of [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]]'s (1709–1751) work, ''[[Man a Machine]]'' (''{{lang|fr|L'homme machine}})''. Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a ''religion of nature''.<ref name=tws908/> [[Novalis]] called him the \"God-intoxicated man\".<ref name=tws9912/><ref name=tws9902/> Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay \"[[The Necessity of Atheism]]\".<ref name=tws9912/>\n\nSpinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word \"God\" (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. \"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law....\"<ref>Frank Thilly, ''A History of Philosophy'', § 47, Holt & Co., New York, 1914</ref> Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God<ref>\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.\" These words were spoken by Albert Einstein, upon being asked if he believed in God by Rabbi Herbert Goldstein of the Institutional Synagogue, New York, 24 April 1921, published in the New York Times, 25 April 1929; from ''Einstein: The Life and Times'' Ronald W. Clark, New York: World Publishing Co., 1971, p. 413; also cited as a telegram to a Jewish newspaper, 1929, Einstein Archive 33-272, from Alice Calaprice, ed., ''The Expanded Quotable Einstein'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University</ref> is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.\n\nAccording to the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect”, (Ethics 2p11c) all knowing, (2p3) and capable of loving both himself—and us, insofar as we are part of his perfection. (5p35c) And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends ''amor intellectualis dei'' (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man. (5p33) However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1apendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).<ref name=\"stanford\">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Per|title=Pantheism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Steven Nadler]] suggests that settling the question of Spinoza's atheism or pantheism depends on an analysis of attitudes. If pantheism is associated with religiosity, then Spinoza is not a pantheist, since Spinoza believes that the proper stance to take towards God is not one of reverence or religious awe, but instead one of objective study and reason, since taking the religious stance would leave one open to the possibility of error and superstition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/#GodNat |title=Baruch Spinoza (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison to Eastern philosophies===\nSimilarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authors. The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was <blockquote>... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.<ref>Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.</ref><ref>The Westminster Review, Volumes 78-79, Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy, 1862. p1862</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Max Muller]], in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying \"the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.\"<ref>Three Lectures on the Vedanta Philosophy. F. Max Muller. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. p123</ref> [[Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]] also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay \"As to Spinoza's Deity—natura naturans—conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity—as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct out-flowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.\"<ref>H.P Blavatsky's Collected Writings, Volume 13, pages 308-310. Quest Books</ref>\n\n===Spinoza's reception in the 20th century===\n\nLate 20th-century Europe demonstrated a greater philosophical interest in Spinoza, often from a left-wing or [[Marxist]] perspective. [[Karl Marx]] liked Spinoza's account of the universe, interpreting it as materialistic.<ref name=tws908/> Notable philosophers [[Louis Althusser]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Étienne Balibar]] have each drawn upon Spinoza's philosophy. Deleuze's doctoral thesis, published in 1968, refers to him as \"the prince of philosophers\".<ref>Deleuze, 1968.</ref> Other philosophers heavily influenced by Spinoza include [[Constantin Brunner]] and John David Garcia. [[Stuart Hampshire]] wrote ''[[Spinoza (book)|Spinoza]]'', a major English language study of Spinoza, though [[H. H. Joachim]]'s work is equally valuable. Unlike most philosophers, Spinoza was highly regarded by [[Nietzsche]].<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich, \"FOURTH DIVISION Concerning the Soul of Artists and Authors\", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt. I&II'' (Dover Philosophical Classics), Kindle Edition (2012-03-15), Aphorism 157, p. 95.</ref><ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich, \"EIGHTH DIVISION A Glance at the State\", in ''Human, All-Too-Human: Parts One and Two: Pt.

A Contextualist Study, Particularly on the Reception of Kuno Fischer, in: ''Journal of Nietzsche Studies'' 43/2 (2012), pp. 156-184.</ref>\n\nSpinoza was an important philosophical inspiration for [[George Santayana]]. When Santayana graduated from college, he published an essay, \"The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza\", in ''The Harvard Monthly''.<ref>George Santayana, \"The Ethical Doctrine of Spinoza\", ''The Harvard Monthly'', 2 (June 1886: 144–52)</ref> Later, he wrote an introduction to ''Spinoza's Ethics and \"De intellectus emendatione\"''.<ref>George Santayana, \"Introduction\", in ''Spinoza's Ethics and \"De intellectus emendatione\"''(London: Dent, 1910, vii–xxii)</ref> In 1932, Santayana was invited to present an essay (published as \"Ultimate Religion\")<ref>George Santayana, \"Ultimate Religion\", in ''Obiter Scripta'', eds. Justus Buchler and Benjamin Schwartz (New York and London: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1936) 280-297.</ref> at a meeting at [[The Hague]] celebrating the tricentennial of Spinoza's birth. In Santayana's autobiography, he characterized Spinoza as his \"master and model\" in understanding the naturalistic basis of morality.<ref>George Santayana, ''Persons and Places'' (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 1986) 233–36.</ref>\n\n===Spinoza's religious criticism and its effect on the philosophy of language===\n[[File:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|right|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]\nPhilosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] evoked Spinoza with the title (suggested to him by [[G. E. Moore]]) of the English translation of his first definitive philosophical work, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', an allusion to Spinoza's ''[[Tractatus Theologico-Politicus]]''. Elsewhere, Wittgenstein deliberately borrowed the expression ''[[sub specie aeternitatis]]'' from Spinoza (''Notebooks, 1914-16'', p.&nbsp;83). The structure of his ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' does have some structural affinities with Spinoza's ''Ethics'' (though, admittedly, not with the latter's own ''Tractatus'') in erecting complex philosophical arguments upon basic logical assertions and principles. Furthermore, in propositions 6.4311 and 6.45 he alludes to a Spinozian understanding of eternity and interpretation of the religious concept of eternal life, stating that \"If by eternity is understood not eternal temporal duration, but timelessness, then he lives eternally who lives in the present.\" (6.4311) \"The contemplation of the world sub specie aeterni is its contemplation as a limited whole.\" (6.45)\n\n[[Leo Strauss]] dedicated his first book, ''Spinoza's Critique of Religion'', to an examination of the latter's ideas. In the book, Strauss identified Spinoza as part of the tradition of Enlightenment rationalism that eventually produced Modernity. Moreover, he identifies Spinoza and his works as the beginning of Jewish Modernity.<ref name=tws9912/> More recently [[Jonathan Israel]], Professor of Modern European History at The [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], has made a detailed case that from 1650 to 1750 Spinoza was \"the chief challenger of the fundamentals of revealed religion, received ideas, tradition, morality, and what was everywhere regarded, in absolutist and non-absolutist states alike, as divinely constituted political authority.\"<ref>Israel, J. (2001) Radical Enlightenment; Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750, Oxford, Oxford University Press, p159.</ref>\n\n===Spinoza in literature, art, and popular culture===\nSpinoza has had influence beyond the confines of philosophy.\n*On the Chair's table in the Dutch Parliament, Spinoza's ''Tractatus theologico-politicus'' is one of three books thought to be most representative of the beliefs and ethics of the Dutch people; the other two are the [[Bible]] and the [[Qu'ran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4500/Politiek/article/detail/3282363/2012/07/05/Van-der-Ham-biedt-Verbeet-Spinoza-aan---voor-naast-Bijbel-en-Koran.dhtml |title=Van der Ham biedt Verbeet Spinoza aan |publisher=RTL Nieuws | date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> \n*The 19th century novelist [[George Eliot]] produced her own translation of the ''Ethics'', the first known English translation of it. Eliot liked Spinoza's vehement attacks on superstition.<ref name=tws908/>\n*In his autobiography \"From My Life: Poetry and Truth\", Goethe recounts the way in which Spinoza's ''Ethics'' calmed the sometimes unbearable emotional turbulence of his youth. Goethe later displayed his grasp of Spinoza's metaphysics in a fragmentary elucidation of some Spinozist ontological principles entitled ''Study After Spinoza''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |title=Goethe: Studie nach Spinoza - Aufsätze und Rezensionen |publisher=Textlog.de |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110513034307/http://www.textlog.de/41473.html |archivedate = 13 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Moreover, he cited Spinoza alongside Shakespeare and [[Carl Linnaeus]] as one of the three strongest influences on his life and work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html |title=Linné on line - What people have said about Linnaeus |publisher=Linnaeus.uu.se |accessdate=2 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110608101238/http://www.linnaeus.uu.se/online/life/8_3.html| archivedate= 8 June 2011| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n*The 20th century novelist [[W.

Spinoza equated God (infinite substance) with Nature, consistent with Einstein's belief in an impersonal deity. In 1929, Einstein was asked in a telegram by [[Herbert S. Goldstein|Rabbi Herbert S.
