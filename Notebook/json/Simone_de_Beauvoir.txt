Olga was one of her students in the Rouen secondary school where de Beauvoir taught during the early '30s. She grew fond of Olga. Sartre tried to pursue Olga but she denied him, so he began a relationship with her sister Wanda, instead. Upon his death, Sartre was still supporting Wanda. He also supported Olga for years, until she met and married [[Jacques-Laurent Bost]], de Beauvoir's lover.\n\nIn the novel, set just before the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], de Beauvoir creates one character from the complex relationships of Olga and Wanda. The fictionalised versions of Beauvoir and Sartre have a ''[[ménage à trois]]'' with the young woman. The novel also delves into de Beauvoir and Sartre's complex relationship and how it was affected by the ''ménage à trois''.\n\nDe Beauvoir's metaphysical novel ''She Came to Stay'' was followed by many others, including ''[[The Blood of Others]]'', which explores the nature of individual responsibility, telling a love story between two young French students participating in the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] in World War II.<ref name=\"iep.utm.edu\">http://www.iep.utm.edu/beauvoir/ Simone de Beauvoir</ref>\n\n===Existentialist ethics===\nIn 1944 de Beauvoir wrote her first philosophical essay, ''Pyrrhus et Cinéas'', a discussion of an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay, ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]'', (1947); it is perhaps the most accessible entry into [[Existentialism|French existentialism]]. Its simplicity keeps it understandable. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, have found in major existentialist works such as ''Being and Nothingness''. In ''The Ethics of Ambiguity'', de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.<ref name=\"plato.stanford\" />\n\n===''Les Temps modernes''===\n{{main|Les Temps modernes}}\nAt the end of World War II, de Beauvoir and Sartre edited ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', a political journal which Sartre founded along with [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and others. De Beauvoir used ''Les Temps Modernes'' to promote her own work and explore her ideas on a small scale before fashioning essays and books. De Beauvoir remained an editor until her death.\n\n===Sexuality, existentialist feminism and ''The Second Sex''===\n''The Second Sex'', published in French, sets out a feminist [[existentialism]] which prescribes a moral revolution. As an existentialist, de Beauvoir believed that ''[[existence precedes essence]]''; hence one is not born a woman, but becomes one. Her analysis focuses on the [[Hegel]]ian concept of [[Other|the Other]]. It is the (social) construction of Woman as the quintessential Other that de Beauvoir identifies as fundamental to women's oppression. The capitalised 'O' in \"other\" indicates the wholly other. De Beauvoir asserted that women are as capable of choice as men, and thus can choose to elevate themselves, moving beyond the '[[immanence]]' to which they were previously resigned and reaching '[[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]', a position in which one takes responsibility for oneself and the world, where one chooses one's freedom.\n\nChapters of ''Le deuxième sexe'' (translated as ''The Second Sex'') were originally published in ''Les Temps modernes'',<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 82</ref> in June 1949. The second volume came a few months after the first in France.<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 89</ref> It was very quickly published in America as ''The Second Sex'', due to the quick translation by [[Howard Parshley]], as prompted by [[Blanche Knopf]], wife of publisher [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Because Parshley had only a basic familiarity with the French language, and a minimal understanding of philosophy (he was a professor of biology at [[Smith College]]), much of de Beauvoir's book was mistranslated or inappropriately cut, distorting her intended message.<ref name=\"Moi, Toril 2002\">Moi, Toril 'While We Wait: The English Translation of \"The Second Sex\" in Signs 27(4) (summer, 2002), pp., 1005–1035.</ref>  For years Knopf prevented the introduction of a more accurate retranslation of de Beauvoir's work, declining all proposals despite the efforts of existentialist scholars.<ref name=\"Moi, Toril 2002\"/> Only in 2009 was there a second translation, to mark the 60th anniversary of the original publication. Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevallier produced the first integral translation in 2010, reinstating a third of the original work.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/books/review-the-second-sex-by-simone-de-beauvoir/article1615327 ''Globe and Mail'' review]</ref>\n\nDe Beauvoir anticipated the sexually charged feminism of [[Erica Jong]] and [[Germaine Greer]].\n\nIn the chapter \"Woman: Myth and Reality\" of ''The Second Sex'', de Beauvoir argued that men had made women the \"Other\" in society by application of a false aura of \"mystery\" around them. She argued that men used this as an excuse not to understand women or their problems and not to help them, and that this stereotyping was always done in societies by the group higher in the hierarchy to the group lower in the hierarchy. She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it as an excuse to organize society into a [[patriarchy]].\n\nWomen who do not follow the domestic norm are looked down upon in society. Beauvoir is explaining that woman referred as “the other.” She states, “What is a woman?’ […] The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the notion of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: ‘I am a woman’; on this truth must be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man. […] It would be out of the question to reply: ‘And you think the contrary because you are a man,’ for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity.” (34-5) As for man there is no need to define what is to be a man, there is no reason because they identified themselves as the superior part. Man represents both “the positive and the neutral,” which doesn’t need to be explained or defined, and it is self-explanatory. “Thus humanity is male and man defines woman not in relation to herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being.” (35) Men are the default setting and women are considered a recessive gender. “He is the Subject, he is the Absolute—she is the Other.” (35) It is like an asymmetrical comparison, but masculine and feminine aren’t asymmetrical.\nDe Beauvoir defines women as the “Second sex” because women are defined in relation to men. Aristotle referred that women are “female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities.” De Beauvoir also points out that St. Thomas referred to the woman as the “imperfect man\", the \"incidental” being.<ref name=\"marxists.org\">[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/introduction.htm]</ref>\n\n“Are there woman, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: ‘Even in Russia women are still women’; and other erudite persons—sometimes the very same—say with a sigh, ‘Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.’” (34) De Beauvoir refers, to the “eternal feminine,” it can be what define some kind of spiritual being that connect all women to each other.<ref name=\"marxists.org\"/>\n\nDe Beauvoir argued that women have historically been considered deviant, abnormal. She said that even [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] considered men to be the ideal toward which women should aspire. De Beauvoir said that this attitude limited women's success by maintaining the perception that they were a deviation from the normal, and were always outsiders attempting to emulate \"normality\". She believed that for feminism to move forward, this assumption must be set aside.\n\nKey concepts of the 1970s feminist movement related directly to the ideas concerning gender as a [[social construct]] presented in de Beauvoir's ''The Second Sex\". ''Despite her contributions to the feminist movement, especially the French Women's Liberation Movement, and her beliefs in women's economic independence and equal education, de Beauvoir was initially reluctant to call herself a feminist.''<ref name=\"oxfordreference.com\"/> ''However, after observing the resurgence of the feminist movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, de Beauvoir stated she no longer believed a socialist revolution to be sufficient enough to bring about women's liberation. She publicly declared herself a feminist in 1972, in an interview with ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fallaize|first=Elizabeth|title=Simone de Beauvoir : a critical reader|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415147033|page=6|edition=Digital print }}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Mandarins'' ===\nPublished in 1954, ''The Mandarins'' is set just after the end of World War II and won her France's highest literary prize, the ''[[Prix Goncourt]]''. The book follows the personal lives of philosophers and friends among Sartre's and de Beauvoir's intimate circle, including her relationship with American writer [[Nelson Algren]], to whom the book was dedicated. Algren was outraged by the frank way de Beauvoir described their sexual experiences in both ''The Mandarins'' and her autobiographies.[[File:Algren house Miller.jpg|thumb|Dunes cottage where Algren and de Beauvoir summered in [[Miller Beach]], Indiana]] Algren vented his outrage when reviewing American translations of de Beauvoir's work. Much material bearing on this episode in de Beauvoir's life, including her love letters to Algren, entered the public domain only after her death.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Núñez-Beauvoir-Sartre-Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|left| [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], de Beauvoir, [[Sartre]] and [[Che Guevara]] in Cuba, 1960]]\nDe Beauvoir wrote popular travel diaries about time spent in the United States and China and published essays and fiction rigorously, especially throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She published several volumes of short stories, including ''The Woman Destroyed'', which, like some of her other later work, deals with aging.\n\n1980 saw the publication of ''[[When Things of the Spirit Come First]]'', a set of short stories centred around and based upon women important to her earlier years.<ref name=\"iep.utm.edu\"/> Though written long before the novel ''She Came to Stay'', de Beauvoir did not at the time consider the stories worth publishing, allowing some forty years to pass before doing so.\n\n[[Sartre]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]] had a longstanding feud, which led Merleau-Ponty to leave ''Les Temps Modernes''. De Beauvoir sided with Sartre and ceased to associate with Merleau-Ponty. In de Beauvoir's later years, she hosted the journal's editorial meetings in her flat and contributed more than Sartre, whom she often had to force to offer his opinions.\n\nDe Beauvoir also notably wrote a four-volume autobiography, consisting of: ''Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter''; ''The Prime of Life''; ''Force of Circumstance'' (sometimes published in two volumes in English translation: ''After the War'' and ''Hard Times''); and ''All Said and Done''.<ref name=\"iep.utm.edu\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s de Beauvoir became active in France's [[women's liberation movement]]. She wrote and signed the [[Manifesto of the 343]] in 1971, a manifesto that included a list of famous women who claimed to have had an abortion, then illegal in France. Some argue most of the women had not had abortions, including Beauvoir, but given the secrecy surrounding the issue, this cannot be known.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Signatories were diverse as [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Delphine Seyrig]] and de Beauvoir's sister Poupette. In 1974, abortion was legalised in France.\n\nHer 1970 long essay [[La Vieillesse]] (''The Coming of Age'') is a rare instance of an intellectual meditation on the decline and solitude all humans experience if they do not die before about the age of 60.\n\nIn an interview with [[Betty Friedan]], de Beauvoir said: \"No, we don’t believe that any woman should have this choice. No woman should be authorised to stay at home to bring up her children. Society should be totally different. Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one. It is a way of forcing women in a certain direction.\"<ref>“A Dialogue with Simone de Beauvoir,” in Betty Friedan, It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women’s Movement (New York: Random House, 1976), pp. 311–12\n</ref>\n\nIn about 1976 de Beauvoir and Sylvie Le Bon made a trip to New York City in the USA to visit [[Kate Millett]] on her farm.<ref>Appignanesi 2005, p. 160</ref>\n[[Image:Sartre+Beauvoir grave.JPG|right|thumb|De Beauvoir's and Sartre's grave at the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]]]\n\nIn 1981 she wrote ''La Cérémonie Des Adieux'' (''A Farewell to Sartre''), a painful account of Sartre's last years. In the opening of ''Adieux'', de Beauvoir notes that it is the only major published work of hers which Sartre did not read before its publication.\n\nShe contributed the piece \"Feminism - alive, well, and in constant danger\" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].<ref name=\"global\">{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter Sartre died in 1980, de Beauvoir published his letters to her with edits to spare the feelings of people in their circle who were still living. After de Beauvoir's death, Sartre's adopted daughter and literary heir Arlette Elkaïm would not let many of Sartre's letters be published in unedited form. Most of Sartre's letters available today have de Beauvoir's edits, which include a few omissions but mostly the use of pseudonyms.
