His grandfather Abu Al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was chief [[Qadi|judge]] of Córdoba under the [[Almoravid]]s. His father, Abu Al-Qasim Ahmad, held the same position until the Almoravids were replaced by the [[Almohad]]s in 1146.<ref name=\"Ahmad\" />\n\nIbn Rushd's education followed a traditional path, beginning with studies in [[Hadith]], [[linguistics]], [[jurisprudence]] and scholastic theology. Throughout his life he wrote extensively on [[Philosophy]] and [[Religion]], attributes of God, origin of the universe, [[Metaphysics]] and [[Psychology]]. It is generally believed that he was perhaps once tutored by [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace). His medical education was directed under [[Abu Jafar ibn Harun of Trujillo]] in [[Seville]].<ref name=\"Hiller\">H. Chad Hillier (2006).

It was Ibn Tufail who introduced him to the court and to [[Ibn Zuhr]] (\"Avenzoar\" to the West), the great [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|Muslim physician]], who became Ibn Rushd's teacher and friend. Ibn Rushd's aptitude for [[medicine]] was noted by his contemporaries and can be seen in his major enduring work ''Kitab al-Kulyat fi al-Tibb'' (Generalities), influenced by the ''Kitab al-Taisir fi al-Mudawat wa al-Tadbir'' (Particularities) of Ibn Zuhr.<ref name=\"dictionary\">Bynum, WF & Bynum, Helen (2006), ''Dictionary of Medical Biography'', Greenwood Press, ISBN 0-313-32877-3</ref> Ibn Rushd later reported how it was also Ibn Tufail that inspired him to write his famous [[commentaries on Aristotle]]:\n\n{{quote|Abu Bakr ibn Tufayl summoned me one day and told me that he had heard the [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] complaining about the disjointedness of [[Aristotle]]'s mode of expression — or that of the translators — and the resultant obscurity of his intentions. He said that if someone took on these books who could summarize them and clarify their aims after first thoroughly understanding them himself, people would have an easier time comprehending them. \"If you have the energy, \" Ibn Tufayl told me, \"you do it. I'm confident you can, because I know what a good mind and devoted character you have, and how dedicated you are to the art. You understand that only my great age, the cares of my office — and my commitment to another task that I think even more vital — keep me from doing it myself. \"|<ref>Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 314, [[Routledge]], ISBN 0-415-13159-6.</ref>}}\n\nIbn Rushd also studied the works and philosophy of Ibn Bajjah (\"Avempace\" to the West), another famous Islamic philosopher who greatly influenced his own Averroist thought.\n\nHowever, while the thought of his mentors Ibn Tufail and Ibn Bajjah were [[Mysticism|mystic]] to an extent, the thought of Ibn Rushd was purely [[Rationalism|rationalist]]. Together, the three men are considered the greatest Andalusian philosophers.<ref name=\"Ahmad\" /> Ibn Rushd devoted the next 30 years to his philosophical writings.\n\nIn 1160, Ibn Rushd was made ''Qadi'' (judge) of Seville and he served in many court appointments in Seville, Cordoba, and Morocco during his career. Sometime during the reign of [[Yaqub al-Mansur]], Averroes's political career was abruptly ended and he faced severe criticism from the [[Faqīh|Fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) of the time.<ref name=\"Mo3jib\">[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]], al-Mojib fi Talkhis Akhbar al-Maghrib [The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb], pp. 150–151 (1224), King Saud University</ref>\n\nA contemporary of Ibn Rushd, [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] writing in 1224, reported that there were secret and public reasons for his falling out of favor with Yaqub al-Mansour:<ref name=\"Mo3jib\" />\n{{quote\n| text=And in his days [Yaqub al-Mansur], Abu al-Walid Ibn Rushd faced his severe ordeal and there were two causes for this; one is known and the other is secret. The secret cause, which was the major reason, is that Abu al-Walid —may God have mercy on his soul— when summarizing, commenting and expending upon Aristotle's book \"[[History of Animals]]\" wrote: \"And I saw the [[Giraffe]] at the garden of the king of the Berbers\".<br />And that is the same way he would mention another king of some other people or land, as it is frequently done by writers, but he omitted that those working for the service of the king should glorify him and observe the usual protocol. This was why they held a grudge against him but initially, they did not show it and in reality, Abu al-Walid wrote that inadvertently...Then a number of his enemies in Cordoba, who were jealous of him and were competing with him both in knowledge and nobility, went to Yaqub al-Mansur with excerpts of Abu Walid's work on some old philosophers which were in his own handwriting. They took one phrase out of context that said: \"and it was shown that Venus is one of the Gods\" and presented it to the king who then summoned the chiefs and noblemen of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] and said to Abu al-Walid in front of them \"Is this your handwriting?\". Abu al-Walid then denied and the king said \"May God curse the one who wrote this\" and ordered that Abu al-Walid be exiled and all the philosophy books to be gathered and burned...And I saw, when I was in [[Fes]], these books being carried on horses in great quantities and burned<ref name=\"Mo3jib\" />\n| sign=[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]]\n| source=\"The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb\", (1224)}}\n\nIbn Rushd's strictly rationalist views collided with the more orthodox views of [[Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]], who therefore eventually banished Ibn Rushd in 1195 and ordered his writings burned, though he had previously appointed him as his personal physician. Ibn Rushd was not allowed to return to Marrakesh until 1197, shortly before his death in the year 1198 AD.

However, he warns against teaching philosophical methods to the general populace.\n\nOther works include ''Kitab al-Kashf an Manahij al-Adilla كتاب الكشف عن مناهج الادلة ''.\n\nIbn Rushd is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the Maliki school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid'' ( بداية المجتهد و نهاية المقتصد), a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework.\n\n[[Jacob Anatoli]] translated several of the works of Ibn Rushd from Arabic into Hebrew in the 13th century. Many of them were later translated from Hebrew into [[Latin]] by [[Jacob Mantino]] and [[Abraham de Balmes]]. Other works were translated directly from Arabic into Latin by [[Michael Scot]]. Many of his works in [[logic]] and metaphysics have been permanently lost, while others, including some of the longer Aristotelian commentaries, have only survived in Latin or Hebrew translation, not in the original Arabic.

Ibn Rushd's rebuttal was two-pronged: he contended both that al-Ghazali's arguments were mistaken and that, in any case, the system of Avicenna was a distortion of genuine Aristotelianism so that al-Ghazali was aiming at the wrong target{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}.\n\nWhereas al-Ghazali believed that phenomenon such as cotton burning when coming into contact with fire happened each and every time only because God willed it to happen -- \"all earthly occurrences depend on heavenly occurrences\"<ref name=incoherence>{{cite book|last1=IBN RUSHD|last2=VAN DEN BERGH (translator)|first2=SIMON|title=IBN RUSHD  AL-QURTUBI  AVERROES’  TAHAFUT AL-TAHAFUT  E-text Edition  (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)  VOLUME I|publisher=THE TRUSTEES OF THE “E.

Before 1150, only a few of Aristotle's works existed in translation in Latin Europe, although the tradition of great philosophers and poets of antiquity continued to be studied and copied in the Greek [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. It was to some degree through the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations of Ibn Rushd's work beginning in the thirteenth century, that the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the Latin West.\n\nIbn Rushd's work on Aristotle spans almost three decades, and he wrote commentaries on almost all of Aristotle's work except for Aristotle's ''Politics'', to which he did not have access. Hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on [[Jewish philosophy]]. [[Moses Maimonides]], [[Samuel ibn Tibbon|Samuel Ben Tibbon]], Juda Ben Solomon Choen, and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera|Shem Tob Ben Joseph Falaquera]] were Jewish philosophers influenced by Ibn Rushd.<ref>{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=132}}</ref> His ideas were assimilated by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others (especially in the [[University of Paris]]) within the [[Christian]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition which valued Aristotelian logic. Famous scholastics such as Aquinas did not refer to him by name, simply calling him \"The Commentator\" and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher.\"  Ibn Rushd had no discernible influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times.<ref>{{harvard citation|Leaman|2002|p=28}}</ref> His death coincides with a change in the culture of Al-Andalus.  In his work ''Fasl al-Maqāl'' (translated a. o.{{Clarify|date=November 2014}} as ''The Decisive Treatise''), he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the [[Qur'an]].\n\n==Jurisprudence and law==\nIbn Rushd is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the Maliki school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is \"Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid, \" a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework, which is rendered in English as ''The Distinguished Jurist's Primer''<ref>Nyazee, The Distinguished Jurist's Primer, 2 vols. (Reading: Garnet Publishing 1994 & 1996)</ref>—. He is also the author of \"al-Bayān wa'l-Taḥṣīl, wa'l-Sharḥ wa'l-Tawjīh wa'l-Ta`līl fi Masā'il al-Mustakhraja, \" a long and detailed commentary based on the \"Mustakhraja\" of Muḥammad al-`Utbī al-Qurtubī.\n\n==Legacy==\n* Reflecting the deference that some [[medieval]] [[Europe]]an scholars paid to him, Ibn Rushd is named by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' along with the thinkers and creative minds of ancient Greece and Rome whose spirits dwell in \"the place that favor owes to fame\" in [[Limbo]].\n* Ibn Rushd appears in a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], entitled \"[[Averroes's Search]]\", in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words ''[[tragedy]]'' and ''[[comedy]]''. He is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] alongside [[Maimonides]]. He appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of Cordoba in [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s poem \"In Cordoba\".\n* The claim that Ibn Rushd deserves equal respect with Maimonides got the fictional Balthazar Abrabanel banished from Amsterdam by the Amsterdam rabbinate in Eric Flint's novel ''1634''.\n* Ibn Rushd is also the title of a play called \"The Gladius and The Rose\", written by Tunisian writer [[Mohamed Ghozzi]], and which took first prize in the theater festival in Charjah in 1999.\n* In his [[Joseph Anton: A Memoir|memoir]], persecuted British Indian novelist [[Salman Rushdie]] recalls that his father adopted the family name \"Rushdie\" in honour of Averroes (Ibn Rushd). Ibn Rushd also appears as a character in Rushdie's novel, \"[[Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights]]\".\n* The [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] was named in his honor.<ref>Ana Ruiz, ''Vibrant Andalusia: The Spice of Life in Southern Spain'', p. 42.</ref>\n* Plant genus ''[[Averrhoa]]'' was named after him.\n* A [[lunar crater]], [[Ibn-Rushd (crater)|ibn Rushd]], was also named in his honor\n* The Muslim pop musician [[Kareem Salama]] composed and performed a song in 2007 titled \"Aristotle and Averroes\".\n* Ibn Rushd is the subject of the film [[Destiny (1997 film)|''Al Massir'' (''Destiny'')]] by [[Youssef Chahine]].\n* The [[Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought]], awarded since 1999, is named after him.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Arab scientists and scholars]]\n* [[List of Islamic studies scholars]]\n* [[Kalam cosmological argument]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Citation |last= Averroes |first= Translated by Ralph Lerner |title= Averroes On Plato's Republic |publisher= [[Cornell University Press]] |year= 2005 |month= |isbn= 0-8014-8975-X }}\n* {{Citation |last=Fakhry |first=Majid |title=Averroes (Ibn Rushd) His Life, Works and Influence |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |year=2001 |isbn=1-85168-269-4 }}\n* Campanini, Massimo.
