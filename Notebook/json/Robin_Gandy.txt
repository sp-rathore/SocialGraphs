During [[World War II]] he worked on radio intercept equipment at [[Hanslope Park]], where Alan Turing was working on a speech [[encipherment]] project, and he became one of Turing's lifelong friends and associates. In 1946, he completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, then began studying for a PhD under Turing's supervision. He completed his thesis, ''On axiomatic systems in mathematics and theories in Physics'', in 1952. He was a member of the [[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]].\n\nGandy held positions at the Universities of [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], and [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Manchester]]. Gandy was a visiting associate professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] from 1966 to 1967, and held a similar position at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1968. In 1969, he moved to [[Wolfson College, Oxford]], where he became [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Mathematical Logic. One of the residential buildings of the college is now named in his honour.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://secure.flickr.com/photos/stommy/2502650192/ | title=Robin Gandy Buildings, Wolfson | publisher=[[Flickr]] | accessdate=January 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe is best known for his work in [[recursion theory]]. His contributions include the [[Spector–Gandy theorem]], the [[Gandy Stage Comparison theorem]], and the [[Gandy Selection Theorem]]. He also made a significant contribution to the [[History of the Church–Turing thesis#Gandy 1980: .22machine computation.22 as discrete.2C deterministic and limited to .22local causation.22 by the speed of light|understanding of the Church—Turing thesis]], and his generalization of the [[Turing machine]] is called a Gandy machine.<ref>[http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/sieg/Church%20without%20dogma.pdf Wilfried Sieg, 2005, ''Church without dogma: axioms for computability,'' Carnegie Mellon University]</ref>\n\nGandy died in [[Oxford]], England.<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | authorlink= Andrew Hodges | last=Hodges | first=Andrew | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma | publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]] | year=1983 | isbn=0-671-49207-1}}\n* {{cite journal |date=March 1996 |title=Notices |journal=[[The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=121–125 |jstor=421052 |doi=10.1017/s1079898600007988}}\n* {{cite journal |date=September 1996 |title=In Memoriam: Robin Oliver Gandy, 1919–1995 |journal=The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=367–370 |author1=Moschovakis, Yannis  |author2=Yates, Mike  |lastauthoramp=yes |jstor=420996 |doi=10.1017/s1079898600007873}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/robin.html Robin Gandy — The Alan Turing Scrapbook], {{dead link|date=January 2015}} [http://www.archive.today/FKKX{{dead link <!-- consider change the domain --> |date=February 2016}} archived] at Archive.Today\n* [http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=36415 Robin Gandy — The Mathematics Genealogy Project]\n* {{AcademicSearch|1742695}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gandy, Robin}}\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:1995 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Oxfordshire]]\n[[Category:Alumni of King's College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:English logicians]]\n[[Category:Mathematical logicians]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Leicester]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Leeds]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Manchester]]\n[[Category:Stanford University Department of Mathematics faculty]]\n[[Category:University of California, Los Angeles faculty]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Wolfson College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:English philosophers]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Robin Gandy"}}}}
