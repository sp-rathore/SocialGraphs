Winstanley was one of the founders of the English group known as the True Levellers or [[Diggers]] for their beliefs, and for their actions. The group occupied public lands that had been privatised by [[enclosures]] and dug them over, pulling down hedges and filling in ditches, to plant crops. True Levellers was the name they used to describe themselves, whereas the term Diggers was coined by contemporaries.\n\n==Brief biography==\nGerrard Winstanley was born on 19 October 1609 and was baptised in the [[Wigan|parish of Wigan]], then part of the [[West Derby (hundred)|West Derby hundred]] of [[Lancashire]]. He was the son of an Edward Winstanley, [[mercer (occupation)|mercer]]. His mother's identity remains unknown and he could have been born anywhere in the parish of Wigan.<ref>Bradstock, Andrew (2000) ''Winstanley and the Diggers 1649–1999'' Frank Cass, London p.&nbsp;20</ref> The parish of Wigan contained the townships of [[Abram, Greater Manchester|Abram]], [[Aspull, Greater Manchester|Aspull]], [[Billinge and Winstanley Urban District|Billinge-and-Winstanley]], Dalton, [[Haigh, Greater Manchester|Haigh]], [[Hindley, Greater Manchester|Hindley]], [[Ince-in-Makerfield]], [[Orrell, Greater Manchester|Orrell]], [[Pemberton, Greater Manchester|Pemberton]], and [[Upholland]], as well as [[Wigan]] itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LAN/Wigan|title=Wigan|website=GENUKI: UK & Ireland Genealogy|access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe moved in 1630 to London, where he became an apprentice and ultimately, in 1638, a freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Tailors' Company]] or [[guild]]. He married Susan King, the daughter of London surgeon William King, in 1639. The [[English Civil War]], however, disrupted his business, and in 1643 he was made bankrupt. His father-in-law helped Winstanley move to [[Cobham, Surrey]], where he initially worked as a cowherd.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Alsop|first=J. D.|year=1989|title=Ethics in the Marketplace: Gerrard Winstanley's London Bankruptcy, 1643|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=28|issue=2|pages=97–119|jstor=175591}}</ref>\n\n===English Civil Wars===\nThere were many factions at work during the period of the three related English civil wars. They included the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] who supported [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]; the [[Parliamentary]] forces led by Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] who would later emerge under the name of the [[New Model Army]]; the [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who believed in the establishment of a heavenly [[theocracy]] on earth to be led by a returning Jesus as king of kings and lord of lords; the Agitators for political egalitarian reform of government, who were branded \"[[Levellers]]\" by their foes and who were led by [[John Lilburne]]; and the True Levellers, who were branded \"Diggers\" because of their actions. The latter were led by Gerrard Winstanley. Whereas Lilburne sought to level the laws and maintain the right to the ownership of real property, Winstanley sought to level the ownership of real property itself, which is why Winstanley's followers called themselves \"True Levellers\".\n\n===The New Law of Righteousness===\nGerrard Winstanley published a [[pamphlet]] called ''The New Law of Righteousness''. The basis of this work came from the [[Book of Acts]], chapter two, verses 44 and 45: \"All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need.\"  Winstanley argued that \"in the beginning of time God made the earth. Not one word was spoken at the beginning that one branch of mankind should rule over another, but selfish imaginations did set up one man to teach and rule over another.\"\n\nWinstanley took as his basic texts the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[sacred history]], with its affirmation that all men were descended from a common stock, and with its scepticism about the rulership of kings, voiced in the [[Books of Samuel]]; and the [[New Testament]]'s affirmations that God was no respecter of persons, that there were no masters or slaves under the [[New Covenant]]. From these and similar texts, he interpreted Christian teaching as calling for the abolition of property [in land] and aristocracy.\n\nWinstanley wrote: \"Seeing the common people of England by joynt consent of person and purse have caste out Charles our Norman oppressour, wee have by this victory recovered ourselves from under his [[Norman Yoke|Norman yoake]].\"\n\nHis theme was rooted in ancient English radical thought. It went back at least to the days of the [[Peasants' Revolt]] (1381) led by [[Wat Tyler]], because that is when a verse of the [[Lollard]] priest [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] was circulated:\n:When [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] delved and Eve span,\n:Who was then the gentleman?\n\n===The Diggers===\nIn 1649, Winstanley and his followers took over vacant or common lands in [[Surrey]], Buckinghamshire, [[Kent]], and [[Northamptonshire]] and began cultivating the land and distributing the crops without charge to their followers. Local landowners took fright from the Diggers' activities and in 1650 sent hired armed men to beat the Diggers and destroy their colony. Winstanley protested to the government, but to no avail, and the colony was abandoned.\n\nAfter the failure of the Digger experiment in Surrey in 1650 Winstanley temporarily fled to [[Pirton, Hertfordshire]], where he took up employment as an estate steward for the mystic aristocrat [[Lady Eleanor Davies]]. This employment lasted less than a year after Davies accused Winstanley of mismanaging her property and Winstanley returned to Cobham.\n\nWinstanley continued to advocate the redistribution of land. In 1652 he published another [[pamphlet]] called ''[[The Law of Freedom in a Platform]]'', in which he argued that the Christian basis for society is where property and wages are abolished. In keeping with Winstanley's adherence to biblical models, the tract envisages a communistic society structured on patriarchal lines.\n\n===Quaker===\nBy 1654 Winstanley was possibly assisting [[Edward Burrough]], an early leader of the Quakers, later called the [[Society of Friends]].<ref>See Friends House Library, London, William Caton MS 3 p. 147.</ref> It is apparent that Winstanley remained a Quaker for the rest of his life as his death was noted in Quaker records.<ref>{{cite journal|first=R. T.|last=Vann|title=From Radicalism to Quakerism: Gerrard Winstanley and Friends|journal=Journal of the Friends Historical Society|volume=XLIX|year=1959|pages=41–46}}</ref> However, his Quakerism may not have been very strong as he was involved in the government of his local parish church from 1659 onwards&nbsp;– though it should be noted that it is not unknown for committed Quakers to retain strong ties to other religious traditions, even including priesthood. He may have been buried in a Quaker cemetery.\n\nWinstanley believed in [[Christian Universalism]], the doctrine that everyone, however sinful, will [[universal reconciliation|eventually be reconciled]] to God; he wrote that \"in the end every man shall be saved, though some at the last hour.\"  His book ''The Mysterie of God'' is apparently the first theological work in the English language to state this universalism.<ref>{{cite web |last=Boulton |first=David |title=Militant Seedbeds of Early Quakerism: Winstanley and Friends |date=March 2005|url=http://www.universalistfriends.org/boulton.html |website=Quaker Universalist Voice|accessdate=25 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nIn 1657 Winstanley and his wife Susan received a gift of property in Ham Manor, near Cobham from his father-in-law William King. This marked Winstanley's renovation in social status in his local community and he became [[waywarden]] of the parish of Cobham in 1659, overseer for the poor in 1660 and [[churchwarden]] in 1667–68. He was elected Chief Constable of Elmbridge in October 1671. Although these offices conflicted with Winstanley's apparent Quakerism, the Quakers had not yet become the quietist religion of later centuries.\n\nWhen Susan died about 1664 Winstanley was paid £50 for the land in Cobham by King. Winstanley returned to London trade, whilst retaining his connections in Surrey. In about 1665 he married his second wife Elizabeth Stanley and re-entered commerce as a corn chandler. Winstanley died in 1676, aged 66, vexed by legal disputes concerning a small legacy owed to him in a will.<ref>See {{cite journal|first=James|last=Alsop|title=Gerrard Winstanley's Later Life|journal=Past & Present|issue=82|year=1979|pages=73–81|jstor=650593|postscript=none}} and {{cite journal|first=J.

Like the original colony, this settlement was quickly disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tlio.org.uk/campaigns/diggers/d350pr.html |deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328075506/http://www.tlio.org.uk/campaigns/diggers/d350pr.html|archive-date=28 March 2014|title=In 1649 to St Georges Hill |publisher=\nThe Land Is Ours|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\nSince 2011 a Wigan Diggers Festival has been held annually in Winstanley's birth town of Wigan in Greater Manchester attracting support across the North of England.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hyland |first=Bernadette |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/31/unite-labour |title=Wigan stakes its claim to be the home of Socialism |work=The Guardian |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Collected works===\n''The Complete Works of Gerrard Winstanley'', edited jointly by Thomas N. Corns, Ann Hughes and David Loewenstein, were published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in December 2009 at £229 (ISBN 978-0-19-957606-7).\n\nA shorter and less comprehensive volume containing all the major works, ''Gerrard Winstanley: A Common Treasury'' edited by Andrew Hopton, was published in 1989 by Aporia (ISBN 978-0-948518-45-4) and reprinted several times since, most recently in 2011 (paperback) by [[Verso Books]] (UK) with an introduction by [[Tony Benn]] (ISBN 978-1-84467-595-1).\n\n===Related works===\n1975 saw the release of [[Kevin Brownlow]] and [[Andrew Mollo]]'s film ''[[Winstanley (film)|Winstanley]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073911/|title=Winstanley (1975)|website=IMDB}}</ref> As with the duo's previous film, ''[[It Happened Here]]'', it had taken several years to produce with a very low budget.

And therefore, though you did not kill or thieve, yet you hold that cursed thing in your hand by the power of the sword; and so you justify the wicked deeds of your fathers, and that sin of your fathers shall be visited upon the head of you and your children to the third and fourth generation, and longer too, till your bloody and thieving power be rooted out of the land.\"\n\nFrom ''A Watch-word to the City of London, and Arm'':\n*\"Alas! you poor blind earth-moles, you strive to take away my livelihood and the liberty of this poor weak frame my body of flesh, which is my house I dwell in for a time; but I strive to cast down your kingdom of darkness, and to open hell gates, and to break the devil's bonds asunder wherewith you are tied, and that you my enemies may live in peace; and that is all the harm I would have you to have.\"\n\nFrom ''A New-year's Gift for the Parliament and Army'':\n*\"The life of this dark kingly power, which you have made an act of Parliament and oath to cast out, if you search it to the bottom, you shall see it lies within the iron chest of cursed covetousness, who gives the earth to some part of mankind and denies it to another part of mankind: and that part that hath the earth, hath no right from the law of creation to take it to himself and shut out others; but he took it away violently by theft and murder in conquest.\"\n\nFrom ''The Law of Freedom in a Platform'':\n*\"if they prove desperate, wanton or idle, and will not quietly submit to the law, the task-master is to feed them with short diet, and to whip them, for a rod is prepared for the fool's back, till such time as their proud hearts do bend to the law&nbsp;... If any have so highly broke the laws as they come within the compass of whipping, imprisoning and death, the executioner shall cut off the head, hang or shoot to death, or whip the offender according to the sentence of law. Thus you may see what the work of every officer in a town or city is.\"\n\nThe song, \"The World Turned Upside Down,\" by English folksinger [[Leon Rosselson]], weaves many of Winstanley's own words into the lyrics.\n\nAn older song, the \"[[Diggers' Song]]\", said to be written by Gerrard Winstanley was recorded by the English group [[Chumbawamba]] on their \"English Rebel Songs 1381–1914\" in 1988. As the lyrics are Winstanley's, they paint a better picture of the time period in song.\n\n== Winstanley and European peasant Protestant Reformation revolts ==\nFor [[libertarian socialist]] scholar [[Murray Bookchin]] there is a coincidence of political projects between German Protestant revolutionary [[Thomas Müntzer]] and Winstanley.  For Bookchin \"In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was Thomas Müntzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the [[Diggers|Digger movement]]. The concepts held by Müntzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Müntzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England.\"<ref>[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Lewis_Herber__Murray_Bookchin___Ecology_and_Revolutionary_Thought.html Lewis Herber.
