His philosophy emphasized self-restraint, self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. During the [[Warring States period]], Mohism was actively developed and practiced in many states but fell out of favour when the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] [[Qin dynasty]] came to power.  During that period, many Mohist classics are by many believed to have been ruined when the emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] supposedly carried out the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. The importance of Mohism further declined when Confucianism became the dominant school of thought during the [[Han Dynasty]], until mostly disappearing by the middle of the [[Western Han dynasty]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Fraser | first = Chris | title = Mohism | encyclopedia = \"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" | year = 2002 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2002/entries/mohism/ }}</ref>\n\nMozi is known by children throughout [[Chinese culture]] by way of the [[Thousand Character Classic]], which records that he was saddened when he saw dyeing of pure white silk, which embodied his conception of austerity (simplicity, chastity). For the modern juvenile audience of Chinese speakers, the image of his school and its founder were popularized by the animated TV series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.\n\n==Name==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nThere has been considerable debate about the actual name of Mozi. Three concepts of its origin exist as of today.\n\n# Traditionally, Mozi was said to have inherited the surname \"Mo\" from his supposed ancestor, the Lord of Guzhu ({{zh|c={{linktext|孤|竹|君}}|p=Gūzhú Jūn}}), himself descended from [[Shennong]], the legendary emperor. The descendants of the Lord of Guzhu had the clan name \"Motai\" ({{zh|c={{linktext|墨|胎}}|p=Mòtāi}}), which later was shortened to \"Mo\". However, modern scholarship suggests that \"Mo\" was not, in fact, the clan name of Mozi, as this clan name/family name is not encountered during the [[Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States]] periods.\n# As \"Mo\" came to be the name of the [[Mohist]] school itself, it might have derived from the name of a criminal punishment (tattooing of the forehead of criminals; \"''mo''\" literally means \"ink\"), usually inflicted on slaves. It signals the Mohists' identification with the lowest of common people. The actual ancestral name and clan name of Mozi is not known. It may be that, because he was likely born into the lower classes, he did not have an ancestral or clan name. During Chinese antiquity, the vast majority of the Chinese people who were not related to aristocratic families did not possess ancestral and clan names.\n# A plausible source of Mozi's name may have been the philosopher's skin complexion itself, which is referred to as \"dark\" (lit. \"black\") in the text. \"Mozi was going north to Qi and met a fortune teller on the way. The fortune teller told him: \"God kills the black dragon in the north today. Now, your complexion is dark. You must not go north.\"<ref>[http://ctext.org/mozi/esteem-for-righteousness#n3859 Mozi: Esteem for Righteousness]</ref>\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Chinese plain 5c. BC-en.svg|alt=|thumb|Mozi was born in Lu (seen toward the north, with a small coastline along the Yellow Sea) and spent some time as a government minister in Song (a landlocked state to the south of Lu)]]\nMost historians believe that Mozi was a member of the lower artisan class who managed to climb his way to an official post. It is known, however, that his parents were not affectionate towards him and showed him very little love. Mozi was a native of the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]] (today's Tengzhou, Shandong Province), although for a time he served as a minister in the [[Song (state)|State of Song]].<ref>{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1956}} 165.</ref> Like Confucius, Mozi was known to have maintained a school for those who desired to become officials serving in the different ruling courts of the Warring States.<ref>{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1956}} 165–184.</ref>\n\nMozi was a carpenter and was extremely skilled in creating devices, designing everything from mechanical birds to wheeled, mobile \"cloud ladders\" used to besiege city walls (see [[Lu Ban]]). Though he did not hold a high official position, Mozi was sought out by various rulers as an expert on [[fortification]]. He was schooled in Confucianism in his early years, but he viewed Confucianism as being too fatalistic and emphasizing too much on elaborate celebrations and funerals which he felt were detrimental to the livelihood and productivity of common people. He managed to attract a large following during his lifetime which rivaled that of Confucius. His followers—mostly technicians and craftspeople—were organized in a disciplined order that studied both Mozi's philosophical and technical writings.\n\nAccording to some accounts of the popular understanding of Mozi at the time, he had been hailed by many as the greatest hero to come from [[Henan]]. His passion was said to be for the good of the people, without concern for personal gain or even his own life or death. His tireless contribution to society was praised by many, including Confucius' disciple [[Mencius]]. Mencius wrote in Jinxin ({{zh|c={{linktext|孟|子|盡|心}}|p=Mengzi Jinxin}}) that Mozi believed in love for all mankind. As long as something benefits mankind, Mozi will pursue it even if it means hurting his head or his feet. Zhang Tai Yan said that in terms of moral virtue, even Confucius and Laozi cannot compare to Mozi.\n\nMozi travelled from one crisis zone to another throughout the ravaged landscape of the Warring States, trying to dissuade rulers from their plans of conquest. According to the chapter \"Gongshu\" in ''Mozi'', he once walked for ten days to the state of Chu in order to forestall an attack on the state of Song. At the Chu court, Mozi engaged in nine simulated war games with [[Lu Ban|Gongshu Ban]], the chief military strategist of Chu, and overturned each one of his stratagems. When Gongshu Ban threatened him with death, Mozi informed the king that his disciples had already trained the soldiers of Song in his fortification methods, so it would be useless to kill him. The Chu king was forced to call off the war. On the way back, however, the soldiers of Song, not recognizing him, would not allow Mozi to enter their city, and he had to spend a night freezing in the rain. After this episode, he also stopped the state of Qi from attacking the state of Lu. He taught that defense of a city does not depend only on fortification, weaponry and food supply; it is also important to keep talented people close by and to put trust in them.\n\nThough Mozi's school of thought faded into obscurity after the Warring States period, he was studied again two millennia after his death. As almost nobody had copied the texts during the last two thousand years, there was much difficulty in deciphering them. As a result, Mohism became the most difficult philosophy within the Hundred Schools of Thoughts to study. Both the [[Republic of China|Republican]] revolutionaries of 1911 and the [[Chinese Communism|Communists]] saw in him a surprisingly modern thinker who was stifled early in Chinese history.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{seealso|Mozi (book)}}\n[[File:Chongwu city wall.JPG|alt=|thumb|Between Mozi's background as an engineer and his pacifist leanings, the Mohists became experts at building fortifications and [[siege]]s]]\nMozi's moral teachings emphasized self-reflection and authenticity rather than obedience to ritual. He observed that we often learn about the world through adversity (\"Embracing Scholars\" in ''Mozi''). By reflecting on one's own successes and failures, one attains true self-knowledge rather than mere conformity to ritual (\"Refining Self\" in ''Mozi''). Mozi exhorted people to lead a life of asceticism and self-restraint, renouncing both material and spiritual extravagance.\n\nLike Confucius, Mozi idealized the [[Xia Dynasty]] and the ancients of [[Chinese mythology]], but he criticized the Confucian belief that modern life should be patterned on the ways of the ancients. After all, he pointed out, what we think of as \"ancient\" was actually innovative in its time, and thus should not be used to hinder present-day innovation (\"Against Confucianism, Part 3\" in the ''Mozi''). Though Mozi did not believe that history necessarily progresses, as did [[Han Fei Zi]], he shared the latter's critique of [[destiny|fate]] ({{linktext|命}}, ''mìng''). Mozi believed that people were capable of changing their circumstances and directing their own lives. They could do this by applying their senses to observing the world, judging objects and events by their causes, their functions, and their historical bases. (\"Against Fate, Part 3\") This was the \"three-prong method\" Mozi recommended for testing the truth or falsehood of statements. His students later expanded on this to form the [[Logicians|School of Names]].\n\nMozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and [[Chinese clan|clan]] structures with the concept of \"impartial caring\" or \"universal love\" ({{linktext|兼|愛}}, ''jiān ài''). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who had argued that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, in contrast, argued that people in principle should care for all people equally, a notion that philosophers in other schools found absurd, as they interpreted this notion as implying no special amount of care or duty towards one's parents and family.\n\nOverlooked by those critics, however, is a passage in the chapter on \"Self-Cultivation\" which states, \"When people near-by are not befriended, there is no use endeavoring to attract those at a distance.\" This point is also precisely articulated by a Mohist in a debate with Mencius (in the Mencius), where the Mohist argues in relation to carrying out universal love, that \"We begin with what is near.\" Also, in the first chapter of the writings of Mozi on universal love, Mozi argues that the best way of being filial to one’s parents is to be filial to the parents of others. The foundational principle is that benevolence, as well as malevolence, is requited, and that one will be treated by others as one treats others. Mozi quotes a popular passage from the ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Odes]]'' to bring home this point: \"When one throws to me a peach, I return to him a plum.\" One’s parents will be treated by others as one treats the parents of others. In pursuing this line of argument, Mozi was directly appealing to the idea of [[enlightened self-interest]] in social relations. Also of note is the fact that Mozi differentiated between \"intention\" and \"actuality\", thereby placing a central importance on the will to love, even though in practice it may very well be impossible to bring benefit to everyone.\n\nIn addition, Mozi argued that benevolence comes to human beings \"as naturally as fire turns upward or water turns downward\", provided that persons in positions of authority illustrate benevolence in their own lives. In differentiating between the ideas of \"universal\" (''jian'') and \"differential\" (''bie''), Mozi said that \"universal\" comes from righteousness while \"differential\" entails human effort. Furthermore, Mozi’s basic argument concerning universal love asserts that universal love is supremely practical, and this argument was directed against those who objected that such love could not be put into practice.<!--what does this sentence mean?-->\n\nMozi also held a belief in the power of ghosts and spirits, although he is often thought to have only worshipped them pragmatically. In fact, in his discussion on ghosts and spirits, he remarks that even if they did not exist, communal gatherings for the sake of making sacrificial offering would play a role in strengthening social bonds. Furthermore, for Mozi the will of [[Tian|Heaven]] ({{linktext|天}}, [[Tian|tiān]]) was that people should love one another, and that mutual love by all would bring benefit to all. Therefore, it was in everyone's interest that they love others \"as they love themselves.\" Heaven should be respected because failing to do so would subject one to punishment. For Mozi, Heaven was not the \"amoral\", mystical nature of the [[Taoists]]. Rather, it was a benevolent, moral force that rewarded good and punished evil. Similar in some ways to the [[Abrahamic religions]], Mozi believed that all living things live in a realm ruled by Heaven, and Heaven has a will which is independent from and higher than the will of man. Thus he writes that \"Universal love is the Way of Heaven,\" since \"Heaven nourishes and sustains all life without regard to status.\" (\"Laws and Customs\" in ''Mozi'') Mozi's ideal of government, which advocated a meritocracy based on talent rather than background, also followed his idea of Heaven.\n\n===Ethics===\n{{main|Mohist consequentialism}}\n{{quote|What is the purpose of houses?

The \"material wealth\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|basic needs]] like shelter and clothing, and the \"order\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability.<ref name=\"Norden\"/> [[Stanford University|Stanford]] [[sinologist]] [[David S. Nivison|David Shepherd Nivison]], in the ''[[The Cambridge History of Ancient China]]'', writes that the moral goods of Mohism \"are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth ... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically\".<ref name=\"Cambridge\"/> In contrast to [[Jeremy Bentham]], Mozi did not believe that individual happiness was important; the consequences of the [[State (polity)|state]] outweigh the consequences of individual actions.<ref name=\"Cambridge\"/><!--\"consequences for the state\"?-->\n\nMozi tended to evaluate actions based on whether they provide benefit to the people, which he measured in terms of an enlarged population (states were sparsely populated in his day), a prosperous economy, and social order. Like other consequentialist theories, Mozi thought that actions should be measured by the way they contribute to the \"greatest societal good for what we have agreed to in a social contract\". With this criterion Mozi denounced things as diverse as offensive warfare, expensive funerals, and even music and dance, which he saw as serving no useful purpose. Mozi did not object to music in principle—\"It's not that I don't like the sound of the drum\" (\"Against Music\")—but only because of the heavy tax burden such activities placed on commoners and also due to the fact that officials tended to indulge in them at the expense of their duties.<!--sounds like he's only talking about public official music-->\n\n==Works and influence==\n{{main|Mozi (book)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Mozi.jpg|alt=A page covered in Chinese writing|thumb|A page from the ''Mozi'']]\n''\"Mozi\"'' is also the name of the philosophical text compiled by Mohists from Mozi's thought. This text originally consisted of 71 chapters. During the Han dynasty Confucianism dominated China. As Mohism is against Confucianism, the text ''\"Mozi\"'' was neglected. During the Song dynasty, only 61 chapters were left. Today, we have only 53 chapters through which we attempt to understand this school of thought, as compiled by [[Sun Yirang]]. Because Mohism disappeared as a living tradition from China, its texts were not well maintained, and many chapters are missing or in a corrupted state. For example, of the three chapters \"Against Confucianism\", only one remains.\n\nThe collection of texts from \"Mozi\" is a rich source of insight into early Chinese dynastic history and culture. Much of Mozi's arguments are supported by the historical claims of even earlier records. His conversations with other renowned philosophers of that era are also recorded. From them, we can distinguish [[Mohism]] from other schools of thought more clearly.\n\nMohism was suppressed under the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and died out completely under the [[Han Dynasty|Han]], which made Confucianism the official doctrine. However, many of its ideas were dissolved into the mainstream of Chinese thought, since both Confucians such as [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] and Taoists such as [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] expressed sympathy with Mozi's concerns. The influence of Mozi is still visible in many Han works written hundreds of years later. In modern times, Mohism was given a fresh analysis. [[Sun Yat-Sen]] used \"universal love\" as one of the foundations for his idea of Chinese democracy. More recently, Chinese scholars under Communism have tried to rehabilitate Mozi as a \"philosopher of the people\", highlighting his rational-empirical approach to the world as well as his \"proletarian\" background.\n\nSome views claim that Mozi's philosophy was at once more advanced and less so than that of Confucius. His concept of \"universal love\" embraced a broader idea of human community than that of the Confucians, but he was less tolerant than Confucius in his condemnation of all that is not directly \"useful,\" neglecting the humanizing functions of art and music. Zhuangzi, who criticized both the Confucians and the Mohists, had this in mind in his parables on the \"usefulness of the useless\". Of course, this insistence on usefulness comes from a time when war and famine were widespread and could well have made all the royal pageantry look frivolous.\n\nHowever, others would say the above view is not entirely accurate, and that in fact \"universal love\" (博愛), as well as \"the world as a commonwealth shared by all\" (天下為公) advocated by Sun Yat-Sen are Confucian ideas.<ref>[[Han Yu]]: \"Universal love\" (博愛, Boai) means [[Ren (Confucianism)|Ren]] (Humanity) (韓愈: 博愛之謂仁).</ref> \"Universal love\" (博愛, Boai) in Confucianism is a little different from Mozi's \"universal love\" (兼愛, Jian'ai): in Confucianism it tends to emphasize it as naturally befitting human relations, while in Mozi's ideas it tends to be community oriented and non-differentiated according to individual. Some modern-day supporters for Mozi (as well as Communism) make the claim that Mohism and modern Communism share a lot in terms of ideals for community life.  Others would claim that Mohism shares more with the central ideas of [[Christianity]], especially in terms of the idea of \"universal love\" (in Greek, \"[[agape]]\"), the \"[[Golden Rule]]\", and the relation of humanity to the supernatural realm.\n\n== Mohism and science ==\nAccording to [[Joseph Needham]], ''Mozi'' (collected writings of those in the tradition of Mozi, some of which might have been by Mozi himself) contains the following sentence: 'The cessation of motion is due to the opposing force... If there is no opposing force... the motion will never stop. This is as true as that an ox is not a horse.' which, he claims, is a precursor to Newton's first law of motion. ''Mozi'' also contains speculations in optics and mechanics that are similarly strikingly original, although their ideas were not taken up by later Chinese philosophers. The Mohist tradition is also highly unusual in Chinese thought in that it devoted time to developing principles of logic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Mozu#Mohism_and_Science|title=Mozu|work=[[New World Encyclopedia]]|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Logic|Philosophy|Religion}}\n* ''[[A Battle of Wits (2006 film)|A Battle of Wits]]''&nbsp;– a historical film based around Mohism\n* [[History of geometry]]\n* [[List of people on stamps of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Fa (concept)|Fa]], an influential concept elaborated by Mozi\n* [[Quantum Experiments at Space Scale]], a joint Austrian-Chinese satellite launched in 2016, alternatively named \"Mozi\" or \"Micius\" because of his writings on optics.\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n* Fraser, Chris.
