The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\n\nJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]] (through both his parents), uniquely positioning him to eventually accede to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother Mary was compelled to [[Abdication|abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583.

James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: \"My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&nbsp;...

As a result, the 16th century became known as ''linn nan creach'', the time of raids.{{sfn|Hunter|2000|pp=143, 166}} Furthermore, the effects of the Reformation were slow to affect the ''[[Gàidhealtachd]]'', driving a religious wedge between this area and centres of political control in the [[Central Belt]].{{sfn|Hunter|2000|p=174}} \n\nIn 1540, [[James V of Scotland|James V]] had toured the Hebrides, forcing the [[Scottish clan|clan]] [[Scottish clan chief|chiefs]] to accompany him.

Henry Howard, son of poet [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], had been a diligent correspondent with James in advance of the succession (James referred to him as \"long approved and trusted Howard\"). His connection with James may have owed something to the attempt by his brother [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk]], to free and marry Mary, Queen of Scots, leading to his execution in 1572. ({{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=156}}; {{harvnb|Guy|2004|pp=461–468}}). For details on the Howards, see ''The Trials of Frances Howard'' by David Lindley. Henry Howard is a traditionally reviled figure (Willson [1956] called him \"A man of dark counsels and creeping schemes, learned but bombastic, and a most fulsome flatterer\" {{harv|Willson|1963|p=156}}) whose reputation was upgraded by Linda Levy Peck's 1982 biography ''Northampton'' {{harv|Croft|2003|p=6}}.}} \n\nIn the early years of James's reign, the day-to-day running of the government was tightly managed by the shrewd Robert Cecil, later [[Earl of Salisbury]], ably assisted by the experienced [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton]], whom James made Baron Ellesmere and [[Lord Chancellor]], and by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]], soon [[Earl of Dorset]], who continued as [[Lord Treasurer]].{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}} As a consequence, James was free to concentrate on bigger issues, such as a scheme for a closer union between England and Scotland and matters of foreign policy, as well as to enjoy his leisure pursuits, particularly hunting.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=51}}\n\nJames was ambitious to build on the [[personal union]] [[Union of the Crowns|of the Crowns of Scotland and England]] to establish a single country under one monarch, one parliament, and one law, a plan which met opposition in both realms.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=52–54}} \"Hath He not made us all in one island,\" James told the English parliament, \"compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?\" In April 1604, however, the Commons refused his request to be titled \"King of Great Britain\" on legal grounds.{{efn|English and Scot, James insisted, should \"join and coalesce together in a sincere and perfect union, as two twins bred in one belly, to love one another as no more two but one estate\".{{harv|Willson|1963|p=250}}.}} In October 1604, he assumed the title \"King of Great Britain\" by proclamation rather than statute, though Sir [[Francis Bacon]] told him that he could not use the style in \"any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance\".{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=249–252}}\n\nJames achieved more success in foreign policy. Never having been at war with Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long [[Anglo–Spanish War (1585)|Anglo–Spanish War]] to an end, and [[Treaty of London (1604)|a peace treaty]] was signed between the two countries in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now [[Earl of Northampton]], which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=52–53}} Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=118}}\n\n===Gunpowder Plot===\n{{Main|Gunpowder Plot}}\n\nA dissident Catholic, [[Guy Fawkes]], was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings on the night of 4–5 November 1605, the eve of the [[State Opening of Parliament|state opening]] of the second session of James's first English Parliament. He was guarding a pile of wood not far from 36 barrels of gunpowder with which Fawkes intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, \"not only&nbsp;... of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general\".{{sfn|Stewart|2003|p=219}} The sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, aroused a mood of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons.

Instead, it was the previous session of [[1604 in England|1604]] that shaped the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=63}} On 7 July 1604, James had angrily [[Parliamentary session|prorogued]] Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies. \"I will not thank where I feel no thanks due\", he had remarked in his closing speech. \"...&nbsp;I am not of such a stock as to praise fools&nbsp;...

In February 1610, Salisbury proposed a scheme, known as the [[Great Contract]], whereby Parliament, in return for ten royal concessions, would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king's debts plus an annual grant of £200,000.{{sfn|Croft|2003|pp=75–81}} The ensuing prickly negotiations became so protracted that James eventually lost patience and dismissed Parliament on 31 December 1610. \"Your greatest error\", he told Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall\".<ref>{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=80}}; {{harvnb|Lockyer|1998|p=167}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=267}}.</ref> The same pattern was repeated with the so-called \"[[Addled Parliament]]\" of 1614, which James dissolved after a mere nine weeks when the Commons hesitated to grant him the money he required.<ref>{{harvnb|Croft|2003|p=93}}; {{harvnb|Willson|1963|p=348}}.</ref> James then ruled without parliament until 1621, employing officials such as the merchant [[Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex|Lionel Cranfield]], who were astute at raising and saving money for the crown, and sold baronetcies and other dignities, many created for the purpose, as an alternative source of income.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=409}}\n\n===Spanish Match===\n{{Main|Spanish Match}}\nAnother potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between [[Charles I of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Maria Anna of Spain|Infanta Maria Anna of Spain]].{{sfn|Willson|1963|pp=348, 357}} The policy of the [[Spanish Match]], as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war.{{sfn|Schama|2001|p=59}} Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.<ref>[[John Phillipps Kenyon|Kenyon, J.

Overbury knew too much of Carr's dealings with Frances and he opposed the match with a fervour that made him dangerous, motivated by a deep political hostility to the Howards.
