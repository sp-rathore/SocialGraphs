His works criticize agricultural [[civilization]] as inherently oppressive, and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of [[hunter-gatherer]]s as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Some subjects of his criticism include [[domestication]], [[language]], [[Anarcho-primitivism#Critique of symbolic culture|symbolic thought]] (such as [[mathematics]] and art) and the concept of time.\n\nHis six major books are ''Elements of Refusal'' (1988), ''[[Future Primitive and Other Essays]]'' (1994), ''Running on Emptiness'' (2002), ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' (2005), ''Twilight of the Machines'' (2008), and ''Why hope? The Stand Against Civilization'' (2015).\n\n{{Green anarchism| People}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nZerzan was born in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]], Oregon. He received his bachelor's degree from [[Stanford University]] and later received a master's degree in History from [[San Francisco State University]]. He completed his coursework towards a PhD at the [[University of Southern California]] but dropped out before completing his [[Thesis|dissertation]]. He is of [[Czechs|Czech]] descent.\n\n==Zerzan's anarchism==\n{{Anarchism sidebar}}\nZerzan's theories draw on [[Theodor Adorno]]'s concept of [[Negative Dialectics|negative dialectics]] to construct a theory of [[civilization]] as the cumulative construction of [[social alienation|alienation]].  According to Zerzan, original human societies in [[paleolithic]] times, and similar societies today such as the [[!Kung people|!Kung]] and [[Mbuti]], live a non-alienated and non-oppressive form of life based on [[Original Affluent Society|primitive abundance]] and closeness to nature. Constructing such societies as a kind of political ideal, or at least an instructive comparison against which to denounce contemporary (especially industrial) societies, Zerzan uses [[anthropology|anthropological]] studies from such societies as the basis for a wide-ranging critique of aspects of modern life. He portrays contemporary society as a world of misery built on the [[psychology|psychological]] production of a sense of scarcity and lack.<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm John Zerzan – The Mass Psychology of Misery] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/massmisery.htm |date=20100323052844 }}</ref> The history of civilization is the history of renunciation; what stands against this is not progress but rather the [[Utopia]] which arises from its negation.<ref name=WhyPrimitivism>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm John Zerzan – Why Primitivism?] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whyprim.htm |date=20091214075548 }}</ref>\n\nZerzan is an anarchist, and is broadly associated with the philosophies of [[anarcho-primitivism]], [[green anarchism]], anti-civilisation, [[post-left anarchy]], [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddism]], and in particular the [[critique of technology]].<ref name=GUARDIAN>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,475181,00.html John Zerzan] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> He rejects not only the state, but all forms of hierarchical and authoritarian relations.  \"Most simply, anarchy means 'without rule.' This implies not only a rejection of government but of all other forms of domination and power as well.\"<ref name=WhatIsAnarchism>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm John Zerzan – What is Anarchism?] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm |date=20100618101213 }}</ref>\n\nZerzan's work relies heavily on a strong [[dualism]] between the \"primitive\" – viewed as non-alienated, wild, non-hierarchical, ludic, and socially [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] – and the \"civilised\" – viewed as alienated, domesticated, hierarchically organised and socially discriminatory. Hence, \"life before domestication/agriculture was in fact largely one of leisure, intimacy with nature, sensual wisdom, sexual equality, and health.\"<ref name=FuturePrimitive>{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/future-primitive.htm |title=John Zerzan – Future Primitive |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nZerzan's claims about the status of primitive societies are based on a certain reading of the works of anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee|Richard B. Lee]]. Crucially, the category of primitives is restricted to pure hunter-gatherer societies with no domesticated plants or animals. For instance, hierarchy among Northwest Coast Native Americans whose main activities were fishing and foraging is attributed to their having domesticated dogs and tobacco.<ref name=FuturePrimitive/><ref name = RunningOnEmptiness/>\n\nZerzan calls for a \"Future Primitive\", a radical reconstruction of society based on a rejection of alienation and an embracing of the wild.  \"It may be that our only real hope is the recovery of a face-to-face social existence, a radical [[decentralization]], a dismantling of the devouring, estranging productionist, high-tech trajectory that is so impoverishing.\"<ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/> The usual use of anthropological evidence is comparative and demonstrative – the necessity or naturality of aspects of modern western societies is challenged by pointing to counter-examples in hunter-gatherer societies.  \"Ever-growing documentation of human prehistory as a very long period of largely non-alienated life stands in sharp contrast to the increasingly stark failures of untenable modernity.\"<ref name=WhyPrimitivism/> It is unclear, however, whether this implies a re-establishment of the literal forms of hunter-gatherer societies or a broader kind of learning from their ways of life in order to construct non-alienated relations.\n\nZerzan's political project calls for the destruction of technology.  He draws the same distinction as [[Ivan Illich]], between tools that stay under the control of the user, and technological systems that draw the user into their control.  One difference is the [[division of labour]], which Zerzan opposes. In Zerzan's philosophy, technology is possessed by an [[elite]] which automatically has power over other users; this power is one of the sources of alienation, along with [[domestication]] and [[symbol]]ic thought.\n\nZerzan's typical method is to take a particular construct of civilisation (a technology, belief, practice or institution) and construct an account of its historical origins, what he calls its destructive and alienating effects and its contrasts with hunter-gatherer experiences.  In his essay on number, for example, Zerzan starts by contrasting the \"civilized\" emphasis on counting and measuring with a \"primitive\" emphasis on sharing, citing [[Dorothy D. Lee|Dorothy Lee]]'s work on the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islanders]] in support, before constructing a narrative of the rise of number through cumulative stages of state domination, starting with the desire of [[Egypt]]ian kings to measure what they ruled.<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm John Zerzan – Number: Its Origin and Evolution] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/number.htm |date=20100618100924 }}</ref>  This approach is repeated in relation to time,<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm John Zerzan – Time and its Discontents] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/time.htm |date=20100618101958 }}</ref> gender inequality,<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm John Zerzan – Patriarchy, Civilization, and the Origins of Gender] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/patriarchy.htm |date=20100206011455 }}</ref> work,<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm John Zerzan – Organized Labor versus \"The Revolt Against Work\"] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/organisedlabour.htm |date=20100618101748 }}</ref> technology,<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm John Zerzan – Technology] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/technology.htm |date=20100618101934 }}</ref> art and ritual,<ref name=RunningOnEmptiness>{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/emptiness.htm |title=John Zerzan – Running on Emptiness: The Failure of Symbolic Thought |publisher=Primitivism.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> agriculture<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm John Zerzan – Agriculture] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/agriculture.htm |date=20100831022318 }}</ref> and globalization.<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm John Zerzan – Globalization and its Apologists: An Abolitionist Perspective] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/globalization.htm |date=20100206011133 }}</ref>  Zerzan also writes more general texts on anarchist,<ref name=WhatIsAnarchism/> primitivist theory,<ref name=WhyPrimitivism/><ref name=FuturePrimitive/> and critiques of \"[[postmodernism]]\".<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/pmanarchist.htm John Zerzan – \"Hakim Bey,\" Postmodern Anarchist] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/pmanarchist.htm |date=20100618100950 }}</ref>\n\nZerzan was one of the editors of ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and [[insurrectionary anarchist]] thought.

He does extensive speaking tours around the world, and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other nonprofit organizations.\n\n==Political development==\nIn 1966, Zerzan was arrested while performing [[civil disobedience]] at a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] anti-[[Vietnam War]] march and spent two weeks in the [[Contra Costa County]] [[county jail|Jail]]. He vowed after his release never again to be willingly arrested. He attended events organized by [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] and was involved with the [[psychedelic drug]] and [[psychedelic music|music]] scene in San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/apr/18/mayday.features11 |title=Profile of American anarchist John Zerzan &#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=April 20, 2001}}</ref><ref name=sohowdidyoubecomeananarchist>[http://www.modukit.com/anarhija-blok45/zerzan/sadrzaj/textz/html/Z_so-how-did-you-become-an-anarchist.html John Zerzan – So...how did you become an anarchist?]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s he worked as a [[social worker]] for the city of San Francisco [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] department.

Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''Demolition Derby '' and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80's, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when [[Fredy Perlman]] was making similar conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |title=Interview: Anarcho-Primitivist Thinker and Activist John Zerzan &#124; CORRUPT.org: Conservation & Conservatism |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> He saw civilization itself as the root of the problems of the world and that a hunter-gatherer form of society presented the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian model]] for human relations with themselves and the natural world.\n\n==Zerzan and the \"Unabomber\"==\nIn the mid-1990s, Zerzan became a confidant to [[Theodore Kaczynski]], the \"Unabomber\", after he read ''Industrial Society and Its Future'', the so-called ''Unabomber Manifesto.''  Zerzan sat through the Unabomber trial and often conversed with Kaczynski during the proceedings.  After Zerzan became known as a friend of the Unabomber, the mainstream media became interested in Zerzan and his ideas.\n\nOn May 7, 1995, a full-page interview with Zerzan was featured in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3DD113FF934A35756C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&&scp=1&sq=zerzan&st=cse Prominent Anarchist Finds Unsought Ally in Serial Bomber] (New York Times article)</ref> In Zerzan's essay \"Whose Unabomber?\" (1995), he signaled his support for the Kaczynski doctrine, but criticised the bombings:\n\n<blockquote>\n[T]he mailing of explosive devices intended for the agents who are engineering the present catastrophe is too random. Children, mail carriers, and others could easily be killed. Even if one granted the legitimacy of striking at the high-tech horror show by terrorizing its indispensable architects, collateral harm is not justifiable ...<ref name=WhoseUnabomber>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm John Zerzan – Whose Unabomber?] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whoseunabomber.htm |date=20100618101228 }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Zerzan in the same essay offered a qualified defense of the Unabomber's actions:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe concept of justice should not be overlooked in considering the Unabomber phenomenon. In fact, except for his targets, when have the many [[little Eichmanns]] who are preparing the [[Brave New World]] ever been called to account?... Is it unethical to try to stop those whose contributions are bringing an unprecedented assault on life?<ref name=WhoseUnabomber/>\n</blockquote>\n\nTwo years later, in the 1997 essay \"He Means It&nbsp;— Do You?,\" Zerzan wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nEnter the Unabomber and a new line is being drawn. This time the bohemian schiz-fluxers, Green yuppies, hobbyist anarcho-journalists, condescending organizers of the poor, hip nihilo-aesthetes and all the other \"anarchists\" who thought their pretentious pastimes would go on unchallenged indefinitely&nbsp;— well, it's time to pick which side you're on. It may be that here also is a [[Crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon]] from which there will be no turning back.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a 2001 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', he said:\n\n<blockquote>\nWill there be other Kaczynskis? I hope not. I think that activity came out of isolation and desperation, and I hope that isn't going to be something that people feel they have to take up because they have no other way to express their opposition to the brave new world.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn a 2014 interview Zerzan stated that he and Kaczynski were \"not on terms anymore.\" He criticized his former friend's 2008 essay \"[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-truth-about-primitive-life-a-critique-of-anarchoprimitivism The Truth About Primitive Life: A Critique of Anarchoprimitivism]\" and expressed disapproval of [[Individuals Tending Towards the Savage|Individuals Tending Towards the Wild]], a Mexican group influenced by the Unabomber's bombing campaign.<ref name=\"vice.com\">{{cite news|url=http://www.vice.com/read/john-zerzan-wants-us-to-give-up-all-of-our-technology |title=The Anarcho-Primitivist Who Wants Us All To Give Up Technology |work=Vice Media Inc |location=USA |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Zerzan and the Seattle Riots==\n{{see also|1999 Seattle WTO protests}}\nAnother significant event that shot Zerzan to celebrity philosopher status was his association with members of the [[Eugene, Oregon anarchist scene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/11/22/coverstory.html|title=Part.

Anarchists using black bloc tactics were thought to be chiefly responsible for the property destruction committed at numerous corporate storefronts and banks.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} \n\nAlthough the majority of black block participants were, in fact, class struggle anarchists and not primitivists, the mainstream media chose Zerzan as one of those to explain the actions. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAgain boosted by public notoriety, Zerzan began accepting speaking engagements and giving interviews around the world explaining anarcho-primitivism  and so-called [[Post-left anarchy|post-left anarchist]] trend. This argues that anarchists should break with the [[political left]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Criticism: history, catastrophe and anarchism==\nIn his essay \"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm\", [[Murray Bookchin]] directed criticism from an anarchist point of view at Zerzan's anti-civilizational and anti-technological perspective. He argued that Zerzan's representation of hunter-gatherers was flawed, selective and often patronisingly racist, that his analysis was superficial, and that his practical proposals were nonsensical.\n\nAside from Murray Bookchin, several other anarchist critiques of Zerzan's primitivist philosophies exist. The pamphlet, \"Anarchism vs. Primitivism\" by Brian Oliver Sheppard criticizes many aspects of the primitivist philosophy.<ref name=\"Libcom.org\"/> It specifically rejects the claim that primitivism is a form of anarchism.\n\nSome authors, such as Andrew Flood, have argued that destroying civilization would lead to the death of a significant majority of the population, mainly in poor countries.<ref name=\"Anarkismo.net\"/> John Zerzan responded to such claims by suggesting a gradual decrease in population size, with the possibility of people having the need to seek means of sustainability more close to nature.<ref>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm ] {{wayback|url=http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/fp.htm |date=20100910091422 }}</ref> \n\nFlood suggests this contradicts Zerzan's claims elsewhere, and adds that, since it is certain that most people will strongly reject Zerzan's supposed utopia, it can only be implemented by authoritarian means, against the will of billions.<ref name=\"Anarkismo.net\"/>  \n\nIn his essay \"Listen Anarchist!\", Chaz Bufe criticized the primitivist position from an anarchist perspective, pointing out that primitivists are extremely vague about exactly which technologies they advocate keeping and which they seek to abolish, noting that smallpox had been eradicated thanks to medical technology.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.seesharppress.com/listen.html| author=Chaz Bufe| title=Listen Anarchist!| publisher=See Sharp Press| year=1987}}</ref>\n\n[[Theodore J. Kaczynski]], better known as the [[Unabomber]], is a surprisingly harsh critic of the current Anarcho-Primitivist mainstream and Zerzan in particular for what he sees as a foolish and invalid projection of leftist values such as gender equality, pacifism and leisure time onto the primitive way of life. Kaczynski holds that the values of gender equality, pacifism, leisure time, etc., while still admirable, are exactly the values of techno-industrial civilization and its promised techno-utopia. Second, he holds that having such an interpretation is counter-productive to the ultimate anti-civilization/anti-tech goal as it attracts \"leftist types\" who are by nature uncommitted and act to dilute the movement.  Kaczynski insists that the core values of freedom, autonomy, dignity, and human fulfillment must be emphasized above all others.<ref>Technological Slavery: The collected writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, pp. 128–189.</ref>\n\nZerzan's views have been criticized for being anti-anarchist. His solution - a return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle - has been criticized as likely to lead to a loss of life.<ref name=\"Anarkismo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1451 |title=Civilization, Primitivism, Anarchism by Andrew Flood |publisher=Anarkismo.net |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> His critics largely reject his claim to be an anarchist.<ref name=\"Libcom.org\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/anarchism-vs-primitivism |title=Anarchism vs. Primitivism by Brian Oliver Sheppard |publisher=Libcom.org |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Books and pamphlets===\n* ''Why hope?
