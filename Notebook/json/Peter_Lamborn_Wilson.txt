Attracted by the philosophy, Wilson was initiated into the group, but later joined a group of breakaway members who founded the [[Moorish Orthodox Church of America|Moorish Orthodox Church]]. The Church maintained a presence at the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], the cult established by [[Timothy Leary]], and it is alleged Wilson would visit it for supplies of LSD. Leary's sponsor, [[Mellon family|Mellon]] fortune heir Billy Hitchcock, cut his ties, and Leary headed to Algiers.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, pp11-78</ref>\n\nAppalled by the social and political climate, Wilson had also decided to leave America, and shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968 he flew to Lebanon. In the words of [[Michael Muhammad Knight]], \"The emerging postcolonial world was crowded with American hippies blowing their trust funds on mystical quests…and [Wilson] was one of them.\"<ref>Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p6</ref>\n\nWilson travelled to India with the intention of studying [[Sufism]], but became fascinated by [[Tantra]], tracking down [[Ganesh Baba]]. He spent a month in a [[Kathmandu]] missionary hospital being treated for [[hepatitis]], and practised meditation techniques in a cave above the east bank of the [[Ganges]]. He also allegedly ingested significant quantities of cannabis.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\nWilson travelled on to Pakistan. There he lived in several places, mixing with princes, Sufis, and gutter dwellers, and moving from teahouses to opium dens. In [[Quetta]] he found \"a total disregard of all government\", with people reliant on family, clans or tribes, which appealed to the anarchist in him.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\nWilson then moved to Iran. It was here that he developed his scholarship. He translated classical Persian texts with French scholar [[Henry Corbin]], and also worked as a journalist at the ''Tehran Journal''. In 1974, [[Farah Pahlavi|Farah Pahlavi  Empress of Iran]], commissioned her personal secretary, scholar [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], to establish the [[Imperial Iranian Academy of Philosophy]]. Nasr offered Wilson the position of director of its English language publications, and editorship of its journal ''Sophia Perennis''. This Wilson edited from 1975 until 1978.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\nFollowing the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, Wilson lived in New York, sharing a brownstone townhouse with [[William Burroughs]], with whom he bonded over their shared interests. Burroughs acknowledged Wilson for providing material on [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] which he used for his novel ''[[The Western Lands]]''.<ref name=\"Knight\" />\n\nWilson currently lives in upstate New York. A family trust fund enables him to live in a state he terms \"independently poor\".<ref name=\"Knight\" /> He has been described as \"a subcultural monument\".<ref>Jarrett, Earnest ''Living Under Sick Machines: Peter Lamborn WIlson / Hakim Bey'', The Brooklyn Rail, 5 June 2014; http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/06/art/hakim-bey-with-jarrett-earnest</ref>\n\n==Hakim Bey==\nWilson's occasional pen name of ''Hakim Bey'' is derived from il-Hakim, the alchemist-king, with 'Bey' a further nod to Moorish Science. Wilson's two personas, as himself and Bey are facilitated by his publishers who provide separate author biographies even when both appear in the same publication.<ref>Knight, Michael M. ''William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur'an'', Soft Skull Press, Berkley 2012, p74</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nIn addition to his writings on ontological anarchy (termed [[lifestyle anarchism]] by detractors such as [[Murray Bookchin]]) and Temporary Autonomous Zones, Wilson has written essays on other topics such as [[Tong (organization)|Tong]] traditions, the utopian [[Charles Fourier]], the poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], alleged connections between [[Sufism]] and ancient [[Celt]]ic culture, technology and [[Luddism]], ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' use in ancient [[Ireland]], and [[Nazar ila'l-murd|sacred pederasty in the Sufi tradition]].<ref>Wilson, Peter Lambourn. ''Contemplation of the Unbearded - The Rubaiyyat of Awhadoddin Kermani.'' [[Paidika]], Vol.3, No.4, 1995.</ref> \n\nWilson's [[freeform poetry]], as Hakim Bey, has appeared in ''[[Exquisite Corpse (magazine)|Exquisite Corpse]]'', the ''Panthology'' and ''Acolyte Reader'' anthologies, ''Gayme'', ''P.A.N.'', ''NAMBLA Bulletin'', ''Ganymede,'' and various samizdat zines. Many of the poems were collected in an unpublished volume ''DogStar,'' praised by Burroughs and Ginsberg. Currently his works can be found regularly in publications like ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'' and the NYC-based ''First of the Month''.\n\nHe has also published at least one novel, ''The Chronicles of Qamar: Crowstone''.<ref>{{oclc|16810252}}</ref>\n\nParticularly because of his [[Temporary Autonomous Zone|TAZ]] work, Wilson has often been embraced by [[rave]] subculture, as ravers have identified the experience and occasions of raves as part of the tradition of \"Temporary Autonomous Zones\" that Bey outlines, particularly the \"[[free party]]\" or [[teknival]] scene.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=March 2014}} Wilson has been supportive of the rave connection, while remarking in an interview, \"The ravers were among my biggest readers... I wish they would rethink all this techno stuff — they didn’t get that part of my writing.\"<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.thebrooklynrail.org/spotlight/july04/wilson.html | title=An Anarchist in the Hudson Valley | journal=Brooklyn Rail | date=July 2004}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, he has commented on the [[Occupy Movement]] in an interview with David Levi Strauss of  ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'':\n\n<blockquote>I was beginning to feel that there would never be another American uprising, that the energy was gone, and I have some reasons to think that might be true. I like to point out that the crime rate in America has been declining for a long time, and in my opinion it’s because Americans don’t even have enough gumption to commit crimes anymore: the creative aspect of crime has fallen into decay. As for the uprising that takes a principled stand against violence, hats off to them, I admire the idealism, but I don’t think it’s going to accomplish much.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Levi Strauss | first=David | title=In Conversation with Peter Lamborn Wilson | journal=The Brooklyn Rail | url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2012/10/art/peter-lamborn-wilson-with-tyler-akers-rabia-ashfaque-carina-badalamenti-matthew-farina-jessica-holmes-candy-koh-naomi-lev-david-levi-strauss-sabrina-locks-tara-stickley-erin-sutphin-terrence-trouillot-and-david-willis | date=October 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn another interview with David Levi Strauss and Christopher Bamford in ''The Brooklyn Rail'', Bey has discussed his views on what he calls \"Green Hermeticism\": \n<blockquote>We all agreed that there is not a sufficient spiritual focus for the environmental movement. And without a spiritual focus, a movement like this doesn’t generate the kind of emotional energy that it needs to battle against global capitalism—that for which there is no other reality, according to most people. It should be a rallying call of the spirit for the environmental movement, or for as many parts of that movement as could be open to it.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Levi Strauss | first=David | title=Green Hermeticism: David Levi Strauss in conversation with Peter Lamborn Wilson and Christopher Bamford | journal=The Brooklyn Rail |date=January 2008 | url=http://brooklynrail.org/2007/12/art/green-hermeticism}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWilson has even taken up commentary on [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|the ontology of quantum physics]], interpreting Nick Herbert's ''[[Quantum Reality]]'' in terms of the social paradigms from which quantum mechanics may draw its metaphors.<ref name=\"qr\">{{cite web | last = Bey | first = Hakim | title = Quantum Mechanics & Chaos Theory: Anarchist Meditations on N.

AK Press. 1994.</ref> Wilson explains his particular conception of anarchism and anarchy which he calls \"ontological anarchy\". In the same compilation he deals with his view of the relationships of individuals with the exterior world as perceived by the senses and a theory of liberation which he calls \"immediatism\".\n\n===Temporary Autonomous Zones===\nWilson has written articles on three different types of what he calls \"autonomous zones\". Regarding his concept of Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ) he said in an interview that <blockquote>the real genesis was my connection to the communal movement in America, my experiences in the 1960s in places like [[Timothy Leary]]'s commune in Millbrook...Usually only the religious ones last longer than a generation—and usually at the expense of becoming quite authoritarian, and probably dismal and boring as well. I've noticed that the exciting ones tend to disappear, and as I began to further study this phenomenon, I found that they tend to disappear in a year or a year and a half.<ref>[http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-hakim-bey/ Hans Ulrich Obrist. \"In Conversation with Hakim Bey\" at e-flux]</ref></blockquote> \n\nIn an article on obsessive love, Wilson posited a utopia based on generosity as well as obsession, and wrote: \n\n<blockquote>I have dreamed this (I remember it suddenly, as if it were literally a dream) — and it has taken on a tantalizing reality and filtered into my life — in certain Temporary Autonomous Zones — an \"impossible\" time and space ....and on this brief hint, all my theory is based.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hermetic.com/bey/obsessive-love.html|title=Obsessive Love — Hakim Bey|website=Hermetic Library|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs such, it may be said that it is part of the eternal vision of an arcadia where desires are fulfilled without reference to the world, and the search for a means of realising it.\n\nThe concept of TAZ was presented in a long elaboration in the book ''TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone, Ontological Anarchy, Poetic Terrorism''.<ref>Hakim Bey.

August 1991</ref>\n\n==Criticism and controversy==\n\n===Lifestyle anarchism===\nIn ''[[Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]]'', [[Murray Bookchin]] included Wilson's work (as Bey) in what he called \"[[lifestyle anarchism]]\", which he criticized Wilson's writing for tendencies towards [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and [[irrationalism]].<ref>Bookchin, Murray. ''Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism'' (1995). [[AK Press]]: [[Stirling]]. ISBN 978-1-873176-83-2. (pp. 20-26)</ref> Wilson did not respond publicly. [[Bob Black]] wrote a rejoinder to Bookchin in ''Anarchy after Leftism''.\n\n===Pederasty===\nWilson is sometimes criticized by other anarchist theorists for his literary celebration of pederasty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Helms|first1=Robert P.|title=Leaving Out the Ugly Part — On Hakim Bey|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/robert-p-helms-leaving-out-the-ugly-part-on-hakim-bey|website=The Anarchist Library|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Steven|title=Paedophilia and American anarchism - the other side of Hakim Bey|url=https://libcom.org/library/paedophilia-and-american-anarchism-the-other-side-of-hakim-bey|website=libcom.org|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''The Winter Calligraphy of Ustad Selim, & Other Poems'' (1975) (Ipswich, England) ISBN 0-903880-05-9\n*''Science and Technology in Islam'' (1976) (with [[Leonard Harrow]])\n*''Traditional Modes of Contemplation & Action'' (1977) (editor, with [[Yusuf Ibish]])\n*''Nasir-I Khusraw: 40 Poems from the Divan'' (1977) (translator and editor, with [[Gholam Reza Aavani]]) ISBN 0-87773-730-4\n*''DIVAN'' (1978) (poems, London/Tehran)\n*''Kings of Love: The Poetry and History of the Nimatullahi Sufi Order of Iran'' (1978) (translator and editor, with [[Nasrollah Pourjavady]]; Tehran)\n*''Angels'' (1980, 1994) ISBN 0-500-11017-4 (abridged edition: ISBN 0-500-81044-3)\n*''Weaver of Tales: Persian Picture Rugs'' (1980) (with [[Karl Schlamminger]])\n*''Loving Boys: Semiotext(e) Special'' (1980) (editor as Hakim Bey; Semiotext(e) (New York))\n*''Divine Flashes'' (1982) (by [[Fakhruddin 'Iraqi]], translated and introduced with [[William Chittick|William C.
