In 1990 he received his D.Sc. from [[Leningrad State University]] with a thesis entitled \"Proof Transformations and Synthesis of Programs\".<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=41775}}</ref> He was a [[Stanford University]] [[professor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wakefield |first=Tanu |url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2014/june/grigori-mints-obit-061214.html |title=Stanford philosophy Professor Grigori Mints, a world-renowned logician, has died at 74. |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2014-06-12 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> Since 1991, Grigori \"Grisha\" Mints was a professor of philosophy and, by courtesy, of mathematics and of computer science at Stanford University. Before joining Stanford, Mints held research positions at the Steklov Mathematical Institute, the Leningrad University and the Estonian Academy of Sciences.\n\nConsidered one of the most distinguished logicians in the world, Mints was passionate about the applications of logic to philosophy. His expertise was in proof theory – the analysis of the structure of mathematical reasoning. Mints was elected to the [[Estonian Academy of Sciences]] in 2008 and to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2010.\n\nMints was a very active member of the steering committee of the [[WoLLIC]] series of workshops on logic and language, after having been a member of the community in several capacities such as invited speaker, PC member, PC chair, Organising Committee chair, guest editor of proceedings and special issue, and steering committee member.\n\n==Selected Publications==\n*Mints, G.
