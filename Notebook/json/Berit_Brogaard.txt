In the TMS study, Padgett was shown formulas and asked to rate his synesthetic sensation on a scale 1-10, relative to his \"baseline\" percept (i.e. without TMS). They applied TMS over the brain areas that were activated in the fMRI scan with the formulas that give rise to synesthetic experiences and found the TMS modulated two central areas.\n\nThe results establish for the first time that synesthetic imagery may be generated in areas of the brain not normally used for the creation of visual imagery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/12/1376.abstract|title=Mental Visual Synthesis is Originated in the Fronto-temporal Network of the Left Hemisphere|author=Yukihito Yomogida|publisher=}}</ref> Jason Padgett has since then published an autobiography with Maureen Seaberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.struckbygenius.com|title=Struck by Genius|publisher=}}</ref> The book is being turned into a major Hollywood movie, starring Channing Tatum.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/channing-tatum-tackling-struck-by-732971 | title= Channing Tatum Tackling 'Struck by Genius' Adaptation (Exclusive) |publisher= The Hollywood Reporter | date= 2014-09-17 | accessdate= Feb 7, 2015 | author= Boris Kit}}</ref>\n\nBrogaard's lab has also studied the cognitive mechanisms underlying grapheme-color synesthesia, one of the most common forms of synesthesia.<ref>{{cite book|title=The LTP Model for Grapheme-Color Binding in Synesthesia.

Plausibly such an individual would proceed slowly from perceiving her surroundings normally to perceiving them unconsciously. In this process, the brightness of the perceived content would gradually decrease until a point at which it would be unclear whether the perception counted as weakly conscious.\n\nOr consider [[George Sperling]]'s classic experiment in which a 3 x 3 array of letters was briefly flashed to the test subjects. Most subjects said that they were aware of all the letters, even though they could report only about half of them. To test whether the subjects were right, Sperling used a tone after the presentation of the stimulus to signal which row the subjects should report (high tone = top row, medium tone = middle row and low tone = the bottom row). The subjects were able to name the letters in the indicated row but they were unable to report any other numbers. The fact that the subjects were able to report any signaled row indicates that they were phenomenally conscious of all the rows but did not have access consciousness to all of them. But suppose we were to flash a 4 x 4 array of letters, then a 5 x 5 array of letters, then 6 x 6 array of letters, and so on, to subjects in an experiment. In that case, it would naturally become harder and harder for them to report the rows as the array became increasingly more complicated. There would, however, be no precise cut-off at which the subjects would go from being weakly conscious to not being weakly conscious of all the rows.\n\n===Philosophy of language===\n\nBrogaard is also a well known contributor to the philosophy of language. Brogaard's book, Transient Truths provides the first book-length exposition and defense of temporalism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/36173-transient-truths-an-essay-in-the-metaphysics-of-propositions/|title=Transient Truths: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Propositions|author=ENR // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Pacific Division of the APA|title=Author-Meets-Critics: Brit Brogaard, Transient Truths: An Essay in the Metaphysics of Propositions|url=http://apa-pacific.org/current/main-program.php|year=2013}}</ref> the view that contents can change their truth-values along with changes in the world.

The view suggests a broader view according to which some types of representation have a determinate truth-value only relative to features about the subject who does the representing.

Delving into the neurological underpinnings of savant syndrome, the authors reveal how we can acquire some of these skills ourselves—from perfect pitch and lightning fast math skills to supercharged creativity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Superhuman-Mind-Free-Genius-Brain/dp/1594633681/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440718358&sr=8-1&keywords=the+superhuman+mind|title=The Superhuman Mind: Free the Genius in Your Brain: Berit Brogaard PhD PhD, Kristian Marlow MA MA: 9781594633683: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Miscellaneous==\n\nBrogaard was the President of the Southern Society for Philosophy and Psychology and the first female President of the Central States Philosophical Association.<ref>[http://www.cspaonline.com/ Central States Philosophical Association]</ref> She is a regular contributor to [[Psychology Today]] with Co-Investigator Kristian Marlow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/|title=The Superhuman Mind|work=Psychology Today}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2013/02/10/psychology-can-be-improved-by-adding-some-economics/|title=Psychology can be improved by adding some economics - Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|work=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science}}</ref> She is on the Governing Board for Gender Studies at University of Missouri, St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/~genderstudies/|title=Gender Studies|publisher=}}</ref> On her website ''Lovesick Love'',Brogaard offers advice focusing on relationships breakups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovesicklove.com/|title=Lovesick Love|work=Lovesick Love}}</ref> She is the American editor of the academic journal [[Erkenntnis]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springer.com/philosophy/journal/10670?detailsPage=editorialBoard|title=Erkenntnis|work=springer.com}}</ref> and the philosophy of language editor for [[David Chalmers]] and David Bourget's PhilPapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/browse/philosophy-of-language/|title=Philosophy of Language|publisher=}}</ref> She also serves on the editorial boards of Brain and Mind, Springer Book Series, ed.
