Sometimes described as \"the father of modern linguistics\", Chomsky is also a major figure in [[analytic philosophy]], and one of the founders of the field of [[cognitive science]]. Based at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) since 1955, where he is [[List of Institute Professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Institute Professor]] [[Emeritus]], he is the author of over 100 books on topics such as [[linguistics]], [[war]], [[politics]], and [[mass media]]. Ideologically, he aligns with [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n<!--Early life up until 1966-->\nBorn to middle-class [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] immigrants in [[Philadelphia]], Chomsky developed an early interest in [[anarchism]] from alternative bookstores in [[New York City]]. At the age of sixteen he began studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. He married fellow linguist [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Schatz]] in 1949. From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to [[Harvard University]]'s [[Society of Fellows]], where he developed the theory of [[transformational grammar]] for which he was awarded his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' while from 1958 to 1959 he was a [[National Science Foundation]] fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the [[Universal Grammar|universal grammar]] theory, the [[generative grammar]] theory, the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], and the [[minimalist program]]. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of [[behaviorism]], being particularly critical of the work of [[B. F. Skinner]].\n\n<!--Later life post-1967-->\nAn outspoken [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent of U.S. involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], which he saw as an act of [[American imperialism]], in 1967 Chomsky attracted widespread public attention for an [[The Responsibility of Intellectuals|essay on the subject]]. Associated with the [[New Left]], he was arrested multiple times for his activism and placed on President [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon's Enemies List|Enemies List]]. While expanding his work in linguistics over subsequent decades, he also became involved in the [[Linguistics Wars]]. In collaboration with [[Edward S. Herman]], Chomsky later developed the [[propaganda model]] of media criticism, and worked to expose the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]]. However, his defense of unconditional [[freedom of speech]]—including for [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]]—generated significant controversy in the [[Faurisson affair]] of the early 1980s. Following his retirement from active teaching, he has continued his vocal political activism, including opposing the [[War on Terror]] and supporting the [[Occupy movement]].\n\n<!--Brief assessment of Chomsky's reception and legacy:-->\nOne of the most cited scholars in history, Chomsky has influenced an array of academic fields. He is widely recognized as a [[paradigm shift]]er who helped spark a major revolution in the [[human sciences]], contributing to the development of a new [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivistic]] framework for the study of [[language]] and the [[mind]]. He remains a leading [[Criticism of American foreign policy|critic of U.S. foreign policy]], [[neoliberalism]] and contemporary [[state capitalism]], the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and mainstream [[news media]]. His ideas have proved highly significant within the [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] movements, but have also drawn criticism, with some accusing Chomsky of [[anti-Americanism]] and alleging that he is sympathetic to [[terrorism]] and [[genocide denial]].\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n===Childhood: 1928–45===\nAvram Noam Chomsky was born on December 7, 1928, in the [[East Oak Lane, Philadelphia|East Oak Lane]] neighborhood of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=9|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=3}} His father was the Ukrainian-born [[William Chomsky|William \"Zev\" Chomsky]], an [[Ashkenazi Jewish|Ashkenazi Jew]] who had fled to the United States in 1913. Having studied at [[Johns Hopkins University]], William went on to become school principal of the [[Congregation Mikveh Israel]] religious school, and in 1924 was appointed to the faculty at [[Gratz College]] in Philadelphia. His wife was the [[Belarus]]ian-born Elsie Simonofsky (1903–1972), a teacher and activist whom William had met while working at Mikveh Israel.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=9–10|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=11}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=\"What motivated his [political] interests? A powerful curiosity, exposure to divergent opinions, and an unorthodox education have all been given as answers to this question. He was clearly struck by the obvious contradictions between his own readings and mainstream press reports. The measurement of the distance between the realities presented by these two sources, and the evaluation of why such a gap exists, remained a passion for Chomsky.\"|source=Biographer [[Robert F.

Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]\" who had a [[centre-left politics|center-left]] position on the political spectrum; however, he was exposed to [[far-left politics]] through other members of the family, a number of whom were [[socialism|socialists]] involved in the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=14|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=11, 14–15}} He was substantially influenced by his uncle, a dropout who owned a newspaper stand in [[New York City]] where Jewish leftists came to debate the issues of the day.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=23|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=12, 14–15, 67|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=4}} Whenever visiting his uncle, Chomsky frequented left-wing and anarchist bookstores in the city, voraciously reading political literature.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=23}} He later described his discovery of [[anarchism]] as \"a lucky accident\",{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=17–19}} because it allowed him to become critical of other far-left ideologies, namely [[Stalinism]] and other forms of [[Marxism–Leninism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=17–19|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=16, 18}}\n\nChomsky's primary education was at [[Oak Lane Day School|Oak Lane Country Day School]], an independent [[Deweyism|Deweyite]] institution that focused on allowing its pupils to pursue their own interests in a non-competitive atmosphere.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=12|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} It was here that he wrote his first article, aged 10, on the spread of [[fascism]], following the [[Catalonia Offensive|fall of Barcelona]] to [[Francisco Franco]]'s fascist army in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=13|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=3}} Aged 12, he moved on to secondary education at [[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Central High School]], where he joined various clubs and societies and excelled academically, but was troubled by the hierarchical and regimented method of teaching employed there.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=21–22|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=14|4a1=McGilvray|4y=2014|4p=4}} From the age of 12 or 13, he identified more fully with anarchist politics.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2pp=15–17}}\n\n===University: 1945–55===\n\nIn 1945, Chomsky, aged 16, embarked on a general program of study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he explored philosophy, logic, and languages and developed a primary interest in learning [[Arabic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=47|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Living at home, he funded his undergraduate degree by teaching Hebrew.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=47}} However, he was frustrated with his experiences at the university, and considered dropping out and moving to a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=17}} His intellectual curiosity was reawakened through conversations with the Russian-born linguist [[Zellig Harris]], whom he first met in a political circle in 1947. Harris introduced Chomsky to the field of theoretical linguistics and convinced him to major in the subject.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=48–51|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19, 31}} Chomsky's [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] honors thesis was titled \"Morphophonemics of Modern Hebrew\", and involved him applying Harris's methods to the language.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=32}} Chomsky revised this thesis for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], which he received at Penn in 1951; it would subsequently be published as a book.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=33}} He also developed his interest in philosophy while at university, in particular under the tutelage of his teacher [[Nelson Goodman]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=33}}\n\nFrom 1951 to 1955, Chomsky was named to the [[Society of Fellows]] at [[Harvard University]], where he undertook research on what would become his doctoral dissertation.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xv|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=79|3a1=Sperlich|3y=2006|3p=20}} Having been encouraged to apply by Goodman,{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} a significant factor in his decision to move to Harvard was that the philosopher [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.

Austin]] of the [[University of Oxford]], would strongly influence Chomsky.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=33–34}} In 1952, Chomsky published his first [[academic article]], \"Systems of Syntactic Analysis\", which appeared not in a journal of linguistics, but in ''[[The Journal of Symbolic Logic]]''.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=34}} Being highly critical of the established behaviorist currents in linguistics, in 1954 he presented his ideas at lectures given at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=81}} Although he had not been registered as a student at Pennsylvania for four years, in 1955 he submitted a thesis to them setting out his ideas on [[transformational grammar]]; he was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] on the basis of it, and it would be privately distributed among specialists on [[microfilm]] before being published in 1975 as part of ''The Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory''.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=83–85|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=36|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3pp=4&ndash;5}} Possession of this Ph.D. nullified his requirement to enter [[national service]] in the armed forces, which was otherwise due to begin in 1955.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=36}} [[George Armitage Miller]], a Professor at Harvard, read the Ph.D. and was impressed; together he and Chomsky published a number of technical papers in [[mathematical linguistics]].{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=38}}\n\n{{double image|left|Rudolf Rocker.jpg|155|George Orwell press photo.jpg|148|The work of anarcho-syndicalist [[Rudolf Rocker]] (left) and democratic socialist [[George Orwell]] (right) significantly influenced the young Chomsky.}}\n\nIn 1947, Chomsky entered into a romantic relationship with [[Carol Chomsky|Carol Doris Schatz]], whom he had known since they were toddlers, and they married in 1949.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=13, 48, 51–52|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=18–19}} After Chomsky was made a Fellow at Harvard, the couple moved to an apartment in the [[Allston]] area of [[Boston]], remaining there until 1965, when they relocated to the city's [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] area.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=20}} In 1953 the couple took up a Harvard travel grant in order to visit Europe, traveling from England through France and Switzerland and into Italy.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=20–21}} On that same trip they also spent six weeks at [[Hashomer Hatzair]]'s [[HaZore'a]] kibbutz in the newly established [[Israel]]; although enjoying himself, Chomsky was appalled by the Jewish nationalism and [[Anti-Arabism|anti-Arab racism]] that he encountered in the country, as well as the pro-Stalinist trend that he thought pervaded the kibbutz's leftist community.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=20–21}}\n\nOn visits to New York City, Chomsky continued to frequent the office of Yiddish anarchist journal ''[[Freie Arbeiter Stimme]]'', becoming enamored with the ideas of contributor [[Rudolf Rocker]], whose work introduced him to the link between anarchism and [[classical liberalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=24|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=13}} Other political thinkers whose work Chomsky read included the anarchist [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], democratic socialists [[George Orwell]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Dwight Macdonald]], and works by Marxists [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Karl Korsch]], and [[Rosa Luxemburg]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=24–25}} His readings convinced him of the desirability of an anarcho-syndicalist society, and he became fascinated by the anarcho-syndicalist communes set up during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which were documented in Orwell's ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=26}} He avidly read leftist journal ''[[politics (magazine 1944-1949)|politics]]'', remarking that it \"answered to and developed\" his interest in anarchism,{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=34–35}} as well as the periodical ''[[International Council Correspondence|Living Marxism]]'', published by [[council communism|council communist]] [[Paul Mattick]]. Although rejecting its Marxist basis, Chomsky was heavily influenced by council communism, voraciously reading articles in ''Living Marxism'' written by [[Antonie Pannekoek]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=36–40}} He was also greatly interested in the Marlenite ideas of the [[Leninist League (US)|Leninist League]], an anti-Stalinist Marxist–Leninist group, sharing their views that the [[Second World War]] was orchestrated by Western capitalists and the Soviet Union's '[[state capitalism|state capitalists]]' to crush Europe's proletariat.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|pp=43–44}}\n\n===Early career: 1955–1966===\n\nChomsky had befriended two linguists at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Morris Halle]] and [[Roman Jakobson]], the latter of whom secured him an assistant professor position at MIT in 1955.

In 1961 he was awarded [[academic tenure]], being made a full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1pp=101–102, 119|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=23}} He went on to be appointed plenary speaker at the Ninth [[International Congress of Linguists]], held in 1962 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which established him as the ''de facto'' spokesperson of American linguistics.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=102}} He continued to publish his linguistic ideas throughout the decade, including in ''[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]]'' (1966), ''Topics in the Theory of Generative Grammar'' (1966), and ''[[Cartesian linguistics|Cartesian Linguistics: A Chapter in the History of Rationalist Thought]]'' (1966).{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=103}} Along with Halle, he also edited the ''Studies in Language'' series of books for [[Harper and Row]],{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=104}} and extended the theory of generative grammar to [[phonology]] in ''[[The Sound Pattern of English]]'' (1968).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.mit.edu/chomsky/slideshow/#active=1&slide=b4|title=Slideshow {{!}} unBox the Chomsky Archive {{!}} MIT Libraries|website=libraries.mit.edu|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref> He continued to receive academic recognition and honors for his work, in 1966 visiting a variety of Californian institutions, first as the [[Linguistics Society of America]] Professor at the [[University of California]], and then as the Beckman Professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lyons|1y=1978|1p=xvi|2a1=Barsky|2y=1997|2p=120}} His Beckman lectures would be assembled and published as ''Language and Mind'' in 1968.{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=122}} The ensuing debates between Chomsky and his critics came to be known as the '[[Linguistics Wars]]', although they revolved largely around debating philosophical issues rather than linguistics proper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|pp=60–61}}\n\n==Later life==\n\n===Anti-Vietnam War activism and rise to prominence: 1967–1975===\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=left|quote=\"[I]t does not require very far-reaching, specialized knowledge to perceive that the United States was invading South Vietnam.

For example, although children are exposed to only a very small and scattered subset of the allowable syntactic variants within their first language, they somehow acquire the highly organized and systematic ability to understand and produce an infinite number of sentences, including ones that have never before been uttered. To explain this, Chomsky reasoned that the primary linguistic data (PLD) must be supplemented by an innate linguistic capacity. Furthermore, while a human baby and a kitten are both capable of [[inductive reasoning]], if they are exposed to exactly the same linguistic data, the human will always acquire the ability to understand and produce language, while the kitten will never acquire either ability. Chomsky labeled whatever relevant capacity the human has that the cat lacks as the [[language acquisition device]] (LAD), and he suggested that one of the tasks for linguistics should be to determine what the LAD is and what constraints it imposes on the range of possible human languages. The universal features that would result from these constraints constitute 'universal grammar'.<ref>{{cite web|author=Noam Chomsky |url=http://www.chomsky.info/books/architecture01.htm |title=The 'Chomskyan Era' (Excerpted from The Architecture of Language) |publisher=Chomsky.info |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|page=234}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:left\"\n|+ Different grammatical [[surface structure]]s of a sentence\n| [[File:Time flies 1.svg|x100px]] || [[File:Time flies 2.svg|x100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Time flies 3.svg|x100px]] || [[File:Time flies 4.svg|x100px]]\n|}\n\n===Transformational generative grammar===\n{{Main article|Transformational generative grammar}}\nBeginning with his ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' (1957), a distillation of his ''Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory'' (1955), Chomsky challenges [[structural linguistics]] and introduces [[transformational grammar]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Transformacijsko-generativni pristup jeziku u ''Sintaktičkim strukturama'' i ''Aspektima teorije sintakse'' Noama Chomskog |trans_title=Transformational-generative approach to language in ''Syntactic structures'' and ''Aspects of the theory of syntax'' of Noam Chomsky |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446914.Transformacijsko-generativni_pristup.PDF |deadurl=no |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=SOL: lingvistički časopis |location=Zagreb |volume=6 |issue=12–13 |pages=103–112 |year=1991 |issn=0352-8715 |id={{ZDB|1080348-8}} |archivedate=September 2, 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ANNlKB4s |accessdate=May 15, 2015}} [http://opak.crolib.hr/cgi-bin/unicat.cgi?form=D1941130086 (CROLIB)]</ref>\n\nChomsky's theory posits that language consists of both '''deep structures''' and '''surface structures'''.

Chomsky dispenses with concepts such as 'deep structure' and 'surface structure' and instead places emphasis on the plasticity of the brain's neural circuits, along with which comes an infinite number of concepts, or '[[Logical Form (lingustics)|Logical Forms]].' When exposed to linguistic data, the brain of a hearer-speaker then proceeds to associate sound and meaning, and the rules of grammar that we observe are in fact only the consequences, or side effects, of the way that language works.

Everett traveled to Brazil and lived among the Piraha people for twenty years to learn their language.  He discovered that their language lacks recursion, embedded phrases that otherwise complicate the simple meaning of a sentence.  In 2002, Chomsky co-wrote a paper stating that recursion is the \"only uniquely human component of the faculty of language.\"  Everett focuses on his discovery that the language of the Piraha people lacks recursion, thereby finding a flaw to Chomsky's theory.  Everett argues his discovery in two books, ''Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes: Life and Language in the Amazonian Jungle,'' and ''Language: The Cultural Tool.''  Everett's argument has culminated into a Smithsonian Channel documentary on the topic, ''The Grammar of Happiness.''

His work seeks to reveal such manipulations and the truth that they obscure.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=8|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=158}} He believes that \"[[common sense]]\" is all that is required to break through the web of falsehood and see the truth, if it is employed using both [[critical thinking]] skills and an awareness of the role that self-interest and self-deception plays on both oneself and on others.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=74|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2pp=12&ndash;13}} He believes that it is the moral responsibility of intellectuals to tell the truth about the world, but claims that few do so because they fear losing prestige and funding.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} He argues that, as such an intellectual, it is his duty to use his [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], resources, and training to aid popular democracy movements their struggles.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=161}}\n\nAlthough he had joined protest marches and organized activist groups, he identifies his primarily political outlet as being that of education, offering free lessons and lectures to encourage wider political consciousness.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=71}} His political

believes that the basic principle of the [[foreign policy of the United States]] is the establishment of \"open societies\" which are economically and politically controlled by the U.S. and where U.S.-based businesses can prosper.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=92}} He argues that the U.S. seeks to suppress any movements within these countries that are not compliant to U.S. interests and ensure that U.S.-friendly governments are placed in power.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} When discussing current events, he emphasises their place within a wider historical perspective.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=160}}\nHe believes that 'official,' sanctioned historical accounts of U.S. and British imperialism have consistently whitewashed these nations' actions in order to present them as having benevolent motives in either spreading democracy or, in older instances spreading [[Christianity]]; criticizing these accounts, he seeks to correct them.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} Prominent examples that he regularly cites are the actions of the [[British Empire]] in India and Africa, and the actions of the U.S. in Vietnam, the Philippines, Latin America, and the Middle East.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}}\n\nChomsky explains his decision to focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because during his lifetime the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14, 160}} His hope is that by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway the population of the U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=13}} He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments, to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions, and to apply the same standards to others as one would apply to oneself.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=18}}\n\nHe has been critical of U.S. involvement in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]], arguing that it has consistently blocked a peaceful settlement.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=159}} Chomsky has long endorsed the left binationalist program, seeking to create a democratic state in the [[Levant]] that is home to both Jews and Arabs.{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=170|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2pp=76–77|3a1=McGilvray|3y=2014|3p=159}} However, acknowledging the [[realpolitik]] of the situation, Chomsky has also considered a [[two-state solution]] on the condition that both nation-states exist on equal terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=97|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=159}} As a result of [[Political positions of Noam

and socialism===\nIn his youth, Chomsky developed a dislike of [[capitalism]] and the [[selfishness|selfish]] pursuit of material advancement.{{sfn|Sperlich|2006|p=15}} At the same time he developed a disdain for the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist-Leninist policies of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barsky|1y=1997|1p=168|2a1=Sperlich|2y=2006|2p=16}} Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy on the one hand and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy of the one hand and total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=164–165}} He argues that Western capitalist nations are not really democratic,{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=169}} for in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=170}} He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the [[IMF]], [[World Bank]], and [[GATT]].{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=211}} \n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Socialism will be achieved only insofar as all social institutions, in particular the central industrial, commercial, and financial institutions of a modern society, are placed under democratic control in a federal industrial republic of the sort that Russell and others envisioned, with actively functioning workers' councils and other self-governing units in which each citizen, in [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s words, will be \"a direct participator in the government of affairs.\"|source=Noam Chomsky{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=210}} }}\n\nChomsky highlights that since the 1970s, the U.S. has become increasingly economically unequal as a result of the repeal of various financial regulations and the rescindment of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods financial control]] agreements.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He characterizes the U.S. as a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], viewing both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] as manifestations of a single \"Business Party\" controlled by corporate and financial interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=14&ndash;15}} Chomsky highlights that within Western capitalist liberal democracies, at least 80% of the population has no control over economic decisions, which are instead in the hands of a management class and ultimately controlled by a small, wealthy elite.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}}\n\nNoting that this economic system is firmly entrenched and difficult to overthrow, he believes that change is possible through the organized co-operation of large numbers of people who understand the problem and know how they want to re-organize the economy in a more equitable way.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} Although acknowledging that corporate domination of media and government stifle any significant change to this system, he sees reason for optimism, citing the historical examples of the social rejection of [[slavery]] as immoral, the advances in women's rights, and the forcing of government to justify invasions to illustrate how change is possible.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=14}} He views violent revolution to overthrow a government as a last resort to be avoided if possible, citing the example of historical revolutions where the population's welfare has worsened as a result of the upheaval.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=15}} \n\nChomsky deems libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist ideas to be the inheritors of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]],{{sfnm|1a1=Sperlich|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=McGilvray|2y=2014|2p=189}} arguing that his ideological position revolves around \"nourishing the libertarian and creative character of the human being.\"{{sfn|Barsky|1997|p=95}} \nHe envisions an anarcho-syndicalist future in which there is direct worker control of the [[means of production]], with society governed by [[Workers' council|workers' councils]], who would select representatives to meet together at general assemblies.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=199}} In this he believes that there will be no need for [[political parties]].{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=200}} By controlling their productive life, he believes that individuals can gain job satisfaction, a sense of fulfilment, and purpose to their work.{{sfn|McGivlray|2014|pp=197, 202}} He argues that unpleasant and unpopular jobs could be fully automated, carried out by workers who are specially remunerated, or shared among everyone.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=201–202}}\n\n=== News media and propaganda ===\n{{Main article|Propaganda model}}\nChomsky's political writings have largely been focused with the two concepts of [[ideology]] and [[power (social and political)|power]], or the media and state policy.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=20}} One of Chomsky's best-known works, ''Manufacturing Consent'', dissects the media's role in reinforcing and acquiescing to state policies, across the political spectrum, while marginalizing contrary perspectives. Chomsky claims that this 'free-market' version of censorship is more subtle and difficult to undermine than the equivalent propaganda system which was present in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=37–38}} As he argues, the mainstream press is corporate owned and thus reflects corporate priorities and interests.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=179}} While acknowledging that many American journalists are dedicated and well-meaning, he argues that the choice of topics and issues featured in the mass media, the unquestioned premises on which that coverage rests, and the range of opinions that are expressed are all constrained to reinforce the state's ideology.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=178}} He states that while the mass media will criticise individual politicians and political parties, it will not undermine the wider state-corporate nexus of which it is a part.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=189}}  As evidence, he highlights that the US mass media does not employ any socialist journalists or political commentators.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=177}} He also points to examples of important news stories which have been ignored by U.S. mainstream media because reporting on them would reflect badly upon the U.S. state: for instance, it ignored the murder of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Fred Hampton]] with possible [[FBI]] involvement, the massacres perpetrated in Nicaragua by the U.S.-funded [[Contras]], and the constant reporting on Israeli deaths while ignoring the far larger number of Palestinian deaths in the conflict between those two nations.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|pp=179–182}}\nTo remedy this situation, Chomsky calls for grassroots democratic control and involvement of the media.{{sfn|McGilvray|2014|p=184}}\n\nChomsky considers most [[conspiracy theories]] to be fruitless, distracting substitutes to thinking about [[policy | policy formation]] in an institutional framework, where individual manipulation is secondary to broader social imperatives.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=70}} He does not dismiss [[conspiracy theories]] outright, but he does consider them unproductive to challenging [[power (social and political)|power]] in a substantial way.\nIn response to the labeling of his own thoughts as \"conspiracy theory,\" Chomsky has replied that it is very rational for the media to manipulate information in order to sell it, like any other business. He asks whether [[General Motors]] would be accused of conspiracy if they deliberately selected what they would use or discard in order to sell their product.{{sfn|Rai|1995|pp=42}}\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|align=right|quote=\"Chomsky’s intellectual life had been divided between his work in linguistics and his political activism, philosophy coming as a distant third.
