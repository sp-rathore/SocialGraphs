Maloney (UPenn, Computer Science).</ref> A current list of all of Corcoran’s publications is available at ResearchGate.\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Corcoran2/\n\n==Education==\nCorcoran studied engineering at the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]],\nAdvanced Curriculum Engineering 1956, and the [[Johns Hopkins University]], BES Mechanical Engineering 1959. After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the [[Johns Hopkins University]]:  MA\nPhilosophy 1962, PhD. Philosophy 1963. Post-doctoral study: [[Yeshiva University]], Mathematics\n1964 and [[University of California Berkeley]], Mathematics 1965. Dissertation: Generative\nStructure of Two-valued Logics; Supervisor Robert McNaughton (PhD student of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]).\n\nCorcoran’s student years, the late 1950s and early 1960s, were wonderful times to be learning logic, its history, and its philosophy.  His first logic teacher was Albert Hammond, who passed on from his own dissertation supervisor [[Arthur Lovejoy]] the tradition of the history of ideas—a tradition that his university, The Johns Hopkins University, had become famous for.  Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with [[Ludwig Edelstein]], the historian of Greek science and medicine who held appointments both at The Johns Hopkins University and at its School of Medicine.  His next two logic teachers were both accomplished and knowledgeable symbolic logicians: Joseph Ullian, a Quine PhD, and Richard Wiebe, a Mates PhD who had studied with Carnap and Tarski. \nCorcoran’s dissertation supervisor, his doctor father, was Robert McNaughton, a Quine PhD who had already made a name for himself in three fields: the metamathematics of number theory, the theory of formal languages, and the theory of automata.  McNaughton encouraged Corcoran to do post-doctoral studies at Yeshiva University in New York City with [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Martin Davis]], both doctoral students of [[Alonzo Church]].  McNaughton later encouraged Corcoran to go to [[UC Berkeley]], the world center for logic and methodology, and he recommended Corcoran to his Berkeley colleagues.  He was also instrumental in Corcoran’s move to his first tenure-track position, at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where McNaughton was a Professor of Computer and Information Science.  In those early years Corcoran also attended semester-long courses and seminars by several other logicians, including John Addison, a [[Stephen Kleene]] PhD, [[Leon Henkin]], another Church PhD, and [[John Myhill]], another Quine PhD.  Corcoran often mentions his teachers with great respect and warmth.\n\n==Regular academic or research appointments==\nHe has been Professor of Philosophy, [[University at Buffalo]] (SUNY), 1973–; Associate Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo, 1970–1973;\nAssistant Professor of Linguistics, [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1965–1969; Member of\nLinguistics Group, IBM Research Center, 1963–1964.\n\n==Visiting academic or research appointments==\nHe is or was Visiting Professor of Logic, University of\nSantiago de Compostela 1994; Visiting Scholar, Linguistic Institute, SUNY Oswego 1976; NSF\nSeminar Project Director, Linguistic Institute, University at Buffalo 1971; Visiting Associate\nProfessor of Philosophy and Research Associate, [[University of Michigan]] 1969–1970; Visiting\nLecturer in Philosophy, [[University of California, Berkeley]] 1964–1965; Mathematician, [[General Electric Research Laboratory]] 1962; Mathematician, Aeronca Astromechanics Institute, 1961; Junior\nInstructor in Philosophy, [[Johns Hopkins University]] 1960–1961.\n\n==Research profile==\n\nCorcoran’s work in [[history of logic]] involves most of the discipline’s\nproductive periods. He has discussed [[Aristotle]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri]], [[George Boole]], [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Clarence Irving Lewis]], the American Postulate Theorists, [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and [[Warren Goldfarb]].\n\nHis 1972 interpretation of Aristotle’s [[Prior Analytics]],<ref>Degnan, M. 1994. Recent Work in Aristotle's Logic. Philosophical Books 35.2 (April, 1994): 81-89.</ref> proposed independently by [[Timothy Smiley]] at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, [[Newton da Costa]], Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by [[Gisela Striker]].\n\nHis 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole’s original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole’s work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole’s philosophy of logic. A 2003 article<ref>Corcoran, John (2003). “Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought”. ''History and Philosophy of Logic'', '''24''': 261–288. Reviewed by Risto Vilkko. ''Bulletin of Symbolic Logic'', '''11'''(2005) 89–91. Also by Marcel Guillaume, ''Mathematical Reviews'' 2033867 (2004m:03006).</ref> provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of [[Aristotelian logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]; it also reveals the centrality of [[wholistic reference]] in Boole's [[philosophy of logic]]. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle’s logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did  “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle’s logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what [[Aristotle]] said; Boole’s ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle’s four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. \nSecond, in the realm of logic’s problems, Boole’s addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole’s doctrine that Aristotle’s rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole’s system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle’s system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.\n \nHis collaboration with Alfred Tarski in the late 1970s and early 1980s<ref>See pp. 361–368 in  {{cite book\n|last1=Feferman\n|first1=Anita Burdman\n|first2=Solomon\n|last2=Feferman\n|authorlink2=Solomon Feferman\n|title=Alfred Tarski:  Life and Logic\n|year=2004\n|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n|isbn=978-0-521-80240-6\n|oclc=54691904\n|ref=F-F\n}}.</ref> led to publications on Tarski’s work<ref>Corcoran, John, and Sagüillo, José Miguel, 2011. “The Absence of Multiple Universes of Discourse in the 1936 Tarski Consequence-Definition Paper”, ''History and Philosophy of Logic''  '''32''': 359–80. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01445340.2011.577145</ref> and to the 2007 article ''Notes on the Founding of Logics and Metalogic: Aristotle, Boole, and Tarski,'' which traces Aristotelian and Boolean ideas in Tarski’s work and which confirms Tarski’s status as a founding figure in logic on a par with Aristotle and Boole.\n\n==Scientific work==\n\nHis work in [[philosophy of logic]] focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in\ninquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[epistemological]] presuppositions\nof logic, the nature of [[mathematical logic]] and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical\npractice. His [[mathematical logic]] treats [[propositional logic]]s, [[modal logic]]s, identity logics,\n[[syllogistic]] logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, [[second-order logic]]s,\n[[model theory]], and [[Concatenation theory|the theory of strings]] – a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic\nand which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In [[philosophy of mathematics]] Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary [[Platonism]] which\nstrives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects\nemphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as [[logicism]], [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]],\n[[deductivism]], and [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]]. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little\nhistory or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his\nrecent BSL article “Schemata”) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article\n“Categoricity”). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as\nmathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been\nguided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best\nunderstood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to [[Arthur Lovejoy]]’s\nHistory of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by\nthe American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.<ref>Corcoran, John, (2009). Remembering My Life with Peter Hare. Remembering Peter Hare 1935–2008. Ed. J. Campbell. Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy. pp. 9–16.\n\thttp://american-philosophy.org/documents/RememberingPeterHare_final.pdf .</ref>\n\n==Collaboration==\n[[Image:Saguillo Shapiro Corcoran-1.jpg|left|180px|thumb|José Miguel Saguillo, [[Stewart Shapiro]], and John Corcoran]]\n\nMany of Corcoran’s articles and reviews are co-authored and many of his single-author\npublications acknowledge involvement of colleagues and students. Corcoran emphasizes the\nintensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge.\nNevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can\nbenefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the “Buffalo Syllogistic Group”—a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper [http://www.revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/idval/article/viewFile/12581/13183 “Aristotle’s Logic at the University at Buffalo’s Department of Philosophy”, Ideas y Valores]: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99–117.\nA list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/tf/01445340.html History and Philosophy of Logic], which also includes the expository article by M. Scanlan and S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]]\n“The Work of John Corcoran: An Appreciation”. Other articles about his work include\n“Corcoran the Mathematician” by S. [[Stewart Shapiro|Shapiro]], “Corcoran the Philosopher” by J. M. Sagüillo, and\n“Corcoran in Spanish” by C. Martínez-Vidal; all appear in a 2007 volume published by the\n[[University of Santiago de Compostela]] Press.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=9IMEm4dYQXUC .</ref>\nCorcoran’s work in the 1990s on information-theoretic logic is discussed by [[José Miguel Sagüillo|José M.
