Law, he claims, is not something given or previous, but the solution to legal problems. Legal problems are the decisive starting point. His opposition to [[legal positivism|positivism]], to [[natural law]] and to the several theories of [[legal syllogism]] would make him one of the first and most accomplished advocates of [[Interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]].\n\nCastanheira Neves, however, has always claimed that law — the task of lawyers — is not essentially interpretive or [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]], but [[Practical reason|practical]], ''i.e.'', [[philosophy of action|action guiding]]. He maintains that legal interpretation is not a necessary feature of legal reasoning. On the contrary, law always arises from legal problems, which are [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], historically situated, [[norm (philosophy)|normative]], and practical. Every legal decision aims to settle what someone (legally) ''ought to do'' in a particular case in a particular historical (and social) situation, and that is its [[definition|defining]] feature. A legal decision is also itself an action. Interpretation is not always needed and, when it is, it is auxiliary.\n\nThe central tenets of Castanheira Neves' philosophy of law were made clear in his 1967 massive book on the philosophical and methodological distinction between [[question of fact|matter of fact and matter of law]]. Castanheira Neves addresses the similarities and significant differences between his and [[Ronald Dworkin|Dworkin]]'s theses in the last part of his 2003 book.\n\nCastanheira Neves also claims that there is no law ''in'' general norms (rules, principles, etc.) as laid down by legislators, but only in solving particular cases. To this thesis, he calls \"jurisprudentialism\".\n\n:Law is not an element, but a synthesis, not a premise for validity, but fulfilled validity, not a prius, but a posterius, not a given, but a solution, it is not in the beginning, but in the end. (Castanheira Neves, 1967, p. 586)\n\nIn this, he was preceded by authors like [[Theodor Viehweg|Viehweg]] and schools of thought like [[critical legal studies]], but he differed from these authors as he claimed it to be essential to law as a normative matter, and not only descriptively. His position is therefore equivalent, in this subject, to [[Jonathan Dancy|J. Dancy's]] later [[moral particularism]]. Castanheira Neves would come to agree with [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] dictum that all interpretation is application (as Dworkin did).\n\n==Major works==\n*(1967) ''Questão-de-facto — questão-de-direito ou o problema metodológico da juridicidade'', [[Coimbra]]: Almedina.
