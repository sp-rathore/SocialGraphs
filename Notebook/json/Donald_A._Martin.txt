('''Tony''') '''Martin''' (born December 24, 1940) is an American [[set theorist]] and [[philosopher of mathematics]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], where he is a member of the faculty of mathematics and [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy]].\n\nAmong Martin's most notable work are the proofs of [[analytic set|analytic]] [[determinacy]] (from the existence of a [[measurable cardinal]]), [[Borel set|Borel]] [[determinacy]] (from [[ZFC]] alone), the proof (with [[John R. Steel]]) of [[projective determinacy]] (from suitable [[large cardinal]] axioms), and his work on [[Martin's axiom]]. [[Martin measure]] on [[Turing degree]]s is also named after Martin.\n\nMartin is a [[List of Harvard Junior Fellows|Harvard junior fellow]]. In 2014, he became a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2014-12-17</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[American philosophy]]\n* [[List of American philosophers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Martin:Donald_A=.html List of publications]\n*[http://www.logic.ucla.edu/ UCLA Logic center]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Donald A.}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century American mathematicians]]\n[[Category:American logicians]]\n[[Category:American philosophers]]\n[[Category:UCLA Philosophy]]\n[[Category:Philosophers of mathematics]]\n[[Category:Set theorists]]\n[[Category:Guggenheim Fellows]]\n[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society]]\n\n{{US-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Donald A.
