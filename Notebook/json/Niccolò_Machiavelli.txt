He also wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is renowned in the [[Italian language]]. He was secretary to the Second [[wikt:chancery|Chancery]] of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the [[Medici]] were out of power. He wrote his most renowned work ''[[The Prince]]'' (''Il Principe'') in 1513.\n\n\"[[Machiavellianism]]\" is a widely used negative term to characterize unscrupulous politicians of the sort Machiavelli described most famously in ''The Prince.'' Machiavelli described immoral behavior, such as dishonesty and killing innocents, as being normal and effective in politics. He even seemed to endorse it in some situations. The book itself gained notoriety when some readers claimed that the author was teaching evil, and providing \"evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power.\"<ref>Giovanni Giorgini, \"Five Hundred Years of Italian Scholarship on Machiavelli's Prince,\" ''Review of Politics'' (2013) 75#4 pp 625-640</ref>  The term \"Machiavellian\" is often associated with political deceit, deviousness, and ''[[realpolitik]]''. On the other hand, many commentators, such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Denis Diderot]], have argued that Machiavelli was actually a [[Republicanism|republican]], even when writing ''The Prince'', and his writings were an inspiration to Enlightenment proponents of modern democratic political philosophy.<ref>B.

Machiavelli married Marietta Corsini in 1502.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Guarini|1999|p=21}}</ref>\n[[File:Machiavel Offices Florence.jpg|thumb|left|Statue at the [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nMachiavelli was born in a tumultuous era in which popes waged acquisitive wars against Italian [[city-state]]s, and people and cities often fell from power as France, Spain, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Switzerland]] battled for regional influence and control. Political-military alliances continually changed, featuring [[condottieri]] (mercenary leaders), who changed sides without warning, and the rise and fall of many short-lived governments.<ref>Maurizio Viroli, ''Niccolò's Smile: A Biography of Machiavelli'' (2000), ch 1</ref>\n\nMachiavelli was taught grammar, rhetoric, and Latin. It is thought that he did not learn Greek even though Florence was at the time one of the centers of Greek scholarship in Europe. In 1494 Florence restored the [[Republic of Florence|republic]], expelling the [[Medici]] family that had ruled Florence for some sixty years. Shortly after the execution of [[Savonarola]], Machiavelli was appointed to an office of the second chancery, a medieval writing office that put Machiavelli in charge of the production of official Florentine government documents. Shortly thereafter, he was also made the secretary of the ''Dieci di Libertà e Pace.''\n\nIn the first decade of the sixteenth century, he carried out several diplomatic missions: most notably to the Papacy in Rome. Moreover, from 1502 to 1503, he witnessed the brutal reality of the state-building methods of [[Cesare Borgia]] (1475–1507) and his father, [[Pope Alexander VI]], who were then engaged in the process of trying to bring a large part of Central Italy under their possession. The pretext of defending Church interests was used as a partial justification by the Borgias. Other excursions to the court of [[Louis XII]] and the Spanish court influenced his writings such as ''The Prince''.\n\nBetween 1503 and 1506, Machiavelli was responsible for the Florentine militia. He distrusted mercenaries (a distrust that he explained in his official reports and then later in his theoretical works for their unpatriotic and uninvested nature in war that makes their allegiance fickle and often too unreliable when most needed) and instead staffed his army with citizens, a policy that was to be repeatedly successful. Under his command, Florentine citizen-soldiers defeated Pisa in 1509.\n\nHowever, Machiavelli's success did not last. In August 1512 the Medici, backed by [[Pope Julius II]] used Spanish troops to defeat the Florentines at [[Prato]], but many historians have argued that it was due to [[Piero Soderini]]'s unwillingness to compromise with the Medici, who were holding Prato under siege. In the wake of the siege, Soderini resigned as Florentine head of state and left in exile. The experience would, like Machiavelli's time in foreign courts and with the Borgia, heavily influence his political writings.\n\nAfter the Medici victory, the Florentine city-state and the republic were dissolved, and Machiavelli was deprived of office in 1512. In 1513 the Medici accused him of conspiracy against them and had him imprisoned. Despite having been subjected to torture (\"[[strappado|with the rope]]\" in which the prisoner is hanged from his bound wrists, from the back, forcing the arms to bear the body's weight and dislocating the shoulders), he denied involvement and was released after three weeks.\n\n[[File:Santa Croce Firenze Apr 2008 (20).JPG|thumb|Machiavelli's [[cenotaph]] in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce di Firenze|Santa Croce Church]] in Florence]]\nMachiavelli then retired to his estate at [[Sant'Andrea in Percussina]], near [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]], and devoted himself to studying and writing of the political treatises that earned his place in the intellectual development of political philosophy and political conduct.<ref>Donna, Daniel, in the introduction to the Bantam Classic edition of ''The Prince'' (1966)</ref>\n\nDespairing of the opportunity to remain directly involved in political matters, after a time, he began to participate in intellectual groups in Florence and wrote several plays that (unlike his works on political theory) were both popular and widely known in his lifetime. Still, politics remained his main passion and, to satisfy this interest, he maintained a well-known correspondence with more politically connected friends, attempting to become involved once again in political life.<ref>Machiavelli, Niccolò (1996), Machiavelli and his friends: Their personal correspondence, Northern Illinois University Press. Translated and edited by James B. Atkinson and David Sices.</ref>\n\nIn a letter to [[Francesco Vettori]], he described his exile:\n<blockquote>When evening comes, I go back home, and go to my study. On the threshold, I take off my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an ambassador would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savor. I am not ashamed to talk to them and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.<ref>Joshua Kaplan, \"Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance,\" ''The Modern Scholar'' (14 lectures in the series; lecture #7 / disc 4), 2005</ref></blockquote>\n\nMachiavelli died in 1527 at 58 after receiving his [[last rites]].<ref>\"Even such men as Malatesta and Machiavelli, after spending their lives in estrangement from the Church, sought on their death-beds her assistance and consolations.

An epitaph honoring him is inscribed on his monument. The Latin legend reads: <small>TANTO NOMINI NULLUM PAR ELOGIUM</small> (\"So great a name (has) no adequate praise\" or \"No [[eulogy]] (would be) a match for such a great name\").\n\n==Works==\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n{{See also|Category:Works by Niccolò Machiavelli}}\n\n===''The Prince''===\n{{Main|The Prince}}\n[[File:Duke-Lorenzo.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Lorenzo II de' Medici|Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici]] to whom the final version of ''The Prince'' was dedicated.]]\nMachiavelli's best-known book ''Il Principe'' contains several maxims concerning politics. Instead of the more traditional target audience of a hereditary prince, it concentrates on the possibility of a \"new prince\". To retain power, the hereditary prince must carefully balance the interests of a variety of institutions to which the people are accustomed. By contrast a new prince has the more difficult task in ruling: He must first stabilize his newfound power in order to build an enduring political structure. Machiavelli suggests that the social benefits of stability and security can be achieved in the face of moral corruption. Machiavelli believed that public and private morality had to be understood as two different things in order to rule well. As a result, a ruler must be concerned not only with reputation, but also must be positively willing to act immorally at the right times. As a political theorist, Machiavelli emphasized the occasional need for the methodical exercise of brute force or deceit including extermination of entire noble families to head off any chance of a challenge to the prince's authority.\n[[File:Niccolò-Machiavelli-Amelot-de-La-Houssaie-Il-principe MG 1089.tif|left|thumb|Engraved portrait of Machiavelli, from the Peace Palace Library's ''Il Principe'', published in 1769]]\n\nScholars often note that Machiavelli glorifies instrumentality in statebuilding, an approach embodied by the saying \"[[The ends justify the means]].\" It should be noted that this quote has been disputed and may not come from Niccolò Machiavelli or his writings. Violence may be necessary for the successful stabilization of power and introduction of new legal institutions. Force may be used to eliminate political rivals, to coerce resistant populations, and to purge the community of other men strong enough of character to rule, who will inevitably attempt to replace the ruler. Machiavelli has become infamous for such political advice, ensuring that he would be remembered in history through the adjective, \"Machiavellian\".\n\nNotwithstanding some mitigating themes, the [[Catholic Church]] banned ''The Prince'', putting it on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''. [[humanism|Humanists]] also viewed the book negatively, including [[Erasmus]] of [[Rotterdam]]. As a treatise, its primary intellectual contribution to the history of political thought is the fundamental break between political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and political [[idealism]], due to it being a manual on acquiring and keeping political power. In contrast with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], Machiavelli insisted that an imaginary ideal society is not a model by which a prince should orient himself.\n\nConcerning the differences and similarities in Machiavelli's advice to ruthless and tyrannical princes in ''The Prince'' and his more republican exhortations in ''Discourses on Livy'', many have concluded that ''The Prince'', although written as advice for a monarchical prince, contains arguments for the superiority of republican regimes, similar to those found in the ''Discourses''. In the 18th century, the work was even called a [[satire]], for example by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].<ref>''Discourse on Political Economy'': opening pages.</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Berlin|first=Isaih|title=The Originality of Machiavelli|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/published_works/ac/machiavelli.pdf|accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref> More recently, commentators such as [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Harvey Mansfield]] have agreed that ''The Prince'' can be read as having a deliberate comical irony.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958}}, pages 40-41.</ref>\n\nOther interpretations include for example that of [[Antonio Gramsci]], who argued that Machiavelli's audience for this work was not even the ruling class but the common people because the rulers already knew these methods through their education.\n\n===''Discourses on Livy''===\n{{Main|Discourses on Livy}}\n\nThe ''Discourses on the First Ten Books of Titus Livy'', published in 1531, written 1517, often referred to simply as the \"Discourses\" or ''Discorsi'', is nominally a discussion regarding the classical history of early [[Ancient Rome]] although it strays very far from this subject matter and also uses contemporary political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic ''should'' be started and structured. It is a larger work than ''The Prince'', and while it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also contains many similar themes. Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, frequently referring to leaders of democracies as \"princes\". It includes early versions of the concept of [[checks and balances]], and asserts the superiority of a republic over a principality. It became one of the central texts of [[republicanism]], and has often been argued to be a superior work to ''The Prince''.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Pocock|1975|pp=183–219}}</ref>\n\nFrom ''The Discourses'':\n* \"In fact, when there is combined under the same constitution a prince, a [[nobility]], and the power of the people, then these three powers will watch and keep each other reciprocally in check.\" Book I, Chapter II\n* \"Doubtless these means [of attaining power] are cruel and destructive of all civilized life, and neither Christian, nor even human, and should be avoided by every one.

It has been suggested that due to such things as this and his style of writing to his superiors generally, there was very likely some animosity to Machiavelli even before the return of the Medici.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Godman|1998|p=240}}. Also see {{Harvtxt|Black|1999|pp=97–98}}</ref>\n\n== Originality ==\nCommentators have taken very different approaches to Machiavelli and not always agreed. Major discussion has tended to be about two issues: first, how unified and philosophical his work is, and second, concerning how innovative or traditional it is.<ref name=Fischer>{{Harvcoltxt|Fischer|2000}}</ref>\n\n=== Coherence ===\nThere is some disagreement concerning how best to describe the unifying themes, if there are any, that can be found in Machiavelli's works, especially in the two major political works, ''The Prince'' and ''Discourses''. Some commentators have described him as inconsistent, and perhaps as not even putting a high priority in consistency.<ref name=Fischer/> Others such as [[Hans Baron]] have argued that his ideas must have changed dramatically over time. Some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times, experiences and education. Others, such as Leo Strauss and Harvey Mansfield, have argued strongly that there is a very strong and deliberate consistency and distinctness, even arguing that this extends to all of Machiavelli's works including his comedies and letters.<ref name=Fischer/>\n\n=== Influences ===\nCommentators such as Leo Strauss have gone so far as to name Machiavelli as the deliberate originator of [[modernity]] itself. Others have argued that Machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around him. In any case Machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding Italians of the old virtues of the Romans and Greeks, and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics.<ref name=Fischer/>\n\nThat Machiavelli had a wide range of influences is in itself not controversial. Their relative importance is however a subject of on-going discussion. It is possible to summarize some of the main influences emphasized by different commentators.\n\n'''1. The Mirror of Princes genre.''' {{Harvcoltxt|Gilbert|1938}} summarized the similarities between ''The Prince'' and the genre it obviously imitates, the so-called \"[[Mirror of Princes]]\" style. This was a classically influenced genre, with models at least as far back as [[Xenophon]] and [[Isocrates]], that was still quite popular during Machiavelli's life. While Gilbert emphasizes the similarities however, he agrees with all other commentators that Machiavelli was particularly novel in the way he used this genre, even when compared to his contemporaries such as [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Erasmus]]. One of the major innovations Gilbert noted was that Machiavelli focused upon the \"deliberate purpose of dealing with a new ruler who will need to establish himself in defiance of custom\". Normally, these types of works were addressed only to hereditary princes. (Xenophon is also an exception in this regard.)\n\n'''2. Classical republicanism.''' Commentators such as [[Quentin Skinner]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]], in the so-called \"Cambridge School\" of interpretation have been able to show that some of the republican themes in Machiavelli's political works, particularly the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', can be found in medieval Italian literature which was influenced by classical authors such as [[Sallust]].\n[[File:Xenophon.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Xenophon]], author of the ''[[Cyropedia]]''.]]\n'''3. Classical political philosophy: Xenophon, Plato and Aristotle.''' The Socratic school of classical political philosophy, especially [[Aristotle]], had become a major influence upon European political thinking in the late [[Middle Ages]]. It existed both in the catholicised form presented by [[Thomas Aquinas]], and in the more controversial \"[[Averroism|Averroist]]\" form of authors like [[Marsilius of Padua]]. Machiavelli was critical of catholic political thinking and may have been influenced by Averroism. But he cites Plato and Aristotle very infrequently and apparently did not approve of them. [[Leo Strauss]] argued that the strong influence of [[Xenophon]], a student of Socrates more known as an historian, rhetorician and soldier, was a major source of Socratic ideas for Machiavelli, sometimes not in line with Aristotle. While interest in [[Plato]] was increasing in Florence during Machiavelli's lifetime he also does not show particular interest in him, but was indirectly influenced by his readings of authors such as [[Polybius]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Cicero]].\n\nThe major difference between Machiavelli and the Socratics, according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature, and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their [[teleological]] understanding of things, Socratics [[teleological argument|argued]] that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli emphasized that such things happen by blind chance, or human action.<ref name=Strauss>{{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958}}</ref>\n\n'''4. Classical materialism.''' Strauss argued that Machiavelli may have seen himself as influenced by some ideas from classical materialists such as [[Democritus]], [[Epicurus]] and [[Lucretius]]. Strauss however sees this also as a sign of major innovation in Machiavelli, because classical materialists did not share the Socratic regard for political life, while Machiavelli clearly did.<ref name=Strauss/>\n\n'''5. Thucydides.'''\nSome scholars note the similarity between Machiavelli and the Greek historian [[Thucydides]], since both emphasized [[power politics]].<ref>Paul Anthony Rahe, ''Against throne and altar: Machiavelli and political theory under the English Republic'' (2008) p. 282</ref><ref>Jack Donnelly, ''Realism and International Relations'' (2000) p. 68</ref> Strauss argued that Machiavelli may indeed have been influenced by [[pre-Socratic philosophers]], but he felt it was a new combination:-\n<blockquote>...contemporary readers are reminded by Machiavelli's teaching of Thucydides; they find in both authors the same \"realism,\" i.e., the same denial of the power of the gods or of justice and the same sensitivity to harsh necessity and elusive chance. Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses in the reader a sadness which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy. One half of humanity remains outside of his thought. There is no tragedy in Machiavelli because he has no sense of the sacredness of \"the common.\" — {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=292}}</blockquote>\n\n== Beliefs ==\nAmongst commentators, there are a few consistently made proposals concerning what was most new in Machiavelli's work.\n\n=== Empiricism and realism versus idealism ===\nMachiavelli is sometimes seen as the prototype of a modern empirical scientist, building generalizations from experience and historical facts, and emphasizing the uselessness of theorizing with the imagination.<ref name=Fischer/>\n\n{{quote|He emancipated politics from theology and moral philosophy. He undertook to describe simply what rulers actually did and thus anticipated what was later called the scientific spirit in which questions of good and bad are ignored, and the observer attempts to discover only what really happens.|Joshua Kaplan, 2005<ref name=twsC11r44fzf>{{cite news|author=Joshua Kaplan|title=Political Theory: The Classic Texts and their Continuing Relevance|publisher=''The Modern Scholar''|quote=14 lectures in the series; (lectures #7) -- see disc 4|year=2005}}</ref>}}\n\nMachiavelli felt that his early schooling along the lines of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development.<ref name=twsC11r44fzf/> Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads to happiness. And Machiavelli viewed misery as ''one of the vices that enables a prince to rule.''<ref>Leo Strauss, Joseph Cropsey, ''History of Political Philosophy'' (1987) p. 300</ref> Machiavelli stated that ''it would be best to be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved.''<ref>Niccolò Machiavelli, ''The Prince'', p. 60</ref> In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime.\n\nA related and more controversial proposal often made is that he described how to do things in politics in a way which seemed neutral concerning who used the advice—tyrants or good rulers.<ref name=Fischer/> That Machiavelli strove for realism is not doubted, but for four centuries scholars have debated how best to describe his morality. ''The Prince'' made the word \"Machiavellian\" a byword for deceit, despotism, and political manipulation. Even if Machiavelli was not himself evil, [[Leo Strauss]] declared himself inclined toward the traditional view that Machiavelli was self-consciously a \"teacher of evil,\" since he counsels the princes to avoid the values of justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and love of their people in preference to the use of cruelty, violence, fear, and deception.<ref>Leo Strauss, [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0226777022?v=search-inside&keywords=teacher+of+evil ''Thoughts on Machiavelli'' (1957), p. 9 online]</ref> Italian anti-fascist philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] (1925) concludes Machiavelli is simply a \"realist\" or \"pragmatist\" who accurately states that moral values in reality do not greatly affect the decisions that political leaders make.<ref>Benedetto Croce, [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1406739774?keywords=Benedetto%20Croce%20machiavelli&p=S02H&checkSum=%252FombMxeAC6hIVUToYvbv9hivFP6U3vxoUdbCmtPQco4%253D ''My Philosophy'' (1949), p. 142 online]</ref> German philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]] (1946) held that Machiavelli simply adopts the stance of a political scientist—a [[Galileo]] of politics—in distinguishing between the \"facts\" of political life and the \"values\" of moral judgment.<ref>Ernst Cassirer, [http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0300000367?v=search-inside&keywords=machiavelli+galileo ''The Myth of the State,'' (1946) p.136, online]</ref> On the other hand, [[Walter Russell Mead]] has argued that ''The Prince''{{'}}s advice presupposes the importance of ideas like [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] in making changes to the political system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.the-american-interest.com/stratblog/2011/05/03/when-isms-go-to-war/|title=When Isms go to War|last=Russell Mead|first=Walter|date=May 3, 2011|work=The American Interest|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortune ===\nMachiavelli is generally seen as being critical of Christianity as it existed in his time, specifically its effect upon politics, and also everyday life. In his opinion, Christianity, along with the [[Teleology|teleological]] [[Aristotelianism]] that the church had come to accept, allowed practical decisions to be guided too much by imaginary [[idealism|ideals]] and encouraged people to lazily leave events up to [[Divine Providence|providence]] or, as he would put it, chance, luck or fortune. While Christianity sees modesty as a virtue and pride as sinful, Machiavelli took a more classical position, seeing ambition, spiritedness, and the pursuit of glory as good and natural things, and part of the virtue and prudence that good princes should have. Therefore, while it was traditional to say that leaders should have virtues, especially prudence, Machiavelli's use of the words ''virtù'' and ''prudenza'' was unusual for his time, implying a spirited and immodest ambition. Famously, Machiavelli argued that virtue and prudence can help a man control more of his future, in the place of allowing fortune to do so.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Najemy|1993}} has argued that this same approach can be found in Machiavelli's approach to love and desire, as seen in his comedies and correspondence. Najemy shows how Machiavelli's friend Vettori argued against Machiavelli and cited a more traditional understanding of fortune.\n\nOn the other hand, [[humanism]] in Machiavelli's time meant that classical pre-Christian ideas about virtue and prudence, including the possibility of trying to control one's future, were not unique to him. But humanists did not go so far as to promote the extra glory of deliberately aiming to establish a new state, in defiance of traditions and laws.\n\nWhile Machiavelli's approach had classical precedents, it has been argued that it did more than just bring back old ideas, and that Machiavelli was not a typical humanist. {{Harvcoltxt|Strauss|1958}} argues that the way Machiavelli combines classical ideas is new. While Xenophon and Plato also described realistic politics, and were closer to Machiavelli than Aristotle was, they, like Aristotle, also saw Philosophy as something higher than politics. Machiavelli was apparently a [[materialist]] who objected to explanations involving [[four causes|formal and final causation]], or [[teleology]].\n\nMachiavelli's promotion of ambition among leaders while denying any higher standard meant that he encouraged risk taking, and innovation, most famously the founding of new modes and orders. His advice to princes was therefore certainly not limited to discussing how to maintain a state. It has been argued that Machiavelli's promotion of innovation led directly to the argument for [[Progress (history)|progress]] as an aim of [[politics]] and [[civilization]]. But while a belief that humanity can control its own future, control nature, and \"progress\" has been long lasting, Machiavelli's followers, starting with his own friend Guicciardini, have tended to prefer peaceful progress through economic development, and not warlike progress. As Harvey {{Harvtxt|Mansfield|1995|p=74}} wrote: \"In attempting other, more regular and scientific modes of overcoming fortune, Machiavelli's successors formalized and emasculated his notion of virtue.\"\n\nMachiavelli however, along with some of his classical predecessors, saw ambition and spiritedness, and therefore war, as inevitable and part of [[human nature]].\n\nStrauss concludes his 1958 ''Thoughts on Machiavelli'' by proposing that this promotion of progress leads directly to the modern [[arms race]]. Strauss argued that the unavoidable nature of such arms races, which have existed before modern times and led to the collapse of peaceful civilizations, provides us with both an explanation of what is most truly dangerous in Machiavelli's innovations, but also the way in which the aims of his apparently immoral innovation can be understood.\n\n===Religion===\nMachiavelli explains repeatedly that religion is man-made, and that the value of religion lies in its contribution to social order and the rules of morality must be dispensed with if security requires it. In ''The Prince,'' the ''Discourses,'' and in the ''[[Life of Castruccio Castracani]],'' he describes \"prophets\", as he calls them, like [[Moses]], [[Romulus]], [[Cyrus the Great]], and [[Theseus]] (he treated pagan and Christian patriarchs in the same way) as the greatest of new princes, the glorious and brutal founders of the most novel innovations in politics, and men whom Machiavelli assures us have always used a large amount of armed force and murder against their own people. He estimated that these sects last from 1666 to 3000 years each time, which, as pointed out by Leo Strauss, would mean that Christianity became due to start finishing about 150 years after Machiavelli.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1987|p=314}}</ref> Machiavelli's concern with Christianity as a sect was that it makes men weak and inactive, delivering politics into the hands of cruel and wicked men without a fight.\n\nWhile fear of [[God]] can be replaced by fear of the prince, if there is a strong enough prince, Machiavelli felt that having a religion is in any case especially essential to keeping a republic in order. For Machiavelli, a truly great prince can never be conventionally religious himself, but he should make his people religious if he can. According to {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|pp=226–227}} he was not the first person to ever explain religion in this way, but his description of religion was novel because of the way he integrated this into his general account of princes.\n\nMachiavelli's judgment that democracies need religion for practical political reasons was widespread among modern proponents of republics until approximately the time of the [[French revolution]]. This therefore represents a point of disagreement between himself and late modernity.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=231}}</ref>\n\n===Positive side to factional and individual vice===\nDespite the classical precedents, which Machiavelli was not the only one to promote in his time, Machiavelli's realism and willingness to argue that good ends justify bad things, is seen as a critical stimulus towards some of the most important theories of modern politics.\n\nFirstly, particularly in the ''Discourses on Livy,'' Machiavelli is unusual in the positive side he sometimes seems to describe in factionalism in republics. For example, quite early in the ''Discourses,'' (in Book I, chapter 4), a chapter title announces that ''the disunion'' of the [[plebs]] and [[Roman senate|senate]] in Rome ''\"kept Rome free.\"'' That a community has different components whose interests must be balanced in any good regime is an idea with classical precedents, but Machiavelli's particularly extreme presentation is seen as a critical step towards the later political ideas of both a [[division of powers]] or [[checks and balances]], ideas which lay behind the [[US constitution]], as well as many other modern state constitutions.\n\nSimilarly, the modern economic argument for [[capitalism]], and most modern forms of economics, was often stated in the form of \"public virtue from private vices.\" Also in this case, even though there are classical precedents, Machiavelli's insistence on being both realistic and ambitious, not only admitting that vice exists but being willing to risk encouraging it, is a critical step on the path to this insight.\n\nMansfield however argues that Machiavelli's own aims have not been shared by those he influenced. Machiavelli argued against seeing mere peace and economic growth as worthy aims on their own, if they would lead to what Mansfield calls the \"taming of the prince.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mansfield|1993}}</ref>\n\n===''Machiavellian''===\n{{See also|Machiavellianism|Machiavellian intelligence}}\n[[File:Cesareborgia.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Cesare Borgia]], used as an example of a successful ruler in ''The Prince''.]]\n\nMachiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, ''[[The Prince]]'', written in 1513 but not published until 1532, five years after his death. Although he privately circulated ''The Prince'' among friends, the only theoretical work to be printed in his lifetime was ''[[The Art of War (Machiavelli)|The Art of War]]'', which was about military science. Since the 16th century, generations of politicians remain attracted and repelled by its apparently neutral acceptance, or even positive encouragement, of the immorality of powerful men, described especially in ''The Prince'' but also in his other works.\n\nHis works are sometimes even said to have contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words ''politics'' and ''politician'',<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bireley|1990|p=241}}</ref> and it is sometimes thought that it is because of him that ''Old Nick'' became an English term for the [[Devil]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Fischer|2000|p=94}}</ref> More obviously, the adjective ''Machiavellian'' became a pejorative term describing someone who aims to deceive and manipulate others for personal advantage. ''[[Machiavellianism]]'' also remains a popular term used in speeches and journalism; while in psychology, it denotes a [[personality type]].\n\nWhile Machiavellianism is notable in the works of Machiavelli, Machiavelli's works are complex and he is generally agreed to have been more than just \"Machiavellian\" himself. For example, J.G.A. {{Harvtxt|Pocock|1975}} saw him as a major source of the republicanism that spread throughout England and North America in the 17th and 18th centuries and Leo {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958}}, whose view of Machiavelli is quite different in many ways, agreed about Machiavelli's influence on republicanism and argued that even though Machiavelli was a teacher of evil he had a nobility of spirit that led him to advocate ignoble actions. Whatever his intentions, which are still debated today, he has become associated with any proposal where \"[[Consequentialism|the end justifies the means]]\". For example, Leo {{Harvtxt|Strauss|1958|p=297}} wrote:{{quote|Machiavelli is the only political thinker whose name has come into common use for designating a kind of politics, which exists and will continue to exist independently of his influence, a politics guided exclusively by considerations of expediency, which uses all means, fair or foul, iron or poison, for achieving its ends—its end being the aggrandizement of one's country or fatherland—but also using the fatherland in the service of the self-aggrandizement of the politician or statesman or one's party.}}\n\n==Influence==\nTo quote Robert Bireley:<ref>Bireley, Robert (1990), ''The Counter Reformation Prince'', p.14</ref>\n\n{{quote|...there were in circulation approximately fifteen editions of the ''Prince'' and nineteen of the ''Discourses'' and French translations of each before they were placed on [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|the Index]] of [[Paul IV]] in 1559, a measure which nearly stopped publication in Catholic areas except in France. Three principal writers took the field against Machiavelli between the publication of his works and their condemnation in 1559 and again by the Tridentine Index in 1564. These were the English cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] and the Portuguese bishop [[Jerónimo Osório|Jeronymo Osorio]], both of whom lived for many years in Italy, and the Italian humanist and later bishop, [[Ambrogio Caterino Politi]].}}\n\nMachiavelli's ideas had a profound impact on political leaders throughout the modern west, helped by the new technology of the printing press. During the first generations after Machiavelli, his main influence was in non-Republican governments. Pole reported that ''The Prince'' was spoken of highly by [[Thomas Cromwell]] in England and had influenced [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in his turn towards Protestantism, and in his tactics, for example during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref name=BireleyP15>{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=15}}</ref> A copy was also possessed by the Catholic king and emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999|p=248}}</ref> In France, after an initially mixed reaction, Machiavelli came to be associated with [[Catherine de' Medici]] and the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. As {{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}} reports, in the 16th century, Catholic writers \"associated Machiavelli with the Protestants, whereas Protestant authors saw him as Italian and Catholic\". In fact, he was apparently influencing both Catholic and Protestant kings.<ref>While Bireley focuses on writers in the Catholic countries, {{Harvcoltxt|Haitsma Mulier|1999}} makes the same observation, writing with more of a focus upon the Protestant [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]].</ref>\n\nOne of the most important early works dedicated to criticism of Machiavelli, especially ''The Prince'', was that of the [[Huguenot]], [[Innocent Gentillet]], whose work commonly referred to as ''Discourse against Machiavelli'' or ''Anti Machiavel'' was published in [[Geneva]] in 1576.<ref>The first English edition was ''A Discourse upon the meanes of wel governing and maintaining in good peace, a Kingdome, or other principalitie'', translated by Simon Patericke.</ref> He accused Machiavelli of being an atheist and accused politicians of his time by saying that his works were the \"Koran of the courtiers\", that \"he is of no reputation in the court of France which hath not Machiavel's writings at the fingers ends\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}</ref> Another theme of Gentillet was more in the spirit of Machiavelli himself: he questioned the effectiveness of immoral strategies (just as Machiavelli had himself done, despite also explaining how they could sometimes work). This became the theme of much future political discourse in Europe during the 17th century. This includes the Catholic [[Counter Reformation]] writers summarised by Bireley: [[Giovanni Botero]], [[Justus Lipsius]], [[Carlo Scribani]], [[Adam Contzen]], [[Pedro de Ribadeneira]], and [[Diego Saavedra Fajardo]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=18}}</ref> These authors criticized Machiavelli, but also followed him in many ways. They accepted the need for a prince to be concerned with reputation, and even a need for cunning and deceit, but compared to Machiavelli, and like later modernist writers, they emphasized [[Economic growth|economic progress]] much more than the riskier ventures of war. These authors tended to cite [[Tacitus]] as their source for realist political advice, rather than Machiavelli, and this pretense came to be known as \"[[Tacitean studies|Tacitism]]\".<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|pp=223–230}}</ref> \"Black tacitism\" was in support of princely rule, but \"red tacitism\" arguing the case for republics, more in the original spirit of Machiavelli himself, became increasingly important.\n\n[[File:Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Bacon]] argued the case for what would become [[modern science]] which would be based more upon real experience and experimentation, free from assumptions about metaphysics, and aimed at increasing control of nature. He named Machiavelli as a predecessor.]]\nModern [[materialism|materialist]] philosophy developed in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, starting in the generations after Machiavelli. This philosophy tended to be republican, more in the original spirit of Machiavellian, but as with the Catholic authors Machiavelli's realism and encouragement of using innovation to try to control one's own fortune were more accepted than his emphasis upon war and politics. Not only was innovative economics and politics a result, but also [[modern science]], leading some commentators to say that the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] involved a \"humanitarian\" moderating of Machiavellianism.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Machiavelli's influence is notable in many important figures in this endeavor, for example [[Jean Bodin|Bodin]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bireley|1990|p=17}}: \"Jean Bodin's first comments, found in his ''Method for the Easy Comprehension of History'', published in 1566, were positive.\"</ref> [[Francis Bacon]],<ref>Bacon wrote: \"We are much beholden to Machiavelli and other writers of that class who openly and unfeignedly declare or describe what men do, and not what they ought to do.\" {{Citation|title=Of the Advancement of Learning|chapter=II.21.9}}.

Although he was not always mentioned by name as an inspiration, due to his controversy, he is also thought to have been an influence for other major philosophers, such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Schaefer|1990}}</ref> [[René Descartes|Descartes]],<ref>{{Harvtxt|Kennington|2004}}, chapter 11.</ref> [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]]<ref>Barnes Smith \"The Philosophy of Liberty: Locke's Machiavellian Teaching\" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.</ref> and [[Montesquieu]].<ref>Carrese \"The Machiavellian Spirit of Montesquieu's Liberal Republic\" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}. Shklar \"Montesquieu and the new republicanism\" in {{Harvtxt|Bock|1999}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough Jean-Jacques Rousseau is associated with very different political ideas, it is important to view Machiavelli's work from different points of view rather than just the traditional notion. For example, Rousseau viewed Machiavelli's work as a satirical piece in which Machiavelli exposes the faults of a one-man rule rather than exalting amorality.\n\n<blockquote>In the seventeenth century it was in England that Machiavelli's ideas were most substantially developed and adapted, and that republicanism came once more to life; and out of seventeenth-century English republicanism there were to emerge in the next century not only a theme of English political and historical reflection—of the writings of the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]] circle and of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] and of early parliamentary radicals—but a stimulus to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Scotland, on the Continent, and in America.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Worden|1999}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nScholars have argued that Machiavelli was a major indirect and direct influence upon the political thinking of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] due to his overwhelming favoritism of [[republicanism]] and the republic type of government. According to John McCormick, it is still very much debatable whether or not Machiavelli was \"an advisor of tyranny or partisan of liberty.\"<ref>John P. McCormick, ''Machiavellian democracy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2011) p 23</ref>  [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[James Madison]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] followed Machiavelli's republicanism when they opposed what they saw as the emerging aristocracy that they feared [[Alexander Hamilton]] was creating with the [[Federalist Party]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}</ref> Hamilton learned from Machiavelli about the importance of foreign policy for domestic policy, but may have broken from him regarding how rapacious a republic needed to be in order to survive<ref>Walling \"Was Alexander Hamilton a Machiavellian Statesman?\" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Harper|2004}}</ref> ([[George Washington]] was probably less influenced by Machiavelli).<ref>Spalding \"The American Prince? George Washington's Anti-Machiavellian moment\" in {{Harvtxt|Rahe|2006}}</ref> However, the Founding Father who perhaps most studied and valued Machiavelli as a political philosopher was [[John Adams]], who profusely commented on the Italian's thought in his work, ''A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States of America''.<ref name=thompson>{{Harvtxt|Thompson|1995}}</ref>\n\nIn his ''Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States,'' [[John Adams]] praised Machiavelli, with Algernon Sidney and [[Montesquieu]], as a philosophic defender of mixed government. For Adams, Machiavelli restored empirical reason to politics, while his analysis of factions was commendable. Adams likewise agreed with the Florentine that human nature was immutable and driven by passions. He also accepted Machiavelli's belief that all societies were subject to cyclical periods of growth and decay. For Adams, Machiavelli lacked only a clear understanding of the institutions necessary for good government.<ref name=thompson/>\n\n===20th century===\nThe 20th-century Italian Communist [[Antonio Gramsci]] drew great inspiration from Machiavelli's writings on ethics, morals, and how they relate to the State and revolution in his writings on [[Passive Revolution]], and how a society can be manipulated by controlling popular notions of morality.<ref>Marcia Landy, \"Culture ansd Politics in the work of Antonio Gramsci,\" 167–88, in ''Antonio Gramsci: Intellectuals, Culture, and the Party'', ed.
