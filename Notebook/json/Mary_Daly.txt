As a result of support from the (then all-male) student body and the general public, however, Daly was ultimately granted [[tenure]].\n\nDaly's refusal to admit male students to some of her classes at Boston College also resulted in disciplinary action. While Daly argued that their presence inhibited class discussion, Boston College took the view that her actions were in violation of [[title IX]] of federal law requiring the college to ensure that no person was excluded from an education program on the basis of sex, and of the university's own non-discrimination policy insisting that all courses be open to both male and female students.\n\nIn 1998, a [[discrimination]] claim against the college by two male students was backed by the [[Center for Individual Rights]], a conservative advocacy group. Following further reprimand, Daly absented herself from classes rather than admit the male students.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Seele| first = Michael| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Daly's Absence Prompts Cancellations| work = | publisher = The Boston College Chronicle| date = March 4, 1999| url = http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v7/mr4/daly.html| doi = | accessdate = }}</ref> Boston College removed her tenure rights, citing a verbal agreement by Daly to retire.

''Beyond God the Father'' is the last book in which Daly really considers God a substantive subject. She laid out her systematic theology, following [[Paul Tillich]]’s example.<ref name=Riswold>{{Cite book| last = Riswold| first = Caryn D.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Two Reformers| publisher = Wipf & Stock Publishers| year = 2007| location = Eugene, OR| pages = 33| url = | doi =  | isbn = 1-59752-826-9}}</ref> Often regarded as a foundational work in feminist theology, ''Beyond God the Father'' is her attempt to explain and overcome [[androcentrism]] in [[Western religion]], and it is notable for its playful writing style and its attempt to rehabilitate \"God-talk\" for the women's liberation movement by critically building on the writing of existentialist theologians such as Paul Tillich and [[Martin Buber]]. While the former increasingly characterized her writing, she soon abandoned the latter.\n\nIn ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'' (1978), Daly argues that men throughout history have sought to oppress women. In this book she moves beyond her previous thoughts on the history of patriarchy to the focus on the actual practices that, in her view, perpetuate patriarchy, which she calls a religion.<ref name=Riswold />\n\nDaly’s ''Pure Lust: Elemental Feminist Philosophy'' (1984) and ''Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language'' (1987) introduce and explore an alternative language to explain the process of exorcism and ecstasy. In ''Wickedary'' Daly provides definitions as well as chants that she says can be used by women to free themselves from patriarchal oppression. She also explores the labels that she says patriarchal society places on women to prolong what she sees as male domination of society. Daly said it is the role of women to unveil the liberatory nature of labels such as “Hag”, “Witch”, and “Lunatic”.<ref name=Ruether>{{Cite book| last = Ruether| first = Rosemary Radford| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Women and Redemption: A Theological History| publisher = Fortress Press| year = 1998| location = Minneapolis| pages = 218–9| url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-8006-2947-7}}</ref>\n\nDaly's work continues to influence feminism and [[feminist theology]], as well as the developing concept of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] as an alternative and challenge to social necrophilia. She was an [[Ethics of eating meat|ethical vegetarian]] and [[animal rights]] activist. ''Gyn/Ecology'', ''Pure Lust'', and ''Websters' First New Intergalactic Wickedary'' all endorse anti-[[Animal testing|vivisection]] and anti-[[Fur clothing|fur]] positions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Daly was a member of the advisory board of Feminists For Animal Rights, a group which is now defunct.\n\nDaly created her own theological anthropology based around the context of what it means to be a woman. She created a thought-praxis that separates the world into the world of false images that create oppression and the world of communion in true being. She labeled these two areas foreground and Background respectively. Daly considered the foreground the realm of patriarchy and the Background the realm of Woman. She argued that the Background is under and behind the surface of the false reality of the foreground. The foreground, for Daly, was a distortion of true being, the paternalistic society in which she said most people live. It has no real energy, but drains the “life energy” of women residing in the Background. In her view, the foreground creates a world of poisons that contaminate natural life. She called the male-centered world of the foreground necrophilic, hating all living things. In contrast, she conceived of the Background as a place where all living things connect.<ref name=Ruether /><ref name=Hoagland>{{Citation| last = Hoagland| first = Sarah Lucia| author-link = | last2 = Frye| first2 = Marilyn| author2-link = | title = Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly| place = | publisher = Penn State Press| year = 2000| volume = | edition = | pages =60, 267| url = | doi =  | isbn = 0-271-02019-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Gyn/Ecology ===\nAccording to Lucy Sargisson, \"Daly seeks in Gyn/Ecology (1987) a true, wild, Woman's self, which she perceives to be dormant in women, temporarily pacified by patriarchal systems of domination.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Sargisson |first= Lucy |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Tq2XYE9xgdQC&pg=PA184 |title= Contemporary feminist utopianism |location= London; New York |publisher= Routledge |year= 1996 |page= 184 |isbn= 978-0-41-514175-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Audre Lorde]] expressed concern over ''Gyn/Ecology'', citing  homogenizing tendencies, and a refusal to acknowledge the \"[[herstory]] and myth\" of women of color.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Audre| first = Lorde| authorlink = Audre_Lorde| coauthors = | title = An Open Letter to Mary Daly| publisher = Crossing Press| year = 1984| location = Berkeley| pages = 66–71| url = | doi =  | isbn = }}</ref> The letter,<ref>Audre Lorde's letter is discussed in Dr. Daly's book, ''Outercourse''.</ref> and Daly's apparent decision not to publicly respond, greatly affected the reception of Daly's work among other feminist theorists, and has been described as a \"paradigmatic example of challenges to white feminist theory by feminists of color in the 1980s.\"<ref name= Hoagland/>\n\nDaly's reply letter to Lorde,<ref>''Amazon Grace'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 1st ed.

In her early works she sought to change religion and create an equal place for women in Catholicism by calling the church out on injustice and insisting on change.  In the course of her writings her view of religion changed. She regarded [[organized religion]] as inherently oppressive toward women by the time she wrote ''Beyond God and Father'',<ref>{{cite book |last1= Hoagland |first1= Sarah Lucia | author1link = Sarah Hoagland|last2= Frye |first2= Marilyn | author2link = Marilyn Frye|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zJbudh1l36YC&pg=PA114 |title= Feminist interpretations of Mary Daly |location= University Park, Pa. |publisher= Pennsylvania State University |year= 2000 |isbn= 978-0-27-102018-1|page= 114}}</ref> stating that \"woman's asking for equality in the church would be comparable to a black person's demanding equality in the [[Ku Klux Klan]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Nicholas |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XeusKyOcgtgC&pg=PA41 |title= Whispers of liberation: Feminist perspectives on the New Testament |location= New York |publisher= [[Paulist Press]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 978-0-80-913816-6 |page= 41}}</ref>\n\nDaly eventually gave up on theology, believing it to be hopelessly [[patriarchal]], and she turned her efforts towards philosophical feminism. She saw the Catholic Church as fundamentally corrupt, but it still had some value to her, as was evidenced by her love for her copy of ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' in her later days.<ref>[[Judith Plaskow]]. \"Lessons from Mary Daly.\" ''Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion'' 28.2 (2012): 100-104. {{doi|10.2979/jfemistudreli.28.2.100}} [[Project MUSE]].
