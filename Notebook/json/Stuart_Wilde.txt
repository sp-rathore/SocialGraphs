[http://www.deedeewilde.co.uk/aboutdeedeewilde.html \"About\"], DeeDeeWilde.co.uk.</ref> who became well known in Britain for her weekly appearances on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the dance troupe [[Pan's People]]. He was educated at [[St George's College, Weybridge|St. George's College, Weybridge]], Surrey. After his schooling he joined the [[Royal Court Theatre|English Stage Company]] in Sloane Square, London. A year later he opened a jeans business in [[Carnaby Street]] London, at the height of the Swinging Sixties where he enjoyed considerable commercial success.<ref>[http://cornerstone.wwwhubs.com/wilde.htm \"Stuart Wilde\"], Cornerstone Books.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe studied alternative religions and [[Taoism|Taoist philosophy]] for five years from the age of twenty-eight, and when he was thirty-three, he emigrated to the United States of America where he lived in [[Laguna Beach|Laguna Beach, California]] with his first wife Cynthia. He wrote his first book, ''Miracles'', in 1983.<ref name=\"worldcat\" />\n\nShortly thereafter he began a career as a lecturer appearing mainly in [[New Thought Movement|New Thought]] Churches and at [[New Age]] conferences.

Retrieved 29 October 2014, from http://www.coasttocoastam.com/article/author-metaphysical-teacher-stuart-wilde-dies</ref>\n\n==Principal philosophy==\n\n===Early Work===\nWilde's principal philosophy states that, while many citizens may seem to be normal, acquiescing to the status quo, there exists, in fact, a vast population of what he calls ''Fringe Dwellers'' whose mind and soul do not align to the constraints of life in regular society that Wilde called Tick-Tock.<ref name=\"hay\" /><ref>Macavery, Tristan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=as6NCrTgLGsC&pg=PP1 The Improvisation Playbook]. AuthorHouse, 2006. p. 30.</ref> Wilde believed through use of the [[Trance#Theta waves|theta state]] of [[Meditation#Acoustic and photic|meditation]] (4–7 [[cycles per second]]), humans can better control their [[emotional]] life and their [[Biorhythm|bio-rhythms]], and begin to see visions, and that those visions and [[Clairvoyance|extrasensory feeling]] will lead to a greater balance and more [[liberty|freedom]].<ref name=\"hay\" /><ref>[http://www.quietearth.org/shoppingcart/products/The-Art-of-Meditation-MP3-Download.html ''The Art of Meditation'']</ref><ref>[http://www.hayhouseradio.com/episode_preview.php?author_id=401 Stuart Wilde on \"Meditations to Go\"], Hay House Radio. (Audio 21:00 min).''</ref>\n\nTo that end, he emphasized the importance of going beyond the habit of struggling, and advocated the need for financial freedom,<ref name=\"hay\" /> themes stated in his books ''Life was Never Meant to be a Struggle'' (1987), ''The Trick to Money is Having Some'' (1989),<ref>Prince, Ruth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j8Bt5WrKOQ4C&pg=PA153 The New Age in Glastonbury: The Construction of Religious Movements]. Berghahn Books, 2000. p. 153.</ref> and ''The Little Money Bible'' (1998).\n\nIn ''Affirmations'' (1986), Wilde laid out systems of self-talk that empower an individual to change their core [[beliefs]].<ref>Navarra, Tova. ''The Encyclopedia of Complementary and Alternative Medicine''. Facts on File, 2004. p. 32.</ref> His book ''Sixth Sense'' (2000) discusses practical techniques for developing [[extrasensory perception]].\n\n===Later Work===\nHe earned both praise and criticism for his later works which advance controversial concepts such as other dimensions, dematerialization, and Morph worlds.<ref name=\"contact\" />\n\nHis most avant garde philosophy is based on the idea that [[Paul Dirac]]'s hypothesis of parallel [[antiparticle]] worlds is, in fact, correct, and that humans adept at [[Trance#Brain waves and brain rhythms|trance]] meditation can become aware of spiritual [[Dimension#In physics|dimensions]] placed at 90° from them left and right—dimensions, Wilde said, that follow [[Stephen Hawking|Hawking']]s theory of transverse waves of light. Wilde acknowledged there was no empirical data to support his claim, but anecdotal evidence, gathered from more than two-thousand people whom he taught, stated they had experienced such [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] 90° [[perception]] which led him to conclude these worlds exist.<ref name=\"grace\">[http://www.hayhouse.com/details.php?id=3960 Wilde, Stuart. Grace, Gaia and the End of Days. Hay House, 2009.]</ref>\n\n''Grace, Gaia, and the End of Days'' (2009) maps out coordinates for these spiritual dimensions and offers \"a twenty-first century understanding of grace and spiritual evolution\"—and tools to activate it in one's life. In a 2009 interview Wilde said, \"Grace is a golden light, pure love, a divine energy, seen coming from these inner spiritual worlds. It is data-driven and laced with trillions of bits of fractal information that will guide you and help you evolve. The human system is configured to read this fractal data through visions and extra sensory intuitive feelings.\"<ref name=\"grace\"/> Serenity and balance developed through regular trance meditation enable access this 'pure information', which he called stream of consciousness from a 'Higher Knowing', 'The Source', 'God'.<ref name=\"grace\"/>\n\nWhile Wilde believed humans are multi-dimensional beings who possess both the celestial light and the dark, he posited they gravitate to one or the other based on inner feelings, thoughts, and actions. The quality of these feelings, moreover, determine the spiritual dimension an aspect of oneself will reside in any moment.<ref name=\"grace\"/><ref>Ward, J.

''From Under the Bridge'', ''The Houston Chronicle'', 28 March 2013 (retrieved 2013-11-05)</ref> Redemption (and a life of love and serenity) is possible for all by choosing the ways of the celestial. On the larger plane, he believed the light will eventually overcome the dark and advised aligning with the forces of light, the forces of God. He laid out techniques for doing so through cultivation of tenderness, generosity, respect, \"the soft eye\", mindfulness, meditation, time in nature and with animals,<ref>Wilde, Stuart.

Move from the cold cerebral mind into the warmth of heart and feeling. \"There is strength in softness. Remember, It's all backwards,\" he was oft quoted.<ref name=\"grace\"/>\n\n===Additional Themes===\nWilde was a staunch supporter of [[peace]] in the world, the philosophy of [[live and let live]],<ref name=\"contact\" /> [[animal rights]] and vegetarianism. Tom Lishman eulogised him this way—\n\n<blockquote>We must remember that just because he has gone back to the non-physical realm he is still very much with us, we should not forget that his time here was set and agreed upon and he has completed his mission, that being said all fringe dwellers must now rise above the despair and confusion they feel and turn it into positive energy and by doing this they will honour his work in the best possible way. Stuart will be remembered for making a huge contribution towards the new golden age of peace and love that is fast approaching, his followers will indeed take up his torch and light up planet earth like never before. We must ponder this question...What if by him leaving his body at this time he can contribute even more to world peace ?, anyone that knows him will know that he will be doing just that.\"<ref>Lishman, Tom.
