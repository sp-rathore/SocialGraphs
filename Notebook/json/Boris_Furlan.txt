First, he worked as an assistant in the [[Josip Wilfan]]'s law firm, establishing his own practice in 1925. In 1926, when [[Fascist Italianization]] was already in full advance, he managed to get a permit to publish a Slovene-language legal journal named ''Pravni vestnik'' (The Legal Herald), in which both Furlan and Wilfan published numerous text on legal philosophy and legal theory.<ref>Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 37</ref> The journal was abolished in 1928, as one of the last Slovene-language and Croat-language media prohibited by the Fascist regime. Between 1928 and 1930, Furlan worked as political advisor to Wilfan, who became one of the leaders of the [[Congress of European Nationalities]].<ref>[http://www2.arnes.si/~ljinz15/documents/english/prispevki/prispevki_00-1.htm www2.arnes.si]</ref>\n\nIn 1930, he escaped to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in order to escape [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] persecution. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 1931, he opened a law practice in [[Ljubljana]], and in 1936 he became a professor of sociology of law at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Exile during World War II==\nIn late March 1941, when Yugoslavia signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], Furlan was evacuated from the country with the help of the British intelligence service with which he had established a collaboration.<ref>[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-janez-arnez/ www.rtvslo.si]</ref> After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Province of Ljubljana|Italian occupation of Slovenia]], he was convicted to death ''[[trial in absentia|in contumaciam]]'' by the Italian authorities.

Together with the [[liberal conservative]] Slovenian émigré politicians [[Izidor Cankar]] and [[Franc Snoj]], Furlan propagated for the Yugoslav and Slovene cause. In 1942, he published a brochure titled ''Fighting Yugoslavia: The Struggle of the Slovenes'', in which he articulated, among other, the Slovenian claims for the annexation of his native [[Julian March]] region to Yugoslavia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 1943, he moved to London, where he served as Minister of Education in the [[exile government]] of [[Miloš Trifunović]] between June and August 1943.
