He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as [[process philosophy]],<ref>[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), vii.</ref> which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas.\n\nIn his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13), which he wrote with former student [[Bertrand Russell]]. ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].<ref name=\"nytimes\">\"The Modern Library's Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the Century\", last modified April 30, 1999, ''[[New York Times]]'', accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.nytimes.com/library/books/042999best-nonfiction-list.html.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to [[philosophy of science]], and finally to [[metaphysics]]. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of [[western philosophy]]. Whitehead argued that reality consists of [[Event (philosophy)|processes]] rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.<ref name=\"RobertMesle\">[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process-Relational Philosophy: An Introduction to Alfred North Whitehead'' (West Conshohocken: Templeton Foundation Press, 2009), 9.</ref>  Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly ''[[Process and Reality]]'' – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.\n\nWhitehead's process philosophy argues that \"there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us.\"<ref name=\"RobertMesle\" /> For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of ecological civilization and [[environmental ethics]] pioneered by [[John B.

He was elected Dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924.<ref name=\"Victor Lowe 1990\"/> Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.<ref>Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 72-74.</ref>\n\nToward the end of his time in England, Whitehead turned his attention to [[philosophy]].  Though he had no advanced training in philosophy, his philosophical work soon became highly regarded.  After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923.<ref>Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 127.</ref>  In 1924, [[Henry Osborn Taylor]] invited the 63-year-old Whitehead to join the faculty at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of philosophy.<ref name=\"VictorLowe_d\">Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 132.</ref>\n\nDuring his time at Harvard, Whitehead produced his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote ''Science and the Modern World'', which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that plagued popular science.<ref>Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 3–4.</ref>  A few years later, he published his seminal work ''[[Process and Reality]]'', which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.<ref name=\"PhilipRose\" />\n\nThe Whiteheads spent the rest of their lives in the United States.

The book covered the nature of mathematics, its unity and internal structure, and its applicability to nature.<ref name=\"religion-online\" />  Whitehead wrote in the opening chapter:\n\n<blockquote>\"The object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of their course to know what the science is about, and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''An Introduction to Mathematics'', (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1911), 8.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book can be seen as an attempt to understand the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole, as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy, language, and physics.<ref>Christoph Wassermann, \"The Relevance of An Introduction to Mathematics to Whitehead's Philosophy\", ''Process Studies'' 17 (1988): 181–182.

In addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject, Whitehead was appointed by Britain's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the UK in 1921 and recommend reform.<ref>Committee To Inquire Into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom, ''Report of the Committee Appointed by the Prime Minister to Inquire into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom'', (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1921), 1, 282.  Available online at https://archive.org/details/reportofcommitt00grea.</ref>\n\nWhitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'', which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927.  The essay from which ''Aims of Education'' derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the [[Mathematical Association]].  In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called \"inert ideas\" – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture.  He opined that \"education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful.\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_g\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 1–2.</ref>\n\nRather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 2.</ref>  For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the [[multidisciplinary]], value-free school model<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_g\" /><ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\" /> – it should be [[Transdisciplinarity|''trans''disciplinary]], and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate.\n\nIn order to make this sort of teaching a reality, however, Whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of (or radically alter) [[Standardized test|standard examinations]] for school entrance.  Whitehead writes:\n\n<blockquote>\"Every school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations. No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments. I suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 13.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff, or else risk total stagnation, interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another.\n\nAbove all else in his educational writings, Whitehead emphasized the importance of [[imagination]] and the free play of ideas.  In his essay \"Universities and Their Function\", Whitehead writes provocatively on imagination:\n\n<blockquote>\"Imagination is not to be divorced from the facts: it is a way of illuminating the facts.  It works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts, as they exist, and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles.  It enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 93.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhitehead's philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that \"knowledge does not keep any better than fish.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 98.</ref>  In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes so much useless trivia, and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves.\n\n==Philosophy and metaphysics==\n[[File:Rummell, Richard Harvard University.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor landscape view of Harvard University, facing northeast.<ref>\"An Iconic College View: Harvard University, circa 1900.

Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and [[metaphysics]], but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur.  In one letter to his friend and former student [[Bertrand Russell]], after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: \"This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead to Bertrand Russell, February 13, 1895, Bertrand Russell Archives, Archives and Research Collections, McMaster Library, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.</ref>  Ironically, in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost [[List of metaphysicians|metaphysicians]].\n\nHowever, interest in metaphysics – the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s.  The ever-more impressive accomplishments of [[empirical]] science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to [[Empirical research|empirical testing]].<ref>[[A. J. Ayer]], ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (New York: Penguin, 1971), 22.</ref>\n\nWhitehead was unimpressed by this objection.  In the notes of one his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: \"Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.  What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.\"<ref>George P. Conger, \"Whitehead lecture notes: Seminary in Logic: Logical and Metaphysical Problems\", 1927, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.</ref>  In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned.  While Whitehead acknowledged that \"philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical [[first principle]]s,\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 4.</ref> he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently [[asymptotic]].  For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 11.</ref>\n\nPerhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favor of an [[Event (philosophy)|event]]-based or \"process\" [[ontology]] in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_a\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 17.</ref>  He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its [[experience]]. He used the term \"experience\" very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 18.</ref>  Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as \"philosophy of organism\", but it would become known more widely as \"[[process philosophy]].\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth\" />\n\nWhitehead's philosophy was highly original, and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles.  After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923, and [[Henri Bergson]] was quoted as saying that Whitehead was \"the best philosopher writing in English.\"<ref>Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 127, 133.</ref>  So impressive and different was Whitehead's philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age.<ref name=\"VictorLowe_d\" />\n\n[[Image:Eckhart Hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Eckhart Hall at the [[University of Chicago]]. Beginning with the arrival of [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] in 1927, Chicago's [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] become closely associated with Whitehead's thought for about thirty years.<ref name=\"GaryDorrien_a\">Gary Dorrien, ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Crisis, Irony, and Postmodernity, 1950–2005'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2006), 123–124.</ref>]]\nThis is not to say that Whitehead's thought was widely accepted or even well-understood.  His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the [[western canon]].<ref name=\"PhilipRose\" />  Even professional philosophers struggled to follow Whitehead's writings.  One famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of Whitehead's philosophy centers around the delivery of Whitehead's [[Gifford lectures]] in 1927–28 – following [[Arthur Eddington]]'s lectures of the year previous – which Whitehead would later publish as ''[[Process and Reality]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course.  The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect.  My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along&nbsp;... The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all.<ref>Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 250.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIndeed, it may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement.  Distinguished [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] [[theologian]] [[Shailer Mathews]] once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book ''Religion in the Making'': \"It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence.\"<ref name=\"GaryDorrien\">[[Gary Dorrien]], \"The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology\", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 320.</ref>\n\nHowever, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest.  In fact, there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications.  In 1927 they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts – [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thought.<ref name=\"GaryDorrien\" />  Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.<ref name=\"GaryDorrien_a\" />\n\nShortly after Whitehead's book ''[[Process and Reality]]'' appeared in 1929, Wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review:\n\n<blockquote>\"Not many people will read Whitehead's recent book in this generation; not many will read it in any generation. But its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it, not knowing whence the light came. After a few decades of discussion and analysis one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done.\"<ref>[[Henry Nelson Wieman]], \"A Philosophy of Religion\", ''The Journal of Religion'' 10 (1930): 137.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWieman's words proved prophetic.  Though ''Process and Reality'' has been called \"arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century,\"<ref>Peter Simons, \"Metaphysical systematics: A lesson from Whitehead\", ''Erkenntnis'' 48 (1998), 378.</ref> it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – \"that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus.\"<ref name=\"IsabelleStengers\">[[Isabelle Stengers]], ''Thinking with Whitehead: A Free and Wild Creation of Concepts'', trans. Michael Chase (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011), 6.</ref>  Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works, but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.<ref>[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Whitehead's Radically Different Postmodern Philosophy: An Argument for Its Contemporary Relevance'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007), viii–ix.</ref>\n\n===Whitehead's conception of reality===\nWhitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of [[matter]] was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things.  In his 1925 book ''Science and the Modern World'', he wrote that\n\n<blockquote>\"There persists&nbsp;... [a] fixed scientific [[cosmology]] which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute [[matter]], or material, spread through space in a flux of configurations.  In itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless.  It just does what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from the nature of its being.  It is this assumption that I call 'scientific materialism.'  Also it is an assumption which I shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived.\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_a\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn Whitehead's view, there are a number of problems with this notion of \"irreducible brute matter.\"  First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change.  By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the ''same'' thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its \"[[Nature (innate)|nature]]\", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same.  For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that \"all things flow.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 208.</ref>\n\nIn Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as \"quality\", \"matter\", and \"form\" are problematic. These \"classical\" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful [[abstraction]]s, but are not the world's basic building blocks.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 52–55.</ref>  What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34–35.</ref>  After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience.  These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a \"society\" of events.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34.</ref>  By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] (what Whitehead calls the \"[[fallacy of misplaced concreteness]]\").<ref name=\"AlfredNorth\" /><ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 54–55.</ref>\n\nTo put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a \"defining [[essence]]\" or a \"core [[Personal identity|identity]]\" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person ''really is''. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. \"Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person\"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete \"occasions of experience\" that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as \"the essence of a thing\" or \"the identity/core of a person\" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time.  Identities do not define people, people define identities.  Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an \"enduring essence\" misses the fact that \"all things flow\", though it is often a useful way of speaking.\n\nWhitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 183.</ref>  After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago.  Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that \"material substances\" or \"essences\" are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes.  No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or [[ontologically]] sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.\n\n[[Image:JohnLocke.png|210px|left|thumb|[[John Locke]] was one of Whitehead's primary influences.  In the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Whitehead wrote: \"The writer who most fully anticipated the main positions of the [[philosophy of organism]] is John Locke in his [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay]].\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_i\" />]]\nA second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of ''relations''.  It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.  Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only ''externally'' related to other things.  The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything.  But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 38–39.</ref>  A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:\n\n<blockquote>\"Reality applies to ''connections'', and only relatively to the things connected.  (A) is real for (B), and (B) is real for (A), but [they are] not absolutely real independent of each other.\"<ref>Louise R. Heath, \"Notes on Whitehead's Philosophy 3b: Philosophical Presuppositions of Science\", September 27, 1924, Whitehead Research Project, Center for Process Studies, Claremont, California.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn fact, Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its ''synthesis of'' and ''reaction to'' the world around it.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 26.</ref>  A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the [[universe]] to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not ''related'' to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_b\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 39.</ref>  Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they ''are'' what the thing is.\n\nIt must be emphasized, however, that an entity is not ''merely'' a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 19.</ref>  For Whitehead, [[creativity]] is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an [[electron]]) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by [[Causation (law)|causal]] or [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] laws.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 21.</ref>  Of course, most entities do not have [[consciousness]].<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_c\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 23.</ref>  As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow.  Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.<ref>[[Charles Hartshorne]], \"Freedom Requires Indeterminism and Universal Causality\", ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 55 (1958): 794.</ref>\n\nThe other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations) – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_b\" />  Freedom always exists within limits.  But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.<ref>[[John B. Cobb]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1978), 52.</ref>\n\nIn summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favor of the idea of reality as interrelated events in process.  He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic \"becoming\" rather than static \"being\", emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve, and that changeless \"essences\" such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth\"/>\n\n===Theory of perception===\nSince Whitehead's [[metaphysics]] described a universe in which all entities [[Experience#Subjective experience|experience]], he needed a new way of describing [[perception]] that was not limited to living, [[self-conscious]] beings.  The term he coined was \"prehension\", which comes from the Latin ''prehensio'', meaning \"to seize.\"<ref name=\"DavidRay\">[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 79.</ref>  The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as [[electron]]s.  It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of ''representative'' perception, in which the [[mind]] only has private ideas about other entities.<ref name=\"DavidRay\" />  For Whitehead, the term \"prehension\" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself.<ref name=\"DavidRay\" />  In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.  Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, ''causal efficacy'' (or \"physical prehension\") and ''presentational immediacy'' (or \"conceptual prehension\").<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_c\" />\n\nWhitehead describes causal efficacy as \"the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 44.</ref>  It is, in other words, the sense of [[causal]] relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the [[sense]]s.  Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as \"pure sense perception\", unmediated by any causal or [[symbol]]ic [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], even [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] interpretation.  In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e.g. mistaking an image in a mirror for \"the real thing\").<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 24.</ref>\n\nIn higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms \"symbolic reference\", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it.  By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair.  An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair.  However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\", but instead \"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 3.</ref>  This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it.  Moreover, animals do the same thing.  Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 4.</ref>  In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 49.</ref>\n\n===Evolution and value===\nWhitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about [[Teleology|value and purpose]] can never be fully escaped.  This is borne out in his thoughts on [[abiogenesis]], or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds.\n\nWhitehead makes the startling observation that \"life is comparatively deficient in survival value.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4.</ref>  If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, \"they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4–5.</ref>  He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 8.</ref>  In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction.  Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.\n\nFor Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert [[matter]].  Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or [[creativity]], however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed.  [[Process philosophy|Process philosopher]] [[David Ray Griffin]] coined the term \"[[Panexperientialism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]\" (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from [[panpsychism]] (the idea that all matter has [[consciousness]]).<ref>[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 97.</ref>\n\n===God===\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = \"I am also greatly indebted to [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].

As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called \"the brief Galilean vision of humility\":\n\n<blockquote>\"It does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover.  It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operates by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world.  Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also it is a little oblivious as to [[morals]].  It does not look to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present.\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_e\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 343.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt should be emphasized, however, that for Whitehead God is not necessarily tied to [[religion]].<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_d\">Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 207.</ref>  Rather than springing primarily from religious [[faith]], Whitehead saw God as necessary for his [[metaphysical]] system.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_d\" />  His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities.  Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the ''primordial nature'' of God.  However, Whitehead was also interested in [[religious experience]].  This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the ''consequent nature''.  Whitehead's conception of God as a \"dipolar\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 345.</ref> entity has called for fresh [[theological]] thinking.\n\nThe primordial nature he described as \"the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality,\"<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_e\" /> i.e., the unlimited possibility of the universe.  This primordial nature is [[Eternity|eternal]] and [[Immutability (theology)|unchanging]], providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization.  Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect \"the lure for [[feeling]], the eternal urge of desire,\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 344.</ref> pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities.\n\nGod's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging – it is God's reception of the world's activity.  As Whitehead puts it, \"[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life.  It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 346.</ref>  In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world.  In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.\n\nWhitehead thus sees God and the world as fulfilling one another.  He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time.  On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them.  God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change.  Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:\n\n<blockquote>\"In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom.'  The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of [[antitheses]], whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence. In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast.\n\n\"It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.\n\n\"It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.\n\n\"It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.\n\n\"It is as true to say that the World is [[immanent]] in God, as that God is immanent in the World.\n\n\"It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.\n\n\"It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God&nbsp;...\n\n\"What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world&nbsp;... In this sense, God is the great companion – the fellow-sufferer who understands.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 347–348, 351.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as [[process theology]], a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.<ref name=\"Bruce\">[[Bruce G. Epperly]], ''Process Theology: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (New York: T&T Clark, 2011), 12.</ref><ref>[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nFor Whitehead the core of religion was individual.  While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15–16.</ref>  His most famous remark on religion is that \"religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness&nbsp;... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 16–17.</ref>  Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's [[Character structure|character]].<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15.</ref>  He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not ''necessarily'' good – an idea which he called a \"dangerous delusion\" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 18.</ref>\n\nHowever, while Whitehead saw religion as ''beginning'' in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual.  In keeping with his [[Process philosophy#Process metaphysics|process metaphysics]] in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of \"the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 59.</ref>   In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community.  Whitehead writes further that each entity \"can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe.  Religion is world-loyalty.  The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 60.</ref>   In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.\n\nWhitehead also described religion more technically as \"an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of [[emotion]] that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.\"<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 16.</ref>  In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance.  For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 15.</ref>  It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[Isabelle Stengers]] wrote that \"Whiteheadians are recruited among both [[philosopher]]s and [[theologian]]s, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from [[ecology]] to [[feminism]], practices that unite political struggle and [[spirituality]] with the [[Pedagogy|sciences of education]].\"<ref name=\"IsabelleStengers\" />  Indeed, in recent decades attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology.  One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]]. In Temple's [[Gifford Lectures]] of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as \"Nature, Man and God\"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the [[emergent evolution]] approach Temple interacts with.<ref>George Garin, \"Theistic Evolution in a Sacramental Universe: The Theology of William Temple Against the Background of Process Thinkers (Whitehead, Alexander, Etc.),\" (Protestant University Press, Kinshasa, The Congo, 1991).</ref> However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.\n\nEarly followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|University of Chicago's Divinity School]], where [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years.<ref name=\"GaryDorrien_a\" />  Professors such as Wieman, [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Bernard Loomer]], Bernard Meland, and [[Daniel Day Williams]] made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the Divinity School.<ref>[[Gary Dorrien]], \"The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology\", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 321–322.</ref>  They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of which is [[John B. Cobb]], Jr.\n\nAlthough interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's Divinity School, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in [[Claremont, California]], where he began teaching at [[Claremont School of Theology]] in 1958 and founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973.<ref>[[David Ray Griffin]], \"[[John B. Cobb]], Jr.: A Theological Biography\", in ''Theology and the University: Essays in Honor of John B. Cobb, Jr.'', ed. David Ray Griffin and Joseph C. Hough, Jr. (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 229.</ref>  Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought.<ref>[[Gary Dorrien]], \"The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology\", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 334.</ref><ref name=\"VictorLowe_e\">Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 5.</ref>\n\nBut while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China.  In order to address the challenges of [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]], China has begun to blend traditions of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]] with Whitehead's \"constructive post-modern\" philosophy in order to create an \"ecological civilization.\"<ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\">\"China embraces Alfred North Whitehead\", last modified December 10, 2008, Douglas Todd, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', accessed December 5, 2013, http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2008/12/10/china-embraces-alfred-north-whitehead/.</ref>  To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of Whitehead's philosophy,<ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\" /><ref>\"About Us\", The Institute for the Postmodern Development of China, accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.postmodernchina.org/cgi/aboutUs.html</ref> and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students.<ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\" /> Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.<ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\" />\n\nOverall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize.  In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal [[Graduate school|graduate-level]] theology and philosophy programs.  Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself.<ref>\"Whitehead, Alfred North\", last modified May 8, 2007, Gary L.

Rescher is a proponent of both Whiteheadian [[process philosophy]] and American [[pragmatism]].]]\nHistorically Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of [[Americans|American]] [[Progressive Christianity|progressive theology]].<ref name=\"Bruce\" /><ref name=\"VictorLowe_e\" />  The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a [[theological]] context was [[Charles Hartshorne]], who spent a semester at [[Harvard]] as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's [[process philosophy]] into a full-blown [[process theology]].<ref>[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'', 2nd edition (Louisville, Westminster John Knox Press, 2007), 112.</ref>  Other notable process theologians include [[John B. Cobb]], Jr., [[David Ray Griffin]], [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]], [[C. Robert Mesle]], [[Roland Faber]], and [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]].\n\nProcess theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as [[impassibility|impassive]] or emotionless, process theologians view God as \"the fellow sufferer who understands\", and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events.<ref>Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 351.</ref>  Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God?<ref>[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 42–43.</ref>  Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world.  However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways.  C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a \"process naturalism\", i.e. a process theology without God.<ref>See part IV of [[C. Robert Mesle|Mesle]]'s ''Process Theology: A Basic Introduction'' (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1993).</ref>\n\nIn fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with [[poststructuralist]], [[postcolonialist]], and [[feminist]] theory. [[Charles Birch]] was both a theologian and a [[geneticist]]. [[Franklin I. Gamwell]] writes on theology and political theory. In ''Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age'', futurologists [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the [[participatory culture]] expected to dominate the digital era.\n\nProcess philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume [[State University of New York]] series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian [[David Ray Griffin]] displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.<ref>\"Search Results For: SUNY series in Constructive Postmodern Thought\", Sunypress.edu, accessed December 5, 2013, http://www.sunypress.edu/Searchadv.aspx?IsSubmit=true&CategoryID=6899.</ref>\n\nOne philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American [[pragmatism]]. Whitehead himself thought highly of [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]''.<ref name=\"AlfredNorth_f\" />  Charles Hartshorne (along with [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]]) edited the collected papers of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], one of the founders of pragmatism.  Noted [[neopragmatist]] [[Richard Rorty]] was in turn a student of Hartshorne.<ref>\"Richard Rorty\", last modified June 16, 2007, Bjørn Ramberg, ed. Edward N.

Bohm is one example of a scientist influenced by Whitehead's philosophy.<ref name=\"SeeDavid\">See [[David Ray Griffin]], ''Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986).</ref>]]\nIn recent years, Whiteheadian thought has become a stimulating influence in scientific research. [[Timothy E. Eastman]] and Hank Keeton's ''Physics and Whitehead'' (2004)<ref>Timothy E. Eastman and Hank Keeton, eds., ''Physics and Whitehead: Quantum, Process, and Experience'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004).</ref> and Michael Epperson's ''Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (2004) aim to offer Whiteheadian approaches to [[physics]], while Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and [[Dorion Sagan]]'s ''Beyond Mechanism'' (2013) and [[Rupert Sheldrake]]'s ''Science Set Free'' (2012) are recent examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology.\n\nIn physics, Whitehead's thought has had some influence. He articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]], see [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation]]. It has been severely criticized.<ref>[[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] (1979). Einstein and general relativity, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''47''': 212–217.</ref><ref>[[Clifford Martin Will|Will, C.M.]] (1981/1993).

They are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], his [[metaphysics]] of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field.  [[Henry Stapp]] and [[David Bohm]] are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.<ref name=\"SeeDavid\" />\n\nOther scientists for whom Whitehead's work has been influential include [[physical chemist]] [[Ilya Prigogine]], [[biologist]] [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], and [[geneticist]]s [[Charles Birch]] and [[Sewall Wright]].<ref name=\"Birch\">[[Charles Birch]], \"Why Aren't We Zombies?

Cobb]], Jr., whose book ''Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology'' (1971) was the first single-authored book in environmental ethics.<ref>\"History of Environmental Ethics for the Novice\", last modified March 15, 2011, The Center for Environmental Philosophy, accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.cep.unt.edu/novice.html.</ref>  Cobb also co-authored a book with leading [[Ecological economics | ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]]  [[Herman Daly]] entitled ''For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future'' (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to [[economics]], and received the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (1994), which aimed to challenge \"economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth.\"<ref>John B. Cobb, Jr., ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 1994), back cover.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nWhitehead is widely known for his influence in [[education theory]]. His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled ''Process Papers'' on [[process philosophy]] and education from 1996 to 2008.<ref>See ''Process Papers'', a publication of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education.  Volume 1 published in 1996, Volume 11 (final volume) published in 2008.</ref>  Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching.\n\nOne such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C. Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems.  As Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard put it: \"Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended.\"<ref>Daniel C. Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard, \"The Philosophy of the ANISA Model\", ''Process Papers'' 6, 38–39.</ref>\n\nAnother model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China. \"FEELS\" stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher.<ref>\"FEELS: A Constructive Postmodern Approach To Curriculum and Education\", Xie Bangxiu, JesusJazzBuddhism.org, accessed December 5, 2013, http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/feels.html.</ref>  It is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to \"help a person become whole.\" This work is in part the product of cooperation between Chinese government organizations and the Institute for the Postmodern Development of China.<ref name=\"blogs.vancouversun\" />\n\nWhitehead's philosophy of education has also found institutional support in Canada, where the [[University of Saskatchewan]] created a Process Philosophy Research Unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education.<ref>\"International Conferences – University of Saskatchewan\", University of Saskatchewan, accessed December 5, 2013, http://www.usask.ca/usppru/international-conferences.php.</ref>  Dr. Howard Woodhouse at the University of Saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of Whiteheadian education.<ref>[http://www.usask.ca/education/profiles/woodhouse/index.php \"Dr. Howard Woodhouse\"], University of Saskatchewan, accessed December 5, 2013</ref>\n\nTwo recent books which further develop Whitehead's philosophy of education include: ''Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education'' (2012) by George Allan; and ''The Adventure of Education: Process Philosophers on Learning, Teaching, and Research'' (2009) by Adam Scarfe.\n\n===Business administration===\nWhitehead has had some influence on philosophy of [[business administration]] and [[organizational theory]].  This has led in  part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers.<ref>Tor Hernes, ''A Process Theory of Organization'' (Oxford University Press, 2014)</ref>  One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and [[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialist]] stance towards [[management]] is Mark Dibben,<ref>Mark R.
