Although distinguished in his scholastic studies, he adhered to [[Gallicanism]] and [[Jansenism]] and was thus considered unsuitable for responsible office by Church authorities. He therefore pursued scientific studies and became royal professor of mathematics at Caen.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Yves Marie André}}</ref>\n\nHe is best known for his ''Essai sur le Beau'' (''Essay on Beauty''), a 1741 philosophical work on [[aesthetics]], which made him famous at the time and remained a well-known work into the 19th century.<ref>André, ''Essai sur le Beau'' in ''Œuvres Philosophiques'' (Paris: Adolphe Delahays, 1843).</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.org/details/oeuvresphilosop01andrgoog Œuvres Philosophiques du Père André] Collected works on the [[Internet Archive]]\n* [https://archive.org/details/EssayOnBeauty Essay on Beauty] Annotated English translation of ''Essai sur le Beau''\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Andre, Yves Marie}}\n[[Category:17th-century French Jesuits]]\n[[Category:French essayists]]\n[[Category:Jansenists]]\n[[Category:1675 births]]\n[[Category:1764 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century French Jesuits]]\n[[Category:17th-century French mathematicians]]\n[[Category:18th-century French mathematicians]]\n[[Category:French philosophers]]\n[[Category:French male writers]]\n[[Category:Male essayists]]\n[[Category:18th-century essayists]]\n\n\n{{RC-clergy-stub}}\n{{France-writer-stub}}\n{{France-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Yves Marie André"}}}}
