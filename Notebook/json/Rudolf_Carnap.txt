''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{IPA-de|ˈkaɐ̯naːp|lang}}; May 18, 1891 – September 14, 1970) was a German-born [[philosopher]] who was active in Europe before 1935 and in the United States thereafter. He was a major member of the [[Vienna Circle]] and an [[advocate]] of [[logical positivism]].  He is considered \"one of the giants among twentieth-century philosophers.\"<ref>[http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00004&toc.depth=1&toc.id= California Digital Library]</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n[[File:Wuppertal Ronsdorf - Villa Carnap 01 ies.jpg|thumb|Carnap's birthplace in Wuppertal]]\nCarnap's father had risen from the status of a poor ribbon-weaver to become the owner of a ribbon-making factory. His mother came from academic stock; her father was an educational reformer and her oldest brother was the archaeologist [[Wilhelm Dörpfeld]]. As a ten-year-old, Carnap accompanied his uncle on an expedition to Greece.<ref name=DCDVlife>{{cite book|last=Quine, W.V. and Rudolf Carnap|title=Dear Carnap, Dear Van: The Quine-Carnap Correspondence and Related Work|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA|page=23}}</ref> Carnap was raised in a religious family, but later became an atheist.<ref>\"Carnap had a modest but deeply religious family background, which might explain why, although he later became an atheist, he maintained a respectful and tolerant attitude in matters of faith throughout his life.\" Buldt, Bernd: \"Carnap, Paul Rudolf\", Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography Vol. 20 p.43. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008.</ref>\n\nHe began his formal education at the [[Barmen]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the [[University of Jena]], intending to write a thesis in physics. But he also studied carefully [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' during a course taught by [[Bruno Bauch]], and was one of very few students to attend [[Gottlob Frege]]'s courses in [[mathematical logic]]. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to [[World War I]], he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the [[University of Berlin]], 1917–18, where [[Albert Einstein]] was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the [[University of Jena]], where he wrote a thesis defining an [[axiom|axiomatic theory]] of [[space]] and time. The physics department said it was too philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian style, and published as ''Der Raum'' (\"Space\") in a supplemental issue of ''[[Kant-Studien]]'' (1922). In it he makes the clear distinction between ''formal,'' ''physical'' and ''perceptual'' (e.g., ''[[Visual space|visual]]'') spaces.\n\nFrege's course exposed him to [[Bertrand Russell]]'s work on logic and philosophy, which put a sense of the aims to his studies. He accepted the effort to surpass traditional philosophy with logical innovations that inform the sciences. He wrote a letter to Russell, who responded by copying by hand long passages from his ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' for Carnap's benefit, as neither Carnap nor his university could afford a copy of this epochal work. In 1924 and 1925, he attended seminars led by [[Edmund Husserl]],<ref>Smith, D. W., and Thomasson, Amie L. (eds.), 2005, ''Phenomenology and Philosophy of Mind''. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, p. 8 n. 18.</ref> the founder of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and continued to write on physics from a [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] perspective.\n\nCarnap discovered a kindred spirit when he met [[Hans Reichenbach]] at a 1923 conference. Reichenbach introduced Carnap to [[Moritz Schlick]], a professor at the [[University of Vienna]] who offered Carnap a position in his department, which Carnap accepted in 1926. Carnap thereupon joined an informal group of Viennese intellectuals that came to be known as the [[Vienna Circle]], directed largely by [[Moritz Schlick]] and including [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Otto Neurath]], and [[Herbert Feigl]], with occasional visits by Hahn's student [[Kurt Gödel]]. When [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] visited Vienna, Carnap would meet with him. He (with Hahn and Neurath) wrote the 1929 manifesto of the Circle, and (with [[Hans Reichenbach]]) initiated the philosophy journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]''.\n\nIn 1928, Carnap published two important books:\n*  ''The Logical Structure of the World'' (German: \"Der logische Aufbau der Welt\"), in which he developed a rigorous formal version of empiricism, defining all scientific terms in phenomenalistic terms. The formal system of the ''Aufbau'' (as the work is commonly termed) was grounded in a single primitive dyadic predicate, which is satisfied if \"two\" individuals \"resemble\" each other. The ''Aufbau'' was greatly influenced by [[Principia Mathematica]], and warrants comparison with the [[mereotopology|mereotopological]] metaphysics [[A. N. Whitehead]] developed over 1916–29. It appears, however, that Carnap soon became somewhat disenchanted with this book. In particular, he did not authorize an English translation until 1967.\n* ''Pseudoproblems in Philosophy'' asserted that many philosophical questions were meaningless, i.e., the way they were posed amounted to an abuse of language. An operational implication of this opinion was taken to be the elimination of [[metaphysics]] from responsible human discourse. This is the statement for which Carnap was best known for many years.\n{{see also|Carnap–Ramsey sentence}}\n\nIn February 1930 [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] lectured in Vienna, and during November 1930 Carnap visited Warsaw. On these occasions he learned much about Tarski's [[model theory|model theoretic]] method of [[semantics]]. [[Rose Rand]], another philosopher in the Vienna Circle, noted, \"Carnap's conception of semantics starts from the basis given in Tarski's work but a distinction is made between logical and non-logical constants and between logical and factual truth... At the same time he worked with the concepts of intension and extension and took these two concepts as a basis of a new method of semantics.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Rose|title=Reading Notes and Summaries on Works by Rudolph Carnap, 1932 and Undated|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/u/ulsmanuscripts/pdf/31735061817825.pdf|work=Rose Rand Papers|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\nIn 1931, Carnap was appointed Professor at the German language [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]]. There he wrote the book that was to make him the most famous [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] and member of the Vienna Circle, his ''Logical Syntax of Language'' (Carnap 1934). In this work, Carnap advanced his Principle of Tolerance, according to which there is not any such thing as a \"true\" or \"correct\" logic or language. One is free to adopt whatever form of language is useful for one's purposes. In 1933, [[W. V. Quine]] met Carnap in Prague and discussed the latter's work at some length. Thus began the lifelong mutual respect these two men shared, one that survived Quine's eventual forceful disagreements with a number of Carnap's philosophical conclusions.\n\nCarnap, whose [[socialism|socialist]] and [[pacifism|pacifist]] beliefs put him at risk in Nazi Germany, emigrated to the United States in 1935 and became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1941. Meanwhile, back in Vienna, [[Moritz Schlick]] was murdered in 1936. From 1936 to 1952, Carnap was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]]. During the late 1930s, Carnap offered an assistant position in philosophy  to [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], who accepted. The two conducted research including ''Logical Syntax''.<ref>{{cite web|last= Carnap|first=Rudolf|title=Rudolf Carnap Papers| url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/f/findaid/findaid-idx?c=ascead&cc=ascead&rgn=main&view=text&didno=US-PPiU-asp197401|publisher=Special Collections Department, University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=September 17, 2013 }}</ref> Thanks partly to Quine's help, Carnap spent the years 1939–41 at Harvard, where he was reunited with Tarski. Carnap (1963) later expressed some irritation about his time at Chicago, where he and [[Charles W. Morris]] were the only members of the department committed to the primacy of science and logic. (Their Chicago colleagues included [[Richard McKeon]], [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Charles Hartshorne]], and Manley Thompson.) Carnap's years at Chicago were nonetheless very productive ones. He wrote books on [[semantics]] (Carnap 1942, 1943, 1956), [[modal logic]], being very similar in Carnap (1956) to the now-standard [[possible worlds]] semantics for that logic [[Saul Kripke]] proposed starting in 1959, and on the philosophical foundations of [[probability]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] (Carnap 1950, 1952).\n\nAfter a stint at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], he joined the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy department at UCLA]] in 1954, [[Hans Reichenbach]] having died the previous year. He had earlier refused an offer of a similar job at the [[University of California]], because accepting that position required that he sign a loyalty oath, a practice to which he was opposed on principle. While at [[UCLA]], he wrote on scientific knowledge, the [[analytic statement|analytic]] – [[synthetic statement|synthetic]] dichotomy, and the [[verification principle]]. His writings on [[thermodynamics]] and on the foundations of probability and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], were published posthumously as Carnap (1971, 1977, 1980).\n\nCarnap taught himself [[Esperanto]] when he was 14 years of age, and remained sympathetic to it (Carnap 1963). He later attended the [[World Congress of Esperanto]] in 1908 and 1922, and employed the language while traveling.\n\nCarnap had four children by his first marriage to Elizabeth Schöndube, which ended in divorce in 1929. He married his second wife, Elizabeth Ina Stöger, in 1933.<ref name=DCDVlife /> Ina committed suicide in 1964.\n\n==Logical syntax==\nCarnap's ''Logical Syntax of Language'' can be regarded as a response to Wittgenstein 's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]''.\n\nCarnap elaborated and extended the concept of logical syntax proposed by [[Wittgenstein]] in the ''Tractatus'' (Section 3.325).\n\n{{ quotation | 3.325. In order to avoid such errors we must make use of a sign-language that excludes them by not using the same sign for different symbols and by not using in a superficially similar way signs that have different modes of signification: that is to say, a sign-language that is governed by logical grammar—by logical syntax. | Wittgenstein | Section 3.325, ''Tractatus'' }}\n\nHowever, Wittgenstein stated that propositions cannot represent logical form.\n\n{{ quotation | 4.121. Propositions cannot represent logical form: it is mirrored in them. What finds its reflection in language, language cannot represent. What expresses itself in language, we cannot express by means of language.\n\nPropositions show the logical form of reality. They display it. | Wittgenstein | Section 4.121, ''Tractatus'' }}\n\nCarnap disagreed. Wittgenstein proposed the idea of logical syntax. It is Carnap who designed, formulated and implemented the details of logical syntax in philosophical analysis. Carnap defined logical syntax as:\n\n{{ quotation | By the logical syntax of a language, we mean the formal theory of the linguistic forms of that language – the systematic statement of the formal rules which govern it together with the development of the consequences which follow from these rules.\n\nA theory, a rule, a definition, or the like is to be called formal when no reference is made in it either to the meaning of the symbols (for examples, the words) or to the sense of the expressions (e.g. the sentences), but simply and solely to the kinds and order of the symbols from which the expressions are constructed. | Carnap | Page 1, ''Logical Syntax of Language'' }}\n\nIn the U.S, the concept of logical syntax helped the development of [[natural language processing]] and [[compiler]] design.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===The purpose of logical syntax===\nThe purpose of logical syntax is to provide a system of concepts, a language, by the help of which the results of logical analysis will be exactly formulable.\n\nCarnap stated:\n{{ quotation | Philosophy is to be replaced by the logic of science – that is to say, by the logical analysis of the concepts and sentences of the sciences, for the logic of science is nothing other than the logical syntax of the language of science. | Carnap | Foreword, ''Logical Syntax of Language'' }}\n\n{{ quotation | According to this view, the sentences of metaphysics are pseudo-sentences which on logical analysis are proved to be either empty phrases or phrases which violate the rules of syntax. Of the so-called philosophical problems, the only questions which have any meaning are those of the logic of science. To share this view is to substitute logical syntax for philosophy. | Carnap | Page 8, ''Logical Syntax of Language'' }}\n\nCarnap wanted only to end metaphysics but not philosophy.\n\n==Rejection of metaphysics==\nCarnap, in his book ''Philosophy and Logical Syntax'', used the concept of verifiability to reject metaphysics.\n\n===The function of logical analysis===\nCarnap used the method of logical analysis to reject metaphysics.\n\n{{ quotation | '' The function of logical analysis is to analyse all knowledge, all assertions of science and of everyday life, in order to make clear the sense of each such assertion and the connections between them. One of the principal tasks of the logical analysis of a given proposition is to find out the method of verification for that proposition.   | Carnap , Page. 9-10 | '' ''Philosophy and Logical Syntax'' }}\n\n{{ cquote | The question is : What reasons can there be to assert this proposition; or: How can we become certain as to its truth or falsehood? }}\n\n==Primary source materials==\nThe Carnap Papers consist of approximately 10,000 personal letters of correspondence. The papers were donated by his daughter, Hanna Carnap-Thost in 1974.
