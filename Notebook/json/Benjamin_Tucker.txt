In 1872, while a student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Tucker attended a convention of the New England Labor Reform League in Boston, chaired by [[William B. Greene]], author of ''Mutual Banking'' (1850). At the convention, Tucker purchased ''Mutual Banking'', [[Josiah Warren]]'s ''True Civilization'' (1869), and a set of [[free-love]] anarchist [[Ezra Heywood]]'s pamphlets. Afterwards, Heywood introduced Tucker to Greene and Warren. All  three men would have a serious influence on Tucker's philosophical development. He also started a romantic correspondence with suffragette [[Victoria Woodhull]] around the same time, a relationship which lasted for three years.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nTucker made his editorial debut in libertarian circles in 1876, when Heywood published Tucker's English translation of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]'s classic work ''What is Property?''. In 1877, Tucker published his first original journal, ''Radical Review'', which ran for only four issues. From August 1881 to April 1908, he published the periodical, ''Liberty'', \"widely considered to be the finest individualist-anarchist periodical ever issued in the English language\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |title=Benjamin Tucker, ''Liberty'', and Individualist Anarchism |journal=The Independent Review |date=Winter 1998 |volume=II |issue=3 |page=421 |url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_02_3_mcelroy.pdf}}</ref>  In 1892, he moved the ''Liberty'' from Boston to New York.\n\n==Anarchism==\n{{Anarchism sidebar}}\nTucker said that he became an anarchist at the age of 18.<ref>Symes, Lillian and Clement, Travers. Rebel America: The Story of Social Revolt in the United States. Harper & Brothers Publishers. 1934. p. 156</ref> Tucker's contribution to American individualist anarchism was as much through his [[publishing]] as his own writing. Tucker was also the first to publish an English translation of [[Max Stirner]]'s ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''&nbsp;– which Tucker claimed was his proudest accomplishment. Tucker also translated [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s book ''[[God and the State]]''.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/godstate/index.htm at marxists.org]</ref> In the anarchist periodical ''[[Liberty (19th century magazine)|Liberty]]'', he published the original work of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Victor Yarros]], and [[Lillian Harman]] (daughter of the free love anarchist [[Moses Harman]]), as well as his own writing.\n\nHe also published [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s first original article to appear in the United States, and the first American translated excerpts of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. In ''Liberty'', Tucker both filtered and integrated the theories of such European thinkers as [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], the economic and legal theories of the American individualists [[Lysander Spooner]], [[William B. Greene]] and [[Josiah Warren]], and the writings of the [[Freethought|free thought]] and [[free love]] movements in opposition to religiously based [[legislation]] and prohibitions on non-invasive{{clarify|date=May 2012}} behavior. Through these influences Tucker produced a rigorous system of philosophical or [[individualist anarchism]] that he called ''Anarchistic-Socialism'',<ref>\"The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his “Wealth of Nations,” – namely, that labor is the true measure of price...Half a century or more after Smith enunciated the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it, and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new economic philosophy...This seems to have been done independently by three different men, of three different nationalities, in three different languages: Josiah Warren, an American; Pierre J.

Before Marxists established a hegemony over definitions of socialism, \"the term socialism was a broad concept.\" Tucker, as well as most of the writers and readers of Liberty, understood \"socialism\" to refer to one or more of various theories aimed at solving \"[[the labor problem]]\" through radical changes in the capitalist economy. Descriptions of 'the problem', explanations of it causes, and proposed solutions (for example, abolition of private property, cooperatives, state-ownership, and so on) varied among \"socialist\" philosophies.<ref>Brooks, Frank H. 1994.

Benjamin Tucker. ''Individual Liberty''<ref>[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-individual-liberty ''Individual Liberty'' by Benjamin Tucker]</ref>}}\n\n=== ''Liberty'' (1881–1908) ===\n{{Main|Liberty (1881–1908)}}\n[[File:Liberty OldPeriodical.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|''[[Liberty (1881–1908)]]'']]''Liberty'' was a nineteenth-century [[anarchism|anarchist]] periodical published in the United States by Benjamin Tucker, from August 1881 to April 1908. The periodical was instrumental in developing and formalizing the [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] philosophy through publishing essays and serving as a format for debate. Contributors included Benjamin Tucker, [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Auberon Herbert]], [[Dyer Lum]], [[Joshua K. Ingalls]], [[John Henry Mackay]], [[Victor Yarros]], [[Wordsworth Donisthorpe]], [[James L. Walker]], [[J. William Lloyd]], [[Florence Finch Kelly]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[John Beverley Robinson (anarchist)|John Beverley Robinson]], [[Jo Labadie]], [[Lillian Harman]], and [[Henry Appleton]]. Included in its masthead is a quote from [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre Proudhon]] saying that liberty is \"Not the Daughter But the Mother of Order.\"\n\n==The Four Monopolies==\n{{Libertarian socialism|People }}\n{{American socialism |expanded=People}}\nTucker argued that the poor condition of American workers resulted from four [[legal monopoly|legal monopolies]] based in authority:\n# the money monopoly\n# the land monopoly\n# [[tariff]]s\n# [[patent]]s\n\nHis focus, for several decades, became the state's economic control of how trade could take place, and what [[currency]] counted as legitimate. He saw interest and profit as a form of exploitation, made possible by the [[banking]] monopoly, which was in turn maintained through coercion and invasion. Tucker called any such interest and profit \"[[usury]]\" and he saw it as the basis of the oppression of the workers. In his words,\n{{quote|interest is theft, Rent Robbery, and Profit Only Another Name for Plunder.<ref>Martin Blatt, ''Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty''. Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 29</ref>}}\n\nTucker believed that usury was immoral; however, he upheld the right of all people to engage in immoral contracts.\n{{quote|Liberty, therefore, must defend the right of individuals to make contracts involving usury, rum, marriage, prostitution, and many other things which are believed to be wrong in principle and opposed to human well-being. The right to do wrong involves the essence of all rights.<ref>Benjamin R. Tucker, \"Right and Individual Rights,\" Liberty I (January 7, 1882): 3.</ref>}}\n\nHe asserted that anarchism is meaningless\n{{quote|unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market – that is, private property.}}\n\n===Land monopoly===\nHe acknowledged that \"anything is a product upon which human labor has been expended,\" but would not recognize full property rights to labored-upon land:\n{{quote|It should be noted, however, that in the case of land, or of any other material the supply of which is so limited that all cannot hold it in unlimited quantities, Anarchism undertakes to protect no titles except such as are based upon actual occupancy and use.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin, [http://fair-use.org/benjamin-tucker/instead-of-a-book/more-questions#art14n1 \"Instead of a Book\", p. 61, footnote.]</ref>}}\n\nTucker opposed granting title to land that was not in use; he argued that an individual should use land continually, in order to retain exclusive right to it. He believed that if this practice were not followed, there was a 'land monopoly'.\n\n===Money and banking monopoly===\nTucker also opposed state protection of the 'banking monopoly' – the requirement that one must obtain a charter to engage in the business of banking. He hoped to raise wages by deregulating the banking industry, reasoning that competition in banking would drive down interest rates and stimulate enterprise. Tucker believed this would decrease the proportion of individuals seeking employment, and wages would be driven up by competing employers. \"Thus, the same blow that strikes interest down will send wages up.\"<ref>[http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm] Libertarian Heritage No. 23. {{ISSN|0959-566X}} ISBN 1-85637-549-8, Libertarian Alliance, 2002.</ref>\n\nHe did not oppose individuals being employed by others, but due to his interpretation of the [[labor theory of value]], he believed that in the present economy individuals do not receive a wage that fully compensates them for their labor. He wrote that, if the four \"monopolies\" were ended,\n{{quote|it will make no difference whether men work for themselves, or are employed, or employ others. In any case they can get nothing but that wages for their labor which free competition determines.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin.

He believed that [[free trade]] would help keep prices low and therefore would assist laborers in receiving their \"natural wage\". Tucker did not believe in intellectual property rights in the form of patents, on the grounds that patents and copyrights protect something which cannot rightfully be held as property. He wrote that the basis for property is \"the fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to be used in different places at the same time.\"<ref>[http://praxeology.net/BT-AIC.htm \"The Attitude of Anarchism toward Industrial Combinations\"]</ref> Property in concrete things is \"socially necessary\":\n{{quote|since successful society rests on individual initiative, [it is necessary] to protect the individual creator in the use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use them without his consent.}}\n\nBecause ideas are not concrete things, they should not be held and protected as property. Ideas ''can'' be used in different places at the same time, and so their use should not be restricted by patents.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin: [http://praxeology.net/BT-AIC.htm The Attitude of Anarchism toward Industrial Combinations]</ref> This was a source of conflict with the philosophy of fellow individualist [[Lysander Spooner]], who saw ideas as the product of \"intellectual labor\" and therefore private property.<ref>Spooner, Lysander. [http://lysanderspooner.org/intellect/contents.htm The Law of Intellectual Property: or an essay on the right of authors and inventors to a perpetual property in their ideas.], Chapter 1, Section VI.</ref>\n\n===Yarros on Tucker===\nAccording to [[Victor Yarros]]: {{quote|He [Tucker] opposed savagely any and all reform movements that had paternalistic aims, and looked to the state for aid and fulfillment...For the same reason, consistent, unrelenting opposition to compulsion, he combated \"populism,\" \"greenbackism,\" the single-tax movement, and all forms of socialism and communism. He denounced and exposed [[Johann Most]], the editor of ''Freiheit'', the anarchist-communist organ. The end, he declared, could never justify the means, if the means were intrinsically immoral&nbsp;– and force, by whomsoever used, was immoral except as a means of preventing or punishing aggression.<ref name=\"Yarros\" />}}\n\n===Attitude towards unions===\nTucker rejected the legislative programs of labor unions, laws imposing a short day, minimum wage laws, forcing businesses to provide insurance to employees, and compulsory pension systems.<ref name=\"Yarros\"/> He believed instead that strikes should be organized by free workers rather than by bureaucratic union officials and organizations. He argued,\n{{quote|strikes, whenever and wherever inaugurated, deserve encouragement from all the friends of labour. . . They show that people are beginning to know their rights, and knowing, dare to maintain them.<ref>Benjamin Tucker, Liberty, 15/4/1881</ref>}}\n\nand furthermore,\n{{quote|as an awakening agent, as an agitating force, the beneficent influence of a strike is immeasurable. . . with our present economic system almost every strike is just. For what is justice in production and distribution? That labour, which creates all, shall have all.<ref>Benjamin Tucker, Liberty, #19, 1882</ref>}}\n\n===Anarchist society===\nTucker envisioned an individualist anarchist society as\n{{quote|each man reaping the fruits of his labour and no man able to live in idleness on an income from capital....become[ing] a great hive of Anarchistic workers, prosperous and free individuals [combining] to carry on their production and distribution on the cost principle.<ref>The Individualist Anarchists, p. 276</ref>}}\n\nrather than a bureaucratic organization of workers organized into rank and file unions. However, he did hold a genuine appreciation for labor unions (which he called \"trades-union socialism\"), and saw it as \"an intelligent and self-governing socialism\" saying, \"[they] promise the coming substitution of industrial socialism for usurping legislative mobism.\"<ref>The Individualist Anarchists, pp. 283–284</ref>\n\n==Private defense forces==\nTucker did not have a utopian vision of anarchy, where individuals would not coerce others.<ref name=\"Yarros\">{{cite journal| author = [[Victor Yarros]]| title = Philosophical Anarchism: Its Rise, Decline, and Eclipse| year=1936 | journal = [[The American Journal of Sociology]]|volume=41|issue=4|pages = 470–483| doi = 10.1086/217188}}</ref> He advocated that liberty and property be defended by private institutions. Opposing the monopoly of the state in providing security, he advocated a free market of competing defense providers, saying \"defense is a service like any other service; ... it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity, subject to the law of supply and demand.\"<ref>\"On Picket Duty.\" Liberty. July 30, 1887; 4, 26. p4.</ref>\n\nHe said that anarchism \"does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders.\"<ref>Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty'' October 19, 1891.</ref> Tucker expressed that the market-based providers of security would offer protection of land that was being used, and would not offer assistance to those attempting to collect rent:\n{{quote|'The land for the people' . . . means the protection by . . . voluntary associations for the maintenance of justice . . . of all people who desire to cultivate land in possession of whatever land they personally cultivate . . . and the positive refusal of the protecting power to lend its aid to the collection of any rent, whatsoever.<ref>quoted by Martin Blatt, Benjamin R. Tucker and the Champions of Liberty, Coughlin, Hamilton and Sullivan (eds.), p. 299</ref>}}\n\n==Embrace of \"egoism\"==\n{{Individualism sidebar}}\nTucker abandoned natural rights positions and converted to [[Max Stirner]]'s [[Egoist anarchism]]. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract.\" He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, \"In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off....Man's only right to land is his might over it.\"<ref>Tucker, Instead of a Book, p. 350</ref> In adopting Stirnerite egoism (1886), Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of ''Liberty'' in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, Liberty championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.\"<ref>[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1300&layout=html#chapter_100896 Wendy Mcelroy. \"Benjamin Tucker, Individualism, & Liberty: Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order\"]</ref> This led to a split in American Individualism between the growing number of Egoists and the contemporary Spoonerian \"[[Natural Law]]yers\". Tucker came to hold the position that no rights exist until they are created by contract. This led him to controversial positions such as claiming that infants had no rights and were the property of their parents, because they did not have the ability to contract. He said that a person, who physically tries to stop a mother from throwing her \"baby into the fire\", should be punished for violating her property rights. He said that children would shed their status as property, when they became old enough to contract \"to buy or sell a house\" for example, noting that the precocity varies by age and would be determined by a jury in the case of a complaint.<ref>McElroy, Wendy. 2003. The Debates of Liberty. Lexington Books. pp. 77–79</ref>\n\nHe also came to believe that aggression towards others was justifiable if doing so led to a greater decrease in \"aggregate pain\" than refraining from doing so. He said:\n\n{{quote|the ultimate end of human endeavor is the minimum of pain. We aim to decrease invasion only because, as a rule, invasion increases the total of pain (meaning, of course, pain suffered by the ego, whether directly or through sympathy with others). But it is precisely my contention that this rule, despite the immense importance which I place upon it, is not absolute; that, on the contrary, there are exceptional cases where invasion – that is, coercion of the non-invasive – lessens the aggregate pain. Therefore coercion of the non-invasive, when justifiable at all, is to be justified on the ground that it secures, not a minimum of invasion, but a minimum of pain. . . . [T]o me [it is] axiomatic – that the ultimate end is the minimum of pain<ref>\"Land Tenure Again.\" Liberty. October 19, 1895; 11, 12; p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nTucker now said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract.\" He also said, after converting to Egoist individualism, that ownership in land is legitimately transferred through force unless contracted otherwise. In 1892, he said \"In times past...it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off. Man's only right to land is his might over it. If his neighbor is mightier than he and takes the land from him, then the land is his neighbor's, until the latter is dispossessed by one mightier still.\"<ref>Benjamin R. Tucker, \"Response to 'Rights,' by William Hansen,\" ''Liberty'', December 31, 1892; 9, 18;\np. 1</ref>\n\nHowever, he said he believed that individuals would come to the realization that \"[[law of equal liberty|equal liberty]]\" and \"occupancy and use\" doctrines were \"generally trustworthy guiding principle of action,\" and, as a result, they would likely find it in their interests to contract with each other to refrain from infringing upon equal liberty and from protecting land that was not in use.<ref>Benjamin R. Tucker, \"The Two Conceptions of Equal Freedom,\" ''Liberty'', April 6, 1895; 10, 24; p. 4</ref> Though he believed that non-invasion, and \"occupancy and use as the title to land\" were general rules that people would find in their own interests to create through contract, he said that these rules \"must be sometimes trodden underfoot.\"<ref>Tucker, \"Land Tenure Again\"</ref>\n\nSeveral periodicals \"were undoubtedly influenced by ''Liberty'''s presentation of egoism. They included: ''I'' published by C.L. Swartz, edited by W.E. Gordak and J.W. Lloyd (all associates of ''Liberty''); ''The Ego'' and ''The Egoist'', both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German ''Der Eigene'', edited by [[Adolf Brand]], and ''The Eagle'' and ''The Serpent'', issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle 'A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"mcelroy\">McElroy, Wendy. [http://libertariannation.org/a/f62m1.html A Reconsideration of Trial by Jury], ''Forumulations'', Winter 1998–1999, Free Nation Foundation</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1906, he opened Tucker's Unique Book Shop in New York City – promoting \"Egoism in Philosophy, Anarchism in Politics, Iconoclasm in Art\". In 1908, a fire destroyed Tucker's uninsured printing equipment and his 30-year stock of books and pamphlets. Tucker's lover, Pearl Johnson – 25 years his junior – was pregnant with their daughter, Oriole Tucker. Six weeks after Oriole's birth, Tucker closed both ''Liberty'' and the book shop and retired with his family to France. In 1913, he came out of retirement for two years to contribute articles and letters to ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' which he called \"the most important publication in existence.\"\n\nLater Tucker became much more pessimistic about the prospects for anarchism. In 1926, [[Vanguard Press]] published a selection of his writings entitled ''Individual Liberty'', in which Tucker added a postscript<ref>[http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm#SSA.37 a postscript]</ref> to \"State Socialism and Anarchism\",<ref>[http://praxeology.net/BT-SSA.htm \"State Socialism and Anarchism\"]</ref> which stated\n{{quote|Forty years ago, when the foregoing essay was written, the denial of competition had not yet effected the enormous concentration of wealth that now so gravely threatens social order. It was not yet too late to stem the current of accumulation by a reversal of the policy of monopoly. The Anarchistic remedy was still applicable.}}\n\nBut, Tucker argued,\n{{quote|Today the way is not so clear. The four monopolies, unhindered, have made possible the modern development of the trust, and the trust is now a monster which I fear, even the freest banking, could it be instituted, would be unable to destroy. ... If this be true, then monopoly, which can be controlled permanently only for economic forces, has passed for the moment beyond their reach, and must be grappled with for a time solely by forces political or revolutionary. Until measures of forcible confiscation, through the State or in defiance of it, shall have abolished the concentrations that monopoly has created, the economic solution proposed by Anarchism and outlined in the forgoing pages – and there is no other solution...  [It] will remain a thing to be taught to the rising generation, that conditions may be favorable to its application after the great leveling. But education is a slow process, and may not come too quickly. Anarchists who endeavor to hasten it by joining in the propaganda of State Socialism or revolution make a sad mistake indeed.
