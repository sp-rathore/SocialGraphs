Callahan, like his great predecessor, [[Henry Hazlitt]], shows that it does. If the theme of Hazlitt's ''[[Economics in One Lesson]]'' is the indirect effects of intervention in the economy, Callahan's dominant thread is the role of monetary calculation in making possible cooperative activity on a vast scale.<ref>Gordon, David. \"Hazlitt For Our Time\". ''The Mises Review'', Vol. 8, No. 3. Fall 2002. Ludwig von Mises Institute.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to economist [[Richard Ebeling]], Callahan's book:\n<blockquote>...neatly explains why socialist central planning must inevitably result in failure because the abolition of private property, market competition, and money prices eliminates the institutional prerequisites for economic calculation, without which the central planner is left with no rational method to determine whether or not the resources under his control are being applied in an efficient manner.<ref>Ebeling, Richard. \"Book Review\".
