He is considered by some rock historians to be the first to write real analysis of Rock and Roll and is credited with inventing \"rock criticism\".<ref name=\"Writer Richard Meltzer\">{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/television/programs/artbeat/segment/writer-richard-meltzer/|publisher=''Oregon Public Broadcasting''|title=Writer Richard Meltzer|date=September 30, 2004|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nMeltzer claims that as a young man he was influenced by [[pop art]]ists [[Jasper Johns]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] as well as the artists [[Paul Cezanne|Cezanne]] and [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWDTRT3YhAk&nohtml5=False |title=Richard Meltzer Talks About Art, Artists and Life|date=6 April 2016 |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>  Meltzer's first book, ''[[The Aesthetics of Rock]]'', evolved out of his undergraduate studies in philosophy at [[Stony Brook University]] and graduate studies at [[Yale University]]. At school, he developed a reputation as something of a prankster, although his actions were closer to the spirit of performance art happenings promoted by one of his professors, [[Allan Kaprow]], than to fraternity hijinks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} One of his actions involved sending a tape recorder to class with his comments for the day on tape. Fellow student [[Sandy Pearlman]] was responsible for pushing the button. <!--[from W.F. a fellow student in the Philosophy Department] -- William enjoys telling this story.--> Meltzer also dabbled in art, including \"detourned\" comic books in the style of the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], which had various objects added to the pages.\n\nMeltzer, along with Sandy Pearlman and several other students, earned money on the side as booking agents for the big musical acts that came to Stony Brook in the 1960s. Following that, the two started writing lyrics and arranging gigs for a musical group they were promoting called Soft White Underbelly, later renamed [[Blue Öyster Cult]] (BÖC). Meltzer wrote the lyrics to many of the band's songs, including the hit \"[[Burnin' for You]]\".\n\nBÖC guitarist and keyboardist [[Allen Lanier]] is often credited with coming up with the [[metal umlaut|umlaut]] over the 'O', but Meltzer claims to have suggested it to producer and manager Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: \"I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] aspect anyway.\"\n\nMeltzer started his career in 1967 writing for [[Paul Williams (Crawdaddy! creator)|Paul Williams]]' ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'' magazine.  That year, he also taught a class in [[aesthetics]] at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]].  He went on to write for [[Rolling Stone]], [[Village Voice]] and [[Creem]].\n\nDuring the punk rock era, he formed a band called [[VOM (punk rock band)|VOM]] (short for \"Vomit\") and released a four-song, 7-inch EP that included \"Electrocute Your Cock\".  Meltzer also produced a movie, directed by Richard Casey, who later directed several Blue Öyster Cult videos.  Clips were filmed in Casey's apartment, [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], The Pike in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], and a beach-side sewage treatment plant in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], with future [[Mau Maus]] guitarist [[Mike R. Livingston]] pantomiming rhythm guitar along with Gregg Turner and bonze blayk (known at that time as \"Kevin Saunders\"), who were at that time organizing the [[Angry Samoans]] with [[Mike Saunders]], the drummer for VOM. The film for \"Electrocute Your Cock\" shows \"Halifax, NS\" t-shirt-clad Meltzer in the shower with jumper cables attached to his crotch, and sparks hand-drawn onto the film cels simulating electrocution. Also included was a beach-side clip for \"Punkmobile.\" The videos are included in The Angry Samoans' 1995 VHS compilation, ''True Documentary''.<ref name=truedoc>Angry Samoans, True Documentary. Triple X Records, 1995</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Meltzer dabbled in architectural criticism, writing a series of articles for the ''[[L.A. Reader]]'' alternative weekly on the ugliest buildings in Los Angeles; these pieces were later published as a book.  He moved to [[Portland, Oregon]] in the 1990s, but continued contributing to the ''[[San Diego Reader]]''. He was also a regular columnist for ''[[Addicted to Noise]]'', and by 2004 he was a contributor to a new weekly, ''[[Los Angeles CityBeat]]''.\n\nIn 2002 he released the CD ''Tropic of Nipples'' along with [[Smegma (band)|Smegma]], [[VOM (punk rock band)|VOM]], Antler and [[Robert Pollard]] of [[Guided by Voices]].\n\nHe has also performed and recorded over the past decade with the improvisational music group [[Smegma (band)|Smegma]].\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[The Aesthetics of Rock]]'' (1970)\n* ''Gulcher: Post-Rock Cultural Pluralism in America'' (1972)\n* ''17 Insects Can Die In Your Heart: Good verse and bad from Richard Meltzer's golden decade (1968–83)'' (1982)\n* ''Frankie, Part 1'' (Talltales Series) (1984)\n* ''Post-Natal Trash'' (Caned Out: The Authorized Autobiography of Richard Meltzer) (1984)\n* ''Prickly Heat and Cold'' (Caned Out Series) (1984)\n* ''Richard Meltzer's Guide to the Ugliest Buildings of Los Angeles'' (1984)\n* ''Frankie, Part 2'' (Talltales Series) (1987)\n* ''Boat Ride Down the Maguire'' (Caned Out Series) (1987)\n* ''L.A.
