He was [[bishop of Halberstadt]] from 1366 until his death.\n\n==Life==\nAlbert was born at [[Rickensdorf]] near [[Helmstedt]], the son of a farmer in a small village; but because of his talent, he was sent to study at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] and the [[University of Paris]].\n\nAt Paris, he became a master of arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the [[College of Sorbonne]], although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of [[Pope Urban V]] in [[Avignon]] as an envoy of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], in order to negotiate the founding of the [[University of Vienna]]. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector of this University in 1365.\n\nIn 1366, Albert was elected [[bishop of Halberstadt]] (counted as '''Albert III'''), Halberstadt being the diocese in which he was born. As Bishop of Halberstadt, he allied himself with [[Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], against [[Gebhard of Berg]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim]], and was taken prisoner by Gebhard in the [[battle of Dinckler]] in 1367.\n\nHe died at [[Halberstadt]] in 1390.\n\n==Philosophy==\nAlbert was a pupil of [[Jean Buridan]]<ref name=\"Clagett 522\"/> and was very much influenced by Buridan's teachings on physics and logic. As a natural philosopher, he worked in the tradition of John Buridan and contributed to the spread of Parisian natural philosophy throughout [[Italy]] and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined critical analysis of language with epistemological realism. Albert distinguishes, as Buridan did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible “in the common course of nature” and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God’s absolute power.  Albert refused to extend the reference of a physical term to supernatural, purely imaginary possibilities.  \nLater regarded as one of the principal adherents of [[nominalism]], along with his near contemporaries at Paris, John Buridan and Marsilius of Inghen, whose works are often so similar as to be confused with each other. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert’s work made him a better-known figure in some areas than more talented contemporaries like Buridan and [[Nicole Oresme]].\n\nAlbert's work in logic also shows strong influence by [[William of Ockham]], whose commentaries on the ''logica vetus'' (on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Aristotle]]'s ''Categoriae'' and ''De interpretatione'') were made the subject of a series of works called ''Quaestiones'' by Albert.\n\n[[File:Theory of impetus.svg|thumb|200px|thumb|Three stage [[Theory of impetus]] according to Albert von Sachsen]]\nAlbert of Saxony's teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The [[Theory of impetus]]<ref>Michael McCloskey: ''Impetustheorie und Intuition in der Physik.''. In: Spektrum der Wissenschaft: ''Newtons Universum'', Heidelberg 1990, ISBN 3-89330-750-8, S.18</ref> introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of [[Avicenna]].\n\n# Initial stage. Motion is in a straight line in direction of impetus which is dominant while gravity is insignificant\n# Intermediate stage. Path begins to deviate downwards from straight line as part of a great circle as air resistance slows projectile and gravity recovers.\n# Last stage. Gravity alone draws projectile downwards vertically as all impetus is spent.\n\nThis theory was a precursor to the modern theory of [[inertia]].\n\nAlthough Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert's ''Perutilis logica'' [c. 1360] was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham’s conception of the nature of a sign.  Albert believed that signification rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign.  Albert followed Ockham in his conception of universals and in his theory of supposition.  Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham’s notion of simple supposition: the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of categories and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of substance and quality.  Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination.  Albert’s treatment of relation was highly original.  Although, like Ockham, he refused to make relations into things distinct from absolute entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the soul by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other.  He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way.\n\nAlbert’s voluminous collection of ''Sophismata'' [c. 1359] examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of syncategorematic words- terms such as quantifiers and certain prepositions, which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the propositions in which they occur.  In his ''Sophismata,'' he followed [[William Heytesbury]].  In his analysis of epistemic verbs or of infinity, Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its terms: just like a syncategorematic word, a proposition signifies a “mode of a thing.”  Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining truth and in dealing with “insolubles” or paradoxes of self-reference.  In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false.\n\nAlbert also authored commentaries on ''Ars Vetus'' [c. 1356], a set of twenty-five ''Quaestiones logicales'' [c. 1356] that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and ''Quaestiones'' on the ''Posterior Analytics''.  Albert explored in a series of disputed questions the status of logic and semantics, as well as the theory of reference and truth.  Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of terminist logic in central Europe.  Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his ''Perutilis Logica''. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of logical deduction.\n\nBut it was his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''Physics'' that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert's Physics basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition in Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of [[William Heytesbury|Heytesbury]] and [[John Dumbleton]]. His commentary on Aristotle's ''De caelo'' was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan's commentary on this text. [[Blasius of Parma]] read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His ''Treatise on Proportions'' was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of [[Thomas Bradwardine|Bradwardine]] and [[Oresme]], it influenced the application of the theory of proportions to motion.\n\nAlbert’s commentaries on the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Economics'' also survive (both unedited), as well as several short mathematical texts, most notably ''Tractatus proportionum'' [c. 1353]. Although Albert studied theology in Paris, no theological writing survived.\n\nAlbert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan's teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert's own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. He knew how to construct proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.\n\n== Works ==\n*''Perutilis Logica Magistri Alberti de Saxonia'' (''Very Useful Logic''), Venice 1522 and [[Hildesheim]] 1974 (reproduction)\n*''Albert of Saxony's Twenty-Five Disputed Questions on Logic.
