The Sublime Object of Ideology. New York: Verso, 1989.</ref>\n#He begins with a critique of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s concept of ideology (as described in ''[[The German Ideology]]'') in which people are beholden to [[false consciousness]] that prevents them from seeing how things really are. Žižek argues, continuing Althusser, that ideology is thoroughly unconscious; and that ideology functions as a series of justifications and spontaneous socio-symbolic rituals which support virtual authorities.\n# However, [[the Real]] is not equivalent to the reality experienced by subjects as a meaningfully ordered totality. For Žižek, the Real names points within the ontological fabric, knitted by the hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, that nevertheless resist full inscription into its terms and that may as such attempt to generate sites of active political resistance.\n\nDrawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject, for Žižek the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is a purely negative entity, a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the cartesian Cogito (Transcendental Subject).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/><ref name=Sinnerbrink2008>{{cite journal|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|title=The Hegelian 'Night of the World': Žižek on Subjectivity, Negativity, and Universality|journal=International Journal of Žižek Studies|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/136|accessdate=17 August 2012|issn=1751-8229|quote=This extraordinary analysis of the transcendental imagination, critique of Heidegger, and rereading of Hegelian 'night of the world,' together contribute to Žižek's reassertion of the radicality of the 'Cartesian subject'—that thoroughly repudiated theoretical spectre which nonetheless continues to 'haunt Western academia' (1999: 1–5). This unorthodox reading of the Hegelian 'night of the world'—the radical negativity that haunts subjectivity—is developed further in an explicitly political direction, which helps explain Žižek's recent critique of the 'Fukuyamaian' consensus, shared both by moral-religious conservatives and libertarian 'postmodernists', that global capitalism remains the 'unsurpassable horizon of our times'.}}</ref> Žižek claims that though consciousness is opaque, following Hegel, that the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;<ref>{{Cite book|title = Umbr(a): The Object|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k7QbBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Umbr(a) Journal|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9780979953965|first = Tom|last = Eyers|first2 = Graham|last2 = Harman|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Johnston|first4 = Guy Le|last4 = Gaufey|first5 = Todd|last5 = McGowan|first6 = Duane|last6 = Rousselle|first7 = Jelica Šumič|last7 = Riha|first8 = Rado|last8 = Riha}}</ref> that the [[Kant's antinomies|antinomies]] of Kant, quantum physics, and Badiou's 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent (\"Barred\") Real itself that Lacan conceptualized prior.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FAqM5rxWWKwC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844679027|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Slavoj Žižek 2011.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|Žižek speaking in 2011]]\n\nŽižek argues that although there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively \"true\". Žižek identifies two instances of the Real: the abject Real (or \"real Real\"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a \"minimal difference\", the gap between the infinite judgement of a [[reductionism|reductionist]] materialism and experience as lived,<ref>Zizek, On Belief</ref> developing his thesis of the \"Parallax\" of dialectical antagonisms as inherent to reality itself, and developing [[Dialectical Materialism]] - contra [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] - as a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy (most notably in his ''magnum opus \"Less than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism\"'' (2012)'','' as well as ''\"Absolute Recoil: Towards a New Foundation of Dialectical Materialism\"'' (2014)).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XxYQCoaEU7AC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844678976|first = Slavoj|last = Žižek}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Absolute Recoil: Towards A New Foundation Of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i8xNBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2014-10-07|isbn = 9781781686836|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}</ref>\n\n===Political thought and the postmodern subject===\nŽižek argues that the state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term ''the law'' signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts.<ref>Žižek, ''For They Know Not What They Do''</ref>\n\nPolitical decisions for Žižek have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently \"objective\" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The [[two-party system]] dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion.<ref>''A Plea for Intolerance''</ref> Žižek says that it is still necessary to engage in [[Political particularism|particular]] conflicts—such as labor disputes—but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as ''metaphorical condensation'' for the system and its injustices. The real political conflict for Žižek is between an ordered structure of society and those without a place in it.<ref name=\"Ticklish Subject&nbsp;— Politics\">{{cite book|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: the absent centre of political ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=9781859848944|chapter=Political Subjectivization and Its Vicissitudes}}</ref>\n\nIn stark contrast to the intellectual tenets of the European \"universalist Left\" in general, and those [[Jürgen Habermas]] defined as postnational, in particular, Žižek spares no efforts in his clear and unequivocal defense of the pro-sovereignty and pro-independence processes opened in Europe.<ref>[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cihuwrieedr8s1j/44101916-LAPIKO-TXOSTENAK-ZIZEK.pdf Žižek: \"The force of universalism is in you Basques, not in the Spanish state\", Interview in ''ARGIA'' (27 June 2010)]</ref>\n\nŽižek argues that the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] subject is cynical toward official institutions, yet at the same time believes in conspiracies.

They draw their inspiration from the social theory of Marxism, and extend it to form a radical [[critique of capitalism]], contemporary politics, and neoliberalism in general. They advocate a withdrawal from, in Žižek's words, \"everyday material social life,\" and decry anyone who abandons the \"hypothesis of communism\" (Badiou) as resigning themselves to the market economy.<ref name=\"Skof\"/>\n\nFor [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]], an alternative path not trodden by thinkers like Žižek and Badiou is that of rethinking structural transformation and the construction of an alternative vision of social arrangements.<ref name=\"Skof\"/> Although Žižek and Unger have been compared for their mutual encounter with Hegel and Marx, as well as by their experience of engagement in the political life of their respective countries, for Unger, the lack of a clear vision of alternatives in contemporary thinkers like Žižek represents a betrayal of our most important attribute: our power to resist and to reshape the social and conceptual worlds in which we find ourselves.<ref name=\"Skof\"/>\n\nŽižek does not agree with his critics who attribute to him a belief in necessitationism and has stated:\n<blockquote>There is no such thing as the Communist [[big Other]], there's no historical necessity or [[teleology]] directing and guiding our actions.\" (In [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: \"''Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja''\".)<ref name=\"Interview_part_two\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn his book \"Living in the End Times\" Žižek acknowledges part of his critics of being ambiguous and multilateral in his positions.: <blockquote>[...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic ''and'' for spreading [[Zionism|Zionist]] lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist ''and'' unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror ''and'' for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom.\"<ref>Slavoj Žižek. \"Living in the End Times\".</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Unorthodox style and scholarship===\nCritics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them.<ref>See e.g. David Bordwell, \"Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything\", DavidBordwell.net blog, April 2005.[http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php]; Philipp Oehmke, \"Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show\".

Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context.<ref>Ian Parker, ''Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction'' (Pluto Press: London and Sterling, 2004) p.78-80. For example, Žižek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that \"the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire\" (Slavoj Žižek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, Žižek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.</ref> Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from the more problematic Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or \"slips-of-the-tongue.\" We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog,' and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.<ref>Noah Horwitz, \"Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel\" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&nbsp;24–32.</ref>\n\nIn a very negative review of Žižek’s magnum opus \"Less than Nothing\", the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek’s work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'<ref name=\"ViolentVisions\"/>\n\n===Accusations of plagiarism in 2014===\nŽižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of [[self-plagiarism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014, after Žižek published \nan op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.<ref name=\"Newsweek\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-self-plagiarized-new-york-times-269221|title=Slavoj Žižek On 'Self Plagiarism' in The New York Times: What's the Big Deal?|date=10 September 2014|publisher=}}</ref> In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\nOn 11 July 2014, leading American weekly newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the [[White Nationalist]] journal ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a publication condemned by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as the organ of a \"white nationalist hate group.\"<ref name=\"American_Renaissance_Plagiarism\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-marxist-philosophy-superstar-slavoj-zizek-plagiarize-white-nationalist-journal-258433 |title= Did Marxist Philosophy Superstar Slavoj Žižek Plagiarize a White Nationalist Journal?|work= Newsweek |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref> However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:\n<blockquote>When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin Macdonald's]]  theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of \"stealing ideas.\" I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Slavoj Žižek Sorta Kinda Admits Plagiarizing White Supremacist Journal|url=http://gawker.com/slavoj-zizek-sorta-kinda-admits-plagiarizing-white-supr-1604590014|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Online|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Praise, Criticism in Latin America===\nŽižek's studies has iluminated to many philosophical interrogations in Latin America which oscilated from politics of exploitation towards the functioning ideology within nationstate.<ref>Arditi, B.

His main thesis on Christianity reminds how the fall is not associated to any ethical fault, but to the perverse core of Christianity which does not eliminate the sin from the creation. In the Christology, Christ should be betrayed in order to becoming in God and live forever. Rather, Korstanje adds that Žižek did not the correct diagnosis because it is not the Christ` myth the founder of Capitalist system, but Noah`s Ark where God asks to his salved man to organize a real genocide. The universal flood, which is a myth enrooted in the core of Christianity and Judaism, appeals to mass-death as a platform of redemption dividing the world in two, victims and witnesses. Following this, if the medieval man lived to die, the modern citizens have developed a profound fear to death. Nowadays, the society or risk sets the pace to a new society, Thana Capitalism where death played a vital role as the many commodity and mediation between peoples and their institutions. The consumption of Others` death by means of TV, Programs, Journalism, Newspapers, Realities shows, or the visit to dark tourism sites, are valid indicators of the modern obsession for consuming mass-suffering or disasters. This means that people feel happier when others die because in that way they avoid to be touched by destiny. Beyond betrayal as Žižek said, the asymmetries of (Thana) Capitalism are legitimized by the introduction of [[social Darwinism]] where few hands have much while many die with nothing. Not only through media but through cultural entertainment, enjoying from other`s disgraces has situated as the main ideology of Thana Capitalism. The intersection of media with terrorism operates under this logic.Though news of terrorist attacks horrorize social imaginary, nobody can escape to their atractiveness.<ref>Korstanje M El Títere y El Enano: el núcleo perverso del Cristianismo.
