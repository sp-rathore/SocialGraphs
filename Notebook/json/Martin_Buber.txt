In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'', the central organ of the [[Zionist]] movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism.  In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (later translated into English as ''I and Thou''), and in 1925, he began translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into the [[German language]].\n\nIn 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]], but resigned from his professorship in protest immediately after [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933. He then founded the Central Office for Jewish Adult Education, which became an increasingly important body as the German government forbade Jews to attend public education. In 1938, Buber left Germany and settled in [[Jerusalem]], [[British Mandate for Palestine|Mandate Palestine]], receiving a professorship at [[Hebrew University]] and lecturing in [[anthropology]] and introductory [[sociology]].\n\nBuber was a direct descendant of the prominent 16th century rabbi [[Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen|Meir Katzenellenbogen]], known as the Maharam of [[Padua]], as was his cousin, cosmetics entrepreneur [[Helena Rubinstein]].

In 1896, Buber went to study in Vienna (philosophy, [[art history]], German studies, [[philology]]).\n\nIn 1898, he joined the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, participating in congresses and organizational work.  In 1899 while studying in [[Zürich]], Buber met his future wife, Paula Winkler, a \"brilliant Catholic writer from a Bavarian peasant family\" <ref>The Pity of It All: A History of Jews in Germany 1743-1933.

A [[Cultural Zionism|cultural Zionist]], Buber was active in the Jewish and educational communities of Germany and [[Israel]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 92}}  He was also a staunch supporter of a [[binational solution]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and after the establishment of the Jewish state of Israel, of a regional federation of Israel and Arab states. His influence extends across the humanities, particularly in the fields of [[social psychology]], [[social philosophy]], and [[existentialism|religious existentialism]].{{Sfn | Buber | 1996 | p = 34}}\n\nBuber's attitude towards [[Zionism]] was tied to his desire to promote a vision of \"Hebrew humanism\".<ref>{{cite book| last= Schaeder| first= Grete| title= The Hebrew humanism of Martin Buber|year=1973|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location= Detroit|isbn= 0-8143-1483-X| page =11}}</ref> According to Laurence J. Silberstein, the terminology of \"Hebrew humanism\" was coined to \"distinguish [Buber's] form of [[nationalism]] from that of the official Zionist movement\" and to point to how \"Israel's problem was but a distinct form of the universal human problem. Accordingly, the task of Israel as a distinct nation was inexorably linked to the task of humanity in general\".<ref>{{cite book|last= Silberstein|first= Laurence J | title= Martin Buber's Social and Religious Thought: Alienation and the quest for meaning | year = 1989 | publisher =New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-7886-0|page = 100}}</ref>\n\n== Zionist views ==\nApproaching Zionism from his own personal viewpoint, Buber disagreed with [[Theodor Herzl]] about the political and cultural direction of Zionism. Herzl envisioned the goal of Zionism in a nation-state, but did not consider [[Jewish culture]] or religion necessary. In contrast, Buber believed the potential of Zionism was for social and spiritual enrichment. For example, Buber argued that following the formation of the Israeli state, there would need to be reforms to Judaism: \"We need someone who would do for Judaism what [[Pope John XXIII]] has done for the Catholic Church\".<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hodes| first = Aubrey| title = Martin Buber: An Intimate Portrait | page = 174 |year= 1971|isbn= 0-670-45904-6|url= http://openlibrary.org/works/OL7021935W/Martin_Buber_an_intimate_portrait}}</ref> Herzl and Buber would continue, in mutual respect and disagreement, to work towards their respective goals for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn 1902 Buber became the editor of the weekly ''Die Welt'', the central organ of the Zionist movement. However, a year later he became involved with the Jewish [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] movement. Buber admired how the Hasidic communities actualized their religion in daily life and culture. In stark contrast to the busy Zionist organizations, which were always mulling political concerns, the Hasidim were focused on the values which Buber had long advocated for Zionism to adopt. In 1904, he withdrew from much of his Zionist organizational work and devoted himself to study and writing. In that year he published his thesis, ''Beiträge zur Geschichte des Individuationsproblems'', on [[Jakob Böhme]] and [[Nicholas of Cusa|Nikolaus Cusanus]].<ref name=\"Stewart2011\">{{cite book| first =Jon | last = Stewart|title = Kierkegaard and Existentialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFQWBkpEbwsC|date= 1 May 2011|publisher= Ashgate |isbn = 978-1-4094-2641-7 | page= 34}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1920s Martin Buber started advocating a [[Binational solution|binational]] Jewish-Arab state, stating that the Jewish people should proclaim \"its desire to live in peace and brotherhood with the Arab people and to develop the common homeland into a republic in which both peoples will have the possibility of free development\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/people/bios/buber.html |title=Jewish Zionist Education |publisher=Jafi | place = [[Israel|IL]] |date= May 15, 2005 |accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBuber rejected the idea of Zionism as just another national movement and wanted instead to see the creation of an exemplary society; a society which would not, he said, be characterized by Jewish domination of the Arabs. It was necessary for the Zionist movement to reach a consensus with the Arabs even at the cost of the Jews remaining a minority in the country. In 1925 he was involved in the creation of the organization [[Brit Shalom (political organization)|Brit Shalom]] (Covenant of Peace), which advocated the creation of a binational state, and throughout the rest of his life he hoped and believed that Jews and Arabs one day would live in peace in a joint nation. In 1942, he co‑founded the [[Ihud]] party which advocated a binationalist program. Nevertheless, he was connected with decades of friendship to Zionists and philosophers like [[Chaim Weizmann]], [[Max Brod]], [[Hugo Bergman]], and [[Felix Weltsch]], who were close friends of his from old European times in [[Prague]], [[Berlin]], and Vienna to the Jerusalem of the 1940s through the 1960s.\n\nAfter the foundation of [[Israel]] in 1948, Buber advocated Israel's participation in a federation of \"Near East\" states wider than just Palestine.<ref>{{cite book | chapter = We Need The Arabs, They Need Us! |last = Buber | first = Martin | title = A Land of Two Peoples | editor-first = Paul | editor-last = Mendes-Flohr | editor-link = Paul Mendes-Flohr |publisher = [[University of Chicago]] |origyear = 1954 |year = 2005 |isbn = 0-226-07802-7}}</ref>\n\n== Literary and academic career ==\n[[File:Martin-Buber-Haus Heppenheim.JPG|thumb|Martin Buber's house (1916–38) in [[Heppenheim]], Germany.

During that period he became the editor of ''[[Der Jude (magazine)|Der Jude]]'' (German for \"The Jew\"), a Jewish monthly (until 1924). In 1921, Buber began his close relationship with [[Franz Rosenzweig]].

Though he edited the work later in his life, he refused to make substantial changes. In 1925, he began, in conjunction with Franz Rosenzweig, translating the [[Hebrew Bible]] into German. He himself called this translation ''Verdeutschung'' (\"Germanification\"), since it does not always use literary German language, but instead attempts to find new dynamic (often newly invented) equivalent phrasing to respect the multivalent Hebrew original.  Between 1926 and 1930, Buber co-edited the quarterly ''Die Kreatur'' (\"The Creature\").<ref name = \"BuberBiemann2002\">{{cite book| first1= Martin | last1 = Buber| first2= Asher D | last2 = Biemann|title= The Martin Buber reader: essential writings | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BTzPiYZUIPwC|year= 2002|publisher= Palgrave Macmillan|isbn= 978-0-312-29290-4|page = 7}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Buber became an honorary professor at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]].

However, his work dealt with a range of issues including religious consciousness, modernity, the concept of evil, ethics, education, and Biblical hermeneutics.<ref name = \"Friedman1996\">{{cite book | first = Maurice S | last = Friedman | title =Martin Buber and the human sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFoU5LdDu6cC|date=July 1996|publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 978-0-7914-2876-4 |page= 186}}</ref>\n\nBuber rejected the label of \"philosopher\" or \"theologian\" claiming he was not interested in ideas, only personal experience, and could not discuss God but only relationships to God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vermes|first=Pamela|title=Buber|year=1988|publisher=Peter Hablan |location=London|isbn=1-870015-08-8|page = vii}}</ref>\n\n=== Dialogue and existence ===\nIn ''I and Thou'', Buber introduced his thesis on human existence. Inspired by [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]]'s ''Single One'', Buber worked upon the premise of existence as encounter.<ref>{{cite book| last =Buber | first = Martin|url= http://www.google.com/books?id=6fPU5xfv4SMC&pg=PA228 | title = Between Man and Man| publisher = Routledge | origyear = 1947 | year = 2002|pages=250–51}}</ref> He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es'' to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and [[being]] through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the gentile Christian Paul.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Langton|first1=Daniel|title=The Apostle Paul in the Jewish Imagination|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=67–71}}</ref> Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly how a person exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in ''I and Thou'', a person is at all times engaged with the world in one of these modes.\n\nThe generic motif Buber employs to describe the dual modes of being is one of dialogue (''Ich-Du'') and monologue (''Ich-Es'').<ref name = \"KramerGawlick2003\">{{cite book | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Kramer| first2= Mechthild | last2 = Gawlick| title= Martin Buber's I and thou: practicing living dialogue | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VgvSa1_l0BEC |date=November 2003|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn= 978-0-8091-4158-6| page = 39}}</ref> The concept of communication, particularly language-oriented communication, is used both in describing dialogue/monologue through metaphors and expressing the interpersonal nature of human existence.\n\n==== ''Ich-Du'' ====\n''Ich‑Du'' (\"I‑Thou\" or \"I‑You\") is a relationship that stresses the mutual, holistic existence of two beings. It is a concrete encounter, because these beings meet one another in their authentic existence, without any qualification or objectification of one another.  Even imagination and ideas do not play a role in this relation. In an I–Thou encounter, infinity and universality are made actual (rather than being merely concepts).<ref name = \"KramerGawlick2003\" />  Buber stressed that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship lacks any composition (e.g.,&nbsp;structure) and communicates no content (e.g.,&nbsp;information). Despite the fact that ''Ich‑Du'' cannot be proven to happen as an event (e.g.,&nbsp;it cannot be measured), Buber stressed that it is real and perceivable. A variety of examples are used to illustrate ''Ich‑Du'' relationships in daily life—two lovers, an observer and a cat, the author and a tree, and two strangers on a train. Common English words used to describe the ''Ich‑Du'' relationship include encounter, meeting, dialogue, mutuality, and exchange.\n\nOne key ''Ich‑Du'' relationship Buber identified was that which can exist between a human being and God. Buber argued that this is the only way in which it is possible to interact with God, and that an ''Ich‑Du'' relationship with anything or anyone connects in some way with the eternal relation to God.\n\nTo create this I–Thou relationship with God, a person has to be open to the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.\n\n==== ''Ich-Es'' ====\nThe ''Ich-Es'' (\"I‑It\") relationship is nearly the opposite of ''Ich‑Du''.<ref name=\"KramerGawlick2003\"/> Whereas in ''Ich‑Du'' the two beings encounter one another, in an ''Ich‑Es'' relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the \"I\" confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being in its presence and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant's theory of [[phenomenon]], in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent’s mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the ''Ich‑Es'' relationship is in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue.\n\nIn the ''Ich-Es'' relationship, an individual treats other things, people, etc., as objects to be used and experienced. Essentially, this form of objectivity relates to the world in terms of the self – how an object can serve the individual’s interest.\n\nBuber argued that human life consists of an oscillation between ''Ich‑Du'' and ''Ich‑Es'', and that in fact ''Ich‑Du'' experiences are rather few and far between. In diagnosing the various perceived ills of [[modernity]] (e.g.,&nbsp;isolation, dehumanization, etc.), Buber believed that the expansion of a purely analytic, material view of existence was at heart an advocation of ''Ich‑Es'' relations – even between human beings. Buber argued that this paradigm devalued not only existents, but the meaning of all existence.\n\n==== Note on translation ====\n''Ich und Du'' has been translated from the original German into many other languages. However, because Buber's use of German was highly idiomatic and often unconventional, there has naturally been debate on how best to convey the complex messages in his text. One critical debate in the English-speaking world has centered on the correct translation of the key word pairs ''Ich-Du'' and ''Ich-Es''. In the German the word \"Du\" is used, while in the English two different translations are used: \"Thou\" (used in Ronald Smith’s version) and \"You\" (used by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]). The key problem is how to translate the very personal, even intimate German \"Du\", which has no direct equivalent in Modern English. Smith argued that \"Thou\" invokes the theological and reverential implications which Buber intended (e.g.,&nbsp;Buber describes God as the eternal \"Du\"). Kaufmann asserted that this wording was archaic and impersonal, offering \"You\" because (like the German ''Du'') it has colloquial usage in intimate conversation.\n\nDespite this debate, Buber’s book is widely known in the English-speaking world as ''I and Thou'', perhaps because Smith's translation appeared years before Kaufmann's. However, both translations are widely available.\n\n== Hasidism and mysticism ==\nBuber was a scholar, interpreter, and translator of Hasidic lore. He viewed Hasidism as a source of cultural renewal for Judaism, frequently citing examples from the Hasidic tradition that emphasized community, interpersonal life, and meaning in common activities (e.g.,&nbsp;a worker's relation to his tools). The Hasidic ideal, according to Buber, emphasized a life lived in the unconditional presence of God, where there was no distinct separation between daily habits and religious experience. This was a major influence on Buber's philosophy of anthropology, which considered the basis of human existence as dialogical.\n\nIn 1906, Buber published ''Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman'', a collection of the tales of the [[Rabbi]] [[Nachman of Breslov]], a renowned Hasidic ''[[rebbe]]'', as interpreted and retold in a [[Neo‐Hasidism|Neo-Hasidic]] fashion by Buber. Two years later, Buber published ''Die Legende des Baalschem'' (stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]), the founder of Hasidism.<ref name=\"Zank2006\" />\n\nBuber's interpretation of the Hasidic tradition, however, has been criticized by [[Chaim Potok]] for its romanticization. In the introduction to Buber's ''[[Tales of the Hasidim]]'', Potok notes that Buber overlooked Hasidism's \"charlatanism, obscurantism, internecine quarrels, its heavy freight of folk superstition and pietistic excesses, its [[tzadik]] worship, its vulgarized and attenuated reading of Lurianic Kabbalah.\" Even more severe is the criticism that Buber deemphasized the importance of the Jewish Law in Hasidism.\n\n== Awards ==\n* In 1951, Buber received the [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] award of the [[University of Hamburg]].\n* In 1953, he received the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]].\n* In 1958, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in the humanities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Recipients |year=1958 |language=Hebrew |publisher=Israel Prize |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5mqejxurH |archivedate=January 17, 2010 |deadurl=unfit }}</ref>\n* In 1961, he was awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for Jewish thought.<ref name=bialik>{{cite web|title = List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933–2004 | language = Hebrew | publisher = Tel Aviv Municipality |url = http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf | format = [[PDF]]}}</ref>\n* In 1963, he won the [[Erasmus Prize]] in [[Amsterdam]].\n\n== Printed works ==\n\n=== Original writings (German) ===\n{{Div col}}\n* ''Die Geschichten des Rabbi Nachman'' (1906)\n* ''Die fünfzigste Pforte'' (1907)\n* ''Die Legende des Baalschem'' (1908)\n* ''Ekstatische Konfessionen'' (1909)\n* ''Chinesische Geister- und Liebesgeschichten'' (1911)\n* ''Daniel – Gespräche von der Verwirklichung'' (1913)\n* ''Die jüdische Bewegung – gesammelte Aufsätze und Ansprachen 1900–1915'' (1916)\n* ''Vom Geist des Judentums – Reden und Geleitworte'' (1916)\n* ''Die Rede, die Lehre und das Lied – drei Beispiele'' (1917)\n* ''Ereignisse und Begegnungen'' (1917)\n* ''Der grosse Maggid und seine Nachfolge''(1922)\n* ''Reden über das Judentum'' (1923)\n* ''[[I and Thou|Ich und Du]]'' (1923)\n** Translation: ''[[I and Thou]]'' by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (Touchstone: 1970)\n* ''Das Verborgene Licht'' (1924)\n* ''Die chassidischen Bücher'' (1928)\n* ''Aus unbekannten Schriften'' (1928)\n* ''Zwiesprache'' (1932)\n* ''Kampf um Israel – Reden und Schriften 1921–1932'' (1933)\n* ''Hundert chassidische Geschichten'' (1933)\n* ''Die Troestung Israels : aus Jeschajahu, Kapitel 40 bis 55'' (1933); with Franz Rosenzweig\n* ''Erzählungen von Engeln, Geistern und Dämonen'' (1934)\n* ''Das Buch der Preisungen'' (1935); with Franz Rosenzweig\n* ''Deutung des Chassidismus – drei Versuche'' (1935)\n* ''Die Josefslegende in aquarellierten Zeichnungen eines unbekannten russischen Juden der Biedermeierzeit'' (1935)\n* ''Die Schrift und ihre Verdeutschung'' (1936); with Franz Rosenzweig\n* ''Aus Tiefen rufe ich Dich – dreiundzwanzig Psalmen in der Urschrift'' (1936)\n* ''Das Kommende : Untersuchungen zur Entstehungsgeschichte des Messianischen Glaubens – 1.
