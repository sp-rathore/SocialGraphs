He is best known for his 2002 book ''Postmodern Anarchism'', which develops an account of [[postmodern]] [[anarchism]] through philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[cyberpunk]] writers such as  [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]].<ref name=pa>{{cite book |last=Call |first=Lewis |title=Postmodern Anarchism |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lexington |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7391-0522-1 }}</ref> Call has written extensively on the intersection of post-anarchism and [[science fiction]], covering philosophers and authors such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Octavia Butler]], [[Samuel R. Delany]] and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]].\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nCall graduated with a B.A. from [[University of California, San Diego]] followed by an M.A. and Ph.D. in Modern European History from the [[University of California, Irvine]], finishing his studies in 1996.  His doctoral dissertation was titled, ''Nietzsche as Critic and Captive of Enlightenment''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrye.com/~station/dissertation.html |title=Lewis Call - Nietzsche as Critic and Captive of Enlightenment|last=Call |first=Lewis}}</ref> He is an Associate Professor in the History Department of [[California Polytechnic State University]] in [[San Luis Obispo]], where he teaches intellectual history, [[political economy]] and the history of network technology. Call also holds the position of Associate Editor of ''[[Anarchist Studies]]'', an international journal of anarchist theory. He received the Distinguished Lecturer Award from the California Faculty Association (California Polytechnic chapter) in 2005, and his paper \"’Sounds Like Kinky Business to Me’: Subtextual and Textual Representations of Erotic Power in the Buffyverse\" won ''Slayage'' journal's 2008 Mr. Pointy Award for [[Buffy studies]] Scholarship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slayageonline.com/Mr_Pointy/mrpointy_winners_2008.htm |title=Mr. Pointy Award Nominations, 2008 |accessdate=February 27, 2009 |work=Slayage}}</ref> Call is a dedicated practitioner of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]].<ref name=pa/>\n\n== Thought ==\n{{details|Post-anarchism}}\nCall is credited along with [[Saul Newman]] and [[Todd May]]  with developing postanarchism from its roots in French [[postmodern]] and classical [[anarchist thought]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Power, Subjectivity, Resistance:Three Works on Postmodern Anarchism |journal=New Formulation |volume=2 |issue=2 |date=Winter–Spring 2004}}</ref> Call has attempted to develop post-anarchist theory through the work of Friedrich Nietzsche, rejecting the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] concept of the \"[[subject (philosophy)|subject]]\". From here a radical form of anarchism is made possible; the anarchism of [[process philosophy|becoming]]. This anarchism does not have an eventual goal, nor flow into \"being\", it is not a final state of development, nor a static form of society, but rather becomes permanent, as a means without end. Call critiques [[Liberalism|liberal]] notions of language, consciousness, and rationality from an anarchist perspective, arguing that they are inherent in economic and political power within the capitalist state organization.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Martin |first=Edward J. |title=Call, Lewis Postmodern Anarchism |journal=Perspectives on Political Science |date=June 2003}}</ref>\n\nCall's other research interests include intellectual history, [[science fiction studies]], and the history of erotic power.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n*{{cite book|title=Postmodern Anarchism |year=2002 |location=Lexington |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=978-0-7391-0522-1}}\n*{{cite journal|title=Structures of Desire:  Erotic Power in the Speculative Fiction of Octavia Butler and Samuel Delany |journal=Rethinking History |volume=9 |issue=2/3 |date=June–September 2005}}\n*{{cite journal|title=Anarchy in the Matrix: Postmodern Anarchism in the Novels of William Gibson and Bruce Sterling |journal=Anarchist Studies |volume=7 |issue=2}}\n*{{cite journal|title=A brief history of Anarchist Studies (so far) |journal=Anarchist Studies |volume=15 |issue=2}}\n*{{cite journal|title=Postmodern Anarchism in the Novels of Ursula K.
