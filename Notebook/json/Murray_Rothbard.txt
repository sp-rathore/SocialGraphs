Paralleling Skousen's remarks, Hans-Hermann Hoppe laments the fact that all non-Misesian economists dismiss the Misesian approach, which both he and Rothbard embraced, as \"dogmatic and unscientific\".\n\nRothbard wrote extensively on [[Austrian Business Cycle Theory]] and as part of this approach, strongly opposed [[central banking]], [[fiat money]], and [[fractional-reserve banking]] and advocated a [[gold standard]] and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.<ref name=\"Mystery\" />{{rp|pages=89–94, 96–97}}<ref name=\"Gordon\"/><ref name=\"golddollar\">{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/1829 |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar |year=1991 |origyear=1962 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north769.html |title=What Is Money?

Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective, and opposed [[utilitarianism]] in favor of principle-based, [[natural law]] reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. Rothbard, on the other hand, concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market.<ref name=\"Essential\" />{{rp|pages=87–89}} He called this principle \"[[self-ownership]],\" loosely basing the idea on the writings of [[John Locke]]<ref>Olsaretti, Serena. 2004.

He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted he or she should not be held in prison or jails, writing \"except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction—all should be subject to the universal law.\" Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/tyranny-government-courts-and-prisons|title=The Tyranny of Government Courts and Prisons|last=anne|date=2011-04-10|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\nIn ''The Ethics of Liberty'', Rothbard advocates for a \"frankly retributive theory of punishment\" or a system of \"a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp |chapter=Punishment and Proportionality |pages=85–97 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3}}</ref> Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that \"the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his\".<ref name=\":6\">Morimura, Susumu (1999). \"Libertarian theories of punishment.\" In P.

Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000, and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be \"put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim\" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.\n\n====Torture of criminal suspects====\nIn chapter twelve of ''Ethics'',<ref name=SelfDefense>{{cite book |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77–84 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3}}</ref> Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.<ref name=\"Callahan\" /> He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard, \"Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault\".<ref name=SelfDefense/> Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect, after having tortured him or her.<ref name=\"Callahan\" />\n\n===Science and scientism===\nIn an essay condemning \"[[scientism]] in the study of man\", Rothbard rejected the application of [[causal determinism]] to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings, as opposed to those of everything else in nature, are not determined by prior causes but by \"[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]]\".<ref>Rothbard, Murray (1960).
