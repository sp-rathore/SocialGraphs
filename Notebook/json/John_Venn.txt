Henry Venn]], who was the rector of the parish of Drypool. His mother died when he was three years old.{{sfn|Famous-mathematicians.com}} Venn was descended from a long line of [[Evangelicalism|church evangelicals]], including his grandfather [[John Venn (1759–1813)|John Venn]].{{sfn|School of Mathematics|2003}}Venn was brought up in a very strict atmosphere at home. His father Henry had played a significant part in the Evangelical movement and he was also the secretary of the ‘Society for Missions to Africa and the East’.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nHe began his education in [[London]] joining Sir Roger Cholmeley's School,<ref>Highgate School Roll 1833–1912, Unwin Brothers Ltd 1913</ref> now known as [[Highgate School]], with his brother Henry in September 1846. He moved on to Islington proprietary school and in October 1853 he went to [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].{{sfn|Gibbins|2004}}{{sfn|Duignan|2014}} In 1857, he obtained his degree in mathematics and became a fellow. In 1903 he was elected President of the College, a post he held until his death.{{sfn|Duignan|2014}} He would follow his family vocation and become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, ordained in 1859, serving first at the church in [[Cheshunt]], Hertfordshire, and later in [[Mortlake]], Surrey.{{sfn|Soylent Communications|2014}}\n\nIn 1862, he returned to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] as a lecturer in moral science, studying and teaching logic and probability theory, and, beginning around 1869, giving intercollegiate lectures. These duties led to his developing the diagram which would eventually bear his name.\n\n{{Quote|I began at once somewhat more steady work on the subjects and books which I should have to lecture on. I now first hit upon the diagrammatical device of representing propositions by inclusive and exclusive circles. Of course the device was not new then, but it was so obviously representative of the way in which any one, who approached the subject from the mathematical side, would attempt to visualise propositions, that it was forced upon me almost at once.|John Venn{{sfn|Edwards|2004}}}}\n\nIn 1868, he married Susanna Carnegie Edmonstone with whom he had one son, [[John Archibald Venn]].\n\nIn 1883, he resigned from the clergy, having concluded that [[Anglicanism]] was incompatible with his philosophical beliefs.{{sfn|Duignan|2014}} In that same year, Venn was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and was awarded a [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]] by Cambridge.\n\nHe died on 4 April 1923.\n\n== Memorials ==\n* Venn is commemorated at the [[University of Hull]] by the Venn Building, built in 1928\n* A [[stained glass]] window in the dining hall of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], commemorates Venn's work.\n* In commemoration of the 180th anniversary of Venn's birth, on 4 August 2014,  Google replaced its normal logo on global search pages with an interactive and animated [[Google logo#Interactive and video doodles|Google doodle]] that incorporated the use of a Venn diagram.{{sfn|Antonimuthu|2014}}\n* In 1866, Venn published The Logic of Chance, a ground-breaking book which espoused the frequency theory of probability, offering that probability should be determined by how often something is forecast to occur as opposed to “educated” assumptions. Venn then further developed George Boole's theories in the 1881 work Symbolic Logic, where he highlighted what would become known as Venn diagrams.\n\n== Publications ==\nVenn compiled ''[[Alumni Cantabrigienses]]'', a biographical register of former members of the [[University of Cambridge]].{{sfn|Venn|1922|p=}} This work is still being updated online, see [[#External links]], below.
