It's no fun being an atheist.\"<ref>https://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/bloom_hartman/bloom/bloom.html</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\n\n===Defense of Romanticism===\nBloom began his career by defending the reputations of the High Romantics through a sequence of highly regarded monographs beginning with his Doctoral Dissertation on [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], (''Shelley's Myth-making'', [[Yale University Press]]), [[W. B. Yeats]], (''Yeats'', [[Oxford University Press]]), and [[Wallace Stevens]], (''Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate'', [[Cornell University Press]]) against [[Christianity|neo-Christian]] critics influenced by such writers as [[T. S. Eliot]], who became a recurring intellectual foil. He had a contentious approach: his first book, ''Shelley's Myth-making'', charged many contemporary critics with sheer carelessness in their reading of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]].\n\n===Influence theory===\n\nAfter a personal crisis in the late sixties, Bloom became deeply interested in Emerson, [[Sigmund Freud]], and the ancient mystic traditions of [[Gnosticism]], [[Kabbalah]], and [[Hermeticism]]. In a 2003 interview with Bloom, Michael Pakenham, the book editor for [[The Baltimore Sun]], writes that Bloom has long referred to himself as a \"Jewish Gnostic\". Bloom explains: \"I am using Gnostic in a very broad way. I am nothing if not Jewish... I really am a product of Yiddish culture. But I can't understand a Yahweh, or a God, who could be all-powerful and all knowing and would allow the Nazi death camps and schizophrenia.\"<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = In Full Bloom: Guerrilla In Our Midst\n  |last = Pakenham\n  |first = Michael\n  |website = [[The Baltimore Sun]]\n  |date = March 23, 2003\n  |accessdate = September 15, 2016\n  |url = http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-03-23/entertainment/0303240442_1_bloom-dining-room-table\n  |ref = harv\n}}</ref> Influenced by his reading, he began a series of books that focused on the way in which poets struggled to create their own individual poetic visions without being overcome by the influence of the previous poets who inspired them to write.\n\t\nThe first of these books, ''Yeats'', a magisterial examination of [[William Butler Yeats|the poet]], challenged the conventional critical view of his poetic career. In the introduction to this volume, Bloom set out the basic principles of his new approach to criticism: \"Poetic influence, as I conceive it, is a variety of melancholy or the anxiety-principle.\" A new poet becomes inspired to write because he has read and admired the poetry of previous poets; but this admiration turns into resentment when the new poet discovers that these poets whom he idolized have already said everything he wishes to say. The poet becomes disappointed because he \"cannot be [[Adam]] early in the morning. There have been too many Adams, and they have named everything.\"\n\t\nIn order to evade this psychological obstacle, the new poet must convince himself that previous poets have gone wrong somewhere and failed in their vision, thus leaving open the possibility that he may have something to add to the tradition after all. The new poet's love for his heroes turns into antagonism towards them: \"Initial love for the precursor's poetry is transformed rapidly enough into revisionary strife, without which individuation is not possible.\"<ref>''Map of Misreading'' p. 10</ref> The book that followed ''Yeats'', ''[[The Anxiety of Influence]]'', which Bloom had started writing in 1967, drew upon the example of [[Walter Jackson Bate]]'s ''The Burden of the Past and The English Poet'' and recast in systematic psychoanalytic form Bate's historicized account of the despair felt by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century poets about their ability to match the achievements of their predecessors. Bloom attempted to trace the psychological process by which a poet broke free from his precursors to achieve his own poetic vision. He drew a sharp distinction between \"strong poets\" who perform \"strong misreadings\" of their precursors, and \"weak poets\" who simply repeat the ideas of their precursors as though following a kind of doctrine. He described this process in terms of a sequence of \"revisionary ratios,\" through which each strong poet passes in the course of his career. ''A Map of Misreading'' picked up where ''The Anxiety of Influence'' left off, making several adjustments to Bloom's system of revisionary ratios. ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' attempted to invoke the esoteric interpretive system of the [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], as explicated by scholar [[Gershom Scholem]], as an alternate system of mapping the path of poetic influence. ''Figures of Capable Imagination'' collected odd pieces Bloom had written in the process of composing his 'influence' books. He capped off this period of intense creativity with another monograph, a full-length study of [[Wallace Stevens]], with whom he identified more than any other poet at this stage of his career, as he told an interviewer in the early 1980s.{{Who|date=January 2009}}\n\t\nBloom continued to write about influence theory throughout the seventies and eighties, and he has written little since that does not invoke his ideas about influence.\n\n===Novel experiment===\n\nBloom's fascination with the fantasy novel ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]] led him to take a brief break from criticism in order to compose a sequel to Lindsay's novel. This novel, ''[[The Flight to Lucifer]]'', remains Bloom's only work of fiction.<ref name=\"The Violet Apple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.violetapple.org.uk/notes/bloom_flighttolucifer.php|title=The Flight to Lucifer review|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> Though reviews were very positive,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} he soon disowned this book. He believed his self-consciousness weighed it down too heavily. He has said that he would remove every copy of the book from every library if he could.\n\n===Religious criticism===\nBloom then entered a phase of what he called \"religious criticism\", beginning in 1989 with ''Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and Belief from the Bible to the Present''.\n\nIn ''The Book of J'' (1990), he and [[David Rosenberg (poet)|David Rosenberg]] (who translated the Biblical texts) portrayed one of the posited ancient documents that formed the basis of the first five books of the bible (see [[documentary hypothesis]]) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a [[dogmatic]]ally religious work (see [[Jahwist]]). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings [[David]] and [[King Solomon|Solomon]]—a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations didn't go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical [[Bathsheba]].<ref>Bloom, Harold, ''The Western Canon. The Books and Schools of the Ages'', Harcourt Brace & Company, New York 1994, p. 5.</ref> In ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in ''The Book of J'' in discussing the significance of [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and [[Jesus of Nazareth]] as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of [[Christianity and Judaism]].\n\nIn ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), Bloom surveyed the major varieties of [[Protestant]] and post-Protestant religious faiths that originated in the United States and argued that, in terms of their psychological hold on their adherents, most shared more in common with [[gnosticism]] than with historical Christianity. The exception was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whom Bloom regards as non-Gnostic. He elsewhere predicted that the [[Mormon]] and [[Pentecostal]] strains of [[American Christianity]] would overtake mainstream Protestant divisions in popularity in the next few decades.  In ''Omens of Millennium'' (1996), Bloom identifies these American religious elements as on the periphery of an old – and not inherently Christian – gnostic, religious tradition which invokes a complex of ideas and experiences concerning [[angelology]], interpretation of dreams as [[prophecy]], [[near-death experience]]s, and [[millennialism]].<ref>Bloom (1996), p. 5.</ref>\n\nIn his essay in ''The Gospel of Thomas'', Bloom states that none of Thomas' Aramaic sayings have survived to this day in the original language.<ref>Bloom, Harold. \"A Reading\" The Gospel of Thomas: The Hidden Sayings of Jesus. English translation and critical edition of the Coptic text by Marvin W. Meyer. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco. 1992. p 115and p. 119.</ref> [[Marvin Meyer]] generally agreed and further confirmed that the earlier versions of that text were likely written in either Aramaic or Greek.<ref>Mayer, Marvin. \"Introduction\". The Gospel of Thomas. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 1992. p 9.</ref> Meyer ends his introduction with an endorsement of much of Bloom's essay.<ref>Meyer, op. cit., p 19.</ref> Bloom notes the other-worldliness of the Jesus in the Thomas sayings by making reference to \"the paradox also of the American Jesus.\"<ref>Meyer, op. cit., p. 119.</ref>\n\n===The Western Canon===\nIn 1994, Bloom published ''[[The Western Canon]]'', a survey of the major literary works of Europe and the Americas since the 14th century, focusing on 26 works he considered sublime and representative of their nations<ref>Bloom 1994, pg. 2</ref> and of the [[Western canon]].<ref>Bloom 1994, pg. 11</ref> Besides analyses of the canon's various representative works, the major concern of the volume is reclaiming literature from those he refers to as the \"[[School of resentment]]\", the mostly academic critics who espouse a social purpose in reading. Bloom believes that the goals of reading must be solitary [[aesthetic]] pleasure and self-insight rather than the goal held by \"forces of resentment\" of improving one's society, which he casts as an absurd aim, writing: \"The idea that you benefit the insulted and injured by reading someone of their own origins rather than reading [[Shakespeare]] is one of the oddest illusions ever promoted by or in our schools.\" His position is that politics have no place in literary criticism: a [[feminist]] or [[Marxist]] reading of ''[[Hamlet]]'' would tell us something about feminism and Marxism, he says, but probably nothing about ''Hamlet'' itself.\n\nIn addition to considering how much influence a writer has had on later writers, Bloom proposed the concept of \"canonical strangeness\" (cf. [[uncanny]]) as a benchmark of a literary work's merit. ''The Western Canon'' also included a list—which aroused more widespread interest than anything else in the volume—of all the Western works from antiquity to the present that Bloom considered either permanent members of the canon of literary classics, or (among more recent works) candidates for that status. Bloom has said that he made the list off the top of his head at his editor's request, and that he does not stand by it.<ref>[http://www.vice.com/read/harold-bloom-431-v15n12 Harold Bloom | VICE United States]; {{Wayback|url=http://www.vice.com/read/harold-bloom-431-v15n12|date=20131014172844}}</ref>\n\n===Work on Shakespeare===\nBloom has a deep appreciation for Shakespeare<ref>Bloom 1994, pp.&nbsp;2–3</ref> and considers him to be the supreme center of the Western Canon.<ref>Bloom 1994, pp.&nbsp;24–5</ref> The first edition of ''The Anxiety of Influence'' almost completely avoided Shakespeare, whom Bloom considered, at the time, barely touched by the psychological drama of anxiety. The second edition, published in 1997, adds a long preface that mostly expounds on Shakespeare's debt to [[Ovid]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], and his [[agon#Literature|agon]] with his contemporary [[Christopher Marlowe]], who set the stage for him by breaking free of ecclesiastical and moralizing overtones.\n\nIn his 1998 survey, ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human'', Bloom provides an analysis of each of Shakespeare's 38 plays, \"twenty-four of which are masterpieces.\" Written as a companion to the general reader and theatergoer, Bloom declares that [[bardolatry]] \"ought to be even more a secular religion than it already is.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human''. New York: Riverhead, 1998, p. xix.</ref> He also contends in the work (as in the title) that Shakespeare \"invented\" humanity, in that he prescribed the now-common practice of \"overhearing\" ourselves, which drives our changes. The two paragons of his theory are [[Sir John Falstaff]] of ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV]]'' and [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]], whom Bloom sees as representing self-satisfaction and self-loathing, respectively. Throughout ''Shakespeare'', characters from disparate plays are imagined alongside and interacting with each other; this has been decried by numerous contemporary academics and critics as hearkening back to the out of fashion character criticism of A.C. Bradley and others, who happen to gather explicit praise in the book. As in ''The Western Canon'', Bloom criticizes what he calls the \"School of Resentment\" for its failure to live up to the challenge of Shakespeare's universality and instead [[Balkanization|balkanizing]] the study of literature through various multicultural and [[New Historicism|historicist]] departments. Asserting Shakespeare's singular popularity throughout the world, Bloom proclaims him as the only multicultural author, and rather than the \"social energies\" historicists ascribe Shakespeare's authorship to, Bloom pronounces his modern academic foes – and indeed, all of society – to be \"a parody of Shakespearian energies.\"\n\n===2000s===\n\nHarold Bloom consolidated his work on the western canon with the publication of ''How to Read and Why'' in 2000 and ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'' in 2003. In the same year, ''Hamlet: Poem Unlimited'' was published, an amendment to ''Shakespeare: Invention of the Human'' written after he decided the chapter on Hamlet in that earlier book had been too focused on the textual question of the ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' to cover his most central thoughts on the play itself. Some elements of religious criticism were combined with his secular criticism in ''Where Shall Wisdom Be Found'' (2004), and a more complete return to religious criticism was marked by the publication of ''Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine'' in 2005. Throughout the decade he also compiled, edited and introduced several major anthologies of poetry.\n\nIn 2006, Bloom took part in the documentary, the ''[[Apparition of the Eternal Church]],'' made by [[Paul Festa]]. This documentary centered on many individuals's reactions to hearing, for the first time, the renowned piece for organ, the ''[[Apparition de l'église éternelle]]'', of [[Olivier Messiaen]].\n\nBloom began a book under the working title of ''Living Labyrinth'', centering on Shakespeare and Whitman, which was published in 2011 as ''Anatomy of Influence: Literature as a Way of Life''.\n\nIn July 2011, after the publication of ''Anatomy of Influence'' and after finishing work on ''The Shadow of a Great Rock'', Bloom was working on three projects:\n* ''Achievement in the Evening Land from Emerson to Faulkner'' (a history of American literature),\n* ''The Hum of Thoughts Evaded in the Mind: A Literary Memoir'', and\n* a play with the working title ''Walt Whitman: A Musical Pageant''.<ref>[http://www.radioopensource.org/harold-bloom-on-the-playing-field-of-poetry/ Harold Bloom: On the Playing Field of Poetry | Radio Open Source with Christopher Lydon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By November 2011, Bloom had changed the title of the play to ''To You Whoever You Are: A Pageant Celebrating Walt Whitman''.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/opinion/sunday/will-this-election-be-the-mormon-breakthrough.html \"Will This Election Be the Mormon Breakthrough?\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 12, 2011.</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nBloom credits [[Northrop Frye]] as his nearest precursor. He told [[Imre Salusinszky]] in 1986: \"In terms of my own theorizations&nbsp;... the precursor proper has to be Northrop Frye. I purchased and read ''[[Fearful Symmetry (Frye)|Fearful Symmetry]]'' a week or two after it had come out and reached the bookstore in Ithaca, New York. It ravished my heart away. I have tried to find an alternative father in Mr. [[Kenneth Burke]], who is a charming fellow and a very powerful critic, but I don't come from Burke, I come out of Frye.\"<ref>[http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html#roots \"On His Own Intellectual Roots\"]</ref> However, he also admits an indebtedness, especially in his later period, to earlier critics such as [[William Hazlitt]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Walter Pater]], [[A. C. Bradley]], and [[Samuel Johnson]], whom he acknowledges in ''The Western Canon'' as \"unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him\". In his 2012 Foreword to the book ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012), Bloom indicated the influence which [[M. H. Abrams]] had upon him in his years at Cornell University.<ref>M.H. Abrams. ''The Fourth Dimension of a Poem'' (WW Norton, 2012).</ref>\n\nBloom's theory of poetic influence regards the development of [[Western literature]] as a process of borrowing and misreading. Writers find their creative inspiration in previous writers and begin by imitating those writers in order to develop a poetic voice of their own; however, they must make their own work different from that of their precursors. As a result, Bloom argues, authors of real power must inevitably \"misread\" their precursors' works in order to make room for fresh imaginings.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom| title=Harold Bloom, The Art of Criticism No. 1| work=Paris Review| date=Spring 1991| author=Antonio Weiss}}</ref><ref>Paul Fry, [http://oyc.yale.edu/english/engl-300/lecture-14 \"Engl 300: Introduction To Theory Of Literature\"].

He told Robert Moynihan in 1983, \"What I think I have in common with the school of deconstruction is the mode of negative thinking or negative awareness, in the technical, philosophical sense of the negative, but which comes to me through [[apophatic theology|negative theology]]&nbsp;... There is no escape, there is simply the given, and there is nothing that we can do.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=INTERVIEWS WITH HAROLD BLOOM|url=https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html|work=Stanford Presidential Lectures in the Humanities and Arts|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=March 15, 2014}} Excerpted from \"Interview: Harold Bloom interviewed by Robert Moynihan\" ''Diacritics : A Review of Contemporary Criticism'' v13 , #3 (Fall, 1983) PAGES 57–68.</ref>\n\nBloom's association with the [[Western canon]] has provoked a substantial interest in his opinion concerning the relative importance of contemporary writers. In the late 1980s, Bloom told an interviewer: \"Probably the most powerful living Western writer is [[Samuel Beckett]]. He's certainly the most authentic.\"<ref>[http://new.bostonreview.net/BR11.1/bloom.html \"Candidates for Survival: A talk with Harold Bloom\" ''Boston Review'' February, 1989]; {{Wayback|url=http://new.bostonreview.net/BR11.1/bloom.html|date=20140315224424}}</ref>\n\nAfter Beckett's death in 1989, Bloom has pointed towards other authors as the new main figures of the Western literary canon.\n\nConcerning British writers: \"[[Geoffrey Hill]] is the strongest British poet now active\", and \"no other contemporary British novelist seems to me to be of [[Iris Murdoch]]'s eminence\". Since Murdoch's death, Bloom has expressed admiration for novelists such as [[Peter Ackroyd]], [[Will Self]], [[John Banville]], and [[A. S. Byatt]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Genius : a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds|year=2002|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-69129-1|page=648|quote=\"There are a few affinities, except perhaps with the admirable Antonia Byatt, in the generation after: novelists I also now admire, like Will Self, Peter Ackroyd, and John Banville.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2003 book, ''Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds'', he named the late [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] writer and Nobel Prize winner [[José Saramago]] as \"the most gifted novelist alive in the world today\", and as \"one of the last titans of an expiring literary genre\".\n\nOf American novelists, he declared in 2003 that \"there are four living American novelists I know of who are still at work and who deserve our praise\".<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/\"Dumbing Down American Readers\" \"Boston Globe\" 9/24/2003] {{wayback|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ |date=20060617015302 }}</ref> He claimed that \"they write the Style of our Age, each has composed canonical works,\" and he identified them as [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Philip Roth]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Don DeLillo]]. He named their strongest works as, respectively, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', ''[[The Crying of Lot 49]]'' and ''[[Mason & Dixon]]''; ''[[American Pastoral]]'' and ''[[Sabbath's Theater]]''; ''[[Blood Meridian]]''; and ''[[Underworld (DeLillo novel)|Underworld]]''. He has added to this estimate the work of [[John Crowley]], with special interest in his [[Aegypt Sequence]] and novel ''[[Little, Big]]'' saying that \"only a handful of living writers in English can equal him as a stylist, and most of them are poets&nbsp;... only Philip Roth consistently writes on Crowley's level\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Snake's-hands : the fiction of John Crowley|year=2003|publisher=Cosmos Books|location=[Canton, OH]|isbn=1-58715-509-5|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JsaIP2n6xvgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=old+snake-hands&source=bl&ots=OgRjTopV_B&sig=bx3eUGL22sMq8QvaJ4qJoNBWh3w&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Crowley%20Roth&f=false|chapter=Preface}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Kabbalah and Criticism'' (1975), Bloom identified [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[James Merrill]], [[John Ashbery]], and [[Elizabeth Bishop]] as the most important living American poets.

Playwright [[Tony Kushner]] sees Bloom as an important influence on his work.\n\n==Reception, criticism and controversy==\nFor many years, indeed decades, Bloom's writings have been able to effectively polarize opinion, among even established literary scholars.

She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a \"victim\", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, \"I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive.

I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter.
