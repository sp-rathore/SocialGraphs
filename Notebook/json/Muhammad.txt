The next morning, at the Muslim conference of war, dispute arose over how best to repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many senior figures suggested it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of the heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying crops, and huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the younger Muslims and readied the Muslim force for battle.<ref name=\"IntroQuran189\"/> Muhammad led his force outside to the mountain of Uhud (the location of the Meccans camp) and fought the [[Battle of Uhud]] on 23 March 625.<ref>C.F. Robinson, ''Uhud'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]</ref><ref>Watt (1964) p. 137</ref> Although the Muslim army had the advantage in early encounters, lack of discipline on the part of strategically placed archers led to a Muslim defeat; 75 Muslims were killed including [[Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Hamza]], Muhammad's uncle who became one of the best known [[Martyrdom in Islam|martyrs in the Muslim tradition]]. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims, instead they marched back to Mecca declaring victory. The announcement is probably because Muhammad was wounded and thought dead. When they discovered that Muhammad lived, the Meccans did not return due to false information about new forces coming to his aid.<ref name=\"IntroQuran189\"/> The attack had failed to achieve their aim of completely destroying the Muslims.<ref>Watt (1974) p. 137</ref><ref>David Cook(2007), p. 24</ref> The Muslims buried the dead, and returned to Medina that evening. Questions accumulated about the reasons for the loss; Muhammad delivered Quranic verses {{cite quran|3|152|s=ns|b=n}} indicating that the defeat was twofold: partly a punishment for disobedience, partly a test for steadfastness.<ref>See:\n* Watt (1981) p. 432\n* Watt (1964) p. 144</ref>\n\nAbu Sufyan directed his effort towards another attack on Medina.

Muhammad prepared a force of about 3,000 men and adopted a form of defense unknown in Arabia at that time; the Muslims dug a trench<ref name=\"IntroQuran190\" /> wherever Medina lay open to cavalry attack. The idea is credited to a Persian convert to Islam, [[Salman the Persian]].

Although the Meccan forces were swayed by suggestions that Muhammad was sure to be overwhelmed, they desired reassurance in case the confederacy was unable to destroy him. No agreement was reached after prolonged negotiations, partly due to sabotage attempts by Muhammad's scouts.<ref>Watt (1964) pp. 170–72</ref> After the coalition's retreat, the Muslims accused the Banu Qurayza of treachery and besieged them in their forts for 25 days. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered; according to [[Ibn Ishaq]], all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded, while the women and children were enslaved.<ref name=\"IntroQuran190\" /><ref>Peterson(2007), p. 126</ref><ref>Ramadan (2007), p. 141</ref> Walid N.

In the month of [[Shawwal]] 628,<ref name=\"IntroQuran190\"/> Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and to prepare for a pilgrimage (''[[umrah]]'') to Mecca, saying that God had promised him the fulfillment of this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj.<ref>Lings (1987), p. 249</ref> Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca.<ref name = \"Hudaybiya\"/> According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.<ref name = \"Hudaybiya\">Watt, ''al- Hudaybiya or al-Hudaybiyya'' [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]</ref>\n\nNegotiations commenced with emissaries travelling to and from Mecca. While these continued, rumors spread that one of the Muslim negotiators, [[Uthman|Uthman bin al-Affan]], had been killed by the Quraysh. Muhammad called upon the pilgrims to make a pledge not to flee (or to stick with Muhammad, whatever decision he made) if the situation descended into war with Mecca. This pledge became known as the \"Pledge of Acceptance\" ({{lang-ar|بيعة الرضوان , ''bay'at al-ridhwān''}}) or the \"[[Pledge of the Tree|Pledge under the Tree]]\". News of Uthman's safety allowed for negotiations to continue, and a treaty scheduled to last ten years was eventually signed between the Muslims and Quraysh.<ref name = \"Hudaybiya\" /><ref>Lewis (2002), p. 42</ref> The main points of the treaty included: cessation of hostilities, the deferral of Muhammad's pilgrimage to the following year,<ref name=\"IntroQuran191\">An Introduction to the Quran (1895), p. 191</ref> and agreement to send back any Meccan who emigrated to Medina without permission from their protector.<ref name = \"Hudaybiya\"/>\n\nMany Muslims were not satisfied with the treaty. However, the Quranic sura \"[[Al-Fath]]\" (The Victory) (Quran {{cite quran|48|1|e=29|s=ns|b=n}}) assured them that the expedition must be considered a victorious one.<ref>Lings (1987), p. 255</ref> It was later that Muhammad's followers realized the benefit behind the treaty. These benefits included the requirement of the Meccans to identify Muhammad as an equal,<ref name=\"IntroQuran191\"/> cessation of military activity allowing Medina to gain strength, and the admiration of Meccans who were impressed by the pilgrimage rituals.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\nAfter signing the truce, Muhammad assembled an expedition against the Jewish oasis of [[Khaybar]],<ref name=\"IntroQuran191\"/> known as the [[Battle of Khaybar]].

A few learned circles of [[Middle Ages]] Europe{{spaced ndash}}primarily Latin-literate scholars{{spaced ndash}}had access to fairly extensive biographical material about Muhammad. They interpreted the biography through a Christian religious filter; one that viewed Muhammad as a person who seduced the [[Saracens]] into his submission under religious guise.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> Popular European literature of the time portrayed Muhammad as though he were worshipped by Muslims, similar to an idol or a heathen god.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\nIn later ages, Muhammad came to be seen as a schismatic: [[Brunetto Latini]]'s 13th century ''Li livres dou tresor'' represents him as a former monk and cardinal,<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], Canto 28), written in the early 1300s, puts Muhammad and his son-in-law, Ali, in Hell \"among the sowers of discord and the schismatics, being lacerated by devils again and again.\"<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\n====Emergence of positive views in Europe====\n\nAfter the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Muhammad was often portrayed in a similar way.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/><ref name = \"Lewis 2002 45\">Lewis (2002)</ref> [[Guillaume Postel]] was among the first to present a more positive view of Muhammad.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> [[Gottfried Leibniz]] praised Muhammad because \"he did not deviate from the natural religion\".<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], in his ''Vie de Mahomed'' which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the [[Byzantine Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain. Voltaire had both a positive and negative opinion on Muhammad: in his play ''[[Mahomet (play)|Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète]]''  he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in a published essay in 1748 he calls him \"a sublime and hearty charlatan\", but in his historical survey ''Essai sur les mœurs'' , he presents him as legislator and a conqueror and calls him an \"enthusiast\", not an imposter. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], in his [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] (1762), brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers. [[Claude-Emmanuel de Pastoret|Emmanuel Pastoret]] published in 1787 his ''Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad'', in which he presents the lives of these three \"great men\", \"the greatest legislators of the universe\", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers.
