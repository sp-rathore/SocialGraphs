The author of over 200 books and papers, he was a founder of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]], to which he contributed much notation. The standard [[axiomatization]] of the [[natural number]]s is named the [[Peano axioms]] in his honor. As part of this effort, he made key contributions to the modern rigorous and systematic treatment of the method of [[mathematical induction]]. He spent most of his career teaching mathematics at the [[University of Turin]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Peano - Aritmetica generale e algebra elementare, 1902 - 3935060.tif |thumb|''Aritmetica generale e algebra elementare'', 1902]]\nPeano was born and raised on a farm at Spinetta, a hamlet now belonging to [[Cuneo]], [[Piedmont]], [[Italy]]. He attended the [[Liceo classico Cavour]] in [[Turin]], and enrolled at the [[University of Turin]] in 1876, graduating in 1880 with high honors, after which the University employed him to assist first [[Enrico D'Ovidio]], and then [[Angelo Genocchi]], the Chair of [[calculus]]. Due to Genocchi's poor health, Peano took over the teaching of calculus course within 2 years. His first major work, a textbook on calculus, was published in 1884 and was credited to Genocchi. A few years later, Peano published his first book dealing with mathematical logic. Here the modern symbols for the [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of sets appeared for the first time.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Richard N.

Luigi Crosio 1835–1916]. Schoenstatt webpage</ref> In 1886, he began teaching concurrently at the [[Royal Military Academy (Italy)|Royal Military Academy]], and was promoted to Professor First Class in 1889. The next year, the University of Turin also granted him his full professorship. Peano's famous [[space-filling curve]] appeared in 1890 as a [[counterexample]]. He used it to show that a continuous curve cannot always be enclosed in an arbitrarily small region. This was an early example of what came to be known as a [[fractal]].\n\nIn 1890 Peano founded the journal ''Rivista di Matematica'', which published its first issue in January 1891.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ziwet, Alexander|title=A New Italian Mathematical Journal|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1891|volume=1|issue=2|pages=42–43|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1891-01-02/S0002-9904-1891-00023-1/|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1891-00023-1}}</ref> In 1891 Peano started the [[Formulario Project]]. It was to be an \"Encyclopedia of Mathematics\", containing all known formulae and theorems of mathematical science using a standard notation invented by Peano. In 1897, the first [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] was held in [[Zürich]]. Peano was a key participant, presenting a paper on mathematical logic. He also started to become increasingly occupied with ''Formulario'' to the detriment of his other work.\n\nIn 1898 he presented a note to the Academy about [[Binary numeral system|binary numeration]] and its ability to be used to represent the sounds of languages. He also became so frustrated with publishing delays (due to his demand that formulae be printed on one line) that he purchased a printing press.\n\n{{rquote|right|He [Peano] was a man I greatly admired from the moment I met him for the first time in 1900 at a Congress of Philosophy, which he dominated by the exactness of his mind.|[[Bertrand Russell]], 1932|<ref>{{cite book|author=Hubert C.

The conference was preceded by the First [[International Conference of Philosophy]] where Peano was a member of the patronage committee. He presented a paper which posed the question of correctly formed definitions in mathematics, ''i.e.'' \"how do you define a definition?\". This became one of Peano's main philosophical interests for the rest of his life. At the conference Peano met [[Bertrand Russell]] and gave him a copy of ''Formulario''. Russell was so struck by Peano's innovative logical symbols that he left the conference and returned home to study Peano's text.\n\nPeano's students [[Mario Pieri]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]] had papers presented at the philosophy congress also. For the mathematical congress, Peano did not speak, but Padoa's memorable presentation has been frequently recalled. A resolution calling for the formation of an \"international auxiliary language\" to facilitate the spread of mathematical (and commercial) ideas, was proposed; Peano fully supported it.\n\nBy 1901, Peano was at the peak of his mathematical career. He had made advances in the areas of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], foundations and logic, made many contributions to the teaching of calculus and also contributed to the fields of [[differential equation]]s and [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] analysis. Peano played a key role in the [[axiomatization]] of mathematics and was a leading pioneer in the development of mathematical logic. Peano had by this stage become heavily involved with the ''Formulario'' project and his teaching began to suffer. In fact, he became so determined to teach his new mathematical symbols that the calculus in his course was neglected. As a result, he was dismissed from the Royal Military Academy but retained his post at Turin University.\n\nIn 1903 Peano announced his work on an international auxiliary language called ''[[Latino sine flexione]]'' (\"[[Latin]] without inflexion,\" later called Interlingua, and the precursor of the [[Interlingua]] of the [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]]). This was an important project for him (along with finding contributors for 'Formulario'). The idea was to use Latin vocabulary, since this was widely known, but simplify the grammar as much as possible and remove all irregular and anomalous forms to make it easier to learn. In one speech, he started speaking in Latin and, as he described each simplification, introduced it into his speech so that by the end he was talking in his new language.\n\nThe year 1908 was important for Peano. The fifth and final edition of the ''Formulario'' project, titled ''Formulario Mathematico'', was published. It contained 4200 formulae and theorems, all completely stated and most of them proved. The book received little attention since much of the content was dated by this time. However, it remains a significant contribution to mathematical literature. The comments and examples were written in ''Latino sine flexione''.\n\nAlso in 1908, Peano took over the chair of higher analysis at Turin (this appointment was to last for only two years). He was elected the director of ''[[Academia pro Interlingua]]''. Having previously created [[Idiom Neutral]], the Academy effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Peano's [[Latino sine flexione]].\n\nAfter his mother died in 1910, Peano divided his time between teaching, working on texts aimed for secondary schooling including a dictionary of mathematics, and developing and promoting his and other [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]s, becoming a revered member of the international auxiliary language movement. He used his membership of the ''[[Accademia dei Lincei]]'' to present papers written by friends and colleagues who were not members (the Accademia recorded and published all presented papers given in sessions).\n\nDuring the years 1913–1918, Peano published several papers that dealt with the remainder term for various [[numerical integration|numerical quadrature]] formulas, and introduced the [[Peano kernel]].<ref name=numericalMath>{{Cite book| last1=Hämmerlin | first1 = Günther | last2=Hoffmann | first2= Karl-Heinz|title = Numerical Mathematics | publisher = Springer | year = 1991 | pages = 192–194 | isbn = 9780387974941}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Peano switched Chairs unofficially from Infinitesimal Calculus to Complementary Mathematics, a field which better suited his current style of mathematics. This move became official in 1931. Giuseppe Peano continued teaching at Turin University until the day before he died, when he suffered a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].\n\n==Milestones and honors received==\n* 1881: Published first paper.\n* 1884: [https://archive.org/details/calcolodifferen00peangoog ''Calcolo Differenziale e Principii di Calcolo Integrale''].\n* 1887: [https://archive.org/details/applicazionigeo00peangoog ''Applicazioni Geometriche del Calcolo Infinitesimale''].\n* 1889: Appointed Professor First Class at the Royal Military Academy.\n* 1889: [https://archive.org/details/arithmeticespri00peangoog ''Arithmetices principia: nova methodo exposita'']\n* 1890: Appointed Extraordinary Professor of [[infinitesimal calculus]] at the [[University of Turin]].\n* 1891: Made a member of the Academy of Science, Torino.\n* 1893: [https://archive.org/details/lezionidianalis00peangoog ''Lezioni di Analisi Infinitesimale''], 2 vols.\n* 1895: Promoted to Ordinary Professor.\n* 1901: Made Knight of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus|Order of Saints Maurizio and Lazzaro]].\n* 1903: Announces ''[[Latino sine flexione]]''.\n* 1905: Made Knight of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]].
