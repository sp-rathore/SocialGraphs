This research has resulted in [[Van Benthem's Theorem]], which states that modal logic is the fragment of [[first-order logic]] that is [[closure (mathematics)|closed under]] [[bisimulation]].\n\nHe has also been active in the fields of [[philosophy of science]], logical structures in natural language ([[generalized quantifier]]s, [[categorial grammar]], substructural [[proof theory]]), [[Dynamic logic (modal logic)|dynamic logic]] and [[update logic]] and applications of [[logic]] to [[game theory]] as well as applications of [[game theory]] to [[logic]] ([[game semantics]]). Van Benthem is a member of the group collectively publishing under the [[pseudonym]] [[L. T. F. Gamut]]. He has also taught in China. He made an effort to encourage and organize international collaboration between Chinese and Western logicians.\n\nProfessor van Benthem retired from the [[Institute for Logic, Language and Computation]] in  September 2014.\n\n==Publications==\n*''Logic in action'', North Holland, 1991\n*''Handbook of Logic and Language'', ed. with [[Alice ter Meulen]], [[Elsevier]]/[[MIT Press]], 1997\n*''Modal Logic: A Semantic Perspective'', with [[Patrick Blackburn]]\n*''Logic in Games'', MIT Press, January 2014\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~johan Van Benthem's personal homepage]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Benthem, Johan van}}\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Dutch philosophers]]\n[[Category:Dutch logicians]]\n[[Category:Logicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:People from Rijswijk]]\n[[Category:Stanford University Department of Philosophy faculty]]\n[[Category:Spinoza Prize winners]]\n[[Category:University of Amsterdam faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Amsterdam alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Groningen faculty]]\n[[Category:20th-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:Tarski lecturers]]\n\n\n{{Netherlands-philosopher-stub}}\n{{Netherlands-scientist-stub}}\n{{Europe-mathematician-stub}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Johan van Benthem (logician)"}}}}
