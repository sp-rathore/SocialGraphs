He served both as [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] and as [[Lord Chancellor]] of England. After his death, he remained extremely influential through his works, especially as philosophical advocate and practitioner of the [[scientific method]] during the [[scientific revolution]].\n\nBacon has been called the father of [[empiricism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm |title=Empiricism: The influence of Francis Bacon, John Locke, and David Hume |publisher=Sweet Briar College|date= |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708012140/http://www.psychology.sbc.edu/Empiricism.htm|archivedate=2013-07-08}}</ref> His works argued for the possibility of [[science|scientific]] [[knowledge]] based only upon [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and careful observation of events in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]]. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a skeptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the ''[[Baconian method]]'', did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a skeptical methodology makes Bacon the father of [[scientific method]]. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and [[methodology]] today.\n\nBacon was generally neglected at court by [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], but after the ascension of [[James I of England|King James I]] in 1603,  Bacon was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]].

Inscription around his head reads: ''Si tabula daretur digna animum mallem'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for \"If one could but paint his mind\" (see also below). [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]\n\nFrancis Bacon was born on 22 January 1561 at [[York House, Strand|York House]] near the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in [[London]], the son of [[Nicholas Bacon (Lord Keeper)|Sir Nicholas Bacon]] by his second wife, [[Anne Bacon|Anne (Cooke) Bacon]], the daughter of the noted [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] [[Anthony Cooke]]. His mother's sister was married to [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], making Burghley Bacon's uncle.<ref>\"Sir Francis Bacon's Journals\". p. 191. universe, 2007</ref>\n\nBiographers believe that Bacon was educated at home in his early years owing to poor health, which would plague him throughout his life. He received tuition from John Walsall, a graduate of Oxford with a strong leaning toward [[Puritan]]ism. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on 5 April 1573 at the age of 12,<ref>{{acad|id=BCN573F|name=Bacon, Francis }}</ref> living for three years there, together with his older brother [[Anthony Bacon (1558–1601)|Anthony Bacon]] under the personal tutelage of [[John Whitgift|Dr John Whitgift]], future [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Bacon's education was conducted largely in Latin and followed the medieval curriculum. He was also educated at the [[University of Poitiers]]. It was at Cambridge that he first met [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]], who was impressed by his precocious intellect, and was accustomed to calling him \"The young lord keeper\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Arthur |title=The English Baronetage: Containing a Genealogical and Historical Account of All the English Baronets, Now Existing: Their Descents, Marriages, and Issues; Memorable Actions, Both in War, and Peace; Religious and Charitable Donations; Deaths, Places of Burial and Monumental Inscriptions {{sic}} |publisher=Printed for Tho.

His reverence for [[Aristotle]] conflicted with his rejection of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]], which seemed to him barren, disputatious and wrong in its objectives.\n\n[[File:york Water Gate.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Italianate]] York Water Gate – the entry to York House, built about 1626, the year of Bacon's death]]\n\nOn 27 June 1576, he and Anthony entered ''de societate magistrorum'' at [[Gray's Inn]]. A few months later, Francis went abroad with Sir [[Amias Paulet]], the English ambassador at Paris, while Anthony continued his studies at home. The state of government and society in France under [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] afforded him valuable political instruction. For the next three years he visited [[Blois]], [[Poitiers]], [[Tours]], Italy, and Spain.<ref name=\"travels\">[[Stephen Gaukroger]] (2001). \"Francis Bacon and the Transformation of Early-Modern Philosophy\". p. 46. Cambridge University Press</ref> During his travels, Bacon studied language, statecraft, and civil law while performing routine diplomatic tasks. On at least one occasion he delivered diplomatic letters to England for [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], Burghley, and [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]], as well as for the queen.<ref name=\"travels\"/>\n\nThe sudden death of his father in February 1579 prompted Bacon to return to England. Sir Nicholas had laid up a considerable sum of money to purchase an estate for his youngest son, but he died before doing so, and Francis was left with only a fifth of that money. Having borrowed money, Bacon got into debt. To support himself, he took up his residence in law at Gray's Inn in 1579, his income being supplemented by a grant from his mother Lady Anne of the manor of Marks in Essex, which generated a rent of £46.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Spall | first = JEH | title = Francis Bacon's connections with Marks Manor House | journal = Romford Record | volume = No. 4 | pages = 32–37 | publisher = Romford and District Historical Society | location = Romford | date = 1971\n}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentarian===\n[[File:Francis Bacon statue, Gray's Inn.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon's statue at [[Gray's Inn]], South Square, London]]\n\nBacon stated that he had three goals: to uncover truth, to serve his country, and to serve his church. He sought to further these ends by seeking a prestigious post. In 1580, through his uncle, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], he applied for a post at court that might enable him to pursue a life of learning, but his application failed. For two years he worked quietly at [[Gray's Inn]], until he was admitted as an [[outer barrister]] in 1582.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Robert. P.|title=Francis Bacon: The Double-Edged Life of the Philosopher and Statesman|date=27 April 2015|publisher=McFarland|page=28}}</ref>\n\nHis parliamentary career began when he was elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MP]] for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney, Cornwall]], in a [[by-election]] (similar to a special election in the US) in 1581. In 1584 he took his seat in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] for [[Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Melcombe]] in Dorset, and in 1586 for [[Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)|Taunton]]. At this time, he began to write on the condition of parties in the church, as well as on the topic of philosophical reform in the lost tract ''Temporis Partus Maximus''. Yet he failed to gain a position that he thought would lead him to success. He showed signs of sympathy to Puritanism, attending the sermons of the Puritan chaplain of Gray's Inn and accompanying his mother to the [[Temple Church]] to hear [[Walter Travers]]. This led to the publication of his earliest surviving tract, which criticised the English church's suppression of the Puritan clergy. In the Parliament of 1586, he openly urged execution for the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nAbout this time, he again approached his powerful uncle for help; this move was followed by his rapid progress at the bar. He became a [[bencher]] in 1586 and was elected a [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Reader]] in 1587, delivering his first set of lectures in Lent the following year. In 1589, he received the valuable appointment of [[Reversion (law)|reversion]] to the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]], although he did not formally take office until 1608; the post was worth £1,600 a year.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}\n\nIn 1588 he became MP for [[Liverpool (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool]] and then for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]] in 1593. He later sat three times for [[Ipswich (UK Parliament constituency)|Ipswich]] (1597, 1601, 1604) and once for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] (1614).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/bacon-francis-1561-1626 |title=History of Parliament |accessdate=2 October 2011}}\n</ref>\n\nHe became known as a liberal-minded reformer, eager to amend and simplify the law. Though a friend of the crown, he opposed feudal privileges and dictatorial powers. He spoke against religious persecution. He struck at the House of Lords in its usurpation of the Money Bills. He advocated for the union of England and Scotland, which made him a significant influence toward the consolidation of the United Kingdom; and he later would advocate for the integration of Ireland into the Union. Closer constitutional ties, he believed, would bring greater peace and strength to these countries.<ref name=\"letters\">{{cite journal |last=Spedding |first=James |title=The letters and life of Francis Bacon |year=1861 }}</ref><ref name=\"ecc.015\">{{cite web |url=http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 |title=Sir Francis Bacon's Letters, Tracts and Speech relating to Ireland |work= |publisher= |deadurl=no |archivedate=2011-08-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807142316/http://publish.ucc.ie/celt/docs/E600001-015 }}</ref>\n\n===Attorney General===\n[[File:StatueOfFrancisBacon.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial to Francis Bacon, in the chapel of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]\nBacon soon became acquainted with [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], Queen Elizabeth's favourite.<ref name=\"Hammer\"/> By 1591 he acted as the earl's confidential adviser.<ref name=\"Hammer\">Paul E.

Bacon's opposition to a bill that would levy triple subsidies in half the usual time offended the Queen: opponents accused him of seeking popularity, and for a time the Court excluded him from favour.<ref>Weir, Alison  ''Elizabeth the Queen'' Pimlico 1999 p.414</ref>\n\nWhen the office of [[Attorney-General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] fell vacant in 1594, Lord Essex's influence was not enough to secure the position for Bacon and it was given to Sir [[Edward Coke]]. Likewise, Bacon failed to secure the lesser office of [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] in 1595, the Queen pointedly snubbing him by appointing Sir [[Thomas Fleming (judge)|Thomas Fleming]] instead.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}} To console him for these disappointments, Essex presented him with a property at [[Twickenham]], which Bacon subsequently sold for £1,800.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bunten|first1=Alice Chambers|title=Twickenham Park and Old Richmond Palace and Francis Bacon: Lord Verulam's Connection with The, 1580-1608|publisher=R. Banks|page=19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1596 Bacon became [[Queen's Counsel]], but missed the appointment of [[Master of the Rolls]]. During the next few years, his financial situation remained embarrassing. His friends could find no public office for him, and a scheme for retrieving his position by a marriage with the wealthy and young widow Lady [[Elizabeth Hatton]] failed after she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to Sir Edward Coke, a further spark of enmity between the men. In 1598 Bacon was arrested for debt. Afterward, however, his standing in the Queen's eyes improved. Gradually, Bacon earned the standing of one of the learned counsels, though he had no commission or warrant, and received no salary. His relationship with the Queen further improved when he severed ties with Essex{{mdash}}a shrewd move, as Essex would be executed for treason in 1601.<ref>{{cite book|title=Britannica Concise Encyclopedia|date=1 May 2008|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=636}}</ref>\n\nWith others, Bacon was appointed to investigate the charges against Essex. A number of Essex's followers confessed that Essex had planned a rebellion against the Queen.<ref name=\"Character Assassination\">Nieves Matthews, ''Francis Bacon: The History of a Character Assassination'' (Yale University Press, 1996)</ref>  Bacon was subsequently a part of the legal team headed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir Edward Coke at Essex's treason trial.<ref name=\"Character Assassination\" /> After the execution, the Queen ordered Bacon to write the official government account of the trial, which was later published as ''A DECLARATION of the Practices and Treasons attempted and committed by Robert late Earle of Essex and his Complices, against her Majestie and her Kingdoms ...'' after Bacon's first draft was heavily edited by the Queen and her ministers.<ref>Matthews (1996: 56–57)</ref>\n\nAccording to his personal secretary and chaplain, [[William Rawley]], as a judge Bacon was always tender-hearted, \"looking upon the examples with the eye of severity, but upon the person with the eye of pity and compassion\". And also that \"he was free from malice\", \"no revenger of injuries\", and \"no defamer of any man\".<ref name=\"Rawley\">{{cite book |last=Rawley |first=William |title=The Life of the Right Honorable Francis Bacon Baron of Verulam, Viscount ST.

He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1603. In another shrewd move, Bacon wrote his ''Apologies'' in defence of his proceedings in the case of Essex, as Essex had favoured James to succeed to the throne.\n\nThe following year, during the course of the uneventful first parliament session, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]]. In June 1607 he was at last rewarded with the office of solicitor general.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}} The following year, he began working as the Clerkship of the [[Star Chamber]]. Despite a generous income, old debts still could not be paid. He sought further promotion and wealth by supporting King James and his arbitrary policies.\n[[File:Francis Bacon, Viscount St Alban from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of Sir Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon, c. 1618]]\n\nIn 1610 the fourth session of James's first [[James I of England and the English Parliament|parliament]] met. Despite Bacon's advice to him, James and the Commons found themselves at odds over royal prerogatives and the king's embarrassing extravagance. The House was finally dissolved in February 1611. Throughout this period Bacon managed to stay in the favour of the king while retaining the confidence of the Commons.\n\nIn 1613 Bacon was finally appointed [[attorney general]], after advising the king to shuffle judicial appointments. As attorney general, Bacon,\nby his zealous efforts—which included torture—to obtain the conviction of [[Edmund Peacham]] for treason, raised legal controversies of high constitutional importance;<ref>[en.wikisource.org/wiki/Peacham,_Edmond_(DNB00) Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 44: \"Edmund Peacham\"]</ref> and successfully prosecuted [[Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset]], and his wife, [[Frances Howard, Countess of Somerset]], for murder in 1616. The so-called Prince's Parliament of April 1614 objected to Bacon's presence in the seat for [[University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] and to the various royal plans that Bacon had supported. Although he was allowed to stay, parliament passed a law that forbade the attorney general to sit in parliament. His influence over the king had evidently inspired resentment or apprehension in many of his peers. Bacon, however, continued to receive the King's favour, which led to his appointment in March 1617 as temporary Regent of England (for a period of a month), and in 1618 as [[Lord Chancellor]]. On 12 July 1618 the king created Bacon '''[[Baron Verulam]]''', of [[Verulamium|Verulam]], in the [[Peerage of England]];  he then became known as Francis, Lord Verulam.{{sfnp|Peltonen|2007}}\n\nBacon continued to use his influence with the king to mediate between the throne and Parliament, and in this capacity he was further elevated in the same peerage, as '''[[Viscount St Alban]]''', on 27 January 1621.\n\n===Lord Chancellor and public disgrace===\n[[File:Bacon vs Parliament.jpg|thumb|Francis Bacon and the members of the Parliament in the day of his political fall]]\nBacon's public career ended in disgrace in 1621.

He narrowly escaped undergoing [[Cashiering|degradation]], which would have stripped him of his titles of nobility. Subsequently, the disgraced viscount devoted himself to study and writing.\n\nThere seems little doubt that Bacon had accepted gifts from litigants, but this was an accepted custom of the time and not necessarily evidence of deeply corrupt behaviour.<ref name=\"pz\">{{cite book |last=Zagorin |first=Perez |authorlink=Perez Zagorin |title=Francis Bacon |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1999 |pages=22–23 |isbn=978-0-691-00966-7 }}</ref> While acknowledging that his conduct had been lax, he countered that he had never allowed gifts to influence his judgement and, indeed, he had on occasion given a verdict against those who had paid him. He even had an interview with King James in which he assured:\n{{Quote |The law of nature teaches me to speak in my own defence: With respect to this charge of bribery I am as innocent as any man born on St. Innocents Day.

I know I have clean hands and a clean heart, and I hope a clean house for friends or servants; but Job himself, or whoever was the justest judge, by such hunting for matters against him as hath been used against me, may for a time seem foul, especially in a time when greatness is the mark and accusation is the game.<ref>{{citation |editor1-last=Matheson |editor1-first=PE |editor2-first=EF |editor2-last=Matheson |year=1922 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029009888/cu31924029009888_djvu.txt |first=Francis |last=Bacon |title=Selections |publisher=Cornell University Library, Oxford University Press, Amen House |place=London |postscript=. }}</ref>}}\n\nThe true reason for his acknowledgement of guilt is the subject of debate, but some authors speculate that it may have been prompted by his sickness, or by a view that through his fame and the greatness of his office he would be spared harsh punishment.  He may even have been blackmailed, with a threat to charge him with sodomy, into confession.<ref name=\"pz\" /><ref>[[A. L. Rowse]], quoted in Parris; Maguire (2004: 8): \"a charge of sodomy was... to be brought against the sixty-year-old Lord Chancellor\".</ref>\n\nThe British jurist [[Basil Montagu]] wrote in Bacon's defence, concerning the episode of his public disgrace:\n{{Quote |Bacon has been accused of servility, of dissimulation, of various base motives, and their filthy brood of base actions, all unworthy of his high birth, and incompatible with his great wisdom, and the estimation in which he was held by the noblest spirits of the age. It is true that there were men in his own time, and will be men in all times, who are better pleased to count spots in the sun than to rejoice in its glorious brightness. Such men have openly libelled him, like Dewes and Weldon, whose falsehoods were detected as soon as uttered, or have fastened upon certain ceremonious compliments and dedications, the fashion of his day, as a sample of his servility, passing over his noble letters to the Queen, his lofty contempt for the Lord Keeper Puckering, his open dealing with Sir Robert Cecil, and with others, who, powerful when he was nothing, might have blighted his opening fortunes for ever, forgetting his advocacy of the rights of the people in the face of the court, and the true and honest counsels, always given by him, in times of great difficulty, both to Elizabeth and her successor.

Reportedly, she broke off their relationship upon accepting marriage to a wealthier man, Bacon's rival, [[Edward Coke]]. Years later, Bacon still wrote of his regret that the marriage to Hatton had not taken place.<ref name=Dodd-Life-Story>Alfred Dodd, ''Francis Bacon's Personal Life Story', Volume 2 – The Age of James'', England: Rider & Co., 1949, 1986. pages 157 – 158, 425, 502 – 503, 518 – 532</ref>\n\nAt the age of 45, Bacon married [[Alice Barnham]], the 14-year-old daughter of a well-connected London [[alderman]] and MP. Bacon wrote two sonnets proclaiming his love for Alice. The first was written during his courtship and the second on his wedding day, 10 May 1606. When Bacon was appointed lord chancellor, \"by special Warrant of the King\", Lady Bacon was given precedence over all other Court ladies.\n\nReports of increasing friction in his marriage to Alice appeared, with speculation that some of this may have been due to financial resources not being as readily available to her as she had been accustomed to. Alice was reportedly interested in fame and fortune, and when reserves of money were no longer available there were complaints about where all the money was going. Alice Chambers Bunten wrote in her ''Life of Alice Barnham''<ref>Alice Chambers Bunten, ''Life of Alice Barnham, Wife of Sir Francis Bacon'', London: Oliphants Ltd. 1928.</ref> that, upon their descent into debt, she actually went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with [[Sir John Underhill]].
