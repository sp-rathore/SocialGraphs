In his philosophy there are three principles: [[Henology|the One]], [[Nous|the Intellect]], and the [[wikt:psyche#English|Soul]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who was Plotinus?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2011/3237626.htm}}</ref> His teacher was [[Ammonius Saccas]] and he is of the Platonic tradition.<ref name=\"Stanford1\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ ''Plotinus''].</ref>  Historians of the 19th century invented the term [[Neoplatonism]]<ref name=\"Stanford1\" /> and applied it to him and his philosophy which was influential in [[Late Antiquity]]. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s preface to his edition of Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]''. His [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] writings have inspired centuries of [[Paganism|Pagan]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic]] and [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[metaphysics|metaphysicians]] and [[mysticism|mystics]].\n\n== Biography ==\n[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor [[Claudius II]], thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205.

This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike.  Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of [[philosophy]] at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to [[Alexandria]] to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of [[Ammonius Saccas]]. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], and various [[Stoicism|Stoics]].\n\n=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the [[Iranian philosophy|Persian philosophers]] and the [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophers]].<ref>Porphyry, ''On the Life of Plotinus and the Order of His Books'', Ch. 3 (in Armstrong's Loeb translation, \"he became eager to make acquaintance with the Persian philosophical discipline and that prevailing among the Indians\").</ref> In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of [[Gordian III]] as it marched on Persia. However, [[Battle of Misiche|the campaign]] was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in [[Antioch]].\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of [[Philip the Arab]], he came to [[Rome]], where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life. There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Amelius|Amelius Gentilianus]] of [[Tuscany]], the Senator [[Castricius Firmus]], and [[Eustochius of Alexandria]], a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death.  Other students included: [[Zethos the Arab|Zethos]], an [[Arab]] by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; [[Disciples of Plotinus|Zoticus]], a critic and poet; [[Paulinus (follower of Plotinus)|Paulinus]], a doctor of [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]; and [[Serapion (follower of Plotinus)|Serapion]] from Alexandria. He had students amongst the [[Roman Senate]] beside Castricius, such as [[Marcellus Orontius]], [[Sabinillus]], and [[Rogantianus]]. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of [[Iamblichus]].<ref>Porphyry, ''Vita Plotini'', 9. See also Emma C. Clarke, [[John M. Dillon]], and Jackson P. Hershbell (1999), ''Iamblichus on The Mysteries'', page xix. SBL. who say that \"to gain some credible chronology, one assumes that Ariston married Amphicleia some time after Plotinus's death\"</ref> Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher [[Cassius Dionysius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]].\n\n=== Later life ===\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor [[Gallienus]] and his wife [[Cornelia Salonina|Salonina]]. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in [[Campania]], known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in [[Plato]]'s ''Laws''. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in [[Sicily]], where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in [[Campania]] which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Strive to give back the Divine in yourselves to the Divine in the All.\" [\"The Six Enneads\" translated by Stephen Mackenna and B. S. Page.] Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the ''[[Enneads]]'' over a period of several years from ''[[Circa|ca.]]'' 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the Enneads, before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\n== Major ideas ==\n\n=== One ===\n{{See also|Substance theory}}\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"[[Henology|One]]\", containing no division, multiplicity or distinction; beyond all categories of [[being]] and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things [compare the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence], but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. [I.6.9]\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the [[noesis]] of the [[nous]]) must contain [[Dualism|duality]]. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" [III.8.11] Plotinus denies [[sentience]], self-awareness or any other action (''ergon'') to the One [V.6.6]. Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') or  without which nothing could exist. [III.8.10] As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere [e.g. V.6.3], it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At [V.6.4], Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine [[Nous]] (first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world—but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process. Later Neoplatonic philosophers, especially [[Iamblichus]], added hundreds of intermediate beings as emanations between the One and humanity; but Plotinus' system was much simpler in comparison.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual conception but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity.<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, pp. 110–123</ref> Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will ''see'', but he will ''be'' that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"<ref>Stace, W. T. (1960) ''The Teachings of the Mystics'', New York, Signet, p122</ref>\n\n=== Emanation by the One ===\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus might seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox [[Christianity|Christian]] notion of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of Emanation, however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the [[Sun]] which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe first emanation is ''[[Nous]]'' (Divine Mind, ''[[Logos]]'', Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the [[Demiurge]] in Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''. It is the first [[will (philosophy)|Will]] toward Good. From ''Nous'' proceeds the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|World Soul]], which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with [[nature]]. From the world soul proceeds individual [[human]] souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of [[chain of being|being]] and thus the least [[perfection|perfected]] level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of ''nous'' and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the [[substantial form|Forms]].<ref>I.6.6 and I.6.9</ref>\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (''[[henosis]]''). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], liberation, and other concepts of [[mysticism|mystical union]] common to many Eastern and Western traditions.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== The true human and happiness ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The philosophy of Plotinus has always exerted a peculiar fascination upon those whose discontent with things as they are has led them to seek the realities behind what they took to be merely the appearances of the sense.\n |source = ''The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads'', p. vii<ref name=\"Plotinus1950\">{{cite book|author=Plotinus|title=The philosophy of Plotinus: representative books from the Enneads|url=https://archive.org/details/philosophyofplot032843mbp|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1950|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|page=vii}}</ref>\n |width  = 30%\n |align  = right\n}}\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that [[eudaimonia]] (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved [[eudaimonia]]. “The perfect life” involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus’ contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body’s discomfort in the physical realm. “…The Proficient’s will is set always and only inward.” (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"...a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theat 176AB) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and The One.\n\n=== Against causal astrology ===\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal [[astrology]]. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common [[Hellenistic]] theme) attributes [[irrationality]] to a perfect universe, and invites moral turpitude.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} He does, however, claim the stars and planets are [[Soul (spirit)|ensouled]], as witnessed by their [[Apparent retrograde motion|movement]].\n\n=== Plotinus's Relation to Plato===\n\n* ''See Also'', [[Allegorical interpretations of Plato]]\n\nFor several centuries after the Protestant Reformation, Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, [[E. R. Dodds]] showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., [[Speusippus]]) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.'<ref>E. R. Dodds, 'The Parmenides of Plato and the Origin of the Neoplatonic One,' ''The Classical Quarterly'', v. 22, No. 3/4, 1928, pp. 129-142, esp. 140.</ref> Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'<ref>Philip Merlan, ''From Platonism to Neoplatonism'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1954, 1968), p. 3.</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, the [[Plato's unwritten doctrines|Tübingen School]] of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.<ref>Detlef Thiel: ''Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie'', München 2006, pp. 197ff. and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: ''Der Aufstieg zum Einen. ''</ref>\n\n=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===\n{{See also|Neoplatonism and Gnosticism}}\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract ''Against the Gnostics'' and who he was addressing it to, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"—or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"—ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking [[Greek language|Greek]] terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in [[Christianity]], the [[Cult of Isis]] and other ancient religious contexts including [[Hermetica|Hermetic]] ones (see [[Alexander of Abonutichus]] for an example).\n\nPlotinus and the [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] viewed Gnosticism as a form of heresy or [[sectarian]]ism to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East.{{refn|group=note|From Introduction to Against the Gnostics Plotinus' Enneads as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220–222:<br />The treatise as it stands in the ''[[Enneads]]'' is a most powerful protest on behalf of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] philosophy against the un-Hellenic [[heresy]] (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's own friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch.10 of this treatise) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch.16). He obviously considered Gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sourcesde Plotin).

Worst of all, they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker. This for a Platonist is utter blasphemy, and all the worse because it obviously derives to some extent from the sharply other-worldly side of Plato's own teaching (e.g. in the ''[[Phaedo]]''). At this point in his attack Plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox Christian opponents of Gnosticism, who also insist that this world is the good work of God in his goodness. But, here as on the question of salvation, the doctrine which Plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox Christianity as to Gnosticism: for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its divinity. The idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is inseparably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational. And to deny the divinity (though a subordinate and dependent divinity) of the World-Soul, and of those noblest of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies, seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable. Pages 220–222}}\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition.{{refn|group=note|\"... as Plotinus had endeavored to revive the religious spirit of paganism\".<ref>''A Biographical History of Philosophy'', by George Henry Lewes Published 1892, G.

Simon and Schuster, INC. 1945. pp. 284–285</ref>}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox]] position on ''energy,'' for example, is often contrasted with the position of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of [[Aristotle]] and Plotinus, either through [[Thomas Aquinas]] for the Roman Catholics or [[Gregory of Nyssa]] for the Orthodox Christians.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== Islam ===\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the [[Sunni]] [[Abbasid]]s fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the [[Ismaili]] [[Shia]].<ref name=\"halm 176\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 176.</ref> Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and [[Abu Yaqub Sijistani]]. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the [[Fatimid]] state of Egypt, and taught by their [[da'i (Islam)|da'i]].<ref name=\"halm 176\"/> Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by [[Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani]], although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with original teachings of Plotinus.<ref name=\"halm 177\">Heinz Halm, ''Shi'ism'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 177.</ref> The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as [[Nasir Khusraw]] of Persia.<ref name=\"halm 177\"/>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the [[Renaissance]] the philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] set up an Academy under the patronage of [[Cosimo de Medici]] in [[Florence]], mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was [[Pico della Mirandola]], author of ''An Oration On the Dignity of Man''. Our term 'Neo Platonist' has its origins in the Renaissance.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== England ===\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], and on numerous writers from [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]] and [[Kathleen Raine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n=== India ===\n[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] used the writing of Plotinus in their own texts as a superlative elaboration upon Indian [[monism]], specifically [[Upanishad]]ic and [[Advaita]] [[Vedantic]] thought.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Coomaraswamy has compared Plotinus' teachings to the Hindu school of [[Advaita Vedanta]] (''advaita'' meaning \"not two\" or \"non-dual\").<ref>[http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/com/com_plot.html Swami-krishnananda.org]</ref>\n\nAdvaita Vedanta and Neoplatonism have been compared by [[Frits Staal|J.
