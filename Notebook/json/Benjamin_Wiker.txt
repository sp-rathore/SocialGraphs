He came to attention in 2002 with the publication of ''Moral Darwinism: How We Became Hedonists''. In this book, Wiker aims to show how [[Darwinism]] by its very nature completely undermines the ethical foundations of [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] because what he sees as its [[materialism|materialist]] [[cosmology]] is incompatible with any concept of [[natural law]].<ref>[http://www.humanitas.org/resources/articles/TSdarwinasepicurean.htm Darwin as Epicurean]</ref> Wiker became a member of the [[Discovery Institute]], a [[think tank]] supporting this idea and [[intelligent design]], soon after the publication of the book.\n\nHis next major book, ''Architects of the Culture of Death'', co-written with veteran Catholic ethicist Donald DeMarco, looks at how the most influential thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] to [[Peter Singer]] have undermined the Christian value of \"sanctity of life\".<ref>See DeMarco, Donald and Wiker, Benjamin; ''Architects of the Culture of Death''; p. 361</ref> 2008's ''10 Books That Screwed Up the World'' looks at fifteen important books from ''[[The Prince]]'' to ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' and aims, following [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] and [[E. Michael Jones]], to show how the actual lives of these thinkers led to fundamentally distorted views about human nature, morality, and sexuality.\n\n''The Darwin Myth'' is a biography of [[Charles Darwin]] which portrays Darwin as a good husband and a kind, charitable person and claims that Darwin was involved in an ideological conspiracy by members of the late Enlightenment which aimed to remove God from science.<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/wiker/05404.html Happy Birthday, Charles Darwin]</ref> Wiker uses these claims to support his own belief in a supernaturally guided [[theistic evolution]] as an alternative to the [[naturalist]] view espoused by Darwin and modern [[biology]].<ref>[http://www.catholicity.com/commentary/wiker/05404.html Happy Birthday, Charles Darwin]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nJohn M. Lynch in a review for ''The Darwin Myth'' in the ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]'' has dismissed Wiker's claims as irrational.<ref>Lynch, John M. (2010).
