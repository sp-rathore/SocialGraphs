Dating from the 5th century, its author, [[Liu Xie]], composed the work in fifty chapters (篇) according to the principles of numerology and divination found in the ''Book of Changes'' or ''[[I Ching]]''.  The work also draws on and argues against the 3rd century author [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]]'s work the [[Wen fu]]文賦 (\"On Literature\").  Liu Xie wished to give a complete and internally consistent account of literature.  Among his contributions is his remarkable notion that affections are literally the medium of literature, and language merely the product.\n\n== Translations ==\n* Liu, Xie  ''The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons''.
