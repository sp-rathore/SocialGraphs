She also opposes [[eco-feminism]].\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1986 she attended the [[Institute for Social Ecology]] and there began a collaborative relationship with Bookchin, working intensively with him over the next two decades in the explication of social ecology from their home in [[Burlington, Vermont]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html|title=Janet Biehl: Short Biography & Selected Works|publisher=Canto Libertário|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nFrom 1987 to 2000 she and Bookchin co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ''Green Perspectives'', later renamed ''Left Green Perspectives''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/category/social-ecology-journals/left-green-perspectives/|title=Left Green Perspectives (1988-1998)|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nShe is the editor and compiler of ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' (1997);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html|title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Anarchy Archives|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> the author of ''The Politics of Social Ecology:  Libertarian Municipalism'' (1998) and ''Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics'' (1991); and coauthor (with Peter Staudenmaier) of ''Ecofascism:  Lessons from the German Experience'' (1995).  She has also authored numerous articles about or related to Bookchin’s  thought, especially [[libertarian municipalism]], social ecology and eco-feminism.  Bookchin considered her ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' to be the best introduction to his work.\n\nBiehl is a supporter of the Kurdish rights movement in Turkey. [[Abdullah Öcalan]], leader of the insurgent [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]], had become an avid reader of Bookchin's work after he was captured and imprisoned in 1999 and tried to arrange a meeting with Bookchin before he died, but was unsuccessful. Following the 2006 death of Bookchin, Biehl became involved in pro-Kurdish activism. She has since translated the 2011 book ''Democratic Autonomy in North Kurdistan'' from German into English.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rudaw.net/english/opinion/06012014|title=Turkish Iron Kettles and Kurdish Clay Pots|last=Xulam|first=Kani|date=6 January 2014|publisher=Rudaw English|accessdate=6 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011 Biehl separated herself from social ecology, explaining that she could no longer advocate an anti-statist ideology, and reverted to her pre-1987 political identity as \"what leftists call a [[social democrat]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/2011/04/biehl-breaks-with-social-ecology/|title=Biehl breaks with social ecology|last=Biehl|first=Janet|date=April 13, 2011 <!-- at 6:10 am --> |publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> She has written a biography of Bookchin, forthcoming from Oxford University Press.\n\n== Selected works ==\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Finding our way: rethinking ecofeminist politics | publisher = Black Rose Books | location = Montreal New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 0921689780 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Ecofascism: lessons from the German experience | publisher = AK Press | location = Edinburgh San Francisco | year = 1995 | isbn = 1873176732 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Bookchin | first1 = Murray (author) | last2 = Biehl | first2 = Janet (editor) | author-link1 = Murray Bookchin | title = The Murray Bookchin reader | publisher = Cassell | location = London Washington | year = 1997 | isbn = 0304338745 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = The politics of social ecology: libertarian municipalism | publisher = Black Rose Books | location = Montreal Buffalo, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 1551641003 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Biehl | first = Janet | title = Mumford Gutkind Bookchin: the emergence of eco-decentralism | publisher = New Compass | location = Porsgrunn, Norway | year = 2011 | isbn = 9788293064107 }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Goodreads author}}\n* {{Facebook|janet.biehl|Janet Biehl}}\n* {{Twitter|jbiehlvt|Janet Biehl}}\n\n{{subject bar|portal1= Biography | portal2= Literature | portal3= Feminism | portal4= Environment | portal5= Libertarianism}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biehl, Janet}}\n[[Category:1953 births]]\n[[Category:American feminists]]\n[[Category:American libertarians]]\n[[Category:American political philosophers]]\n[[Category:American political writers]]\n[[Category:Libertarian theorists]]\n[[Category:Feminist studies scholars]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Social ecology]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Janet Biehl"}}}}
