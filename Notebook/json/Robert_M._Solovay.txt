Solovay has spent his career at the [[University of California]] at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include [[W. Hugh Woodin]] and [[Matthew Foreman]].\n\nSolovay's theorems include:\n* [[Solovay's theorem]] showing that, if one assumes the existence of an [[inaccessible cardinal]], then the statement \"every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real number]]s is [[Lebesgue measurable]]\" is consistent with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] without the [[axiom of choice]];\n* Isolating the notion of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]];\n* Proving that the existence of a [[measurable cardinal#Real-valued measurable|real valued measurable cardinal]] is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with the existence of a measurable cardinal;\n* Proving that if <math>\\lambda</math> is a strong limit [[singular cardinal]], greater than a [[strongly compact cardinal]] then <math>2^\\lambda=\\lambda^+</math> holds;\n* Proving that if <math>\\kappa</math> is an uncountable regular cardinal, and <math>S\\subseteq\\kappa</math> is a [[stationary set]], then <math>S</math> can be decomposed into the union of <math>\\kappa</math> disjoint stationary sets;\n* With [[Stanley Tennenbaum]], developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of [[Suslin's hypothesis]].\n* Outside of set theory, developing (with [[Volker Strassen]]) the [[Solovay–Strassen primality test]], used to identify large [[natural number]]s that are [[prime number|prime]] with high [[probability]]. This method has had implications for [[cryptography]].\n* Proving that GL (the [[normal modal logic]] which has the instances of the schema <math>\\Box(\\Box A\\to A)\\to\\Box A</math> as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of [[Peano Arithmetic]].\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1970696|author=Solovay, Robert M.|title=A model of set-theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable|journal=Annals of Mathematics.
