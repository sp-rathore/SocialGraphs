Free logic itself is an adjustment of a given standard [[predicate logic]] such as to relieve it of existential assumptions, and so make it a free logic. Taking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s predicate logic in his ''Principia Mathematica'' as standard, one replaces universal instantiation, <math>\\forall x \\,\\phi x \\rightarrow \\phi y</math>, with universal specification <math>(\\forall x \\,\\phi x \\and E!y \\,\\phi y) \\rightarrow \\phi z</math>. Thus universal statements, like \"All men are mortal,\" or \"Everything is a unicorn,\" do not presuppose that there are men or that there is anything.  These would be symbolized, with the appropriate predicates, as <math>\\forall x\\,(Mx \\rightarrow Lx)</math> and <math>\\forall x\\, Ux</math>, which in ''Principia Mathematica'' entail <math>\\exists x\\,(Mx \\and Lx)</math> and <math>\\exists x\\,Ux</math>, but not in free logic.  The truth of these last statements, when used in a free logic, depend on the [[Domain of discourse|domain of quantification]], which may be the null set.\n\n==Published works==\n* ''Philosophical Applications of Free Logic'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1991, \"A Theory of Definite Descriptions\", pp.&nbsp;17â€“27, details an account of Russell's Theory of Descriptions in free logic. In the process, he demonstrates how a formulation from Hintikka allows for a contradiction by a correlate in logic to Russell's Paradox. He introduces the predicate <math>(\\lambda x)(\\phi x \\and \\neg \\phi x)</math>\n* ''Free Logic.
