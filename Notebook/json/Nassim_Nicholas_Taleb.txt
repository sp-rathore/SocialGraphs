Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness.

Taleb disagrees with [[Plato]]nic (i.e., theoretical) approaches to reality to the extent that they lead people to have the wrong map of reality rather than no map at all.<ref name=Mouth /> He opposes most economic and grand social science theorizing, which in his view suffer acutely from the problem of overuse of Plato's ''Theory of Forms''. Based on these and other constructions, he advocates for what he calls a \"black swan robust\" society, meaning a society that can withstand difficult-to-predict events.<ref name=swans />\n\nHe has also proposed that biological, economic, and other systems exhibit an ability to benefit and grow from volatility—including particular types of random errors and events—a characteristic of these systems that he terms ''[[antifragility]].''<ref>Antoine Danchin, Philippe M.

His argument centers on the idea that predictive models are based on Plato's ''Theory of Forms'', gravitating towards mathematical purity and failing to take some key ideas into account, such as: the impossibility of possessing all relevant information, that small unknown variations in the data can have a huge impact, and flawed theories/models that are based on empirical data and that fail to consider events that have not taken place but could have taken place. Discussing the Ludic fallacy in ''The Black Swan'', he writes, \"The dark side of the moon is harder to see; beaming light on it costs energy. In the same way, beaming light on the unseen is costly in both computational and mental effort.\"\n\nIn the second edition of ''The Black Swan'', he posited that the foundations of [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative economics]] are faulty and highly self-referential. He states that statistics is fundamentally incomplete as a field as it cannot predict the risk of rare events, a problem that is acute in proportion to the rarity of these events. With the mathematician [[Raphael Douady]], he called the problem ''statistical undecidability'' (Douady and Taleb, 2010).\n\nTaleb sees his main challenge as mapping his ideas of \"robustification\" and \"[[anti-fragility]]\", that is, how to live and act in a world we do not understand and build robustness to black swan events. Taleb introduced the idea of the \"fourth quadrant\" in the exposure domain.<ref>Taleb, N. N. (2009). Errors, robustness, and the fourth quadrant. [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeintfor/v_3a25_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a744-759.htm International Journal of Forecasting, 25(4), 744-759]</ref> One of its applications is in his definition of the most effective (that is, least fragile) risk management approach: what he calls the 'barbell' strategy which is based on avoiding the middle in favor of linear combination of extremes, across all domains from politics to economics to one's personal life. These are deemed by Taleb to be more robust to estimation errors. For instance, he suggests that investing money in 'medium risk' investments is pointless because risk is difficult if not impossible to compute. His preferred strategy is to be both hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive at the same time. For example, an investor might put 80 to 90% of their money in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remainder going into highly risky and diversified speculative bets. An alternative suggestion is to engage in highly speculative bets with a limited downside.\n\nTaleb asserts that by adopting these strategies a portfolio can be \"robust\", that is, gain a positive exposure to black swan events while limiting losses suffered by such random events.<ref>Taleb, ''The Black Swan'', pg 207</ref> Together with [[Donald Geman]] and [[Hélyette Geman]], he modeled the \"maximum entropy barbell\" which consists in \"to constrain only what can be constrained (in a robust manner) and to maximize entropy elsewhere\", based on an insight by E.T. Jaynes that economic life increases in entropy under regulatory and other constraints.<ref>Geman, D., Geman, H., and Taleb, N. N. (2015). Tail risk constraints and maximum entropy. Entropy, 17(6):3724.</ref> Taleb also applies a similar barbell-style approach to health and exercise. Instead of doing steady and moderate exercise daily, he suggests that it is better to do a low-effort exercise such as walking slowly most of the time, while occasionally expending extreme effort. He avers that the human body evolved to live in a random environment, with various unexpected but intense efforts and much rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Praise and criticism==\nIn a 2008 article in ''The Times'', the journalist [[Bryan Appleyard]] described Taleb as \"now the hottest thinker in the world\".<ref name=\"business.timesonline.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4022091.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Nassim Nicholas Taleb the prophet of boom and doom | first=Bryan | last=Appleyard | date=2008-06-01 | accessdate=2010-05-19}}</ref> The [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Daniel Kahneman]] proposed the inclusion of Taleb's name among the world's top intellectuals, saying \"Taleb has changed the way many people think about uncertainty, particularly in the financial markets.

For the U.S. stock market, a single day, [[Black Monday (1987)|the crash of 1987]], determined 80% of the kurtosis. The same problem is found with interest and exchange rates, commodities, and other variables. The problem is not just that the data had \"fat tails\", something people knew but sort of wanted to forget; it was that we would never be able to determine \"how fat\" the tails were. Never. The implication is that those tools used in economics that are based on squaring variables (more technically, the Euclidean, or ''L''<sup>2</sup> norm), such as standard deviation, variance, correlation, regression, or value-at-risk, the kind of stuff you find in textbooks, are not valid scientifically (except in some rare cases where the variable is bounded).
