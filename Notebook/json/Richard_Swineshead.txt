He was perhaps the greatest of the [[Oxford Calculators]] of [[Merton College]], where he was a [[fellow]] certainly by 1344 and possibly by 1340. His magnum opus was a series of treatises known as the ''Liber calculationum'' (\"Book of Calculations\"), written c. 1350, which earned him the nickname of '''The Calculator'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|1959}}, page 69.</ref>\n\n[[Robert_Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (d. 1640) wrote in ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' that \"[[Julius_Caesar_Scaliger|Scaliger]] and [[Gerolamo_Cardano|Cardan]] admire Suisset the calculator, ''qui pene modum excessit humani ingenii'' [whose talents were almost superhuman]\".<ref>Jackson, Holbrook (ed.)
