Russell was appreciative and invited him to study in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nHe proposed landmark theoretical formulations of neural activity and generative processes that influenced diverse fields such as [[cognitive sciences]] and [[psychology]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]]s, [[computer science]], [[artificial neural network]]s, [[cybernetic]]s and [[artificial intelligence]], together with what has come to be known as the [[generative science]]s. He is best remembered for having written along with [[Warren McCulloch]], a seminal paper entitled \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\" (1943). This paper proposed the first mathematical model of a [[neural network]]. The unit of this model, a simple formalized neuron, is still the standard of reference in the field of neural networks. It is often called a [[McCulloch–Pitts neuron]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nWalter Pitts was born in [[Detroit]]. [[Michigan]] on April 23, 1923, the son of Walter and Marie (née Welsia). He was an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]] who taught himself [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] and was able to read several languages including [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. Although Bertrand Russell invited him to [[Cambridge University]] at the age of only 12, the offer was not taken up although Pitts did decide to become a logician.\n\n==Academic career==\n\nPitts probably continued to correspond with Bertrand Russell; and at the age of 15  he attended Russell's lectures at the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name=\"SMALHEISER2000\"/><ref name=\"ARBIB218\">Cf.

Aizawa 1992</ref>\n\nLater [[Warren McCulloch]] also arrived at the University of Chicago, and in early 1942 invited Pitts, who was still homeless, together with Lettvin to live with his family. In the evenings McCulloch and Pitts collaborated.  Pitts was familiar with the work of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] on computing and they considered the question of whether the nervous system could be considered a kind of universal computing device as described by Leibniz. This led to their seminal [[neural network]]s paper ''A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity''. After five years of unofficial studies, the University of Chicago awarded Pitts an [[Associate of Arts]] (his only earned degree) for his work on the paper.<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=4pjlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22Research+Laboratory+of+Electronics%22+%22walter+pitts%22&source=bl&ots=h2tzVFsnpp&sig=WR4V3znX1JBZCHLSVGoPNPrHMPI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7lKSgw7LOAhUJzoMKHTqFDF84ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22Research%20Laboratory%20of%20Electronics%22%20%22walter%20pitts%22&f=false</ref>\n\nIn 1943 Lettvin introduced Pitts to [[Norbert Wiener]] at [[MIT]], who had recently lost his \"right-hand man\". Their first meeting, where they discussed Wiener's proof of the [[ergodic theory|ergodic theorem]], went so well that Pitts moved to Boston to work with Wiener. While Pitts was an unofficial student under the aegis of Wiener at MIT until their acrimonious parting in 1952, he formally enrolled as a graduate student in the physics department during the 1943-1944 academic year and in the electrical engineering department from 1956-1958.<ref>Cf.

Lettvin</ref>\n\nFrom 1946, Pitts was a core member and involved with the [[Macy conferences]], whose principal purpose was to set the foundations for a general science of the workings of the human mind.\n\nIn 1951 Wiener convinced [[Jerome Wiesner]] to hire some physiologists of the nervous system. A group was established with Pitts, Lettvin, McCulloch, and [[Patrick David Wall|Pat Wall]].  Pitts wrote a large thesis on the properties of neural nets connected in three dimensions. Lettvin described him as \"in no uncertain sense the genius of the group … when you asked him a question, you would get back a whole textbook\". Pitts was also described as an eccentric, refusing to allow his name to be made publicly available. He refused all offers of advanced degrees or positions of authority at MIT (in part as he would have to sign his name), culminating in Pitts burning his unpublished doctoral dissertation and years of unpublished research following the publication of the paradigmatic \"What the Frog’s Eye Tells the Frog’s Brain\" (a collaboration with Lettvin, McCulloch and [[Humberto Maturana]] which conclusively demonstrated that \"analog processes in the eye were doing at least part of the interpretive work\" in image processing as opposed to \"the brain computing information digital neuron by digital neuron using the exacting implement of mathematical logic\") in 1959. Nevertheless, he remained employed as a research associate in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT]] \"as little more than a technicality\" from 1951 to 1969.<ref>http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic</ref>\n\n== Emotional trauma and decline ==\n\nIn 1952, Wiener suddenly turned against McCulloch—his wife, Margaret Wiener, hated McCulloch<ref name=\"Gefter_Nautilus\">{{cite magazine\n| last        = Gefter\n| first       = Amanda\n| date        = February 5, 2015\n| title       = The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic\n| url         = http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic\n| magazine    = Nautilus\n| publisher             = MIT Press and NautilusThink\n| publication-date      = February 5, 2015\n| issue                 = 21\n| issn                  = 2372-1758\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160614095134/http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic\n| archive-date= June 14, 2016\n| access-date = 13 Jul 2016\n| quote = There was just one person who wasn’t happy about the reunion: Wiener's wife. Margaret Wiener was, by all accounts, a controlling, conservative prude—and she despised McCulloch's influence on her husband. McCulloch hosted wild get-togethers at his family farm in Old Lyme, Connecticut, where ideas roamed free and everyone went skinny-dipping. It had been one thing when McCulloch was in Chicago, but now he was coming to Cambridge and Margaret wouldn’t have it. And so she invented a story. She sat Wiener down and informed him that when their daughter, Barbara, had stayed at McCulloch's house in Chicago, several of \"his boys\" had seduced her. Wiener immediately sent an angry telegram to Wiesner: \"Please inform [Pitts and Lettvin] that all connection between me and your projects is permanently abolished. They are your problem. Wiener.\" He never spoke to Pitts again.\n}}</ref>—and broke off relations with anyone connected to him, including Pitts.<ref name=\"Gefter_Nautilus\" /> Pitts became increasingly [[Social isolation|socially isolated]] for the rest of his life. He burned the manuscript on three-dimensional networks and took little further interest in work, excepting only a collaboration with Robert Gesteland which produced a paper on [[olfaction]].  Pitts died in 1969 of bleeding [[esophageal varices]], a condition usually associated with [[cirrhosis]] and [[alcoholism]].<ref name=\"SMALHEISER2000\"/><ref name=\"ARBIB218\"/><ref name=\"Gefter_Nautilus\" />\n\n==Publications==\n* Walter Pitts, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/xr117416q17648p5/ \"Some observations on the simple neuron circuit\"], ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biology'', Volume 4, Number 3, 121–129, 1942.\n* [[Warren McCulloch]] and Walter Pitts, \"A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity\", 1943, ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 5:115–133.\n: Reprinted in ''Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research''.
