R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India\"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.</ref> Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:\n\n{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.<ref name=\"Sharma, Arvind 2005\">Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''\"Dr. B. R.
