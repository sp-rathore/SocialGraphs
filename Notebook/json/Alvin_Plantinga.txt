He retired from the University of Notre Dame in 2010 and returned to Calvin College, where he serves as the first holder of the William Harry Jellema Chair in Philosophy.  He has trained many prominent philosophers working in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]] including [[Michael Bergmann (philosopher)|Michael Bergmann]] at Purdue and [[Michael Rea]] at Notre Dame, and [[Trenton Merricks]] working at [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Awards and honors===\nPlantinga served as president of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Western Division, 1981–1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanphilosophy.net/dmap/apa_presidents.htm|title=APA Presidents|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> and as President of the [[Society of Christian Philosophers]] 1983–1986.<ref name=\"Baker2007profile\" /><ref name=\"nnp\">[http://www.nnp.org/nni/Publications/Dutch-American/plantinga.html New Netherland Institute PLANTINGA, ALVIN]</ref>\n\nHe has honorary degrees from [[Glasgow University]] (1982), [[Calvin College]] (1986), [[North Park College]] (1994), the [[Free University of Amsterdam]] (1995), [[Brigham Young University]] (1996), and [[Valparaiso University]] (1999).<ref name=nnp/>\n\nHe was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]], 1971–1972, and elected a Fellow in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1975.<ref name=nnp/>\n\nIn 2006, the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s Center for Philosophy of Religion renamed its Distinguished Scholar Fellowship as the Alvin Plantinga Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~cprelig/events/index.shtml|title=Events|author=RKD // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> The fellowship includes an annual lecture by the current Plantinga Fellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~cprelig/plantinga/index.shtml|title=Center for Philosophy of Religion|author=RKD // AgencyND // University of Notre Dame|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the University of Pittsburgh's Philosophy Department, History and Philosophy of Science Department, and the Center for the History and Philosophy of Science co-awarded Plantinga the [[Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/news-story/nicholas-rescher-prize-systematic-philosophy-0|title=Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy|author=University of Pittsburgh University Marketing Communications Webteam|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2016}}</ref> which he received with a talk titled, \"Religion and Science: Where the Conflict Really Lies\".\n\n==Philosophical views==\nPlantinga has argued that some people can know that [[God]] exists as a [[basic belief]], requiring no argument. He developed this argument in two different fashions: firstly, in ''God and Other Minds'' (1967), by drawing an equivalence between the [[teleological argument]] and the common sense view that people have of [[Problem of other minds|other minds]] existing by analogy with their own minds.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Felder | first1 = D.

''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Oxford University Press, 1995.</ref>\n\n===Problem of evil===\n{{Main|Plantinga's free will defense}}\n\nPlantinga proposed a \"free will defense\" in a volume edited by [[Max Black]] in 1965,<ref>\"Free Will Defense\", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen & Unwin, 1965</ref> which attempts to refute the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]], the argument that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God.<ref name=\"BeebeIEP\">{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}\n</ref> Plantinga's argument (in a truncated form) states that \"It is possible that God, even being omnipotent, could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil. Furthermore, it is possible that God, even being omnibenevolent, would desire to create a world which contains evil if moral goodness requires free moral creatures.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Meister|2009|p=133}}</ref>\n\nPlantinga's defense has received wide acceptance among contemporary philosophers when addressing [[moral evil]].<ref>\"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil. [...] Because of [Plantinga's argument], it is now widely accepted that the logical problem of evil has been sufficiently rebutted.\" {{harvnb|Meister|2009|p=134}}\n</ref> However, the argument's handling of [[natural evil]] has been more heavily disputed, and its presupposition of a libertarianist, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will has been seen as problematic as well.<ref name=\"Peterson 1991 130–133\">{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}\n</ref> According to the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', the argument also \"conflicts with important theistic doctrines\", including the notion of [[heaven]] and the idea that God has free will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-log/#H10 |title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=July 2012}}</ref> [[J.L. Mackie]] sees Plantinga's free-will defense as incoherent.<ref>[[J.L. Mackie]] wrote: \"[H]ow could there be logically contingent states of affairs, ''prior to the creation and existence of any created beings with free will'', which an omnipotent god would have to accept and put up with? This suggestion is simply incoherent. Indeed, by bringing in the notion of individual essences which determine—presumably non-causally—how Curly Smith, Satan, and the rest of us would choose freely or would act in each hypothetical situation, Plantinga has not rescued the free will defence but made its weaknesses all too clear\". Mackie 1982, p. 174.\n</ref>\n\nPlantinga's well-received book ''God, Freedom and Evil'' written in 1974 gave his response to what he saw as the incomplete and uncritical view of theism's criticism of theodicy. Plantinga's contribution stated that when the issue of a comprehensive doctrine of freedom is added to the discussion of the goodness of God and the omnipotence of God then it is not possible to exclude the presence of evil in the world after introducing freedom into the discussion. Plantinga's own summary occurs in his discussion titled \"Could God Have Created a World Containing Moral Good but No Moral Evil,\" where he states his conclusion that, \"...the price for creating a world in which they produce moral good is creating one in which they also produce moral evil.\"<ref>Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom and Evil'', p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Reformed epistemology===\nPlantinga's contributions to epistemology include an argument which he dubs \"Reformed epistemology\". According to Reformed epistemology, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and due to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called \"proper functionalism\", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].\n\nPlantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm|Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour|BonJour]], [[William Alston|Alston]], [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]], and others.<ref>Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.</ref> In the book, Plantinga argues specifically that the theories of what he calls “warrant”-what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a property of a person holding a belief while warrant is a property of a belief)—put forth by these epistemologists have systematically failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.<ref>Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.</ref>\n\nIn the second book, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.<ref>\nAlvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.\n</ref> Plantinga's \"proper function\" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's \"belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers\" are functioning properly—\"working the way it ought to work\".<ref>WPF, p. 4</ref> Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a \"design plan\", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: \"it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans\",<ref>WPF, p. 21</ref> but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.<ref>WPF, 237.</ref>\n\nAccording to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:\n\n<blockquote>\n(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.<ref>\nPlantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.\n</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nPlantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as \"naturalistic\", including the \"functional generalization\" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].<ref>WPF, p. 199-211.</ref> Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the \"A/C\" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the \"Extended A/C\" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that specifically Christian theological beliefs including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation etc. Under this model, Christians are justified in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.\n\nJames Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga's ''Warrant'' trilogy, and specifically of his ''Warranted Christian Belief'', is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so \"the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beilby|first1=James|editor1-last=Baker|editor1-first=Deane-Peter|title=Alvin Plantinga|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-67143-4|pages=125–165|chapter=Plantinga's Model of Warranted Christian Belief}}</ref> rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.\n\n===Modal ontological argument===\nPlantinga has expressed a [[Ontological argument#Alvin Plantinga|modal logic version of the ontological argument]] in which he uses [[modal logic]] to develop, in a more rigorous and formal way, [[Norman Malcolm]]'s and [[Charles Hartshorne]]'s modal [[Anselm's argument|ontological arguments]].\n\n===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===\nIn Plantinga's [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], he argues that the truth of evolution is an epistemic [[defeater]] for naturalism (i.e. if evolution is true, it undermines [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]]). His basic argument is that if evolution and naturalism are both true, human cognitive faculties evolved to produce beliefs that have survival value (maximizing one's success at the four F's: \"feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproducing\"), not necessarily to produce beliefs that are true. Thus, since human cognitive faculties are tuned to survival rather than truth in the naturalism-evolution model, there is reason to doubt the veracity of the products of those same faculties, including naturalism and evolution themselves. On the other hand, if God created man \"[[image of God|in his image]]\" by way of an evolutionary process (or any other means), then Plantinga argues our faculties would probably be reliable.\n\nThe argument does not assume any necessary correlation (or uncorrelation) between true beliefs and survival. Making the contrary assumption—that there is in fact a relatively strong correlation between truth and survival—if human belief-forming apparatus evolved giving a survival advantage, then it ought to yield truth since true beliefs confer a survival advantage. Plantinga counters that, while there may be overlap between true beliefs and beliefs that contribute to survival, the two kinds of beliefs are not the same, and he gives the following example with a man named Paul:\n\n{{bquote|Perhaps Paul very much ''likes'' the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him. This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it... Clearly there are any number of belief-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.<ref>Plantinga, Alvin ''Warrant and Proper Function'', (New York: Oxford University Press), 1993. pp. 225–226 (ISBN 978-0-19-507864-0).</ref>}}\n\nAlthough the argument has been criticized by some philosophers, like [[Elliott Sober]], it has received favorable notice from [[Thomas Nagel]] and others.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Evolution and Christianity===\nIn the past, Plantinga has lent support to the [[intelligent design movement]].<ref>\n*\"…design proponents such as Alvin Plantinga…\" — [http://www.arn.org/docs/pearcey/np_ctoday052200.htm We're Not in Kansas Anymore], [[Nancy Pearcey]], [[Christianity Today]], May 22, 2000, cited in {{harvnb|Forrest|Gross|2004|p=18}}\n*\"Alvin Plantinga … lent moral support to the design camp\" — ''[[The Creationists]]'', Expanded Edition, p397\n*\"a number of others like Alvin Plantinga are long-time [[Wedge strategy|Wedge]] allies\" — {{harvnb|Forrest|Gross|2004|pp=212–213}}\n*\"Alvin Plantinga was also a signatory to this letter, early evidence of his continuing support of the intelligent design movement\" — ''Intelligent design creationism and its critics'', [[Robert T.

The hallmark of intelligent design, however, is the claim that this can be shown scientifically; I'm dubious about that.\n\n...As far as I can see, God certainly could have used Darwinian processes to create the living world and direct it as he wanted to go; hence evolution as such does not imply that there is no direction in the history of life. What does have that implication is not evolutionary theory itself, but ''unguided'' evolution, the idea that neither God nor any other person has taken a hand in guiding, directing or orchestrating the course of evolution. But the scientific theory of evolution, sensibly enough, says nothing one way or the other about divine guidance. It doesn't say that evolution is divinely guided; it also doesn't say that it isn't. Like almost any theist, I reject unguided evolution; but the contemporary scientific theory of evolution just as such—apart from philosophical or theological add-ons—doesn't say that evolution is unguided. Like science in general, it makes no pronouncements on the existence or activity of God.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ | title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers |publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=April 11, 2010 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Selected works by Plantinga==\n* ''[[God and Other Minds]]''.
