According to his obituary on the Cambridge web site, he was \"recognized as one of the leading [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] and [[epistemology|epistemologists]] in the world.\"\n\n==Career==\nLipton was an undergraduate at [[Wesleyan University]] and a graduate student at [[Oxford University]]. Before coming to Cambridge, he taught at [[Clark University]] and [[Williams College]]. He was a member of the [[Nuffield Council]] on [[Bioethics]] and chaired the working party that produced ''Pharmacogenetics: Ethical Issues''. He was also on the [[AskPhilosophers]] panel. In 2004, Lipton had the honour of being the [[Medawar Prize Lecturer]] of the [[Royal Society]].\n\nLipton's research interests focused on the philosophy of science, including topics such as [[explanation]], [[inference]], [[Test method|testing]], [[theory change]], [[Physical law|laws of nature]], and [[scientific realism]]. Lipton's research in philosophy of science led him to do work in other related areas of philosophy; in [[epistemology]], Lipton also investigated the philosophy of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Testimony, philosophical problems of|testimony]]. Likewise in [[philosophy of mind]] Lipton researched notions of [[mental content]] and the [[mind-body problem]].\n\nHe was a member of the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] (2003â€“2007).\n\n==Personal life==\nLipton lived with his wife Diana and two sons Jonah and Jacob. He was a self-confessed \"religious atheist\"; he held that he could follow the customs and culture of a Jewish lifestyle, and use the teachings of [[Judaism]] to help him tackle moral problems in life, without simultaneously believing in the [[metaphysics]] of such a religion (such as the existence of [[God]]).\n\nOn 25 November 2007, Lipton suffered a fatal [[heart attack]] after playing a game of [[Squash (sport)|squash]].  He was succeeded in his capacity as Head of Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the [[University of Cambridge]] by Professor [[John Forrester (historian of philosophy and science)|John Forrester]].\n\n==Selected publications==\n* \"Wouldn't It Be Lovely: Explanation and Scientific Realism\", ''Metascience'' 14, 3 (2006) 331-361.
