Several of the philosophical fragments are derived from commentators on Homer.<ref>Three fragments (27, 31, 33) come from the ''Homeric Allegories'', two (30, 32) are from Homeric scholia.</ref> It is thus likely that the philosophical remarks of Xenophanes were expressed incidentally in his satires.<ref name=\"burnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm |title=Early Greek Philosophy by John Burnet, 3rd edition (1920) |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> The satires are called ''Silloi'' by late writers, and this name may go back to Xenophanes himself, but it may originate in the fact that [[Timon of Phlius]], the \"sillographer\" (3rd century BC), put much of his own satire upon philosophers into the mouth of Xenophanes.<ref name=\"burnet\"/>\n\n==Theology==\nXenophanes' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the fourth century. He satirized traditional religious views of his time as human [[Psychological projection|projections]].<ref>Johansen, Karsten Friis [https://books.google.com/books?id=3waGV4BJmfQC&pg=PA49 ''A history of ancient philosophy: from the beginnings to Augustine''] p.49</ref> He aimed his critique at the polytheistic religious views of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries: \"Homer and Hesiod,\" one fragment states, \"have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deception.\" [[Sextus Empiricus]] reported that<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', I.289, and IX.192f.</ref> such observations were appreciated by [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]].  Xenophanes is quoted, memorably, in [[Clement of Alexandria]],<ref>Clement, ''Miscellanies'' V.110 and VII.22.</ref> arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic:\n<blockquote>But if cattle and horses and lions had hands<br>or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,<br>horses like horses and cattle like cattle<br>also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies<br>of such a sort as the form they themselves have.<br>...<br>[[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] say that their gods are snub–nosed [σιμούς] and black<br>[[Thracians]] that they are pale and red-haired.<ref>Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16. Many other translations of this passage have Xenophanes state that the Thracians were \"blond\".</ref></blockquote> \nAn additional criticism of the gods is found in the quote<br>\n<blockquote>The gods have not, of course, revealed all things to mortals<br>\n:from the beginning;\nbut rather, seeking in the course of time, they discover<br>\n:what is better.<ref>Stephen M. Trzaskoma, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Brunet, Thomas G. Palaima; ''Anthology of Classical Myth: Primary Sources in Translation'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=K4pZr3JfYqcC&pg=PA43 p. 433].</ref><br></blockquote>\nXenophanes could be trying to say that humans are independent of the gods with their intelligence, that discoveries in science and other areas are the result of human work and not divine favors, thus removing the gods from the role of receiving credit for human accomplishment.<br>\nOther passages quoted by Clement of Alexandria that argue against the traditional Greek conception of gods include:\n# \"One god, greatest among gods and humans,<br>like mortals neither in form nor in thought.\"<ref name=\"osborne62\">Osborne, Catherine. \"Chapter 4.\" ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.</ref>\n# \"But mortals think that the gods are born<br>and have the mortals' own clothes and voice and form.\"<ref name=\"osborne62\"/>\n\nRegarding Xenophanes' theology five key concepts about God can be formed. God is: beyond human morality, does not resemble human form, cannot die or be born (God is divine thus eternal), no divine hierarchy exists, and God does not intervene in human affairs.<ref name=\"mckirahan6062\">McKirahan, Richard D. \"Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 60-62. Print.</ref> While Xenophanes is rejecting Homeric theology, he is not questioning the presence of a divine entity, rather his philosophy is a critique on Ancient Greek writers and their conception of divinity.<ref>McKirahan, Richard D. \"Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.</ref> There is also the concept of God being whole with the universe, essentially controlling it, while at the same time being physically unconnected.<ref name=\"mckirahan6062\"/>\n\nXenophanes espoused a belief that \"[[God]] is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind.\"<ref>Zeller, Vorsokrastische Philosophie, p. 530, n. 3.</ref> He maintained there was one greatest God. God is one eternal being, spherical in form, comprehending all things within himself, is the absolute [[Nous|mind]] and thought,<ref name=\"dl19\" /> therefore is intelligent, and moves all things, but bears no resemblance to human nature either in body or mind. He is considered by some to be a precursor to [[Parmenides]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. Because of his development of the concept of a \"one [[god]] greatest among gods and men\" that is abstract, universal, unchanging, immobile and always present, Xenophanes is often seen as one of the first [[Monotheism|monotheists]], in the [[Western world|Western]] philosophy of [[religion]], although the quotation that seems to point to Xenophanes's monotheism also refers to multiple \"gods\" who the supreme God is greater than. Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] specifically identified Xenophanes as one of the earliest [[pandeist]]s.<ref>Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' (\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\") (1910), page 231: \"Pandeistisch ist, wenn der Eleate Xenophanes (aus Kolophon um 580-492 v. Chr.) von Gott gesagt haben soll: \"Er ist ganz und gar Geist und Gedanke und ewig\", \"er sieht ganz und gar, er denkt ganz und gar, er hört ganz und gar.\"</ref>\n\n== Physical ideas ==\nXenophanes wrote about two extremes predominating the world: wet and dry (water and earth).<ref name=\"mckirahan65\">McKirahan, Richard D. \"Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 65. Print.</ref> These two extreme states would alternate between one another, and with the alternation human life would become extinct, then regenerate (or vice versa depending on the dominant form).<ref name=\"mckirahan66\">McKirahan, Richard D. \"Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 66. Print.</ref> The idea of alternating states and human life perishing and coming back suggests he believed in the principle of causation, another distinguishing step that Xenophanes takes away from Ancient philosophical traditions to ones based more on scientific observation.<ref name=\"mckirahan66\"/> The argument can be considered a rebuke to Anaximenes' air theory.<ref name=\"mckirahan65\"/> A detailed account of the wet and dry form theory is found in Hippolytus' ''Refutation''.\n\nHe also holds that there is an infinite number of worlds, not overlapping in time.<ref name=\"dl19\" />\n\nXenophanes concluded from his examination of [[fossil]]s that [[water]] once must have covered all of the [[Earth]]'s surface. The use of evidence is an important step in advancing from simply stating an idea to backing it up by evidence and observation.<ref name=\"mckirahan66\"/>\n\n=== Knowing ===\n\nXenophanes is credited with being one of the first philosophers to distinguish between true belief and knowledge, which he further developed into the prospect that you can know something but not really know it.<ref>Osborne, Catherine. \"Chapter 4.\" ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 66-67. Print.</ref> Due to the lack of whole works by Xenophanes, a lot of meaning is lost and a large amount of guessing is at hand, so that the implication of knowing being something deeper (\"a clearer truth\") may have special implications, or it may mean that you cannot know something just by looking at it.<ref>Osborne, Catherine. \"Chapter 4.\" ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 67. Print.</ref> It is known that the most and widest variety of evidence was considered by Xenophanes to be the surest way to prove a theory.<ref name=\"mckirahan66\"/>\n\nHis [[epistemology]], which is still influential today, held that there actually exists a [[truth]] of [[reality]], but that humans as mortals are unable to know it. [[Karl Popper]] read Xenophanes as saying that it is possible to act only on the basis of working [[hypotheses]]—we may act as if we knew the truth, as long as we know that this is extremely unlikely.<ref>K. Popper, A. Friemuth Petersen, J. Mejer: [https://books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&pg=PA46&dq=B34 The World of Parmenides, p. 46]</ref> Xenophanes' views then might serve as a basis of [[Critical rationalism]].\n\nIn today's philosophical and classics discourse, Xenophanes is seen as one of the most important [[presocratic philosophy|presocratic philosophers]]. It had also been common since antiquity to see him as the teacher of [[Zeno of Elea]], the colleague of [[Parmenides]], and generally associated with the [[Eleatic school]], but common opinion today is likewise that this is false.<ref>Lesher, p. 102.</ref>\n\nThere is one fragment dealing with the management of a feast, another which denounces the exaggerated importance attached to athletic victories, and several which deny the humanized gods of Homer. Arguments such as these made Xenophanes infamous for his attacks on \"conventional military and athletic virtues of the time\" and well known to side with the intellectual instead.<ref name=\"yorku1\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Editions===\n* [[Eduard Zeller|E.
