The character of the Buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent (Skt. ''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world. In the ''Mahāvastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supra-mundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such \"in conformity with the world\"; omniscience, and the ability to \"suppress karma\".{{sfn|Jones|1956|p=}} Nevertheless, some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources. In modern times there has been an attempt to form a [[secularity|secular understanding]] of Siddhārtha Gautama's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies.\n\nAndrew Skilton writes that the Buddha was never historically regarded by Buddhist traditions as being merely human:\n{{quote|It is important to stress that, despite modern Theravada teachings to the contrary (often a sop to skeptical Western pupils), he was never seen as being merely human. For instance, he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a ''mahāpuruṣa'', \"superman\"; the Buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a [[Deva (Buddhism)|god]]; and in the ''[[Mahaparinibbana Sutta|Mahāparinibbāna Sutta]]'' he states that he could live for an [[Kalpa (aeon)|aeon]] were he asked to do so.{{sfn|Skilton|2004|p=64-65}}}}\nThe ancient Indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies, being more focused on philosophy. Buddhist texts reflect this tendency, providing a clearer picture of what Gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life.

Gautama was the [[family name]]. His mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]] (Māyādevī), Suddhodana's wife, was a [[Koli people|Koliyan]] princess.

As was the Shakya tradition, when his mother Queen Maya became pregnant, she left Kapilvastu for her father's kingdom to give birth.  However, her son is said to have been born on the way, at Lumbini, in a garden beneath a [[Shorea robusta|sal tree]].\n\nThe day of the Buddha's birth is widely celebrated in Theravada countries as [[Vesak]].{{sfn|Turpie|2001|p=3}} [[Buddha's Birthday]] is called ''Buddha [[Purnima]]'' in Nepal, Bangladesh, and India as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day. Various sources hold that the Buddha's mother died at his birth, a few days or seven days later. The infant was given the name Siddhartha (Pāli: Siddhattha), meaning \"he who achieves his aim\". During the birth celebrations, the hermit seer [[Asita]] journeyed from his mountain abode and announced that the child would either become a great king ([[chakravartin]]) or a great [[sadhu]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=9–12}} By traditional account,{{Which|date=November 2010}} this occurred after Siddhartha placed his feet in Asita's hair and Asita examined the birthmarks. Suddhodana held a naming ceremony on the fifth day, and invited eight [[Brahmin]] scholars to read the future. All gave a dual prediction that the baby would either become a great king or a great holy man.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=9–12}} [[Kaundinya|Kondañña]], the youngest, and later to be the first [[arhat]] other than the Buddha, was reputed to be the only one who unequivocally predicted that Siddhartha would become a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=11-12}}\n\nWhile later tradition and legend characterized Śuddhodana as a [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]], the [[Kinship|descendant]] of the [[Suryavansha]] (Solar dynasty) of {{IAST|Ikṣvāku}} (Pāli: Okkāka), many scholars think that Śuddhodana was the elected chief of a tribal confederacy.\n\nEarly texts suggest that Gautama was not familiar with the dominant religious teachings of his time until he left on his religious quest, which is said to have been motivated by existential concern for the human condition.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=47}} The state of the Shakya clan was not a monarchy, and seems to have been structured either as an [[oligarchy]], or as a form of republic.{{sfn|Gombrich|1988|pages=49-50}} The more egalitarian gana-sangha form of government, as a political alternative to the strongly hierarchical kingdoms, may have influenced the development of the śramanic [[Jain monasticism|Jain]] and Buddhist [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]], where monarchies tended toward [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic Brahmanism]].{{sfn|Thapar|2002|p=146}}\n\n=== Early life and marriage ===\n[[File:Departure of Siddhartha.jpg|thumb|upright|Departure of Prince Siddhartha]]\n\nSiddhartha was brought up by his mother's younger sister, [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Maha Pajapati]].{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=14}} By tradition, he is said to have been destined by birth to the life of a prince, and had three palaces (for seasonal occupation) built for him. Although more recent scholarship doubts this status, his father, said to be King Śuddhodana, wishing for his son to be a great king, is said to have shielded him from religious teachings and from knowledge of human [[dukkha|suffering]].\n\nWhen he reached the age of 16, his father reputedly arranged his marriage to a cousin of the same age named [[Yashodhara|Yaśodharā]] (Pāli: Yasodharā). According to the traditional account,{{Which|date=November 2010}} she gave birth to a son, named [[Rāhula]]. Siddhartha is said to have spent 29 years as a prince in [[Kapilavastu (Shakya capital)|Kapilavastu]]. Although his father ensured that Siddhartha was provided with everything he could want or need, Buddhist scriptures say that the future Buddha felt that material wealth was not life's ultimate goal.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=14}}\n\n=== Renunciation and ascetic life ===\n[[File:The Victory of Buddha.jpg|thumb|The Victory of Buddha]]\n[[File:Great Departure.JPG|thumb|The \"Great Departure\" of Siddhartha Gautama, surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], he is accompanied by numerous guards, [[maithuna]] loving couples, and [[devata]] who have come to pay homage; [[Gandhara]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]\n[[File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|thumb|Prince Siddhartha shaves his hair and becomes an [[ascetic]].

Despite his father's efforts to hide from him the sick, aged and suffering, Siddhartha was said to have seen an old man. When his charioteer [[Channa (Buddhist)|Channa]] explained to him that all people grew old, the prince went on further trips beyond the palace. On these he encountered a [[disease]]d man, a decaying [[Cadaver|corpse]], and an [[Asceticism|ascetic]]. These depressed him, and he initially strove to overcome aging, sickness, and death by living the life of an ascetic.{{sfn|Conze|1959|p=39-40}}\n\nAccompanied by Channa and riding his horse [[Kanthaka]], Gautama quit his palace for the life of a [[mendicant]]. It's said that, \"the horse's hooves were muffled by the gods\"{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=15-16}} to prevent guards from knowing of his departure.\n\nGautama initially went to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]] and began his ascetic life by begging for alms in the street. After King Bimbisara's men recognised Siddhartha and the king learned of his quest, Bimbisara offered Siddhartha the throne. Siddhartha rejected the offer, but promised to visit his kingdom of [[Magadha]] first, upon attaining enlightenment.\n\nHe left Rajagaha and practised under two hermit teachers of [[yogic]] meditation.{{sfn|Upadhyaya|1971|p=95}}{{sfn|Laumakis|2008|p=8}}{{sfn|Grubin|2010|p=}} After mastering the teachings of [[Alara Kalama]] (Skr.

Udraka Rāmaputra).{{sfn|Armstrong|2004|p=77}} With him he achieved high levels of meditative consciousness, and was again asked to succeed his teacher. But, once more, he was not satisfied, and again moved on.{{sfn|Narada|1992|p=19-20}}\n\nSiddhartha and a group of five companions led by [[Kaundinya]] are then said to have set out to take their austerities even further. They tried to find enlightenment through deprivation of worldly goods, including food, practising [[Mortification of the flesh|self-mortification]]. After nearly starving himself to death by restricting his food intake to around a leaf or nut per day, he collapsed in a river while bathing and almost drowned. Siddhartha was rescued by a village girl named Sujata and she gave him some [[payasam]] (a pudding made from milk and [[jaggery]]) after which Siddhartha got back some energy. Siddhartha began to reconsider his path. Then, he remembered a moment in childhood in which he had been watching his father start the season's ploughing. He attained a concentrated and focused state that was blissful and refreshing, the [[jhāna]].\n\n=== Awakening ===\n[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Victory Over Mara.jpeg|thumb|right|The Buddha surrounded by the demons of [[Mara (demon)|Māra]].

He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, [[Brahma (Buddhism)#Brahmā Sahampati|Brahmā Sahampati]] convinced him, arguing that at least some will understand it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.\n\n=== Formation of the sangha ===\n[[File:Sarnath1.jpg|thumb|[[Dhamek Stupa]] in Sârnâth, India, site of the first teaching of the Buddha in which he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]] to his first five disciples]]\n\nAfter his awakening, the Buddha met [[Trapusa and Bahalika|Taphussa and Bhallika]]&nbsp;— two merchant brothers from the city of [[Balkh]] in what is currently Afghanistan&nbsp;— who became his first lay disciples. It is said that each was given hairs from his head, which are now claimed to be enshrined as [[Śarīra|relics]] in the [[Shwe Dagon]] Temple in [[Rangoon]], [[Burma]]. The Buddha intended to visit [[Asita]], and his former teachers, [[Alara Kalama]] and [[Udaka Ramaputta]], to explain his findings, but they had already died.\n\nHe then travelled to the [[Sarnath|Deer Park]] near [[Varanasi]] (Benares) in northern India, where he set in motion what Buddhists call the [[Dharmacakra|Wheel of Dharma]] by delivering his first sermon to the five companions with whom he had sought enlightenment. Together with him, they formed the first [[Sangha (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṅgha}}]]: the company of Buddhist monks.\n\nAll five become [[arahants]], and within the first two months, with the conversion of [[Yasa]] and fifty four of his friends, the number of such arahants is said to have grown to 60. The conversion of three brothers named Kassapa followed, with their reputed 200, 300 and 500 disciples, respectively. This swelled the sangha to more than 1,000.\n\n=== Travels and teaching ===\n[[File:TheBuddhaAndVajrapaniGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddha with his protector [[Vajrapani]], [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]], 2nd century CE, Ostasiatische Kunst Museum]]\n\nFor the remaining 45 years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the [[Gangetic Plain]], in what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and southern [[Nepal]], teaching a diverse range of people: from nobles to servants, murderers such as [[Angulimala]], and cannibals such as Alavaka.{{sfn | Malalasekera|1960| pp = 291-292}} Although the Buddha's language remains unknown, it's likely that he taught in one or more of a variety of closely related Middle Indo-Aryan dialects, of which [[Pali]] may be a standardization.\n\nThe sangha traveled through the subcontinent, expounding the dharma. This continued throughout the year, except during the four months of the [[Vāsanā]] rainy season when ascetics of all religions rarely traveled. One reason was that it was more difficult to do so without causing harm to animal life. At this time of year, the sangha would retreat to monasteries, public parks or forests, where people would come to them.\n\n[[File:Vulturepeak1.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Griddhraj Parvat|Vulture Peak]], where the [[Atanatiya Sutta]] was held]]\n\nThe first vassana was spent at [[Varanasi]] when the sangha was formed. After this, the Buddha kept a promise to travel to [[Rajgir|Rajagaha]], capital of [[Magadha]], to visit King [[Bimbisara]]. During this visit, [[Sariputta]] and [[Maudgalyayana]] were converted by [[Assaji]], one of the first five disciples, after which they were to become the Buddha's two foremost followers. The Buddha spent the next three seasons at Veluvana Bamboo Grove monastery in Rajagaha, capital of Magadha.\n\nUpon hearing of his son's awakening, Suddhodana sent, over a period, ten delegations to ask him to return to Kapilavastu. On the first nine occasions, the delegates failed to deliver the message, and instead joined the sangha to become arahants. The tenth delegation, led by Kaludayi, a childhood friend of Gautama's (who also became an arahant), however, delivered the message.\n\nNow two years after his awakening, the Buddha agreed to return, and made a two-month journey by foot to Kapilavastu, teaching the dharma as he went. At his return, the royal palace prepared a midday meal, but the sangha was making an alms round in Kapilavastu. Hearing this, Suddhodana approached his son, the Buddha, saying:\n{{quote|\"Ours is the warrior lineage of Mahamassata, and not a single warrior has gone seeking alms.\"}}\n\nThe Buddha is said to have replied:\n{{quote|\"That is not the custom of your royal lineage. But it is the custom of my Buddha lineage. Several thousands of Buddhas have gone by seeking alms.\"}}\n\nBuddhist texts say that Suddhodana invited the sangha into the palace for the meal, followed by a dharma talk. After this he is said to have become a [[sotapanna]]. During the visit, many members of the royal family joined the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. The Buddha's cousins [[Ananda]] and [[Anuruddha]] became two of his five chief disciples. At the age of seven, his son [[Rahula]] also joined, and became one of his ten chief disciples. His half-brother [[Nanda (Buddhist)|Nanda]] also joined and became an arahant.\n\nOf the Buddha's disciples, Sariputta, [[Maudgalyayana]], [[Mahakasyapa]], Ananda and Anuruddha are believed to have been the five closest to him. His ten foremost disciples were reputedly completed by the quintet of [[Upali]], [[Subhoti]], Rahula, [[Mahakaccana]] and [[Punna]].\n\nIn the fifth vassana, the Buddha was staying at Mahavana near [[Vesali]] when he heard news of the impending death of his father. He is said to have gone to Suddhodana and taught the dharma, after which his father became an arahant.\n\n[[File:The last days of buddha teachings.jpg|thumb|The last days of buddha teachings]]The king's death and cremation was to inspire the creation of an order of nuns. Buddhist texts record that the Buddha was reluctant to ordain women. His foster mother [[Maha Pajapati]], for example, approached him, asking to join the sangha, but he refused. Maha Pajapati, however, was so intent on the path of awakening that she led a group of royal Sakyan and Koliyan ladies, which followed the sangha on a long journey to Rajagaha. In time, after Ananda championed their cause, the Buddha is said to have reconsidered and, five years after the formation of the sangha, agreed to the ordination of women as nuns. He reasoned that males and females had an equal capacity for awakening. But he gave women additional rules ([[Vinaya]]) to follow.\n\n=== Mahaparinirvana ===\n[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Buddha Parinirvana.jpeg|thumb|The Buddha's entry into [[Parinirvana]].

After this, the Buddha ate his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named [[Cunda (Buddhism)|Cunda]]. Falling violently ill, Buddha instructed his attendant [[Ananda|Ānanda]] to convince Cunda that the meal eaten at his place had nothing to do with his passing and that his meal would be a source of the greatest merit as it provided the last meal for a Buddha.<ref group= web>{{Citation | publisher = Access insight | chapter-url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html | chapter = Maha-parinibbana Sutta | title = [[Digha Nikaya]] | number = 16 | at = verse 56}}</ref> Mettanando and [[Oskar von Hinüber|von Hinüber]] argue that the Buddha died of [[Superior mesenteric artery syndrome|mesenteric]] [[infarction]], a symptom of old age, rather than food poisoning.{{sfn|Mettanando| 2000}}<ref group=\"web\">{{cite web |last=Mettanando |url = http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |title=Buddha net |date=2001-05-15 |accessdate=25 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114032016/http://www.buddhanet.net/budsas/ebud/ebdha192.htm |archivedate=14 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe precise contents of the Buddha's final meal are not clear, due to variant scriptural traditions and ambiguity over the translation of certain significant terms; the [[Theravada]] tradition generally believes that the Buddha was offered some kind of pork, while the [[Mahayana]] tradition believes that the Buddha consumed some sort of truffle or other mushroom.  These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns.\n\n[[Arthur Waley|Waley]] suggests that Theravadin's would take ''suukaramaddava'' (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as ''pig-soft'', to mean \"soft flesh of a pig\" or \"pig's soft-food\", that is, after [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]], a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a [[truffle]]. He argues (also after Neumann) that as \"(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical\", as there are several plants known to have ''suukara-'' (pig) as part of their names,<ref group = note name= \"Wayley1932\">Waley notes: ''suukara-kanda'', \"pig-bulb\"; ''suukara-paadika'', \"pig's foot\" and  ''sukaresh.ta''  \"sought-out by pigs\".  He cites Neumann's suggestion that if a plant called \"sought-out by pigs\" exists then ''suukaramaddava'' can mean \"pig's delight\".</ref> and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, ''suukaramaddava'' could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions. Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described. Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly.{{sfn|Waley|1932|pp= 343–54}}\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha died at Kuśināra (present-day [[Kushinagar]], India), which became a pilgrimage center.{{sfn |Huntington|1986|p=47}} Ananda protested the Buddha's decision to enter Parinirvana in the abandoned jungles of [[Kushinagar|Kuśināra]]  of the [[Malla (India)|Malla]] kingdom. The Buddha, however, is said to have reminded Ananda how Kushinara was a land once ruled by a righteous wheel-turning king and the appropriate place for him to die.{{sfn|Von Hinüber|2009|p=49}}\n\nThe Buddha then asked all the attendant [[Bhikkhu]]s to clarify any doubts or questions they had and cleared them all in a way which others could not do. They had none. According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana. The Buddha's final words are reported to have been: \"All composite things ([[Saṅkhāra]]) are perishable.

According to two textual records in Chinese ({{lang|zh|十八部論}} and {{lang |zh|部執異論}}), the coronation of Emperor Aśoka is 116 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the time of Buddha's passing is either 486 BCE according to Theravāda record or 383 BCE according to Mahayana record. However, the actual date traditionally accepted as the date of the Buddha's death in Theravāda countries is 544 or 545 BCE, because the reign of Emperor Aśoka was traditionally reckoned to be about 60 years earlier than current estimates. In Burmese Buddhist tradition, the date of the Buddha's death is 13 May 544 BCE.{{sfn |Kala |1724|p = 39}} whereas in Thai tradition it is 11 March 545 BCE.{{sfn|Eade | 1995 |pp = 15–16}}\n\nAt his death, the Buddha is famously believed to have told his disciples to follow no leader.
