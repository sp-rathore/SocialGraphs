He has also published articles in the [[philosophy of language]], [[metaphysics]], and [[social choice theory]].<ref name=\"Gibbard1973\">{{cite journal |first=Allan |last=Gibbard |title=Manipulation of Voting Schemes: A General Result |journal=[[Econometrica]] |volume=41 |issue=4 |year=1973 |pages=587–601 |jstor=1914083 }}</ref>\n\n==Education and Career==\n\nGibbard received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[mathematics]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1963 with minors in [[physics]] and philosophy. After teaching mathematics and physics in [[Ghana]] with the [[Peace Corps]] (1963–1965), Gibbard studied philosophy at [[Harvard University]], participating in the seminar on social and political philosophy with [[John Rawls]], [[Kenneth J. Arrow]], [[Amartya K. Sen]], and [[Robert Nozick]]. In 1971 Gibbard earned his [[Ph.D.]], writing a dissertation under the direction of [[John Rawls]].\n\nHe served as professor of philosophy at the [[University of Chicago]] (1969–1974), and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] (1974–1977), before joining the University of Michigan. Gibbard chaired the University of Michigan's Philosophy Department (1987–1988) and has held the title of Richard B. Brandt Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy since 1994.  He retired in 2016.\n\nGibbard was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1990 and was elected a Fellow of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2009,<ref>http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=04282009</ref> one of only two living philosophers to be so honored (the other being [[Brian Skyrms]]).<ref>http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/events/2015-iss-conference/conference-presenters-1/brian-skyrms-uc-irvine</ref> and the [[Econometric Society]], and has also received Fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]. He served as President of the Central Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]] from 2001 to 2002.  He gave the [[Tanner Lectures]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2006.<ref>http://tannerlectures.berkeley.edu/2005-2006/</ref>\n\n==Philosophical work==\nSoon after his doctoral degree, Gibbard provided a first proof of a conjecture that [[strategic voting]] was an intrinsic feature of [[Arrow impossibility theorem|non-dictatorial]] voting systems with at least three choices, a conjecture of [[Michael Dummett]] and [[Robin Farquharson]]. Once established, this result has been known as the [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem]].<ref name=\"Gibbard1973\" /><ref>{{cite journal |first=Mark A. |last=Satterthwaite |title=Strategy-proofness and Arrow's Conditions: Existence and Correspondence Theorems for Voting Procedures and Social Welfare Functions |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=10 |year=1975 |issue=2 |pages=187–217 |doi=10.1016/0022-0531(75)90050-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Dummett |authorlink=Michael Dummett |title=Voting Procedures |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-19-876188-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOFRAQAAIAAJ }}</ref>\n\nGibbard is best-known in philosophy for his contributions to ethical theory.  He is the author of three books in this area.  ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings: A Theory of Normative Judgment'' (1990) develops a general [[theory]] of moral [[judgment]] and judgments of rationality. Gibbard argues that when we endorse someone's action, belief, or feeling as \"rational\" or warranted we are expressing acceptance of a system of norms that permits it. More narrowly, morality is about norms relating to the aptness of moral feelings (such as guilt and resentment).<ref>Allan Gibbard (1990). ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings''.
