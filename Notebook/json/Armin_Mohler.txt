He was called up to the [[Military of Switzerland|Swiss army]] at the age of 20 but, after reading the works of [[Oswald Spengler]] and the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet-Union]] in June 1941, he became a supporter of [[Nazi Germany]] and defected to that country in 1942 with the aim of joining the [[Waffen SS]]. Mohler was not trusted by SS-authorities and they refused to accept him. Despite of that he remained in Berlin for another year before returning to Switzerland, where he was incarcerated for [[desertion]].\n\nAfter World War II he returned to study in [[Berlin]] and completed his doctoral thesis ''Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932 (The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932)'' under [[Karl Jaspers]] in 1949. The aim of his thesis was not merely scientific, but also providing old traditions for new pathways for a non-[[national socialist]] Right in post-war Germany. In the same year, he worked as a secretary for his idol [[Ernst Jünger]], but increasingly felt that Jünger had become too moderate for his taste after the end of the war.\n\nMohler went on to work as a correspondent in [[Paris]] for ''[[Die Zeit]]'' from 1953 to 1961. After that he lived in [[Munich]], leading the Carl Friedrich von Siemens Foundation. For a brief period he worked as a speech writer for [[Franz Josef Strauß]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://business-and-science.de/ghostwriter-von-franz-josef-strauss|title=Ghostwriter von Franz Josef Strauß - Business And Science|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref>, but his influence was marginal. In 1967, he became the first to receive the [[Konrad Adenauer Prize]], which provoked strong media attacks on him.\n\nIn 1970 he became a major contributing editor to Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing's conservative monthly magazine ''Criticon'', Germany's most important platform for non-mainstream conservative thought for almost three decades. He died in [[Munich]] in 2003 at the age of 83.\n\n==Writings and ideas==\nMohler's seminal work is his book ''Die Konservative Revolution in Deutschland 1918-1932'' (''The Conservative Revolution in Germany, 1918-1932'') (initially his doctoral thesis) which tried to unearth Weimar Republic right-wing thought and tradition apart from and alternative to National-Socialism. Amongst the most crucial thinkers of the \"[[Conservative Revolution]]\" he counted [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Ernst Niekisch]], [[Hans Blüher]] and [[Thomas Mann]] (before his turn to liberalism).\n\nMohler was one of the first German publishers to write about the ideas of his long-time friend [[Alain de Benoist]], founding father of the [[Nouvelle Droite]]. Similar as Benoist, Mohler advocated a Right that would oppose both socialism and liberalism, with a decided emphasis on the latter. According to Michael Minkenberg, Mohler's ideas owed more to the [[Nouvelle Droite]] strain associated with [[Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne|GRECE]] than the [[Ostpolitik]]-derived ideas of a strong German state associated with contemporaries such as [[Robert Spaemann]] and [[Gerd-Klaus Kaltenbrunner]].<ref>M. Minkenberg, 'The New Right in France and Germany: Nouvelle Droite, Neue Rechte, and the New Right Radical Parties', P. H. Merkl & L Weinberg (eds.), The Revival of Right Wing Extremism in the Nineties, London: Frank Cass, 1997, pp. 73-4</ref>\n\nOne of his favourite targets was the so-called \"[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]\", which he criticized in several books. This argument involved the claim that post-war Germany should 'step out of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s shadow'. In this respect it has been claimed that Mohler was a forerunner of [[Ernst Nolte]] and associated thinkers involved in the ''[[Historikerstreit]]''.<ref>[http://www.projects.v2.nl/~arns/Texts/leitkultur-e.html Prelude, Interlude, Afterlude. Spotlights on German Debates]</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s Mohler contributed to journals such as ''[[Nation Europa]]'' and ''Die Tat'' (not to be confused with an older paper of the  [[Die Tat|same title]]), whilst also writing for mainstream newspapers such as ''[[Die Zeit]]'' and (in the 1960s and 1970s) ''[[Die Welt]]''. In his later years he supported the \"Neue Rechte\" weekly paper ''[[Junge Freiheit]]''. Under the alias Michael Hintermwald he also contributed two articles to [[Gerhard Frey (politician)|Gerhard Frey]]'s ''Deutschen National-Zeitung'', for which he was much criticized.\n\n==Political activism==\nMohler was initially a supporter of [[Franz Josef Strauß]] and the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria]] but later worked with [[Franz Schönhuber]] in the founding of [[The Republicans (Germany)|The Republicans]]. Internationally he was close to [[Alain de Benoist]].\n\n==Fascism==\nMohler's notion of Conservative Revolution has been described as [[fascism]], with [[Roger Griffin]] arguing this point.<ref>R. Griffin, ''The Nature of Fascism'', London : Routledge, 1993, pp. 166-9</ref> In a newspaper interview Mohler accepted that he was a fascist but only in the tradition of [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]] and with the acceptance of the notion that fascism had its roots in the [[far left]] as argued by [[Zeev Sternhell]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{de icon}} [http://dispatch.opac.d-nb.de/DB=4.1/REL?PPN=118923935 Literature by and about Armin Mohler ]\n\n{{German far right}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mohler, Armin}}\n[[Category:1920 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Basel-Stadt]]\n[[Category:German politicians]]\n[[Category:Conservative Revolutionary movement]]\n[[Category:New Right (Europe)]]\n[[Category:Swiss atheists]]\n[[Category:Swiss fascists]]\n[[Category:Swiss journalists]]\n[[Category:Swiss philosophers]]\n[[Category:German nationalists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Armin Mohler"}}}}
