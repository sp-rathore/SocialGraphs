She begins by basing her theory of gender performativity on a feminist phenomenological point of view. She suggests that both phenomenology and feminism ground their theories in \"lived experience\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|last = Butler|first = Judith|date = 17 November 2015|journal = Theatre Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Further, in comparing phenomenologist [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]], Butler argues that both theories view the sexual body as a historical idea or situation; she accepts this notion of a \"distinction between sex, as biological facticity, and gender, as the cultural interpretation or signification of that facticity\".<ref name=\":0\" /> This combination of theories is essential for founding Butler's view of \"theatrical\" or performative genders in society.\n\nButler argues that it is more valid to perceive gender as a performance in which an individual agent acts. The performative element of her theory suggests a social audience. For Butler, the \"script\" of gender performance is effortlessly transmitted generation to generation in the form of socially established \"meanings\": She states, \"gender is not a radical choice... [nor is it] imposed or inscribed upon the individual\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Given the social nature of human beings, most actions are witnessed, reproduced, and internalized and thus take on a performative or theatric quality. Currently, the actions appropriate for men and women have been transmitted to produce a social atmosphere that both maintains and legitimizes a seemingly natural gender binary.<ref name=\":0\" /> Consistent with her acceptance of the body as a historical idea, she suggests that our concept of gender is seen as natural or innate because the body \"becomes its gender through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nButler argues that the performance of gender itself creates gender. Additionally, she compares the performativity of gender to the performance of the theater. She brings many similarities, including the idea of each individual functioning as an actor of their gender. However she also brings into light a critical difference between gender performance in reality and theater performances. She explains how the theater is much less threatening and does not produce the same fear that gender performances often encounter because of the fact that there is a clear distinction from reality within the theater.\n\nButler uses [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of how a person's identity is modeled in terms of the normal. She revises Freud's notion of this concept's applicability to lesbianism, where Freud says that lesbians are modeling their behavior on men, the perceived normal or ideal. She instead says that all gender works in this way of performativity and a representing of an internalized notion of gender norms.<ref>Rivkin, Julie, and Michael Ryan.

The book has enjoyed widespread popularity outside of traditional academic circles, even inspiring an intellectual fanzine, ''Judy!''.<ref>Larissa MacFarquhar, \"Putting the Camp Back into Campus,\" ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' (September/October 1993); see also Judith Butler, \"Decamping,\" ''Lingua Franca'' (November–December 1993).</ref>\n\nThe crux of Butler's argument in ''Gender Trouble'' is that the coherence of the categories of sex, [[sociology of gender|gender]], and sexuality—the natural-seeming coherence, for example, of masculine gender and heterosexual desire in male bodies—is culturally constructed through the repetition of stylized acts in time. These stylized bodily acts, in their repetition, establish the appearance of an essential, [[ontology|ontological]] \"core\" gender.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} This is the sense in which Butler famously theorizes gender, along with sex and sexuality, as [[performative]]. The performance of gender, sex, and sexuality, however, is not a voluntary choice for Butler, who locates the construction of the gendered, sexed, desiring subject within what she calls, borrowing from Foucault's ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', \"regulative [[discourse]]s.\" These, also called \"frameworks of intelligibility\" or \"disciplinary regimes,\" decide in advance what possibilities of sex, gender, and sexuality are socially permitted to appear as coherent or \"natural.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Regulative discourse includes within it [[Discipline and Punish#Discipline|disciplinary techniques]] which, by coercing subjects to perform specific stylized actions, maintain the appearance in those subjects of the \"core\" gender, sex and sexuality the discourse itself produces.<ref>Butler explicitly formulates her theory of [[performativity]] in the final pages of ''Gender Trouble'', specifically in the final section of her chapter \"Subversive Bodily Acts\" entitled \"Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions\" and elaborates performativity in relation to the question of political agency in her conclusion, \"From Parody to Politics.\" See {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=171–90 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref>\n\nA significant yet sometimes overlooked part of Butler's argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of \"natural\" or coherent gender and sexuality. Butler explicitly challenges biological accounts of binary sex, reconceiving the sexed body as itself culturally constructed by regulative discourse.<ref>For Butler's critique of biological accounts of sexual difference as a ruse for the cultural construction of \"natural\" sex, see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=135–41 |chapter=Concluding Unscientific Postscript |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref> The supposed obviousness of sex as a natural biological fact attests to how deeply its production in discourse is concealed. The sexed body, once established as a \"natural\" and unquestioned \"fact,\" is the alibi for constructions of gender and sexuality, unavoidably more cultural in their appearance, which can purport to be the just-as-natural expressions or consequences of a more fundamental sex. On Butler's account, it is on the basis of the construction of natural binary sex that binary gender and heterosexuality are likewise constructed as natural.<ref>For Butler's discussion of the performative co-construction of sex and gender see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=163–71, 177–8 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}} The signification of sex is also addressed in connection with [[Monique Wittig]] in the section \"Monique Wittig: Bodily Disintegrations and Fictive Sex,\" pp. 141–63</ref> In this way, Butler claims that without a critique of sex as produced by discourse, the [[sex/gender distinction]] as a feminist strategy for contesting constructions of binary asymmetric gender and [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]] will be ineffective.<ref>For Butler's problematization of the [[sex/gender distinction]] see {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |origyear=1990 |year=1999 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=9–11, 45–9 |isbn=84-493-2030-5}}</ref>\n\nThus, by showing the terms \"gender\" and \"sex\" as socially and culturally constructed, Butler offers a critique of both terms, even as they have been used by feminists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Judith Butler|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t306.e100&srn=1&ssid=460269119#FIRSTHIT|publisher=Oxford reference Online Premium}}</ref> Butler argued that feminism made a mistake in trying to make \"women\" a discrete, ahistorical group with common characteristics. Butler said this approach reinforces the binary view of gender relations because it allows for two distinct categories: men and women.  Butler believes that feminists should not try to define \"women\" and she also believes that feminists should \"focus on providing an account of how power functions and shapes our understandings of womanhood not only in the society at large but also within the feminist movement.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-gender/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> Finally, Butler aims to break the supposed links between sex and gender so that gender and desire can be \"flexible, free floating and not caused by other stable factors\". The idea of identity as free and flexible and gender as a performance, not an essence, is one of the foundations of [[Queer theory]].\n\n=== \"Imitation and Gender Insubordination\" (1990)===\nJudith Butler explores the production of identities such as \"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\" and the limiting nature of identity categories. An identity category for her is a result of certain exclusions and concealments, and thus a site of regulation. However, Butler also acknowledges that categorized identities are important for political action at present times. An important idea in this work is also that identity forms through repetition of acts or imitation and not due to a certain original identity that exists prior to repetition. Imitation gives the illusion of continuity to produce identities. In the same way, heterosexual identity, which is set up as an ideal, requires constant \"compulsive\" repetition to protect the very identity repetition has created.<ref>Butler, Judith. \"Imitation and Gender Insubordination1.\" Cultural theory and popular culture: A reader 1 (2006): 255.</ref>\n\n===''Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\"'' (1993)===\n''Bodies That Matter'' seeks to clear up readings and supposed misreadings of performativity that view the enactment of sex/gender as a daily choice.<ref>For example, {{Cite journal | last=Jeffreys | first=Sheila | authorlink=Sheila Jeffreys | title = The queer disappearance of lesbians: Sexuality in the academy | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–472 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | date = September–October 1994 | url = http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-5395(94)00051-4 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> To do this, Butler emphasizes the role of repetition in performativity, making use of [[Derrida]]'s theory of iterability, a form of [[citationality]], to work out a theory of performativity in terms of iterability:\n\n<blockquote>Performativity cannot be understood outside of a process of iterability, a regularized and constrained repetition of norms. And this repetition is not performed ''by'' a subject; this repetition is what enables a subject and constitutes the temporal condition for the subject. This iterability implies that 'performance' is not a singular 'act' or event, but a ritualized production, a ritual reiterated under and through constraint, under and through the force of prohibition and taboo, with the threat of ostracism and even death controlling and compelling the shape of the production, but not, I will insist, determining it fully in advance. This concept is linked to Butler's discussion of performativity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\" |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |page=95 |isbn=0-415-90365-3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIterability, in its endless ''un''determinedness as to-be-determinedness, is thus precisely that aspect of performativity that makes the production of the \"natural\" sexed, gendered, heterosexual subject possible, while also and at the same time opening that subject up to the possibility of its incoherence and contestation.{{Technical statement|date=July 2011}}\n\n===''Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative'' (1997)===\n{{Main article|Performativity#Judith Butler's perspective on performativity}}\n\nIn ''Excitable Speech'', Butler surveys the problems of [[hate speech]] and censorship. She argues that censorship is difficult to evaluate, and that in some cases it may be useful or even necessary, while in others it may be worse than tolerance.<ref name=\"Jagger\">{{cite book |last=Jagger|first=Gill |title=Judith Butler: Sexual politics, social change and the power of the performative |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=115–8 |isbn=978-0-415-21975-4}}</ref> She develops a new conception of censorship's complex workings, supplanting the myth of the independent subject who wields the power to censor with a theory of censorship as an effect of state power and, more primordially, as the condition of language and [[discourse]] itself. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nButler argues that hate speech exists retrospectively, only after being declared such by state authorities. In this way, the state reserves for itself the power to define hate speech and, conversely, the limits of acceptable discourse. In this connection, Butler criticizes feminist legal scholar [[Catharine MacKinnon]]'s argument against pornography for its unquestioning acceptance of the state's power to censor. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nDeploying [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s argument from the first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'', Butler claims that any attempt at censorship, legal or otherwise, necessarily propagates the very language it seeks to forbid.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | pages=129–33 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}</ref> As Foucault argues, for example, the strict sexual mores of 19th century Western Europe did nothing but amplify the discourse of sexuality it sought to control.<ref>For example, {{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |authorlink=Michel Foucault |others=Trans. Robert Hurley |title=The History of Sexuality: An Introduction. Vol 1. |origyear=1976 |year=1990 |publisher=Vintage |location=New York | page=23 |quote=A censorship of sex? There was installed [since the 17th century] rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy.}}</ref> Extending this argument using [[Derrida]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], Butler claims that censorship is primitive to language, and that the linguistic ''I'' is a mere effect of an originary censorship. In this way, Butler questions the possibility of any genuinely oppositional discourse; \"If speech depends upon censorship, then the principle that one might seek to oppose is at once the formative principle of oppositional speech\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |title=Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York | page=140 |isbn=0-415-91588-0}}</ref>\n\nButler also questions the efficacy of censorship on the grounds that hate speech is context-dependent. Citing [[J.L. Austin]]'s concept of the [[performative utterance]], Butler notes that words' ability to \"do things\" makes hate speech possible but also at the same time dependent on its specific embodied context. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Austin's claim that what a word ''does'', its [[illocutionary force]], varies with the context in which it is uttered implies that it is impossible to adequately define the performative meanings of words, including hate, abstractly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On this basis, Butler rejects arguments like [[Richard Delgado]]'s which justify the censorship of certain specific words by claiming the use of those words constitutes hate speech in any context. In this way, Butler underlines the difficulty inherent in efforts to systematically identify hate speech.\n\n===''Undoing Gender'' (2004)===\n''[[Undoing Gender]]'' collects Butler's reflections on gender, sex, sexuality, psychoanalysis and the medical treatment of intersex people for a more general readership than many of her other books. Butler revisits and refines her notion of performativity and focuses on the question of undoing \"restrictively normative conceptions of sexual and gendered life\".\n\nButler discusses how gender is performed without one being conscious of it, but says that it does not mean this performativity is \"automatic or mechanical\". She argues that we have desires that do not originate from our personhood, but rather, from social norms. The writer also debates our notions of \"human\" and \"less-than-human\" and how these culturally imposed ideas can keep one from having a \"viable life\" as the biggest concerns are usually about whether a person will be accepted if his or her desires differ from normality. She states that one may feel the need of being recognized in order to live, but that at the same time, the conditions to be recognized make life \"unlivable\". The writer proposes an interrogation of such conditions so that people who resist them may have more possibilities of living.<ref>Butler, Judith (2004). Undoing Gender. New York: Routledge</ref>\n\nIn her discussion of intersex, Butler addresses the case of [[David Reimer]], a person whose sex was medically \"reassigned\" from male to female after a botched [[circumcision]] at eight months of age. Reimer was \"made\" female by doctors, but later in life identified as \"really\" male, married and became a stepfather to his wife's three children, and went on to tell his story in ''As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl'', which he wrote with John Colapinto.  Reimer committed suicide in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://slate.com/id/2101678/ | title = Gender Gap:  What were the real reasons behind David Reimer's suicide?| last = Colapinto | first = J | authorlink = John Colapinto | publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date = June 3, 2004 | accessdate = February 13, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===''Giving an Account of Oneself'' (2005)===\nIn ''Giving an Account of Oneself'', Butler develops an ethics based on the opacity of the subject to itself; in other words, the limits of self-knowledge. Primarily borrowing from [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jean Laplanche]], [[Adriana Cavarero]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]], Butler develops a theory of the formation of the subject. She theorizes the subject in relation to the social – a community of others and their norms – which is beyond the control of the subject it forms, as precisely the very condition of that subject's formation, the resources by which the subject becomes recognizably human, a grammatical \"I\", in the first place.\n\nButler accepts the claim that if the subject is opaque to itself the limitations of its free ethical responsibility and obligations are due to the limits of narrative, presuppositions of language and projection.\n\n{{cquote|\"You may think that I am in fact telling a story about the prehistory of the subject, one that I have been arguing cannot be told. There are two responses to this objection. (1) That there is no final or adequate narrative reconstruction of the prehistory of the speaking \"I\" does not mean we cannot narrate it; it only means that at the moment when we narrate we become speculative philosophers or fiction writers. (2) This prehistory has never stopped happening and, as such, is not a prehistory in any chronological sense. It is not done with, over, relegated to a past, which then becomes part of a causal or narrative reconstruction of the self. On the contrary, that prehistory interrupts the story I have to give of myself, makes every account of myself partial and failed, and constitutes, in a way, my failure to be fully accountable for my actions, my final \"irresponsibility,\" one for which I may be forgiven only because I could not do otherwise. This not being able to do otherwise is our common predicament\" (page 78).}}\n\nInstead she argues for an ethics based precisely on the limits of self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks the constitution of the self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate the social world in which one comes to be human in the first place and which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Adorno-preis-2012-judith-butler-ffm-287.jpg|thumb|Butler receives the [[Theodor W.

In 1998, [[Denis Dutton]]'s journal ''Philosophy and Literature'' awarded Butler first prize in its fourth annual \"Bad Writing Competition,\" which set out to \"celebrate bad writing from the most stylistically lamentable passages found in scholarly books and articles.\"<ref name=\"bad\">{{cite web| url=http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm| first=Denis| last=Dutton| year=1998| title=Bad Writing Contest}}</ref> Her unwitting entry, which ran in a 1997 issue of the scholarly journal ''[[Diacritics]]'', ran thusly:\n{{cquote|The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.<ref name=\"bad\" />}}\n\nDutton discontinued the contest after critics opposed its hostile spirit.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://decasia.org/papers/badwriting.pdf| first=Eli| last=Thorkelson|date=April 2007| title=The case of the Bad Writing Contest: Literary theory as commodity and literary theorists as brands| format=pdf}}</ref>\n\nSome critics have accused Butler of elitism due to her difficult prose style, while others claim that she reduces gender to \"discourse\" or promotes a form of gender voluntarism. [[Susan Bordo]], for example, has argued that Butler reduces gender to language, contending that the body is a major part of gender, thus implicitly opposing Butler's conception of gender as performed.<ref>Hekman, Susan (1998). \"Material Bodies.\" ''Body and Flesh: a Philosophical Reader'' ed. by Donn Welton. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 61–70.</ref> A particularly vocal critic has been liberal feminist [[Martha Nussbaum]], who has argued that Butler misreads [[J.L. Austin]]'s idea of performative utterance, makes erroneous legal claims, forecloses an essential site of resistance by repudiating pre-cultural agency, and provides no normative ethical theory to direct the subversive performances that Butler endorses.<ref name=\"The Professor Parody\">[http://www.akad.se/Nussbaum.pdf The Professor Parody]</ref> Finally, [[Nancy Fraser]]'s critique of Butler was part of a famous exchange between the two theorists.  Fraser has suggested that Butler's focus on performativity distances her from \"everyday ways of talking and thinking about ourselves. […] Why should we use such a self-distancing idiom?\"<ref>Fraser, Nancy (1995). \"False Antitheses.\" In Seyla Benhabib, Judith Butler, Drucilla Cornell and Nancy Fraser (eds.), ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange''.

For example, Timothy Laurie notes that Butler's use of phrases like \"gender politics\" and \"gender violence\" in relation to assaults on transgender individuals in the USA can \"[scour] a landscape filled with class and labour relations, racialised urban stratification, and complex interactions between sexual identity, sexual practices and sex work\", and produce instead \"a clean surface on which struggles over 'the human' are imagined to play out\".<ref>{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | page= 72 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250}}</ref> Nevertheless, both Namaste and Laurie acknowledge the enduring importance of Butler's critical contributions to the study of gender identities.\n\n==Political activism==\nMuch of Butler's early political activism centered around queer and feminist issues, and she served, for a period of time, as the chair of the board of the [[International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission]].  Over the years, she has been particularly active in the gay and lesbian rights, feminist, and anti-war movements.<ref name=\"mcgill\" /> She has also written and spoken out on issues ranging from affirmative action and gay marriage to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the prisoners detained at Guantanamo Bay.  More recently, she has been active in the [[Occupy movement]] and has publicly expressed support for a version of the 2005 BDS ([[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]]) campaign against Israel.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, Butler participated in a faculty-organized [[teach-in]] against the [[2006 Lebanon War]] at the University of California, Berkeley.<ref>{{cite web| title=Coming attractions for fall 2006| url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2006/09/06_eventspreview2.shtml|publisher=UC Berkeley| accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref> Another widely publicized moment occurred in June 2010, when Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the [[Christopher Street Day]] (CSD) Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony. She cited racist comments on the part of organizers and a general failure of CSD organizations to distance themselves from racism in general and from anti-Muslim excuses for war more specifically. Criticizing the event's commercialism, she went on to name several groups that she commended as stronger opponents of \"homophobia, transphobia, sexism, racism, and militarism\".<ref>Butler, Judith.

What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social equality and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.<ref>http://www.salon.com/2011/10/24/judith_butler_at_occupy_wall_street/</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nShe is currently an executive member of the Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace in the United States and The Jenin Theatre in Palestine.<ref name=\"mondoweiss\"/> She is also a member of the advisory board of [[Jewish Voice for Peace]].<ref name=\"mondoweiss\"/>\n\n===The Adorno Prize affair===\nWhen Butler received the 2012 [[Theodor W.

She had described them as \"social movements that are progressive, that are on the Left, that are part of a global Left\".<ref>Petra Marquardt-Bigman, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/09/07/defending-judith-butler-in-the-ivory-tower/ \"Defending Judith Butler in The Ivory Tower\"], ''The Algemeiner Journal'', September 7, 2012.</ref> She was accused of defending \"Hezbollah and Hamas as progressive organizations\" and supporting their tactics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weinthal|first=Benjamin|title=Frankfurt to award US advocate of Israel boycott|journal=The Jerusalem Post|date=26 August 2012|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Frankfurt-to-award-US-advocate-of-Israel-boycott|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Illouz|first=Eva|title=Judith Butler gets a taste of her own politics|journal=Haaretz|date=20 September 2012|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/judith-butler-gets-a-taste-of-her-own-politics-1.465861|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nButler responded to these criticisms by stating that her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah were taken completely out of context and badly, if not wittingly, distort her established views on non-violence. She has repeatedly condemned the violence and non-democratic actions of these groups while clearly advocating for a politics committed to non-violence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Willing the impossible: an interview with Judith Butler|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/transformation/ray-filar/willing-impossible-interview-with-judith-butler|publisher=Open Democracy|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=23 July 2013}}</ref> In a recent interview she explained that Hamas and Hezbollah are \"progressive\" insofar as they do address infrastructural needs that are quite acute under occupation. Precisely because such groups are supplying important social services, it becomes harder—yet more urgent—to find ways of persuading people not to support their violent tactics.\n\nButler describes the origin of her remarks on Hamas and Hezbollah in the following way: \n<blockquote>\nI was asked by a member of an academic audience a few years ago whether I thought Hamas and Hezbollah belonged to \"the global left\" and I replied with two points. My first point was merely descriptive: those political organizations define themselves as anti-imperialist, and anti-imperialism is one characteristic of the global left, so on that basis one could describe them as part of the global left. My second point was then critical: as with any group on the left, one has to decide whether one is for that group or against that group, and one needs to critically evaluate their stand.<ref name=\"mondoweiss\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Comments on Black Lives Matter ===\n\nIn a January 2015 interview with George Yancy of ''[[The New York Times]]'', Butler discussed the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.
