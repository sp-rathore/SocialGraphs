Acumen (2004).</ref> Carter has responded by arguing that his critics fail to take sufficiently into account the problems the military causes in modern societies: \"it is telling how little attention green liberal critics of the state-primacy theory have paid to the role of the military and to its highly distorting effects. Failing to examine in any detail military requirements within ostensibly ‘liberal democracies’, whether existing or imagined, is more like simply ignoring an argument rather than answering it.\"<ref name=\"Carter\">Carter, A. \"Beyond primacy: Marxism, anarchism and radical green political theory,\" ''Environmental Politics'' 19, 6 (2010): 951-972, here at 971n.</ref>\n\nCarter was one of the founder members of the London-based Anarchist Research Group.<ref name=\"Goodway\">Goodway, D.
