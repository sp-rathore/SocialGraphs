Kateb, along with [[John Rawls]] and [[Isaiah Berlin]], is credited with making significant contributions to liberal political theory. A staunch individualist, Kateb has written scholarly works on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Hannah Arendt]], and the ethical dimensions of the individual in a constitutional democracy. More recently Kateb has turned his attention to what he sees as the increasing erosion of individual liberty wrought by the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and the poisonous influence of religious, ethnic and statist group identity on morality.\n\nKateb earned his A.B., A.M. and Ph.D. at [[Columbia University]] and was a [[Junior Fellow]] at [[Harvard University]].  He then taught at [[Amherst College]] for thirty years before joining the faculty at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1987. As a member of the executive committee of the University Center for Human Values he was involved with the search committee that somewhat controversially appointed noted Australian philosopher [[Peter Singer]] to a chair in [[bioethics]] at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1999. Kateb is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He has also served as vice president of the American Society of Political and Legal Philosophy and president of the New England Political Science Association. In addition, Kateb has served as a member of the editorial board or consulting editor of the ''[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]'', the [[Library of America]], Alternative Futures, the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', ''Political Theory'', and ''[[Raritan Quarterly Review]]''. He is also a recipient of the Behrman Award for Distinguished Achievement in the Humanities from [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Kateb retired from teaching in 2002.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Utopia and Its Enemies'' (1963)\n* ''Political Theory: Its Nature and Uses'' (1968)\n* ''Hannah Arendt: Politics, Conscience, Evil'' (1984)\n* ''The Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture'' (1992)\n* ''Emerson and Self-Reliance'' (1994)\n* ''Patriotism and Other Mistakes'' (2006)\n* ''[http://www.themontrealreview.com/2009/Human-Dignity.php Human Dignity]'' (2011)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.princeton.edu/prok/issues/1-2/forum.xml Princeton Report On Knowledge Forum with Kateb]\n* [http://www.nybooks.com/authors/6827 Kateb's contributions to the New York Review of Books]\n* [https://www.princeton.edu/politics/people/display_person.xml?netid=kateb&display=All Kateb's Princeton faculty page]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kateb, George}}\n[[Category:American political theorists]]\n[[Category:American political writers]]\n[[Category:American male writers]]\n[[Category:Amherst College faculty]]\n[[Category:Columbia University alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Fellows]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Princeton University faculty]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "George Kateb"}}}}
