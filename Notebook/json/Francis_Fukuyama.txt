Fukuyama is known for his book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992), which argued that the worldwide spread of [[liberal democracies]] and free market [[capitalism]] of the West and its lifestyle may signal the end point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and become the final form of human government. However, his subsequent book ''Trust: Social Virtues and Creation of Prosperity'' (1995) modified his earlier position to acknowledge that culture cannot be cleanly separated from economics. Fukuyama is also associated with the rise of the [[neoconservative]] movement,<ref>Thies, Clifford (2011-06-24) [https://mises.org/daily/5377/The-End-of-Hystery-Francis-Fukuyamas-Review-of-The-Constitution-of-Liberty The End of Hystery?

Fukuyama predicted the eventual global triumph of political and economic liberalism:\n\n{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such.... That is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.}}\n\nAuthors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which will be followed by a slide into obscurity.<ref>Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37</ref><ref>[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita.

Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: \"World Historians and Their Critics\" (May 1995): 43.</ref> The fact that Marxism and fascism had been proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.</ref> Being a work that both praised the ideals of a group that had fallen out of favor and challenged the premises of the group that had replaced them, it was bound to create some controversy.\n\nFukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original \"end of history\" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.<ref>For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal | last1 = Jordaan | first1 = D.

He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.\n\nIn another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.\n\nIn 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.\n\nIn 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|title=Fukuyama: \"Social Agenda\" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|author=Ryan Weddle|work=[[Devex]]|date=2009-02-18|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>\n\n===Neoconservatism===\nAs a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.<ref>[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.</ref> Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=PNACClinton>{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archiveurl=http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/98-Rumsfield-Iraq.pdf| archivedate=2005-10-09| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| accessdate=2008-08-16| author=[[Elliott Abrams|Abrams, Elliott]]| date=1998-01-26| format=PDF|display-authors=etal}}</ref> He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W.

A latent military force is more likely to have an effect than actual deployment. The US spends 43% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders |title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref> but Iraq shows there are limits to its effectiveness.\n\nThe US should instead stimulate political and economic development and gain a better understanding of what happens in other countries. The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy. But such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.\n\nIn a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]]. He wrote that neoconservatives:<ref name=\"After Neoconservatism\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?ex=1298005200&en=4126fa38fefd80de&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=After Neoconservatism|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=2006-02-19|accessdate=2007-05-13|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will.
