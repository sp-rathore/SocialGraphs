His 1994 book ''The Political Philosophy of Poststructuralist Anarchism'' was the first to combine [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] and [[anarchist]] thought, and he subsequently has published treatments of major poststructuralist philosophers, including [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Michel Foucault]].  He serves as faculty adviser for several student-run political organizations.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''Between Genealogy and Epistemology'' (1993).
