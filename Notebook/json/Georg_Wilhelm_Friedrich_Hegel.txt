Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a \"bilious fever\" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease but narrowly survived.<ref>Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his \"Chronology of Hegel's Life\", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].</ref> Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832), and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|4}}\n\nAt the age of three Hegel went to the \"German School.\" When he entered the \"Latin School\" two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother.\n\nIn 1776, Hegel entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]''. During his adolescence Hegel read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. Hegel's studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''Abiturrede'' (\"graduation speech\") entitled \"The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey.\"<ref>http://assets.cambridge.org/052149/6799/sample/0521496799WSN01.pdf</ref>\n\n====Tübingen (1788–93)====\nAt the age of eighteen Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where two fellow students were to become vital to his development: poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], and philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization, and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] during this time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}</ref> They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on Kantian philosophy, from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e., a \"man of letters\" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800.\n\n====Bern (1793–96) and Frankfurt (1797–1801)====\nHaving received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–96). During this period he composed the text which has become known as the \"[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]\" and a book-length manuscript titled \"The Positivity of the Christian Religion.\" His relations with his employers becoming strained, Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt Hegel composed the essay \"Fragments on Religion and Love.\"<ref>http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf</ref> In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled \"The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate\",<ref>http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf</ref> unpublished during his lifetime.\n\nAlso in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of \"[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]\" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.<ref name=\"Hammermeister\">Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.</ref>\n\n===Career years===\n\n====Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816)====\nIn 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting a ''[[Habilitation]]sschrift'' (inaugural dissertation) on the orbits of the planets.<ref>The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.</ref> Later in the year Hegel's first book, ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'', was completed. He lectured on \"Logic and Metaphysics\" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an \"Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy\" and held a \"Philosophical Disputorium.\" In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (\"Critical Journal of Philosophy\"), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.\n\nIn 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried), after Hegel wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.<ref name=pinkard>{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}</ref>{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|224–25}}\n[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|200px|Napoleon, the \"world spirit on horseback\", in Jena]]\nHis finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on October 14, 1806, in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]:\n\n<blockquote>I saw the Emperor – this world-spirit – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it&nbsp;... this extraordinary man, whom it is impossible not to admire.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|228}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–31).<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|192}}\n\nIn March 1807, aged 37, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{ill|de|Bamberger Zeitung}}''. Hegel, unable to find more suitable employment, reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|238}}\n\nHe was then, in November 1808, again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called \"Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences\", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit).<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|337}}\n\nHegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator, in 1811. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813, 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).\n\n==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====\nHaving received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, in April 1817, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|354–55}} (Ludwig's mother had died in the meantime.)<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|356}}\n\nHegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|right|Hegel with his Berlin students<br>Sketch by Franz Kugler]]\n\nIn 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here he published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history, and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.\n\nIn 1819–27, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]], and [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Siep xxii\">Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.</ref>\n\nHegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, when he was 59. His term as Rector ended in September 1830; he was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.<ref name=\"Siep xxii\"/> In August 1831 a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin, with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14 Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words \"And he didn't understand me\" before expiring.<ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687</ref> In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger|Solger]].\n\nHegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]; the news of his death never reached his father.<ref name=pinkard/>{{rp|548}} Early the following year Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons — [[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian, and {{ill|de|Immanuel Hegel|Immanuel Hegel|Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path — lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.\n\n== Thought ==\n{{Hegelianism}}\n\n=== Freedom ===\nHegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]], the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications, for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While Aristotle criticizes Plato's \"Forms\", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos, and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom, as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.\n\nIn his discussion of \"Spirit\" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as \"by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic.\"<ref>par. 378</ref> In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality, and with their ontological implications, is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within \"true infinity\", the \"Concept\" (or \"Notion\": ''Begriff''), \"Spirit\", and \"ethical life\" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute \"given.\"\n\nThe reason why this subsumption takes place in a ''series'' of concepts is that Hegel's method, in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'', is to begin with basic concepts like Being and Nothing, and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached, in principle, in the account of \"true infinity\" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on \"Quality\", is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to \"Spirit\" and \"ethical life\", in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.\n\nIn this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of \"duty\" (or, in Plato's case, \"good\") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to \"freedom\" and the \"ought\"<ref name=miller>See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]</ref>{{rp|133–136, 138}}), the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept), and Spirit going beyond Nature. And Hegel renders these dualities ''intelligible'' by (ultimately) his argument in the \"Quality\" chapter of the \"Science of Logic.\" The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because, as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of \"reality\",<ref name=miller/>{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully \"real\" (following the Latin etymology of \"real:\" more \"thing-like\") than what does not. Finite things don't determine themselves, because, as \"finite\" things, their essential character is determined by their boundaries, over against other finite things. So, in order to become \"real\", they must go beyond their finitude (\"finitude ''is'' only as a transcending of itself\"<ref name=miller/>{{rp|145}}).\n\nThe result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and, by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—don't face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the ''self-transcending'' of the former.<ref name=miller/>{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal, and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.\n\n=== Progress ===\nThe mystical writings of Böhme had a strong effect on Hegel.<ref>[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.</ref> Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was, itself, the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau, and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]], and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Self (Philosophy)|self]] and [[Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called \"the absolute Idea\" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–3) or \"absolute knowledge\" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', \"(DD) Absolute Knowledge\").\n\nAccording to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature, society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up ([[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]) to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation: as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.<ref name=\"Schroeder2000\">{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&pg=PA104|accessdate=17 December 2012|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}</ref>\n\n\"Mind\" and \"Spirit\" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German \"[[Geist]].\" Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly \"psychologize\" Hegel,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or \"soul.\" Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of \"Geist\" was tightly bound to the notion of \"[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]\" from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]]; however in his later works (after Jena) Hegel did not explicitly use his old notion of \"Aether\" any more.<ref>Stefan Gruner: \"Hegel's Aether Doctrine\", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, ISBN 978-3-639-28451-5</ref>\n\nCentral to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]], that is that mind [[externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it, and that, through recognizing itself in them, is \"with itself\" in these external manifestations, so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n=== Civil society ===\n{{See also|Civil society}}\nHegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm Etext of Philosophy of Right Hegel, 1827 (translated by Dyde, 1897)]</ref> In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term \"''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''\" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.<ref>Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press</ref> Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];<ref name=\"glob\">{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society.

This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].<ref name=\"glob\" /> In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of \"lesser\" and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.\n\n=== State ===\nHegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called \"ethical life\" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three \"moments\". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations, and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's \"supreme duty is to be a member of the state.\" (''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', section 258.) The individual has \"substantial freedom in the state\". The State is \"objective spirit\" so \"it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life.\" (Section 258.) Every member, furthermore, both loves the state with genuine patriotism but has transcended mere \"team spirit\" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the state.\n\n===Heraclitus===\nAccording to Hegel, \"[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle.\"<ref>{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=336–337 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality, and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process, and that \"being\" and \"nothingness\" are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's \"obscurity\" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms \"speculative\") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: \"...&nbsp;there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic.\"<ref>{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.</ref>\n\nHegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.<ref>{{cite web | author=Hegel, G.

Hegel, however, interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or \"pure\" [[being]] without particularity or specificity.<ref>{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}</ref> Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming, and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.\n\nFor Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking, as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.\n\nFor his god Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same, as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.\n\nThe universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free \"in itself;\" that is, it does not depend on anything else, such as matter, for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.<ref>The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.</ref>\n\nAlthough Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians, although he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology. At the same time, an atheistic version of his thought was adopted instead by some [[Marxism|Marxists]], who, stripping away the concepts of divinity, styled what was left [[dialectical materialism]], which some saw as originating in Heraclitus.\n\n=== Religion ===\nAs a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.<ref>\"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything.\" (Hegel, \"How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug\", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&nbsp;91–115)</ref> Hegel's thoughts on the person of Jesus Christ stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'' Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.<ref>Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100</ref> He espouses that, \"God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&nbsp;... God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit.\" This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and Human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but \"...&nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed.\"\n\n[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes, and \"sometimes could not resist equating\" his conception of spirit (Geist) \"with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me.\"<ref>Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1965, pp. 276–77</ref> Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:\n\n<blockquote>In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian<ref>Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, 1965, p. 277</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.<ref>Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100</ref> This led Hegelian [[Carl Friedrich Göschel]] to prepare a treatise to demonstrate the presence of the doctrine of immortality in Hegel's philosophy.<ref>Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105</ref>\n\n== Works ==\nHegel published four books during his lifetime: the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807; the ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes, published in 1812, 1813, and 1816 (with a revised Book One published in 1831); ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830; and the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820. During the last ten years of his life, he did not publish another book but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).<ref>W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203</ref> In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]], and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Hegelgrave.jpg|thumb|left|Hegel's tombstone in Berlin]]{{See also|Hegelianism}}\nThere are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]], and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].\n\nHegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians, and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], Marx, and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to, many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s magnum opus on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).<ref>Cormier, Youri. \"Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics\" International History Review, Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA]</ref> After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]], and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.\n\nAfter the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of [[British idealism|British Idealism]] and the 20th century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.\n\n=== Reading Hegel ===\nSome of Hegel's writing were intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Kant]], and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Fichte]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.<ref>Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12</ref>\n\nOne especially difficult aspect of Hegel's work is his innovation in logic. In response to Immanuel Kant's challenge to the limits of [[Critique of Pure Reason|pure reason]], Hegel develops a radically new form of logic, which he called ''speculative.'' The difficulty in reading Hegel was perceived in Hegel's own day, and persists into the 21st century. To understand Hegel fully requires paying attention to his critique of standard logic, such as the [[law of contradiction]] and the [[law of the excluded middle]]. Many philosophers who came after Hegel and were influenced by him, whether adopting or rejecting his ideas, did so without fully absorbing his new speculative or dialectical logic.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAccording to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of the Spirit'' is that a philosopher should not \"confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect.\" In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; \"it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality.\"<ref>W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115</ref>\n\n=== Left and Right Hegelianism ===\nSome historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the political conservatism of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a revolutionary sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.\n\nIn more recent studies, however, this paradigm has been questioned.<ref>[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.</ref> No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as \"Right Hegelians\"; that was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe Left Hegelians also spawned [[Marxism]], which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]], and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.\n\nTwentieth-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism|British Idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], and [[Fascism]]. The Italian Fascist [[Giovanni Gentile]], according to [[Benedetto Croce]], \"...&nbsp;holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy.\"<ref>[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, \"Translator's Introduction\", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965</ref> However, since the fall of the [[USSR]], a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West, without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. [[Walter Jaeschke]] and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany, as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in America are notable for their recent contributions to post-USSR thinking about Hegel.\n\n=== Triads ===\n{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}\nIn previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, \"[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]\"; namely, that a \"thesis\" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its \"antithesis\" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed), and would eventually result in a \"synthesis\" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once, and he attributed the terminology to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. The terminology was largely developed earlier by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy, and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.\n\nThe \"thesis–antithesis–synthesis\" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete, abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.\n\nFor Hegel, reason is but \"speculative\", not \"dialectical\".<ref>''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&pg=PA238 p. 238].</ref> Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars, like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to \"the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity\" (thesis and antithesis) he doesn't use \"synthesis\" but instead speaks of the \"Whole\": \"We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements.\" Furthermore, in Hegel's language, the \"dialectical\" aspect or \"moment\" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called \"[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]\", is only preliminary to the \"speculative\" (and not \"synthesizing\") aspect or \"moment\", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.\n\nIt is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nIn the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists, (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything, and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. Lukács' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], Adorno, [[Ernst Bloch]], Dunayevskaya, [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. Marcuse, in ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}</ref> The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e., those written before the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.<ref>French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term \"post-Kojèvian discourse\" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).</ref> U.S. [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.<ref>{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}</ref>  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the 'non-metaphysical option', has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past 40 years.\n\nLate 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995), and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).\n\nRecently, two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the \"[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians\"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work, ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of \"incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''\" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, after the fall of the [[USSR]], a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield, and [[Theodore Geraets]].\n\n=== Criticism ===\nCriticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries; a diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th Century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism|British Idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], and, in the United States, [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell; Russell, in particular, considered \"almost all\" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.<ref>B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.</ref>  Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented, \"Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance.\"<ref>Russell, 735.</ref>  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.\n\nHegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical, and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as \"a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking.\"<ref>On the Basis of Morality.</ref> In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a \"clumsy charlatan\".<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to \"On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]</ref> However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures, so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's 'absolute knowledge' unity.<ref>Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt</ref> Scientist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an \"unclear thoughtless flow of words.\"<ref>Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, ISBN 90-277-0250-0</ref>  In a similar vein, Robert Pippin wrote that Hegel had \"the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language.\"<ref>Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5</ref> Russell stated in his ''Unpopular Essays'' (1950) and ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was \"the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers.\" [[Karl Popper]] wrote that \"there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage.\"<ref>Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.</ref>\n\nPopper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Scholars such as Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.<ref>See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']</ref> [[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], and [[Joseph de Maistre]].<ref>Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)</ref>\n\nWalter Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that \"he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted.\"<ref>W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99</ref>\n\nVoegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a \"sorcerer\" -- ''i.e.'', as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] thinker.<ref>Voegelin, Eric (1972). \"On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery\", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber & G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)</ref>  This concept of Hegel as a Hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee<ref>Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press</ref> who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and Hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.<ref>\"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all.\" Magee 2001, p. 2.</ref>\n\n== Selected works ==\n{{main|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel bibliography}}\n\n=== Published during Hegel's lifetime ===\n* ''Differenz des Fichteschen und Schellingschen Systems der Philosophie'', 1801\n:''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'', tr.
