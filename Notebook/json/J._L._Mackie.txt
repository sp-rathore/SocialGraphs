L. Mackie''', was an Australian philosopher, originally from Sydney. He made significant contributions to the [[philosophy of religion]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[philosophy of language]], and is perhaps best known for his views on [[meta-ethics]], especially his defence of [[moral scepticism]].\n\nHe authored six books. His most widely known, ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977), opens by boldly stating that \"There are no objective values.\" It goes on to argue that because of this ethics must be invented, rather than discovered.\n\n==Life==\nMackie was born 25 August 1917 in Sydney. His mother, Annie Burnett Duncan, was a schoolteacher,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and his father, Alexander Mackie, was professor of education at the [[University of Sydney]] as well as the principal of the [[Sydney Teachers College]], and was influential in the educational system of [[New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Times Obit\"/> He graduated from the University of Sydney in 1938 after studying under [[John Anderson (philosopher)|John Anderson]], sharing the medal in philosophy with eminent jurist [[Harold Glass]]. Mackie received the Wentworth Travelling Fellowship to study [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|first]] in 1940.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he served with the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] in the Middle East and Italy. He was professor of philosophy at the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand from 1955 to 1959 and succeeded Anderson as the [[Challis Professor]] of Philosophy at the University of Sydney from 1959 to 1963. In 1963, he moved to the United Kingdom, becoming the inaugural holder of the chair of philosophy in the [[University of York]], a position he held until 1967 when he was instead elected a fellow of [[University College, Oxford]], where he served as [[praelector]]. In 1974, he became a fellow of the [[British Academy]].\n\nHe died in Oxford on 12 December 1981. <ref name=\"Times Obit\"/>\n\n===Character and family===\nMackie is said to have been capable of expressing total disagreement in such a genial way that the person being addressed might mistake the comment for a compliment.<ref>Obituary notice, ''University College Record'', 1982</ref> This personal style is exemplified by the following words from the preface to Mackie's ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977, p.&nbsp;3):\n\n<blockquote>I am nowhere mainly concerned to refute any individual writer. I believe that all those to whom I have referred, even those with whom I disagree most strongly, have contributed significantly to our understanding of ethics: where I have quoted their actual words, it is because they have presented views or arguments more clearly or more forcefully than I could put them myself.</blockquote>\n\nMackie married Joan Meredith in 1947. One of Mackie's three daughters, [[Penelope Mackie]], also became a philosopher. She lectured in Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]] from 1994 to 2004, and was appointed Head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Nottingham]] in 2007. Mackie's younger son, David, is also a philosopher and graduated from Oxford University where he held lectureships at [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] before being appointed a Fellow and Tutor at [[Oriel College]]. {{As of|2013}} he teaches at [[D'Overbroeck's College]], Oxford.<ref>[http://www.doverbroecks.com/staff/ D'Overbroeck's College Teaching Staff] at official website. Accessed 12 June 2015</ref>\n\n==Work==\nMackie was best known for his contributions to the fields of [[meta-ethics]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[metaphysics]].  In meta-ethics, he took a position called [[moral scepticism]], arguing against the objective existence of ''right'' and ''wrong'' as intrinsically normative entities on fundamental grounds as unsure about what kinds of things such entities would be, if they existed.<ref>See, for example, Mackie 1977: [[Argument from Queerness]]. ''The Argument from Queerness also suggests that the only way to know of such entities would be through an intuition or another faculty different from how we know everything else. He conjoined moral scepticism with [[error theory]], holding that moral judgments, while cognitive, are all false since there are no moral properties about which our moral judgments could be correct.''</ref>\n\nHis perhaps most widely known work,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'', bluntly begins with the opening sentence \"There are no objective values\". He uses several arguments to support this claim that objective values are false.  He argues that some aspects of moral thought are relative, and that objective morals require an absurd intrinsic action-guiding feature.  Most of all, he thinks it is very unclear how objective values could supervene on features of the natural world (see the ''[[Argument from queerness]]'').  Fourth, he thinks it would be difficult to justify our knowledge of \"value entities\" or account for any links or consequences they would have.  And, finally, he thinks it is possible to show that even without any objective values, people would still have reason to firmly believe in them (hence, he claims that it is possible for people to be mistaken or fooled into believing that objective values exist). ''[[The Times]]'' called the book \"a lucid discussion of moral theory which, although aimed at the general reader, has attracted a good deal of professional attention.\"<ref name=\"Times Obit\"/>\n\n[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|Mackie was a supporter of the [[compatibilism|compatibilistic]] interpretation of [[free will]].]]\nConcerning religion, he was well known for vigorously defending [[atheism]], and also arguing that the [[problem of evil]] made untenable the main [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions.<ref>See, for example, Mackie 1982.</ref> His criticisms of the [[free will]] defence are particularly significant. He argued that the idea of human free will is no defense for those who wish to believe in an omnicompetent being in the face of evil and suffering, as such a being could have given us both free will and moral perfection, thus resulting in us choosing the good in every situation.  In 1955 he published one of his most reprinted articles,<ref>[http://www.otago.ac.nz/philosophy/history.html Department of Philosophy, University of Otago]</ref> \"Evil and Omnipotence\", summarizing his view that the simultaneous existence of evil and an all-powerful, all-knowing and all-good God was \"positively irrational\".<ref name=\"Mackie1955\"/> Mackie's views on this so-called [[Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil|logical problem of evil]] prompted [[Alvin Plantinga]] to respond with his version of the [[Plantinga's free will defense|Free Will Defense]] to which Mackie later responded in his ''The Miracle of Theism''.\n\nIn metaphysics, Mackie made significant contributions relating to the nature of [[causality (physics)|causal relationships]], especially regarding conditional statements describing them (see, for example, Mackie 1974){{citation needed|reason=no citation given||date=March 2016}} and the notion of an [[INUS]] condition.\n\nUpon being given a copy of [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' as a Christmas present,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> he in 1978 wrote an article in the journal ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' praising the book and discussing how its ideas might be applied to moral philosophy.<ref name=\"Philosophy1978\"/> Philosopher [[Mary Midgley]] responded in 1979 with \"Gene-Juggling\", an article arguing that ''The Selfish Gene'' was about [[psychological egoism]], rather than [[evolution]].<ref name=\"Philosophy1979\"/> This started a dispute between Mackie, Midgley, and Dawkins that was still ongoing at the time of Mackie's death.\n\n==Publications==\n;Books\n* ''Truth, Probability, and Paradox'' (1973), [[Oxford University Press]], ISBN 0-19-824402-9.\n* ''The Cement of the Universe: A Study of Causation'' (1980), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-824642-0.\n* ''Problems from Locke'' (1976), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-824555-6.\n* ''Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong'' (1977), Viking Press, ISBN 0-14-013558-8.\n* ''Hume's Moral Theory'' (1980), Routledge Keegan & Paul, ISBN 0-7100-0525-3.\n* ''The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God'' (1982), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-824682-X.\n\n;Anthologies\n* ''Logic and Knowledge: Selected Papers, Volume I'' (1985), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-824679-X.\n* ''Persons and Values: Selected Papers, Volume II'' (1985), Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-824678-1.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Times Obit\">[http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/anderson/contributors/harris/mackie-obit.pdf Obituary], ''The Times'', 15 December 1981</ref>\n<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{ODNBweb |id=65648 |title=Mackie, John Leslie (1917–1981)|last=McDowell |first=John}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Philosophy1978\">{{cite journal |last=Mackie |first=J.
