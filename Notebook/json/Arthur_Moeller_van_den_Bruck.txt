He did not support the party, however. From 1906 to 1922, he also published [[Elisabeth Kaerrick]]'s first full German translation of [[Dostoyevsky]]'s works.\n\n==Biography==\n'''Arthur Wilhelm Ernst Victor Moeller van den Bruck''' was born on 23 April 1876 in [[Solingen]], [[Westphalia]] as the only child of [[bourgeois]] parents. His father was Ottomar Victor Moeller, a German [[state architect]], and his mother was Elise van den Bruck, the daughter of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architect [[van den Broeck]] and—allegedly—a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] mother. At birth Moeller van den Broek was assigned the [[given name|first name]] \"Arthur\" (in honor of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]), but he would later drop the part from his name.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lauryssens | first = Stan | title = The man who invented the Third Reich : the life and times of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck | publisher = Sutton | location = Stroud, Gloucestershire England | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7509-1866-7 | page = 14}}</ref>\n\nHe was expelled from a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (a type of German secondary school) for his indifference towards his studies. The young Moeller van den Bruck believed German literature and philosophy, particularly the works of [[Nietzsche]] to be a more vital education.<ref>G Krebs, Moeller van den Bruck: Inventor of the Third Reich, The American Political Science Review, Vol. 35, No. 6</ref> Afterwards, he continued his studies on his own in [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], and [[Italy]].\n\nIn 1897 he married [[Hedda Eulenberg|Hedda Maase]] (later Eulenberg). She divorced him in 1904.\n\nMoeller van den Bruck's eight-volume cultural history ''Die Deutschen, unsere Menschengeschichte'' (\"The Germans, our people's history\") appeared in 1905. In 1907 he returned to Germany and in 1914 enlisted in the army at the start of [[World War I]].  Soon thereafter, he joined the press office of the Foreign Ministry and was attached to the foreign affairs section of the German [[Oberste Heeresleitung|Supreme Army Command]].\n\nHis essay \"''Der Preußische Stil''\" (\"The Prussian Style\"), in which he celebrated the essence of Prussia as \"the will to the state\", appeared in 1916, marking his embrace of [[nationalism]]. It showed him as an opponent of [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[liberalism]], and exerted a strong influence on the Jungkonservativen (\"young conservative movement\").\n\nAfter a [[nervous breakdown]], he committed [[suicide]] in [[Berlin]] on May 30, 1925.\n\nMoeller van den Bruck was the joint founder of the \"June Club\" (Juniklub), which sought to influence young conservatives in the fight against the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Later, it was renamed \"Deutscher Herrenklub\" (German Gentlemen's Club): it became very powerful, helping [[Franz von Papen]] to become [[Reichskanzler]] in 1932.\n\n== Influence on Nazism ==\nIn his 1918 book ''Das Recht der jungen Völker'' (\"The Right Of Young Nations\"), Moeller van den Bruck presents a version of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' theory, in which he developed the theme of Russia as representing Communist civilization and the United States representing capitalist civilization, both of which are rejected. Germany is held up as the model between the two extremes. In the same book, Moeller van den Bruck advocated an expressly anti-Western and anti-imperialist philosophy of the state (''Staatstheorie''), which attempted to bridge the gap between nationalism and concepts of social justice.\n\nHe had a major influence on the ''Jungkonservativen'' (Young Conservatives) in their opposition to the [[Weimar Republic]]. He may have also supplied the Nazis with some of the concepts underpinning their movement, though upon meeting Hitler in 1922, Bruck rejected him for his \"proletarian primitiveness\". The Nazis still made use of his ideas where they could, including appropriating the title of his 1923 book ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'' (meaning \"[[The Third Reich]]\") as a political slogan and the Germanic ''Übermensch'' idea.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Die moderne Literatur in Gruppen und Einzeldarstellungen'' (1900)  \n* ''Das Variété: Eine Kulturdramaturgie'' (1900)  \n* ''Die Deutschen: Unsere Menschheitsgeschichte'' (1904)  \n* ''Zeitgenossen'' (1905)  \n* ''Die italienische Schönheit'' (1913)  \n* ''Der preußische Stil'' (1915)  \n* ''Das Recht der jungen Völker'' (1918)\n* ''Das Dritte Reich'' (1923)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Sebastian Maaß, ''Kämpfer um ein drittes Reich.
