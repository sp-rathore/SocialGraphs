[[Ray Monk]] writes, \"In 1944--when Kreisel was still only twenty-one--Wittgenstein shocked [[Rush Rhees]] by declaring Kreisel to be the most able philosopher he had ever met who was also a mathematician.\"<ref>Ray Monk, ''Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius'' (Penguin, 1991), 498.</ref>\n\nKreisel was also a close friend of the Anglo-Irish philosopher and novelist [[Iris Murdoch]].  They met at Cambridge in 1947 during Murdoch's year of study there.  Peter Conradi reports that Murdoch transcribed Kreisel's letters into her journals over the next fifty years.  According to Conradi, \"For half a century she nonetheless records variously Kreisel's brilliance, wit and sheer 'dotty' solipsistic strangeness, his amoralism, cruelty, ambiguous vanity and obscenity.\"  Murdoch dedicated her 1971 novel ''[[An Accidental Man]]'' to Kreisel and he became a (partial) model for several characters in other novels, including Marcus Vallar in ''[[The Message to the Planet]]'' and Guy Openshaw in ''[[Nuns and Soldiers]]''.*<ref>Peter Conradi, ''Iris Murdoch: A Life'' (HarperCollins, 2001), 264-65.</ref>\n\nAfter retirement Kreisel lived in [[Salzburg]], Austria.

There was a particularly fast train that was timed just right for the shows in London, and he would go to the station at that time. He checked the timetable one day, and that train was canceled. But out of habit one day he showed up at the station at the usual time and the train was there. It seems that it was going from [[Bristol]] to London, stopping at Reading only to get water. He got on the train anyway, and from then on took that train regularly. One day he was accosted by the conductor after he got on. \"The train doesn't stop here sir!\" \"In that case I didn't get on here.\"<ref>''Kreiseliana: About and Around Georg Kreisel'', ed. by Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Wellesley, MA, 1996, (festschrift)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kreisel–Putnam logic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links and further reading==\n\n* {{Find a Grave|162972801}}\n* ''Kreiseliana: About and Around George Kreisel'',  Piergiorgio Odifreddi, ed., Wellesley, Massachusetts: A.
