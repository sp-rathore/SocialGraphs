His primary field of study was scientific [[axiology]] (the [[Science of Value|science of value]]) and he is known as its original theorist. His axiology is the basis of the [[Hartman Value Inventory]] (also known as the \"Hartman Value Profile (HVP)\".<ref>https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/about/hartman-value-profile/</ref> which is used in [[psychology]] to measure the character of an individual.\n\n== Biography ==\nHartman was born in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire|Germany]] on January 27, 1910. He studied at the [[German College of Political Science]], and also at the [[University of Paris]], the [[London School of Economics]], and at the [[University of Berlin]], from which he received an LL.B. degree.\n\nHe started working as instructor in [[administrative law]] and the [[philosophy of law]] at the [[University of Berlin]], and he also served as Assistant Judge of the District court, Berlin-Charlottenburg. In 1932 he left Germany for Britain and \"started working for [[Walt Disney Productions]] as a copyright representative in Britain and later opened offices for Disney in Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden where he met and married his wife. The Hartmans moved to [[Mexico City]] where he represented Disney Productions in Central America and the Antilles.\"<ref name= \"BIB\">[http://www.lib.utk.edu/spcoll/manuscripts/ms2031fa.html The Robert S. Hartman Collection, 1910-1973], retrieved 15 April 2008.</ref>\n\nIn 1941 he migrated to the United States, became a citizen, and did his doctoral work in philosophy at [[Northwestern University]] in 1946. He taught at the University of Berlin, at [[Lake Forest Academy]] near Chicago, at the [[College of Wooster]], [[Ohio State University]], and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], before assuming duties in Mexico. In 1955-1956 he was Visiting Professor at [[Yale University]]. Robert S. Hartman spent his later days as simultaneously a Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]] as well as at the [[National University of Mexico]]. In the late  1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].\n\nFrom 1950-1957 he was Chairman of the Commission on Peace, International Council of Community Churches.  He served as  Executive Director of the Council of Profit-Sharing Industries, and wrote its first manual.  He was a founder of the Deutsche Institute fur Social-Wirtschaftliche Betriebsgestaltung (industrial organization). He was a founding sponsor of the [[American Association for Humanistic Psychology]]. He has been credited with being the founding spirit behind the prevailing business-retirement plan in the United States today, the 401K Plan.[http://www.wooster.edu/magazine/fall2003/hartman.php] He was the first President of the [[American Society for Value Inquiry]], founded in 1971 by [[James Wilbur]].\n\nHe served as consultant for the practical application of Value Theory with [[AT&T]], [[General Foods]], [[General Electric]], and [[IBM]].\n\nHartman was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1973.\n\nHartman died in Mexico City on September 20, 1973. He had one child, a son, Jan. Jan Hartman was an Emmy-winning screenwriter, author, and playwright. He died of heart failure in October 2006. For the previous 10 years, Jan lived in Hertfordshire, England, with his wife, Stacey McNutt, a book editor.\n\nAn Institute has been set up in  honor  of Robert S. Hartman to explore the implications of his work in formal axiology and [[Science of Value|value science]].\n\n== Work ==\nHe was the subject of doctoral dissertations, including that of a former Chairman of the Philosophy Department at the University of Tennessee, Professor John Davis, as well as of Marvin Charles Katz, whose thesis was later published as a book entitled ''Trends Towards Synthesis''.\n\nHe has published papers on the phenomenology of group measurement, on universal constants in Physics (in his role as a philosopher of science), on the logic of description and valuation, on the contribution of [[St. Anselm]], and on the Concept of Self in [[Søren Kierkegaard]].\n\n=== Value theory ===\nThe reference book ''Who Knows What'' listed Hartman as one of the two living authorities on value theory (the other was [[Charles W. Morris]] (1903-1979)). Among Hartman's publications are the report on Value Theory for the Institut International de Philosophis 1949-1955, published by UNESCO; his magnum opus ''The Structure of Value'' (1967 Southern Illinois University Press); and at the time of his death in 1973 he was working on a manuscript entitled ''The Measurement of Value''.\n\nAnother critical work is his Knowledge of Good (Robert S. HARTMAN, Arthur ELLIS and Rem B. EDWARDS, 2002 Rodopi Press) a thorough study of all the philosophical discussions of goodness and what gaps exist in a complete philosophy of value.  Hartman shows how his Formal Value Theory fills these gaps.\n\n==See also==\n* [[American philosophy]]\n* [[List of American philosophers]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Robert S.
