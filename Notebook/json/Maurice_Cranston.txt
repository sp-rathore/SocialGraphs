He served for many years as Professor of Political Science at the [[London School of Economics]], and was also known for his popular publications. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he was Professor of Political Theory at the [[European University Institute]] in Florence (Italy).\n\nHe was born at 53 Harringay Road, [[Harringay]]<ref name=rosen>F.

During the [[Second World War]], Cranston was a [[conscientious objector]], active in the [[Peace Pledge Union]],  \nand a \"frequent contributor\" to its newspaper ''[[Peace News]]''.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-maurice-cranston-1503237.html Obituary:Professor Maurice Cranston] Alan Eden-Green, ''The Independent'', 10 November 1993. Retrieved 21 April 2011.</ref>\n\nCranston's major works include biographies of [[John Locke]], for which he received the 1957 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and others addressing the history of liberty.<ref name=\"obit\" />\nHe contributed to many publications in both Britain and the [[United States]] and wrote scripts for the BBC. In 1946 two of his detective novels were published by John Westhouse: ''Tomorrow We'll Be Sober'' and ''Philosopher's Hemlock''.\n\nCranston's intellectual abilities were varied. His first academic book, ''Freedom: A New Analysis'' (1954), covered history (the history of liberalism), politics (a precursive discussion of what [[Sir Isaiah Berlin]] would later analyse as negative and positive liberty) and a philosophical attempt to resolve or at least elucidate freedom of the will. The philosophical section was the least successful; and Cranston never again attempted pure philosophy. His main academic strengths were as a biographer and as an intellectual historian.\n\nIn a controversial paper, Cranston argued that the scarcity of welfare goods and services meant that supposed welfare rights are not really rights at all.<ref>Cranston, Maurice. ‘Human Rights: Real and Supposed,’ in Political Theory and the Rights of Man, edited by D. D. Raphael (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1967), pp. 43-51</ref>\n\nIn his later years, Cranston moved to the political right, and expressed admiration for [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>Seldon, Arthur. ''The virtues of capitalism''. Liberty Fund, 2004  ISBN 0-86597-550-7.  (p. 415)</ref> Cranston also contributed to ''The American Spectator'' magazine.\n\nCranston had a keen aesthetic sensibility. This was shown not only in his clothes but also in his elegant literary style. Elegance extended also to his conversation. At a party for politics students at the [[London School of Economics]] in 1965, sherry was much in demand. Professor Kingsley Smellie pointed to a bottle and said to Cranston : 'I hope you've ordered buckets of that stuff'. 'I have', Cranston replied without malice, 'not quite in those terms'.\n\nHe died 5 November 1993 of a heart attack while taping a television production in [[London]] for the BBC. He was 73.\n\n==Publications==\n*''Freedom : A New Analysis'', London : Longmans, Green, 1954.\n*''John Locke : A Biography'', London : Longmans, Green, 1957.\n*''John Stuart MIll'', London : Longmans, Green, 1958.\n*''Human Rights Today'', London : Ampersand, 1962.\n*''Jean-Jacques Rousseau : The Social Contract'', tr. with intro., Harmondsworth : Penguin, 1968.\n*''Politics and Ethics'', Inaugural Lecture, London School of Economics, 1971, London : Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1972.\n*''The Mask of Politics, and Other Essays'', London : Allen Lane, 1973.\n*''What Are Human Rights?'', London : Bodley Head, 1973.\n*''Jean-Jacques: The Early Life and Work'', New York: Norton, 1982.
