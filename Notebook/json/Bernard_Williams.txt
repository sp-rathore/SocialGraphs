Smart]] (1973), ''Moral Luck'' (1981) and ''Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy'' (1985), outlined his attacks on the twin pillars of ethics: [[utilitarianism]] and the moral philosophy of the 18th-century German philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]. Nussbaum wrote that his work \"denounced the trivial and evasive way in which moral philosophy was being practised in England under the aegis of those two dominant theories.\"<ref name=Nussbaum2003/> Both theories simplified the moral life, she wrote, neglecting emotions and personal attachments and how sheer luck shapes our choices.<ref>Nussbaum 2009, 213.</ref><ref>Bernard Williams, \"Moral Luck,\" in ''Moral Luck, 1981, 20–39. First published in ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', supplementary volume 1, 1976, 115–135.</ref> (Williams said in 1996: \"Roughly, if it isn't about obligation or consequences, it doesn't count.\")<ref name=Davies1996/>\n\nKant's ''[[Groundwork for the Metaphysic of Morals|Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten]]'' (1785) expounded a moral system based on the [[categorical imperative]], one formulation of which is: \"Act only according to that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\"{{refn|group=n|Kant: \"Der categorische Imperativ ist also nur ein einziger, und zwar dieser: \"''handle nur nach derjenigen Maxime, durch die due zugleich wollen kannst, daß sie ein allgemeines Gesezt werde''.\"<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals: A German-English edition'', 1786 [1785], Mary Gregor and Jens Timmermann (eds.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011, 4:421, 70–71.</ref>}} Rational agents must act on \"principles of pure rational agency,\" writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and \"what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth,\" writes Moore. But one can ''act'' rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.<ref>Moore 2006, 213.</ref>\n\nWilliams argued that Kant had given the \"purest, deepest and most thorough representation of morality,\"<ref>Williams, ''Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy'', 194.</ref> but that the \"honourable instincts of Kantianism to defend the individuality of individuals against the agglomerative indifference of Utilitarianism\" may not be effective against the Kantian \"abstract character of persons as moral agents.\" We should not be expected to act as though we are not who we are in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.<ref>Bernard Williams, \"Persons, character and morality,\" in Amélie Oksenberg Rorty (ed.), ''The Identities of Persons'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976 (197–216), 200–201, 215.</ref>\n\n===Critique of utilitarianism===\n{{further|Act utilitarianism|Rule utilitarianism|Preference utilitarianism}}\nWilliams set out the case against [[utilitarianism]]&nbsp;–a [[Consequentialism|consequentialist]] position the simplest version of which is that actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number&nbsp;– in ''Utilitarianism: For and Against'' (1973) with [[J. J. C. Smart]]. One of the book's [[thought experiment]]s involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple [[act utilitarianism]] would favour Jim killing one of the men.<ref>J. J. C. Smart, Bernard Williams, ''Utilitarianism: For and Against'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, 98–99.</ref>\n\nWilliams argued that there is a crucial distinction between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect ''Jim'' is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity.<ref>Smart and Williams 1973, 109ff.</ref><ref>Daniel Markovits, \"The architecture of integrity,\" in Daniel Callcut (ed.), ''Reading Bernard Williams'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2009.</ref> We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.<ref>Williams, ''Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy'', 117.</ref>\n\n===Reasons for action===\n{{Further|Internalism and externalism#Reasons}}\nWilliams argued that there are only internal reasons for action: \"A has a reason to φ iff A has some desire the satisfaction of which will be served by his φ-ing.\"<ref>Bernard Williams, \"Internal and external reasons,\" in ''Moral Luck'', 1981 (101–113), 101.

Williams argued that it is meaningless to say that there are external reasons; reason alone does not move people to action.<ref>Bernard Williams, \"Internal Reasons and the Obscurity of Blame,\" 1989, reprinted in Williams, ''Making Sense of Humanity, and Other Philosophical Papers 1982–1993'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995, 35–45.</ref><ref>Bernard Williams, \"Replies,\" in J.

Although part of Williams's intention was to attack those he felt denied the value of truth, the book cautions that, to understand it simply in that sense, would be to miss part of its purpose; rather, as Kenneth Baker wrote, it is \"Williams' reflection on the moral cost of the intellectual vogue for dispensing with the concept of truth.\"<ref name=Baker22Sept2002/>\n\n==Legacy==\nWilliams did not propose any systematic philosophical theory; indeed, he was suspicious of any such attempt.<ref name=Callcut2009>Daniel Callcut, \"Introduction,\" in Callcut 2009, 1–2.</ref> He became known for his dialectical powers, although he was suspicious of them too. [[Alan Code]] wrote that Williams had never been \"impressed by the display of mere dialectical cleverness, least of all in moral philosophy\":\n\n<blockquote>On the contrary, one of the most notable features of his philosophical outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points that may seem obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral or ethical thought is part of human life; that in writing about it, philosophers are writing about something of genuine importance; that it is not easy to say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the relevant measure of value.\"<ref name=Cal/></blockquote>\n\n{{quote box\n|border=1px\n|halign=left\n|quote=Being in Williams's presence is at times painful because of that intensity of aliveness, which challenges the friend to something or other, and yet it was, and is, not terribly clear to what.
