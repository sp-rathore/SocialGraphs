A. Long High School]]. He received a [[master of business administration]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[Stanford University Graduate School of Business]]. He said: \"My early career [after leaving Stanford in 1959] was devoted to setting up [[business school]]s in [[Poverty|low-income]] countries—starting with Ethiopia\". He served during the [[Vietnam War]] as a captain in the [[United States Air Force]], undertaking U.S.-based teaching and organizational duties;<ref name=selfbio/> and for five and a half years was a visiting professor in the Harvard Business School. While at Stanford in the 1950s, he married Frances Fisher Korten, with whom he now lives on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington|Bainbridge Island]] near [[Seattle, Washington]].\n\n==Career and main body of work==\n[[File:David Korten, The Green Interview.webm|thumb|right|David Korten in conversation with [[Silver Donald Cameron]] about his work]]\nKorten served for five and a half years as a visiting associate professor of the [[Harvard University]] Graduate School of Business where he taught in Harvard's middle management, M.B.A., and doctoral programs.\n\nHe also served as the [[Harvard Business School]] adviser to the [[Nicaragua]]-based [[Central American Institute of Business Administration]]. He subsequently joined the staff of the [[Harvard Institute for International Development]], where he headed a [[Ford Foundation]]-funded project to strengthen the organization and management of national [[family planning]] programs.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Korten moved to [[Southeast Asia]], where he lived for nearly fifteen years, serving as a Ford Foundation project specialist and, later, as Asia regional adviser on development management to the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), which involved him in regular travels to Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines.<ref name=selfbio/>\n\nKorten has written that he became disenchanted with the official aid system and devoted his last five years in Asia to \"working with leaders of Asian [[non-governmental organization]]s on identifying the root causes of development failure in the region and building the capacity of [[civil society]] organizations to function as strategic [[economic catalyst|catalyst]]s of national- and global-level change\".<ref name=selfbio/> He formed the view that the poverty, growing inequality, environmental devastation, and [[social disintegration]] he was observing in Asia also was being experienced in nearly every country in the world, including the United States and other \"developed\" countries. He also concluded that the United States was actively promoting—both at home and abroad—the very policies that were deepening the resulting global crisis.\n\nHe returned to the U.S. in 1992 and has assisted in raising public consciousness of the political and institutional consequences of [[economic globalization]] and the expansion of corporate power at the expense of democracy, equity, and [[environmental protection]].\n\nKorten is co-founder and board chair of the [[Positive Futures Network]], which publishes the quarterly ''[[Yes! (U.S. magazine)|YES! Magazine]]''. He is also a founding board member, emeritus, of the Business Alliance for Local Living Economies, a former associate of the [[International Forum on Globalization]],<ref name=\"ifg\">[http://www.ifg.org/ International Forum on Globalization]</ref> and a member of the [[Club of Rome]].\n\n==''The Post-Corporate World''==\nBuilding on the arguments put forward in his 1995 book ''When Corporations Rule the World'', Korten expands on several of the themes. Having made a case for the unworkability of current economic systems on several grounds - the impoverishment of the majority of the population, the need for indefinitely expanding credit leading to the debasement of the currency, and the finite limits of energy and material resources - he provides a context for discussing alternative ways of life, and explores possible courses of action to establish them.\n\n==''The Great Turning''==\n[[File:David Korten at The Great Turning in October 2010.jpg|thumb|David Korten in 2010]]\nKorten's 2006 book ''The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community'' argues that the development of empires about 5,000 years ago, initiated unequal distribution of power and social benefits to the small portion of the population they controlled. He also argues that corporations are modern versions of empire, both being social organizations based on hierarchies, chauvinism, and domination through violence.\n\nThe rise of powerful, [[High technology|advanced technology]] combined with the control of corporate- as well as nation-based empires is described as becoming increasingly destructive to communities and the environment. Korten postulates that the world is on the verge of a [[perfect storm]] of converging crises, including [[anthropogenic]] adverse [[climate change]], [[peak oil|post-peak oil production decline]], and a [[financial crisis]] caused by an unbalanced global economy. This will precipitate major changes to the current economic and social structure.\n\nKorten believes that these crises will present an opportunity for significant changes that could replace the paradigm of \"Empire\" with one of \"Earth Community\". Although recognizing the potential that the opportunity may not be seized, Korten hopes that this opportunity will result in the emergence of an \"Earth Community\", based on sustainable, just, and caring communities that incorporate the values of mutual responsibility and accountability, and he advocates toward that.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Planned Change in a Traditional Society: Psychological Problems of Modernization in Ethiopia'', 1972, Praeger Publishers\n* ''People-Centered Development: Contributions Toward Theory and Planning Frameworks'', with Rudi Klauss, 1984, Kumarian Press\n* ''Bureaucracy and the Poor: Closing the Gap'', with Felipe B.
