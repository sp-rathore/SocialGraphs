After the success of the revolution, he quickly resigned, due to [[Beiyang Clique]] pressure, from his post as President of the newly founded Republic of China, and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the [[warlord era|warlord]]s who controlled much of the nation.

His party, which formed a fragile alliance with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]], split into two factions after his death.\n\nSun's chief legacy resides in his developing of the [[political philosophy]] known as the [[Three Principles of the People]]: nationalism (non-ethnic, independence from imperialist domination), democracy, and the people's livelihood (free trade and [[Georgist]] tax reform<ref>{{cite book|last=Trescott|first=Paul B.|title=Jingji Xue: The History of the Introduction of Western Economic Ideas Into China, 1850-1950|year=2007|publisher=Chinese University Press|pages=46–48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RkJtJm9L7mQC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22basis+of+our+program+OR+reform%22+Leng+sun+yat+sen&source=bl&ots=jD4Er59--_&sig=9w4ekTvan6dbxPqCw6uW4MIq1z8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_M0mU8b3C8jioASlvYLQAw&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22basis%20of%20our%20program%20OR%20reform%22%20Leng%20sun%20yat%20sen&f=false|quote='The teachings of your single-taxer, Henry George, will be the basis of our program of reform.'}}</ref>).<ref>Schoppa, Keith R.

However, as the war ended in July 1902, America emerged victorious from a bitter 3-year war against the Republic.

He raised money for his revolutionary party and to support uprisings in China. In 1896 he was detained at the [[Embassy of China, London|Chinese Legation in London]], where the Chinese Imperial secret service planned to kill him. He was released after 12 days through the efforts of [[James Cantlie]], ''[[The Times]]'', and the [[Foreign Office]], leaving Sun a hero in Britain.<ref>Contrary to popular legends, Sun entered the Legation voluntarily, but was prevented from leaving. The Legation planned to execute him, before returning his body to Beijing for ritual beheading. Cantlie, his former teacher, was refused a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' because of the Legation's [[diplomatic immunity]], but he began a campaign through ''[[The Times]]''.

Later, he initiated the establishment of reading clubs across Singapore and Malaysia, in order to disseminate revolutionary ideas among the lower class through public readings of newspaper stories. The United Chinese Library, founded on 8 August 1910, was one such reading club, first set up at leased property on the second floor of the Wan He Salt Traders in North Boat Quay.\n\nThe first actual United Chinese Library building was built between 1908 and 1911 below Fort Canning - 51 Armenian Street, commenced operations in 1912.  The library was set up as a part of the 50 reading rooms by the Chinese Republicans to serve as an information station and liaison point for the revolutionaries. In 1987, the library was moved to its present site at Cantonment Road. But the Armenian Street building is still intact with the plaque at its entrance with Sun Yat Sen's words. With an initial membership of over 400, the library has about 180 members today. Although the United Chinese Library, with 102 years of history, was not the only reading club in Singapore during the time, today it is the only one of its kind remaining.\n\n===Zhennanguan uprising===\nOn 1 December 1907, Sun led the [[Xinhai Revolution#Zhennanguan Uprising|Zhennanguan uprising]] against the Qing at [[Friendship Pass]], which is the border between [[Guangxi]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref name=\"Khoo\">Khoo, Salma Nasution.

The new [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|Provisional Government of the Republic of China]] was created along with the [[Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China]].  Sun is credited for the funding of the revolutions and for keeping the spirit of revolution alive, even after a series of failed uprisings. His successful merger of minor revolutionary groups to a single larger party provided a better base for all those who shared the same ideals.  A number of things were introduced such as the [[Minguo calendar|republic calendar system]] and new fashion like [[Mao suit|Zhongshan suits]].\n\n===Beiyang government===\n{{main|Beiyang government}}\n[[Yuan Shikai]], who controlled the [[Beiyang Army]], the military of northern China, was promised the position of President of the Republic of China if he could get the Qing court to abdicate.<ref name=\"Fu\" />  On 12 February 1912 Emperor Puyi did abdicate the throne.<ref name=\"Well\" />  Sun stepped down as President, and Yuan became the new provisional president in Beijing on 10 March 1912.<ref name=\"Fu\" />  The provisional government did not have any military forces of its own, its control over elements of the [[New Army]] that had mutinied was limited and there were still significant forces which still had not declared against the Qing.\n\nSun Yat-sen sent telegrams to the leaders of all provinces requesting them to elect and to establish the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China]] in 1912.<ref>[[#Bergère & Lloyd|Bergère]]: 226</ref>  In May 1912 the legislative assembly moved from Nanjing to Beijing with its 120 members divided between members of [[Tongmenghui]] and a Republican party that supported Yuan Shikai.<ref name=\"chien\">Ch'ien Tuan-sheng.

At stake in this struggle was the right to lay claim to Sun's ambiguous legacy. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek married [[Soong Mei-ling]], a sister of Sun's widow [[Soong Ching-ling]], and subsequently he could claim to be a brother-in-law of Sun. When the [[12 April Incident|Communists and the Kuomintang split]] in 1927, marking the start of the [[Chinese Civil War]], each group claimed to be his true heirs, a conflict that continued through World War II.  Sun's widow, [[Soong Ching-ling]], sided with the Communists during the Chinese Civil War and served from 1949 to 1981 as Vice-President (or Vice-Chairwoman) of the People's Republic of China and as Honorary President shortly before her death in 1981.\n\n===Cult of personality===\nA [[personality cult]] in the Republic of China was centered on Sun and his successor, [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]].

[[Zhongshan Memorial Middle School]] has also been a name used by many schools. [[Zhongshan Park]] is also a common name used for a number of places named after him.  The first highway in Taiwan is called the [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|Sun Yat-sen expressway]]. Two ships are also named after him, the [[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan]] and [[Chinese cruiser Yat Sen]].
