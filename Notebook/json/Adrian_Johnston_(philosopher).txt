Influenced by [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] and his readings of [[German idealism]], Johnston’s work has gained many readers among those making the materialist and realist turns in [[Continental philosophy]].<ref name=\"societyandspace.com\">{{cite web|url=http://societyandspace.com/material/interviews/interview-with-adrian-johnston-on-transcendental-materialism/|title=Interview with Adrian Johnston on Transcendental Materialism|work=Society and space|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Johnston’s books are guided by his “transcendental materialism,” which in sum calls for a materialist ontology that nevertheless does not reduce away the gap or figure that is human subjectivity. Johnston argues for retooling [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]] after the success of the natural sciences in recent decades, but argues that both Freud and Lacan presaged a lot of these successes. Critical of the thinkers of immanence whom he believes, following [[Hegel]], can only give us subjectless substance, Johnston’s work has brought Lacanianism into the 21st century when many wrongly claimed it dead long before the end of the last.<ref name=\"societyandspace.com\"/>\n\nJohnston is the author of ''Time Driven: Metapsychology and the Splitting of the Drive'' (2005), ''Žižek’s Ontology: A Transcendental Materialist Theory of Subjectivity'' (2008), ''Badiou, Žižek, and Political Transformations: The Cadence of Change'' (2009), and ''Prolegomena to Any Future Materialism, Volume One: The Outcome of contemporary French Philosophy'' (2013), all published by Northwestern University Press.
