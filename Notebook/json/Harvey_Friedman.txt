He has worked on [[reverse mathematics]], a project intended to derive the axioms of mathematics from the theorems considered to be necessary. In recent years this has advanced to a study of Boolean relation theory, which attempts to justify [[large cardinal]] [[axiom]]s by demonstrating their necessity for deriving certain propositions considered \"concrete\".\n\nFriedman earned his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1967, with a [[dissertation]] on ''Subsystems of Analysis''. His advisor was [[Gerald Sacks]]. Friedman received the [[Alan T. Waterman Award]] in 1984. He delivered the {{ill-WD|Tarski Lectures|Q1291783}} in 2007.\n\nIn 1967, Friedman was listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for being the world's youngest professor when he taught at [[Stanford University]] at age 18 as an [[assistant professor]] of [[philosophy]].<ref name=hphil/><ref>[http://u.osu.edu/friedman.8/ Dr. Harvey Martin Friedman]</ref><ref>[http://www.osu.edu/facultystaff-web/university_awards/2007/lecturer.php Ohio State University Distinguished Lecturers (2007â€”2008)]</ref> He has also been a [[professor]] of [[mathematics]] and a professor of music.<ref>[http://u.osu.edu/friedman.8/foundational-adventures/degrees-employment-students-contact/ Harvey Friedman's Degrees and Employment History]</ref> He officially retired in July of 2012.\n\nFriedman is the brother of mathematician [[Sy Friedman]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Friedman's grand conjecture]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Leo Harrington|L.
