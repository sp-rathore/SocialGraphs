The alternative to electoral politics]] (1985) Burnheim used the term \"[[demarchy]]\" (created by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his [[Law, Legislation and Liberty]]) to describe a political system without the [[Sovereign state|state]] or bureaucracies, and based instead on randomly selected groups of decision makers. This has striking resemblances to classical democratic ideas, as reported by [[Thucydides]]. In 2006 Burnheim published a second edition with a new preface in which he directed the reader to an emphasis that \"a polity organised by negotiation between specialised authorities would work much better than one based on centralised authority\".<ref name=burnpref >Burnheim J.

The point of this is to remedy the defect of existing democracies in which issues are settled according to the power strategies of politicians rather than the merits of the case.\n\nSecond that the committee in charge of each policy body should be statistically representative of those who are most substantially affected by their decisions. The hope is that this would lead to better decisions, not just the wishful thinking of populist spin.\n \nBurnheim used to be a [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]<ref name=stove >Stove D.
