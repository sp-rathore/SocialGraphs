The column continued with the same format but a new byline until early 2015, when it abandoned the question and answer format for a discussion format among a number of persons.\n\nCohen donated $585 to [[MoveOn|MoveOn.org's]] voter registration effort in 2004, apparently in violation of ''Times'' policy, which had banned political donations in 2003. The [[Spokane]], Wash., ''[[The Spokesman-Review|Spokesman-Review]]'' decided on June 20, 2007, to drop Cohen's column, which had been scheduled to begin running in the paper on the following Saturday, because of his donation. Cohen responded that he saw no ethical violation, because he viewed MoveOn as no more activist than other organizations, such as the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. Nonetheless, he said he would not make such donations in the future.<ref>{{cite web| date=June 2007 | url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19113485/page/2/ | title=Journalists dole out campaign cash| publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref>\n\nCohen wrote about the eighteenth century boxing champion [[Daniel Mendoza]].

In Cohen's view of ethics, individuals are all more or less the same with respect to ethics, but [[society]] is often to blame for the very existence of an ethical dilemma, which aligns him (by his own admission) with many of the beliefs of the [[Society for Ethical Culture]]; a fundamental premise of this ethical framework is that humans are morally obligated to promote changes in society so all people can lead more ethical lives.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Modest Proposals'' (1981, ISBN 0-312-54365-4), a book of satiric letters\n*''Diary of a Flying Man'' (1989, ISBN 978-0-394-56124-0), a collection of stories and humor pieces\n*''The Good, the Bad & the Difference: How to Tell Right from Wrong in Everyday Situations'' (2002, ISBN 0-385-50273-7), a collection of his columns<ref>{{cite web| title=The Good, the Bad & the Difference | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/ethicist/| publisher=[[Random House]]}}</ref>\n*''Be Good: how to navigate the ethics of everything'' (2012, Chronicle Books ISBN 978-1452107905), a guide, in Q&A format, to facing everyday moral challenges.\n\n== Personal life ==\nCohen was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and raised in [[Reading, Pennsylvania]],<ref name=\"mjh09\">{{cite web| title=New York Times \"Ethicist\" Randy Cohen’s Provocative First Play The Punishing Blow to be Performed at the Museum of Jewish Heritage — A Living Memorial to the Holocaust | url=http://www.mjhnyc.org/pressroom/documents/PunishingBlow.pdf | format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | publisher=[[Museum of Jewish Heritage]] | work=Press release| date=February 26, 2009| accessdate=2009-10-12}}</ref> in what he has called a \"suburban [[Reform Judaism|reform Jewish]] household.\"<ref>{{cite web| title=Q&A with Randy Cohen | url=http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/talk-cohen-randy.asp | publisher=bookreporter.com | year=2002}}</ref>\n\nHe was formerly married to the writer and [[activism|activist]] [[Katha Pollitt]], with whom he has a daughter, Sophie Pollitt-Cohen.\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2009}}\nSpecific references:\n{{Reflist|2}}\nGeneral references:\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.gothamist.com/archives/2004/10/08/randy_cohen_the_ethicist.php October 2004 interview with Cohen] from [[Gothamist]].com\n*December 1999: [http://www.reason.com/news/show/31198.html The Ethicist Who Isn't], a critique of the column from [[Reason magazine]]\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb name|id=0169694|name=Randy Cohen}}\n*[http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?ppds=ctax&v1=Top%2fFeatures%2fMagazine%2fColumns%2fThe%20Ethicist The Ethicist Archives] at the ''New York Times'' website\n*[http://personplacething.org/ Person Place Thing with Randy Cohen]\n*{{cite web| date=November 2000| url= http://www.slate.com/id/93140/ | title=No. 500: End of an Error| work=Cohen's 500th (and last) \"News Quiz\" | publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] magazine}}\n\n{{Andrews McMeel Universal}}\n{{EmmyAward ComedyVarietyMusicWriting 1975-2000}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cohen, Randy}}\n[[Category:American advice columnists]]\n[[Category:American male screenwriters]]\n[[Category:Jewish American writers]]\n[[Category:University at Albany, SUNY alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:People from Charleston, South Carolina]]\n[[Category:NPR personalities]]\n[[Category:David Letterman]]\n[[Category:The New York Times columnists]]\n[[Category:Emmy Award winners]]\n[[Category:American ethicists]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Randy Cohen"}}}}
