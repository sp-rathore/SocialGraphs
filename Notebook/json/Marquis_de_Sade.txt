His works include novels, short stories, plays, dialogues, and political tracts; in his lifetime some were published under his own name, while others appeared anonymously and de Sade denied being their author. De Sade is best known for his [[erotic literature|erotic]] works, which combined philosophical discourse with pornography, depicting [[sexual fantasies]] with an emphasis on [[violence]], criminality, and [[blasphemy]] against the [[Catholic Church]]. He was a proponent of extreme [[freedom (philosophy)|freedom]], unrestrained by [[morality]], religion, or law. The words ''[[sexual sadism disorder|sadism]]'' and ''[[wikt:sadist|sadist]]'' are derived from his name.\n\nDe Sade was incarcerated in various prisons and an [[insane asylum]] for about 32 years of his life: 11 years in Paris (10 of which were spent in the [[Bastille]]), a month in the [[Conciergerie]], two years in a fortress, a year in [[Madelonnettes Convent]], three years in [[Bicêtre Hospital]], a year in [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]], and 12 years in the [[Charenton (asylum)|Charenton asylum]]. During the [[French Revolution]] he was an elected delegate to the [[National Convention]]. Many of his works were written in prison.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life and education===\n[[File:Lacoste France.jpg|thumb|The [[Château de Lacoste]] above [[Lacoste, Vaucluse|Lacoste]], a residence of Sade; currently the site of theater festivals.]]\n\nThe Marquis de Sade was born in the [[Hôtel de Condé]], [[Paris]], to Jean Baptiste François Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie Eléonore de Maillé de Carman, cousin and [[Lady-in-waiting]] to the [[Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg|Princess of Condé]] on 2 June 1740.

His grandfather, Gaspard François de Sade, was the first to use ''marquis'';<ref name=lely>''Vie du Marquis de Sade'' by Gilbert Lêly, 1961</ref> occasionally, he was the ''Marquis de Sade'', but is identified in documents as the ''Marquis de [[Mazan]]''. The de Sade family were ''[[Nobles of the Sword|noblesse d'épée]]'', claiming at the time the oldest, [[Franks|Frank]]-descended nobility, so, assuming a noble title without a King's grant, was customarily ''[[Wiktionary:de rigueur|de rigueur]]''. Alternating title usage indicates that titular hierarchy (below ''[[peerage of France|duc et pair]]'') was notional; theoretically, the ''marquis'' title was granted to noblemen owning ''several'' countships, but its use by men of dubious lineage caused its disrepute. At Court, precedence was by seniority and royal favor, not title. There is father-and-son correspondence, wherein father addresses son as ''marquis''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nFor many years, de Sade's descendants regarded his life and work as a scandal to be suppressed. This did not change until the mid-twentieth century, when the Comte Xavier de Sade reclaimed the marquis title, long fallen into disuse, on his visiting cards,<ref>du Plessix Gray, Francine ''At Home With The Marquis de Sade: A Life'', Simon and Schuster 1998, p420</ref> and took an interest in his ancestor's writings. At that time, the \"Divine Marquis\" of legend was so unmentionable in his own family that Xavier de Sade only learned of him in the late 1940s when approached by a journalist.<ref>du Plessix Gray, Francine ''At Home With The Marquis de Sade: A Life'', Simon and Schuster 1998, p418</ref> He subsequently discovered a store of de Sade's papers in the family château at Condé-en-Brie, and worked with scholars for decades to enable their publication.<ref name=Smith2015>{{cite news|last1=Perrottet|first1=Tony|title=Who Was the Marquis de Sade?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-marquis-de-sade-180953980/?all|accessdate=25 January 2015|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2015}}</ref> His youngest son, the Marquis Thibault de Sade, has continued the collaboration.

He was also accused of [[blasphemy]], a serious offense at that time. His behavior included an affair with his wife's sister, Anne-Prospère, who had come to live at the castle.<ref name=Smith2015/>\n\nBeginning in 1763, de Sade lived mainly in or near Paris. Several prostitutes there complained about mistreatment by him and he was put under surveillance by the police, who made detailed reports of his activities. After several short imprisonments, which included a brief incarceration in the [[Château de Saumur]] (then a prison), he was exiled to his château at Lacoste in 1768.<ref>[http://www.neilschaeffer.com/sade/timeline/index.htm Timeline of de Sade's life] by Neil Schaeffer. Retrieved 12 September 2006.</ref>\n\nThe first major scandal occurred on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which de Sade procured the sexual services of a woman, Rose Keller,<ref>{{cite book|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=Life of Sade|origyear=1971|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux|location=New York}}</ref> a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, de Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs. Then he whipped her, made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, and then beat her. He repeated this process seven or eight times, when she finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, de Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'' (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding de Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The ''lettre de cachet'' would later prove disastrous for the marquis.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=5kn_ws4c1VUC&pg=PA220&dq=rose+keller&hl=fr&sa=X&ei=oPXgVPnvDZCV7Aa-sYGACA&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=rose%20keller&f=false Kathleen Barry, \"Female Sexual Slavery\", p.220]</ref>\n\nIn 1772, an episode in [[Marseille]] involved the non-lethal poisoning of prostitutes with the supposed [[aphrodisiac]] [[cantharidin|Spanish fly]] and [[sodomy]] with Latour, his manservant. That year, the two men were sentenced to death [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] for sodomy and the poisoning. They fled to Italy, de Sade taking his wife's sister with him. De Sade and Latour were caught and imprisoned at the [[Fortress of Miolans]] in late 1772, but escaped four months later.\n[[File:Deatail of The 120 Days of Sodom, or the School of Libertinism.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Detail of [[The 120 Days of Sodom|Les 120 Journées de Sodome]] manuscript]]\nDe Sade later hid at Lacoste, where he rejoined his wife, who became an accomplice in his subsequent endeavors.<ref name=Smith2015/> He kept a group of young employees at Lacoste, most of whom complained about sexual mistreatment and quickly left his service. De Sade was forced to flee to Italy once again. It was during this time he wrote ''Voyage d'Italie''. In 1776, he returned to Lacoste, again hired several servant girls, most of whom fled. In 1777, the father of one of those employees went to Lacoste to claim his daughter, and attempted to shoot the Marquis at point-blank range, but the gun misfired.\n\nLater that year, de Sade was tricked into going to Paris to visit his supposedly ill mother, who in fact had recently died. He was arrested there and imprisoned in the [[Château de Vincennes]]. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778, but remained imprisoned under the ''lettre de cachet''. He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]], who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mirabeau|first=Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti|authorlink=Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|title=L'Œuvre du comte de Mirabeau|year=1921|publisher=Bibliothèque des curieux|location=Paris, France|pages=9|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k206962n.notice|author2=Guillaume Apollinaire |author3=P. Pierrugues}}</ref>\n\nIn 1784, Vincennes was closed, and de Sade was transferred to the [[Bastille]]. On 2 July 1789, he reportedly shouted out from his cell to the crowd outside, \"They are killing the prisoners here!\", and a disturbance began to foment.<ref name=Smith2015/> Two days later, he was transferred to the [[Charenton (asylum)|insane asylum at Charenton]] near Paris. The [[storming of the Bastille]], a major event of the [[French Revolution]], would occur a few days later on 14 July.\n\nHe had been working on his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Les 120 Journées de Sodome'' (''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]''). To his despair, he believed that the manuscript was lost during his transfer, but he continued to write.<ref name=Smith2015/>\n\nIn 1790, he was released from Charenton after the new [[National Constituent Assembly]] abolished the instrument of ''lettre de cachet''. His wife obtained a divorce soon after.\n\n===Return to freedom, delegate to the National Convention, and imprisonment===\nDuring Sade's time of freedom, beginning in 1790, he published several of his books anonymously. He met Marie-Constance Quesnet, a former actress, and mother of a six-year-old son, who had been abandoned by her husband. Constance and de Sade would stay together for the rest of his life.\n\nHe initially ingratiated himself with the new political situation after the revolution, supported the Republic,<ref name=\"glbtq\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/sade.html|last=McLemee|first=Scott|title=Sade, Marquis de|year=2002|periodical=[[glbtq.com]]|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> called himself \"Citizen de Sade\", and managed to obtain several official positions despite his aristocratic background.\n\nBecause of the damage done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, he was elected to the [[National Convention]], where he represented the [[far-left politics|far left]]. He was a member of the Piques [[revolutionary sections of Paris|section]], notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of [[direct vote]]. However, there is much to suggest that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. De Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save his neck. Later that year, his name was added – whether by error or wilful malice – to the list of [[émigré]]s of the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] [[Department (administrative division)|department]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/acropolis/7362/timeline.htm|title=The Life and Times of the Marquis de Sade|publisher=Geocities.com|accessdate=23 October 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/athens/acropolis/7362/timeline.htm&date=2009-10-25+12:51:08|archivedate=25 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nWhile claiming he was opposed to the [[Reign of Terror]] in 1793, he wrote an admiring [[eulogy]] for [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} At this stage, he was becoming publicly critical of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and, on 5 December, he was removed from his posts, accused of \"moderatism\", and imprisoned for almost a year. He was released in 1794, after the overthrow and execution of Robespierre had effectively ended the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn 1796, now all but destitute, he had to sell his ruined castle in Lacoste.\n\n===Imprisonment for his writings and death===\n[[File:Sade 1.jpeg|thumb|right|The first page of de Sade's ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]'', one of the works for which he was imprisoned.]]\nIn 1801, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]'' and ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]''.<ref name=Smith2015/> De Sade was arrested at his publisher's office and imprisoned without trial; first in the [[Sainte-Pélagie Prison]] and, following allegations that he had tried to seduce young fellow prisoners there, in the harsh fortress of [[Bicêtre Hospital|Bicêtre]].\n\nAfter intervention by his family, he was declared insane in 1803 and transferred once more to the [[Charenton (asylum)|asylum at Charenton]]. His ex-wife and children had agreed to pay his pension there. Constance was allowed to live with him at Charenton. The benign director of the institution, [[Abbé de Coulmier]], allowed and encouraged him to stage several of his plays, with the inmates as actors, to be viewed by the Parisian public.<ref name=Smith2015/> Coulmier's novel approaches to psychotherapy attracted much opposition. In 1809, new police orders put de Sade into solitary confinement and deprived him of pens and paper. In 1813, the government ordered Coulmier to suspend all theatrical performances.\n\nDe Sade began a sexual relationship with 14-year-old Madeleine LeClerc, daughter of an employee at Charenton. This affair lasted some 4 years, until his death in 1814.\n\nHe had left instructions in his [[living will|will]] forbidding that his body be opened for any reason whatsoever, and that it remain untouched for 48 hours in the chamber in which he died, and then placed in a coffin and buried on his property located in Malmaison near [[Épernon]]. His skull was later removed from the grave for [[phrenology|phrenological]] examination.<ref name=Smith2015/> His son had all his remaining unpublished manuscripts burned, including the immense multi-volume work ''[[Les Journées de Florbelle]]''.\n\n==Appraisal and criticism==\n{{Individualism sidebar}}Numerous writers and artists, especially those concerned with sexuality, have been both repelled and fascinated by de Sade.\n\nThe contemporary rival pornographer [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Rétif de la Bretonne]] published an ''[[Anti-Justine]]'' in 1798.\n\n[[Geoffrey Gorer]], an English anthropologist and author (1905–1985), wrote one of the earliest books on de Sade entitled ''The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade'' in 1935. He pointed out that de Sade was in complete opposition to contemporary philosophers for both his \"complete and continual denial of the right to property\" and for viewing the struggle in late 18th century French society as being not between \"the Crown, the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy or the clergy, or sectional interests of any of these against one another\", but rather all of these \"more or less united against the [[proletariat]].\" By holding these views, he cut himself off entirely from the revolutionary thinkers of his time to join those of the mid-nineteenth century. Thus, Gorer argued, \"he can with some justice be called the first reasoned [[socialist]].\"<ref>Gorer, Geoffrey. ''The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade'', p. 197.</ref>\n\n[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (in her essay ''Must we burn Sade?'', published in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', December 1951 and January 1952) and other writers have attempted to locate traces of a radical philosophy of [[freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] in de Sade's writings, preceding modern [[existentialism]] by some 150 years. He has also been seen as a precursor of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]] in his focus on sexuality as a motive force. The [[surrealism|surrealists]] admired him as one of their forerunners, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] famously called him \"the freest spirit that has yet existed\".<ref>{{cite book|last= Queenan|first=Joe|title=Malcontents|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia|year=2004|isbn=0-7624-1697-1|page=519}}</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Klossowski]], in his 1947 book ''Sade Mon Prochain'' (\"Sade My Neighbour\"), analyzes de Sade's philosophy as a precursor of [[nihilism]], negating Christian values and the [[French materialism|materialism]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nOne of the essays in [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]'s ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947) is titled \"Juliette, or Enlightenment and Morality\" and interprets the ruthless and calculating behavior of ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]'' as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. Similarly, psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] posited in his 1966 essay \"Kant avec de Sade\" that de Sade's ethics was the complementary completion of the [[categorical imperative]] originally formulated by [[Immanuel Kant]]. However, at least one philosopher has rejected Adorno and Horkheimer’s claim that de Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.<ref>Geoffrey Roche, \"Much Sense the Starkest Madness: de Sade’s Moral Scepticism.\" ''Angelaki'' Volume 15, Issue 1 April 2010, pages 45 – 59.

Connolly]] analyzes Sade's ''[[Philosophy in the Bedroom]]'' as an argument against earlier political philosophers, notably [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], and their attempts to reconcile nature, reason, and virtue as bases of ordered society. Similarly, [[Camille Paglia]]<ref>Paglia, Camille. (1990) ''[[Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson]].'' NY: Vintage, ISBN 0-679-73579-8, Chapter 8, \"Return of the Great Mother: Rousseau vs. Sade\".</ref> argued that de Sade can be best understood as a satirist, responding \"point by point\" to Rousseau's claims that society inhibits and corrupts mankind's innate goodness: Paglia notes that Sade wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when Rousseauist [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]]s instituted the bloody [[Reign of Terror]] and Rousseau's predictions were brutally disproved.\n\nIn ''The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography'' (1979), [[Angela Carter]] provides a feminist reading of Sade, seeing him as a \"moral pornographer\" who creates spaces for women. Similarly, [[Susan Sontag]] defended both Sade and [[Georges Bataille]]'s ''Histoire de l'oeil'' (''[[Story of the Eye]]'') in her essay \"The Pornographic Imagination\" (1967) on the basis their works were [[transgressive fiction|transgressive]] texts, and argued that neither should be censored. By contrast, [[Andrea Dworkin]] saw Sade as the exemplary woman-hating pornographer, supporting her theory that pornography inevitably leads to violence against women. One chapter of her book ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'' (1979) is devoted to an analysis of Sade. [[Susie Bright]] claims that Dworkin's first novel ''Ice and Fire'', which is rife with violence and abuse, can be seen as a modern retelling of Sade's ''Juliette''.<ref>[http://susiebright.blogs.com/susie_brights_journal_/2005/04/andrea_dworkin_.html Andrea Dworkin has Died], from Susie Bright's Journal, 11 April 2005.

The eponym of the [[psychology|psychological]] and [[subculture|subcultural]] term ''[[wikt:sadism|sadism]]'', his name is used variously to evoke [[sexual assault|sexual violence]], licentiousness, and [[freedom of speech]].<ref name= Phillips>Phillips, John, 2005, ''The Marquis De Sade: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-280469-3.</ref> In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica.<ref name=Guins>Guins, Raiford, and Cruz, Omayra Zaragoza, 2005, ''Popular Culture: A Reader'', Sage Publications, ISBN 0-7619-7472-5.</ref> Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus became a symbol of the artist's struggle with the censor. De Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. De Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism that became reality in the economic liberalism of the following centuries.<ref name=MacNair>MacNair, Brian, 2002, ''Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire'', Routledge, ISBN 0-415-23733-5.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in de Sade; leading French intellectuals like [[Roland Barthes]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Michel Foucault]] published studies of the philosopher, and interest in de Sade among scholars and artists continued.<ref name=Phillips/> In the realm of visual arts, many [[surrealism|surrealist]] artists had interest in the Marquis. De Sade was celebrated in surrealist periodicals, and feted by figures such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Paul Éluard]], and Maurice Heine; [[Man Ray]] admired Sade because he and other surrealists viewed him as an ideal of freedom.<ref name=MacNair/> The first ''[[Surrealist Manifesto|Manifesto of Surrealism]]'' (1924) announced that \"Sade is surrealist in sadism\", and extracts of the original draft of ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]'' were published in ''Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution''.<ref name=Bate>Bate, David, 2004, ''Photography and Surrealism: Sexuality, Colonialism and Social Dissent'', I.B. Tauris, ISBN 1-86064-379-5.</ref> In literature, de Sade is referenced in several stories by horror and science fiction writer (and author of [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]) [[Robert Bloch]], while Polish science fiction author [[Stanisław Lem]] wrote an essay analyzing the [[game theory]] arguments appearing in de Sade's ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]''.<ref name=\"Lem\">{{cite news|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/lem40interview.htm|publisher=DePauw University|title=Twenty-Two Answers and Two Postscripts: An Interview with Stanislaw Lem|author=Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr.|year= 1986}}</ref> The writer [[Georges Bataille]] applied de Sade's methods of writing about sexual transgression to shock and provoke readers.<ref name=MacNair/>\n\nDe Sade's life and works have been the subject of numerous fictional plays, films, pornographic or erotic drawings, etchings, and more.\nThese include [[Peter Weiss]]'s play ''[[Marat/Sade]]'', a fantasia extrapolating from the fact that de Sade directed plays performed by his fellow inmates at the Charenton asylum.<ref name=Dancyger>Dancyger, Ken, 2002, ''The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice'', Focal Press, ISBN 0-240-80225-X.</ref> [[Yukio Mishima]], [[Barry Yzereef]], and [[Doug Wright]] also wrote plays about de Sade; Weiss's and Wright's plays have been made into films. His work is referenced on film at least as early as\n[[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'' (1930), the final segment of which provides a coda to de Sade's ''120 Days of Sodom'', with the four debauched noblemen emerging from their mountain retreat. In 1969, American International Films released a German-made production called ''[[de Sade]]'', with [[Keir Dullea]] in the title role. [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] filmed ''[[Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'' (1975),\nupdating de Sade's novel to the brief [[Italian Social Republic|Salò Republic]]; [[Benoît Jacquot]]'s ''[[Sade (film)|Sade]]'' and [[Philip Kaufman]]'s ''[[Quills]]'' (from the play of the same name by Doug Wright) both hit cinemas in 2000. ''Quills'', inspired by de Sade's imprisonment and battles with the censorship in his society,<ref name=MacNair/> portrays de Sade as a literary freedom fighter who is a martyr to the cause of free expression.<ref name= Raengo>Raengo, Alessandra, and Stam, Robert, 2005, ''Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Film Adaptation'', Blackwell, ISBN 0-631-23055-6.</ref><!--NOTE: This section is a summary of the [[Marquis de Sade in popular culture]] article. Please do not add content here unless it is included in that article and is supported by independent reliable sources.-->\n\nOften de Sade himself has been depicted in American popular culture less as a revolutionary or even as a libertine and more akin to a sadistic, tyrannical villain. For example, in the final episode of the television series ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'', Micki, the female protagonist, travels back in time and ends up being imprisoned and tortured by de Sade. Similarly, in the horror film ''[[Waxwork (1988 film)|Waxwork]]'', de Sade is among the film's wax villains to come alive.\n\n==Writing==\n\n===Literary criticism===\nThe Marquis de Sade viewed [[Gothic fiction]] as a genre that relied heavily on magic and [[phantasmagoria]]. In his literary criticism de Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled \"Gothic\" by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel was a perfectly natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to \"look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels.\" Sade held the work of writers [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]] and [[Ann Radcliffe]] high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' ''[[The Monk]]'' as without question the genre’s best achievement. De Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was forced to choose between elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanations at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of ''The Monk'', de Sade believed that there was not a single Gothic novel that had been able to overcome these problems. He theorized that if these problems were successfully avoided within the genre that the resulting work would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sade|first=Marquis de|chapter=An Essay on Novels|title=The Crimes of Love|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-953998-7}}</ref>\n\nMany assume that de Sade's criticism of the Gothic novel is a reflection of his frustration with sweeping interpretations of works like ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]''. Within his objections to the lack of verisimilitude in the Gothic may have been an attempt to present his own work as the better representation of the whole nature of man. Since de Sade professed that the ultimate goal of an author should be to deliver an accurate portrayal of man, it is believed that de Sade's attempts to separate himself from the Gothic novel highlights this conviction. For de Sade, his work was best suited for the accomplishment of this goal in part because he was not chained down by the supernatural silliness that dominated late 18th-century fiction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gorer|first= Geoffrey|title=The Life and Ideas of the Marquis de Sade|location=New York|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=1962}}</ref> Moreover, it is believed that de Sade praised ''The Monk'' (which displays Ambrosio’s sacrifice of his humanity to his unrelenting sexual appetite) as the best Gothic novel chiefly because its themes were the closest to those within his own work.<ref name=Intro>{{cite news|title=Introduction|work=The Crimes of Love|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn= 978-0-19-953998-7}}</ref>\n\n===Libertine novels===\nDe Sade's fiction has been tagged under many different titles, including pornography, Gothic, and [[baroque]]. Sade’s most famous books are often classified not as Gothic but as [[libertine novel]]s, and include the novels ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]], or the Misfortunes of Virtue''; ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]''; ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]''; and ''[[Philosophy in the Bedroom]]''. These works challenge perceptions of sexuality, religion, law, age, and gender in ways that de Sade would argue are incompatible with the supernatural. The issues of sexual violence, [[sadomasochism]], and pedophilia stunned even those contemporaries of de Sade who were quite familiar with the dark themes of the Gothic novel during its popularity in the late 18th century. Suffering is the primary rule, as in these novels one must often decide between sympathizing with the torturer or the victim. While these works focus on the dark side of human nature, the magic and phantasmagoria that dominates the Gothic is noticeably absent and is the primary reason these works are not considered to fit the genre.<ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=John|title=Sade: The Libertine Novels |location=London|publisher=Pluto Press|year=2001|isbn=0-7453-1598-4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the unreleased passions of his libertines, de Sade wished to shake the world at its core. With ''120 Days'', for example, de Sade wished to present \"the most impure tale that has ever been written since the world exists.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= Gray|first=Francine du Plessix|title=At Home with the Marquis de Sade: A Life|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year= 1998|isbn=0-684-80007-1}}</ref>\n\n===Short fiction===\nSubtitled \"Heroic and Tragic Tales\", Sade combines [[romance novel|romance]] and [[horror and terror|horror]], employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes. There is blood, [[banditti]], corpses and, of course, insatiable lust. Compared to works like ''Justine'', here Sade is relatively tame, as overt eroticism and torture is subtracted for a more psychological approach. It is the impact of [[sadomasochism|sadism]] instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works.<ref name=\"Intro\" /> The modern volume entitled ''Gothic Tales'' collects a variety of other short works of fiction intended to be included in Sade's ''Contes et Fabliaux d'un Troubadour Provencal du XVIII Siecle''.\n\nAn example is \"[[Eugénie de Franval]]\", a tale of incest and retribution. In its portrayal of conventional moralities it is somewhat of a departure from the erotic cruelties and moral ironies that dominate his libertine works. It opens with a domesticated approach:<blockquote>\n\"To enlighten mankind and improve its morals is the only lesson which we offer in this story. In reading it, may the world discover how great is the peril which follows the footsteps of those who will stop at nothing to satisfy their desires.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nDescriptions in ''Justine'' seem to anticipate [[Ann Radcliffe|Radcliffe]]'s scenery in ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' and the vaults in ''[[The Italian (novel)|The Italian]]'', but, unlike these stories, there is no escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's horror ends in sodomy, rape, or torture. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the [[bourgeoisie]]. Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her tormentors, suggesting shades of [[sadomasochism|masochism]] in his heroine.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Donald|title=The Marquis de Sade|location=London|publisher=Allison & Busby |year=1992}}</ref>\n\n===Sadism in the Gothic novel===\nDespite the strong adverse reaction to de Sade's work and de Sade's own disassociation from the Gothic novel, the similarities between the fiction of [[sadomasochism|sadism]] and the [[Gothic novel]] were much closer than many of its readers or providers even realized. After the controversy surrounding Matthew Lewis' ''[[The Monk]]'', [[Minerva Press]] released ''[[The New Monk]]'' as a supposed indictment of a wholly immoral book. It features the sadistic Mrs. Rod, whose boarding school for young women becomes a torture chamber equipped with its own \"flogging-room\". Ironically, ''The New Monk'' wound up increasing the level of cruelty, but as a parody of the genre, it illuminates the link between sadism and the Gothic novel.<ref name=Thomas/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*The Marquis de Sade appears as a character in the [[Grant Morrison]]'s [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Invisibles]]''.\n*\"Howard Roark is the Marquis de Sade of architecture.\" In the [[Ayn Rand]] novel ''[[Fountainhead]]'' (1943).\n*The [[Guy Endore]] novel ''Satan's Saint'' (1965) is a fictionalized biography of Marquis de Sade.\n*The Marquis de Sade is mentioned in the lyrics of [[The Stone Roses]] song \"[[Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]\".\n*The 1990 song \"[[sadeness (Part I)]]\" by the group [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]] was inspired by the Marquis de Sade.\n*The 2000 film ''[[Quills (film)|Quills]]'' is a heavily fictionalized account of the Marquis de Sade's imprisonment.
