Sen has made contributions to [[welfare economics]], [[social choice theory]], [[Economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], economic theories of [[famine]]s, and indexes of the measure of well-being of citizens of developing countries. He was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1998 and [[Bharat Ratna]] in 1999 for his work in welfare economics. He was also awarded the inaugural Charleston-EFG John Maynard Keynes Prize in recognition of his work on [[welfare economics]] in February 2015 during a reception at the Royal Academy in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.charleston.org.uk/amartya-sen-announced-as-winner-of-charleston-efg-john-maynard-keynes-prize-2015/|title=Amartya Sen announced as winner of Charleston-EFG John Maynard Keynes Prize 2015 {{!}} Charleston|website=www.charleston.org.uk|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref>\n\nHe is currently the [[Harvard University Professor|Thomas W.

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] gave Amartya Sen his name (Bengali অমর্ত্য ''ômorto'', lit. \"immortal\"). Sen's family was from Wari and [[Manikganj District|Manikganj]], [[Dhaka]], both in present-day [[Bangladesh]]. His father Ashutosh Sen was a professor of chemistry at [[Dhaka University]] who moved with his family to [[West Bengal]] in 1945 and worked at various government institutions, including the West Bengal Public Service Commission (of which he was the chairman), and the [[Union Public Service Commission]]. Sen's mother Amita Sen was the daughter of [[Kshitimohan Sen|Kshiti Mohan Sen]], a well-known scholar of ancient and medieval India and close associate of Rabindranath Tagore. He served as the [[Vice Chancellor]] of [[Visva-Bharati University]] for some years.\n\nSen began his high-school education at [[St Gregory's School (Dhaka)|St Gregory's School]] in Dhaka in 1940. From fall 1941, Sen studied at [[Patha Bhavana]], Santiniketan. The school had many progressive features: at the school, any focus on examinations or competitive testing was deeply frowned upon. In addition, the school stressed cultural diversity, and embraced influences from the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html|title=Amartya Sen - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> In 1951, he went to [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], where he earned a B.A. in Economics with First Class, with a minor in Mathematics, as a graduating student of the [[University of Calcutta]]. While at Presidency, Sen was diagnosed with oral cancer, and given a 15% chance of living five years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Al Jazeera English|title=One on One - Amartya Sen|date=2010-08-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN5esbvAt-w|accessdate=2016-04-26}}</ref> With radiation treatment, he survived, and in 1953 he moved to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he earned a second B.A. in Pure Economics in 1955 with a First Class, topping the list as well. He was elected President of the Cambridge Majlis. While Sen was officially a Ph.D student at Cambridge (though he had finished his research in 1955-6), he was offered the position of Professor and Head of the Economics Department of the newly created [[Jadavpur University]] in [[Calcutta]], and he became the youngest chairman to head the Department of Economics. He served in that position, starting the new Economics Department, during 1956 to 1958.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, which gave him four years of freedom to do anything he liked; he made the radical decision to study [[philosophy]]. Sen explained: \"The broadening of my studies into philosophy was important for me not just because some of my main areas of interest in economics relate quite closely to philosophical disciplines (for example, [[social choice theory]] makes intense use of [[mathematical logic]] and also draws on [[moral philosophy]], and so does the study of inequality and deprivation), but also because I found philosophical studies very rewarding on their own\".<ref name=Philosophy>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen – Biographical: Philosophy and economics |url= http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> His interest in philosophy, however, dates back to his college days at Presidency, where he read books on philosophy and debated philosophical themes.\n\nIn Cambridge, there were major debates between supporters of [[Keynesian economics]] on the one hand, and the \"neo-classical\" economists skeptical of Keynes, on the other. However, because of a lack of enthusiasm for social choice theory in both Trinity and Cambridge, Sen had to choose a different subject for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis, which was on \"[[Choice of techniques|The Choice of Techniques]]\" in 1959, though the work had been completed much earlier (except for some valuable advice from his adjunct supervisor in India, Professor [[A.K. Dasgupta]], given to Sen while teaching and revising his work at Jadavpur) under the supervision of the \"brilliant but vigorously intolerant\" [[post-Keynesian]], [[Joan Robinson]].<ref name=Robinson>{{cite web|title= Amartya Sen – Biographical: Cambridge as a battleground |url= http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website= The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher= Nobel Prize |accessdate= 16 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Quentin Skinner]] notes that Sen was a member of the secret society [[Cambridge Apostles]] during his time at Cambridge.<ref>{{cite AV media | people = Professor Quentin Skinner and Alan Macfarlane | title = Interview of Professor Quentin Skinner &nbsp;– part 2  | medium = Video | publisher = YouTube | location = Cambridge | date = 2 June 2008 | minutes = 57:55 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVdAhzqFLps }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nSen's work on 'Choice of Technique' complemented that of Maurice Dobb. In a Developing country, the Dobb-Sen strategy relied on maximising investible surpluses, maintaining constant real wages and using the entire increase in labour productivity, due to technological change, to raise the rate of accumulation. In other words, workers were expected to demand no improvement in their standard of living despite having become more productive. \nSen's papers in the late 1960s and early 1970s helped develop the theory of [[social choice]], which first came to prominence in the work by the American economist [[Kenneth Arrow]].  Arrow, while working at the [[RAND Corporation]], had most famously shown that \nwhen voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), any [[Ranked voting system|ranked order]] [[voting system]] will in at least some situations inevitably conflict with what many assume to be basic democratic norms. Sen's contribution to the literature was to show under what conditions [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Benicourt | first = Emmanuelle | title = Is Amartya Sen a post-autistic economist? | journal = Post-Autistic Economics Review | issue = 15 | pages = article 4 | publisher = Post-Autistic Economics &#124; PAECON | date = 1 September 2002 | url = http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue15/Benicourt15.htm | accessdate= 16 June 2014}}</ref> applied, as well as to extend and enrich the theory of social choice, informed by his interests in [[history of economic thought]] and philosophy.\n[[File:Amartya Sen NIH.jpg|thumb|Official Portrait at the Nobel Prize]]\nIn 1981, Sen published ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' (1981), a book in which he argued that famine occurs not only from a lack of food, but from inequalities built into mechanisms for distributing food. Sen also argued that the Bengal famine was caused by an urban economic boom that raised food prices, thereby causing millions of rural workers to starve to death when their wages did not keep up.<ref name=Time>{{cite news | last= Sachs | first= Jeffrey | author-link = Jeffrey Sachs | title= The real causes of famine: a Nobel laureate blames authoritarian rulers | url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html | accessdate= 16 June 2014 | publisher= Time Magazine | date= 26 October 1998 }}</ref>\n\nSen's interest in famine stemmed from personal experience. As a nine-year-old boy, he witnessed the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], in which three million people perished. This staggering loss of life was unnecessary, Sen later concluded. He presents data that there was an adequate food supply in Bengal at the time, but particular groups of people including rural landless labourers and urban service providers like haircutters did not have the means to buy food as its price rose rapidly due to factors that include British military acquisition, [[panic buying]], hoarding, and [[price gouging]], all connected to the war in the region. In ''Poverty and Famines'', Sen revealed that in many cases of famine, food supplies were not significantly reduced. In Bengal, for example, food production, while down on the previous year, was higher than in previous non-famine years. Thus, Sen points to a number of social and economic factors, such as declining wages, unemployment, rising food prices, and poor food-distribution, which led to starvation. His [[capabilities approach]] focuses on [[positive freedom]], a person's actual ability to be or do something, rather than on [[negative freedom]] approaches, which are common in economics and simply focuses on non-interference. In the Bengal famine, rural laborers' negative freedom to buy food was not affected. However, they still starved because they were not positively free to do anything, they did not have the functioning of nourishment, nor the capability to escape morbidity.\n\nIn addition to his important work on the causes of famines, Sen's work in the field of development economics has had considerable influence in the formulation of the \"[[Human Development Report]]\",<ref name=UNDP>{{cite book | contribution = Overview &#124; Celebrating 20 years of human development | editor-last = United Nations Development Programme | editor-first = UNDP | editor-link = United Nations Development Programme | title = Human Development Report 2010 &#124; 20th anniversary edition &#124; the real wealth of nations: pathways to human development | page = 2 | publisher = United Nations Development Programme | location = New York, NY | year = 2010 | isbn = 9780230284456 | quote = ...the first HDR called for a different approach to economics and development – one that put people at the centre.

This is because top-down development will always trump [[human rights]] as long as the definition of terms remains in doubt (is a \"right\" something that must be provided or something that simply cannot be taken away?). For instance, in the United States citizens have a hypothetical \"right\" to vote. To Sen, this concept is fairly empty. In order for citizens to have a capacity to vote, they first must have \"functionings\". These \"functionings\" can range from the very broad, such as the availability of education, to the very specific, such as transportation to the [[Polling station|polls]]. Only when such barriers are removed can the citizen truly be said to act out of personal choice. It is up to the individual society to make the list of minimum capabilities guaranteed by that society. For an example of the \"capabilities approach\" in practice, see [[Martha Nussbaum]]'s ''Women and Human Development''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nussbaum | first = Martha | author-link = Martha Nussbaum | title = Women and human development: the capabilities approach | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521003858 }}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a controversial article in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' entitled \"More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing\" (see [[Missing women of Asia]]), analyzing the mortality impact of unequal rights between the genders in the developing world, particularly Asia. Other studies, including one by [[Emily Oster]], had argued that this is an overestimation, though Oster has since then recanted her conclusions.<ref>{{citation |last1 = Oster | first1 = Emily |last2 = Chen | first2 = Gang | author-link1 = Emily Oster |title= Hepatitis B does not explain male-biased sex ratios in China |date= May 2008 | volume= NBER Working Paper No. 13971 |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |location= Cambridge, Massachusetts |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.nber.org/papers/w13971.pdf Pdf version.]</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Sen further advanced and redefined the capability approach in his book ''[[Development as Freedom]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Development as Freedom|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Anchor|year=1998|isbn=0385720270|location=|pages=}}</ref> Sen argues that development should be viewed as an effort to advance the real freedoms that individuals enjoy, rather than simply focusing on metrics such as GDP or income-per-capita. Sen was inspired by violent acts he had witnessed as a child leading up to the Partition of India in 1947. On one morning, a Muslim laborer named Kader Mia stumbled through the rear gate of Sen's family home, bleeding from a knife wound in his back. Because of his extreme poverty, he had come to Sen's primarily Hindu neighborhood searching for work; his choices were the starvation of his family or the risk of death in coming to the neighborhood. The price of Kader Mia's economic unfreedom was his death. This experience led Sen to begin thinking about economic unfreedom from a young age.\n\nIn ''Development as Freedom'', Sen outlines five specific types of freedoms: political freedoms, economic facilities, social opportunities, transparency guarantees, and protective security. Political freedoms, the first of these, refers to the ability of the people to have a voice in government and to be able to scrutinize the authorities. Economic facilities concern both the resources within the market and the market mechanism itself. Any focus on income and wealth in the country would serve to increase the economic facilities for the people. Social opportunities deal with the establishments that provide benefits like healthcare or education for the populace, allowing individuals to live better lives. Transparency guarantees allow individuals to interact with some degree of trust and knowledge of the interaction. Protective security is the system of social safety nets that prevent a group affected by poverty being subjected to terrible misery. Before Sen's work, these had been viewed as only the ends of development; luxuries afforded to countries that focus on increasing income. However, Sen argues that the increase in real freedoms should be both the ends and the means of development.\n\nWelfare economics seeks to evaluate economic policies in terms of their effects on the well-being of the community. Sen, who devoted his career to such issues, was called the \"conscience of his profession\". His influential monograph ''Collective Choice and Social Welfare'' (1970), which addressed problems related to individual rights (including formulation of the [[liberal paradox]]), justice and equity, majority rule, and the availability of information about individual conditions, inspired researchers to turn their attention to issues of basic welfare. Sen devised methods of measuring poverty that yielded useful information for improving economic conditions for the poor. For instance, his theoretical work on inequality provided an explanation for why there are fewer women than men in India<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Sen | first = Amartya | title = Many Faces of Gender Inequality | journal = Frontline | volume = 18 | issue = 22 | publisher = The Hindu | date = 27 October – 9 November 2001 | url = http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1822/18220040.htm | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> and China despite the fact that in the West and in poor but medically unbiased countries, women have lower [[mortality rate]]s at all ages, live longer, and make a slight majority of the population. Sen claimed that this skewed ratio results from the better health treatment and childhood opportunities afforded boys in those countries, as well as [[sex-selective abortion]]s.\n\nGovernments and international organizations handling food crises were influenced by Sen's work. His views encouraged policy makers to pay attention not only to alleviating immediate suffering but also to finding ways to replace the lost income of the poor—for example through public works—and to maintain stable prices for food. A vigorous defender of political freedom, Sen believed that famines do not occur in functioning democracies because their leaders must be more responsive to the demands of the citizens. In order for economic growth to be achieved, he argued, social reforms—such as improvements in education and public health—must precede economic reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Amartya-Sen|title=Amartya Sen {{!}} Indian economist|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2016-04-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sen published a book called ''The Idea of Justice''.<ref name=\"Sen 2010\" /> Based on his previous work in welfare economics and social choice theory, but also on his philosophical thoughts, he presented his own theory of justice that he meant to be an alternative to the influential modern theories of justice of [[John Rawls]] or [[John Harsanyi]]. In opposition to Rawls but also earlier justice theoreticians [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] or [[David Hume]], and inspired by the philosophical works of [[Adam Smith]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], Sen developed a theory that is both comparative and realizations-oriented (instead of being transcendental and institutional). However, he still regards institutions and processes as being important. As an alternative to Rawls's [[veil of ignorance]], Sen chose the [[thought experiment]] of an impartial spectator as the basis of his theory of justice. He also stressed the importance of public discussion (understanding democracy in the sense of [[John Stuart Mill]]) and a focus on people's capabilities (an [[capability approach|approach]] that he had co-developed), including the notion of universal human rights, in evaluating various states with regard to justice.\n\n==Professional career==\nSen began his career both as a teacher and a research scholar in the Department of Economics, [[Jadavpur University]]. Between 1960 and 1961, Sen was a visiting Professor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the United States, where he got to know [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Robert Solow]], [[Franco Modigliani]], and [[Norbert Wiener]].<ref name=Calcutta>{{cite web|title=Amartya Sen &#124; Biographical: opening paragraph |url= http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1998/sen-bio.html |website=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1998 |publisher=Nobel Prize |accessdate=12 June 2012 }}</ref> He was also a visiting Professor at UC-Berkeley and [[Cornell University|Cornell]].
