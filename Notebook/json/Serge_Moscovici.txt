His theory of ''social representations'' is now widespread in understanding this process of cultural  ''[[Telephone (game)|Chinese whispers]]''. Influenced by [[Gabriel Tarde]], he later criticized American research into majority influence ([[conformity (psychology)|conformity]]) and instead investigated the effects of minority influence, where the opinions of a small group influence those of a larger one.<ref name=\"balzan\"/> He also researched the dynamics of group decisions and consensus-forming.\n\n===Minority influence===\n{{main|Conversion theory of minority influence}}\nMoscovici claimed that majority influence in many ways was misleading – if the majority was indeed all-powerful, we would all end up thinking the same.<ref name=\"balzan\"/> Drawing attention to the works of [[Gabriel Tarde]], he pointed to the fact that most major social movements have been started by individuals and small groups (e.g. [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], the [[Suffragette]] movement, [[Nazism]], etc.) and that without an outspoken minority, we would have no innovation or social change.\n\nThe study he is most famous for, ''Influences of a consistent minority on the responses of a majority in a colour perception task'', is now seen as one of the defining investigations into the effects of minority influence:\n*Aims: To investigate the process of innovation by looking at how a consistent minority affect the opinions of a larger group, possibly creating doubt and leading them to question and alter their views\n*Procedures: Participants were first given an eye test to check that they were not colour blind. They were then placed in a group of four participants and two confederates. they were all shown 36 slides that were different shades of blue and asked to state the colour out loud. There were two groups in the experiment. In the first group the confederates were consistent and answered green for every slide. In the second group the confederates were inconsistent and answered green 24 times and blue 12 times.\n*Findings: For 8.42% of the trials, participants agreed with the minority and said that the slides were green. Overall, 32% of the participants agreed at least once.\n*Conclusions: The study suggested that minorities can indeed exert an effect over the opinion of a majority. Not to the same degree as majority influence, but the fact that almost a third of people agreed at least once is significant. However, this also leaves two thirds who never agreed. In a follow up experiment, Moscovici demonstrated that consistency was the key factor in [[minority influence]]; by instructing the stooges to be inconsistent, the effect fell off sharply.\n\n==Works==\n* ''La psychanalyse, son image, son public'', PUF, 1961/ new edition 1976 / ''Psychoanalysis.
