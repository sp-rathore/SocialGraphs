Along with the earlier works of [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Alberico Gentili]], Grotius laid the foundations for [[international law]], based on [[natural law]]. A teenage intellectual prodigy, he was imprisoned for his involvement in the intra-Calvinist disputes of the Dutch Republic, but escaped hidden (appropriately) in a chest of books. He wrote most of his major works in exile in [[France]].\n\nIt is thought that Hugo Grotius was not the first to formulate the international society doctrine, but he was one of the first to define expressly the idea of one society of states, governed not by [[force]] or [[warfare]] but by actual laws and mutual agreement to enforce those laws. As [[Hedley Bull]] declared in 1990: \"The idea of international society which Grotius propounded was given concrete expression in the [[Peace of Westphalia]], and Grotius may be considered the intellectual father of this first general peace settlement of modern times.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Hedley Bull|editor2=[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]]|editor3=Benedict Kingsbury)|title=Hugo Grotius and International Relations|place=Oxford|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=0-19-825569-1 }}</ref><!--page(s)-->\n\nAdditionally, his contributions to [[Arminian]] [[theology]] provided the seeds for later Arminian-based movements, such as [[Methodism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] and he is acknowledged as a significant figure in the Arminianism-Calvinism debate.

His father was a man of learning, once having studied with the eminent [[Justus Lipsius]] at [[Leiden]], as well as of political distinction, and he groomed his son from an early age in a traditional [[Humanism|humanist]] and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] education. A [[child prodigy|prodigious]] learner, Hugo entered the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] when he was just eleven years old.

His first occasion to write systematically on issues of international justice came in 1604, when he became involved in the legal proceedings following the seizure by Dutch merchants of a Portuguese [[carrack]] and its cargo in the [[Singapore Strait]]. {{citation needed|reason=any source?|date=June 2015}}\n\n==''De Indis'' and ''Mare Liberum''==\n[[File:Grotius de iure praedae.jpg|thumb|upright|Page written in Grotius' hand from the manuscript of ''De Indis'' (circa 1604/05)]]\n\nThe Dutch were at [[Eighty Years' War|war with Spain]] and [[Portugal]] when the loaded merchant ship ''[[Santa Catarina (ship)|Santa Catarina]]'', a Portuguese [[carrack]], was captured by captain [[Jacob van Heemskerk]] off present-day Singapore in 1603.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Heemskerk was employed with the United Amsterdam Company (part of the [[Dutch East India Company]]), and though he did not have authorization from the company or the government to initiate the use of force, many shareholders were eager to accept the riches that he brought back to them.<ref name=\"See Ittersum 2006, chapter 1\">See Ittersum (2006), chapter 1.</ref>\n\nNot only was the legality of keeping the [[prize (law)|prize]] questionable under Dutch statute, but a faction of shareholders (mostly [[Mennonite]]) in the Company also objected to the forceful seizure on moral grounds, and of course, the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo. The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It was in this wider context that representatives of the Company called upon Grotius to draft a [[polemic]]al defence of the seizure.<ref name=\"See Ittersum 2006, chapter 1\" />\n\nThe result of Grotius' efforts in 1604/05 was a long, theory-laden treatise that he provisionally entitled ''De Indis'' (''On the Indies''). Grotius sought to ground his defense of the seizure in terms of the natural principles of justice. In this, he had cast a net much wider than the case at hand; his interest was in the source and ground of war's lawfulness in general. The treatise was never published in full during Grotius' lifetime, perhaps because the court ruling in favor of the Company preempted the need to garner public support.{{citation needed|reason=any source?|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[File:Mierevelt grotius 1608.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Grotius at age 25 ([[Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt]], 1608)]]\n\nIn ''The Free Sea'' (''[[Mare Liberum]]'', published 1609) Grotius formulated the new principle that the sea was international territory and all [[nation]]s were free to use it for seafaring [[trade]].

On the other side [[Johannes Wtenbogaert]] (a Remonstrant leader) and [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], Grand Pensionary of Holland had strongly promoted the appointment of Vortius and began to defend their actions.

Such a measure putatively undermined the authority of the [[stadtholder]] of the republic, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Maurice seized the opportunity to solidify the preeminence of the [[Gomarist]]s, whom he had supported, and to eliminate the nuisance he perceived in Oldenbarnevelt (the latter had previously brokered the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] with Spain in 1609 against Maurice's wishes).

The Latin work was first published in 1627 as ''De veritate religionis Christianae''.\n\n===Governmental theory of atonement===\nGrotius also developed a particular view of the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of Christ known as the \"[[Atonement (Governmental view)|Governmental]]\" or \"Moral government\" theory. He theorized that Jesus' sacrificial death occurred in order for the Father to forgive while still maintaining his just rule over the universe.

His most lasting work, begun in prison and published during his exile in Paris, was a monumental effort to restrain such conflicts on the basis of a broad moral consensus. Grotius wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Fully convinced...that there is a common law among nations, which is valid alike for war and in war, I have had many and weighty reasons for undertaking to write upon the subject. Throughout the Christian world I observed a lack of restraint in relation to war, such as even barbarous races should be ashamed of; I observed that men rush to arms for slight causes, or no cause at all, and that when arms have once been taken up there is no longer any respect for law, divine or human; it is as if, in accordance with a general decree, frenzy had openly been let loose for the committing of all crimes.<ref>''The Law of War and Peace'', trans.

The treatise advances a system of principles of natural law, which are held to be binding on all people and nations regardless of local custom. The work is divided into three books:\n* Book I advances his conception of [[Philosophy of war|war]] and of natural [[justice]], arguing that there are some circumstances in which war is justifiable.\n* Book II identifies three 'just causes' for war: [[self-defense]], [[restitution|reparation of injury]], and [[punishment]]; Grotius considers a wide variety of circumstances under which these rights of war attach and when they do not.\n* Book III takes up the question of what rules govern the conduct of war once it has begun; influentially, Grotius argued that all parties to war are bound by such rules, whether their cause is just or not.\n\n==Natural law==\n[[File:Hugo-de-Groot-Johann-Niclas-Serlin-Drey-Bücher-von-Kriegs-und-Friedens-Rechten 0157.tif|left|thumb|Engraved portrait of Grotius]]\n\nGrotius' concept of natural law had a strong impact on the philosophical and theological debates and political developments of the 17th and 18th centuries.

In 1630 they were allowed complete freedom to build and run churches and schools and to live anywhere in Holland. The Remonstrants guided by Uytenbogaert set up a presbyterial organization. They established a theological seminary at Amsterdam where Grotius came to teach alongside Episcopius, Limborch, Curcellaeus, and Le Clerc.\n\nIn 1634 Grotius met the opportunity to serve as [[Sweden]]'s ambassador to [[France]]. The recently deceased Swedish king, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] had been an admirer of Grotius (he was said to have carried a copy of ''De jure belli ac pacis'' always in his saddle when leading his troops),<ref>Grotius, Hugo ''The Rights of War and Peace'' Book I, Introduction by Tuck, Richard: Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2005.</ref> and his successor's regent, [[Axel Oxenstierna]], was keen to have Grotius in his employ.
