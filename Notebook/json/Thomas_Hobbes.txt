Thomas Hobbes, the younger, had a brother Edmund, about two years older, and a sister.  Thomas Sr. was involved in a fight with the local clergy outside his church, forcing him to leave London and abandon the family. The family was left in the care of Thomas Sr.'s older brother, Francis, a wealthy merchant with no family.  Hobbes Jr. was educated at Westport church from age four, passed to the [[Malmesbury school]], and then to a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]]. Hobbes was a good pupil, and around 1603 he went up to [[Magdalen Hall]], the predecessor college to [[Hertford College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://philosophy.hertford.ox.ac.uk/ |title = Philosophy at Hertford College |publisher= Oxford |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.hertford.ox.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=88&Itemid=159 |title=Thomas Hobbes | publisher = Hertford College | accessdate= 24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://galileo.rice.edu/Catalog/NewFiles/hobbes.html | title = The Galileo Project |publisher = Rice | accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LGSytrSTMQwC&pg=PT89 | title =Thomas Hobbes: Politics and law | publisher = Google Books |accessdate=24 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-41508083-5|year = 1993}}</ref>  The principal John Wilkinson was a [[Puritan]], and he had some influence on Hobbes.\n\nAt university, Hobbes appears to have followed his own curriculum; he was \"little attracted by the scholastic learning\". He did not complete his [[B.A. degree]] until 1608, but he was recommended by Sir James Hussey, his master at Magdalen, as tutor to [[William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire|William]], the son of [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire|William Cavendish]], Baron of Hardwick (and later [[Duke of Devonshire|Earl of Devonshire]]), and began a lifelong connection with that family.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hobbes.html |title = Hobbes biography |publisher= St And | accessdate =24 July 2009}}</ref>\n\nHobbes became a companion to the younger William and they both took part in a [[Grand Tour|grand tour]] of Europe in 1610. Hobbes was exposed to European scientific and critical methods during the tour, in contrast to the [[scholastic philosophy]] which he had learned in Oxford. His scholarly efforts at the time were aimed at a careful study of classic Greek and Latin authors, the outcome of which was, in 1628, his great translation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', the first translation of that work into English from a Greek manuscript. It has been argued that three of the discourses in the 1620 publication known as ''Horea Subsecivae: Observations and Discourses'', also represent the work of Hobbes from this period.<ref name = threediscor>{{Cite book|last=Hobbes|first = Thomas |title=Three Discourses: A Critical Modern Edition of Newly Identified Work of the Young Hobbes|editor1-last=Reynolds| editor1-first =Noel|editor2-last=Saxonhouse| editor2-first =Arlene| publisher= University of Chicago Press|year=1995|ref= harv}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he associated with literary figures like [[Ben Jonson]] and briefly worked as [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]]'s [[amanuensis]],<ref>[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/b.618.Grewal.680_zd87t39f.pdf David Singh Grewal, ''The Domestic Analogy Revisited: Hobbes on International Order''], 125 YALE L.J. 618 (2016).</ref> he did not extend his efforts into philosophy until after 1629. His employer Cavendish, then the Earl of Devonshire, died of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in June 1628. The widowed countess dismissed Hobbes but he soon found work, again as a tutor, this time to [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 2nd Baronet|Gervase Clifton]], the son of [[Sir Gervase Clifton, 1st Baronet]]. This task, chiefly spent in Paris, ended in 1631 when he again found work with the Cavendish family, tutoring [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire|William]], the eldest son of his previous pupil. Over the next seven years, as well as tutoring, he expanded his own knowledge of philosophy, awakening in him curiosity over key philosophic debates. He visited [[Florence]] in 1636 and was later a regular debater in philosophic groups in Paris, held together by [[Marin Mersenne]]. From 1637 he considered himself a philosopher and scholar.{{citation needed |date= February 2014}}\n\n==In Paris==\n[[File:Thomas Hobbes.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Thomas Hobbes]]Hobbes's first area of study was an interest in the physical doctrine of motion and physical momentum. Despite his interest in this phenomenon, he disdained experimental work as in [[physics]]. He went on to conceive the system of thought to the elaboration of which he would devote his life. His scheme was first to work out, in a separate treatise, a systematic doctrine of body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, at least as motion or mechanical action was then understood. He then singled out Man from the realm of Nature and plants. Then, in another treatise, he showed what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation, knowledge, affections and passions whereby Man came into relation with Man. Finally he considered, in his crowning treatise, how Men were moved to enter into society, and argued how this must be regulated if Men were not to fall back into \"brutishness and misery\". Thus he proposed to unite the separate phenomena of Body, Man, and the State.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nHobbes came home, in 1637, to a country riven with discontent which disrupted him from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. However, by the end of the [[Short Parliament]] in 1640, he had written a short treatise called ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic''. It was not published and only circulated as a manuscript among his acquaintances. A pirated version, however, was published about ten years later. Although it seems that much of ''The Elements of Law'' was composed before the sitting of the Short Parliament, there are polemical pieces of the work that clearly mark the influences of the rising political crisis. Nevertheless, many (though not all) elements of Hobbes's political thought were unchanged between ''The Elements of Law'' and ''Leviathan,'' which demonstrates that the events of the [[English Civil War]] had little effect on his [[contractarian]] methodology. However, the arguments in ''Leviathan'' were modified from ''The Elements of Law'' when it came to the necessity of consent in creating political obligation. Namely, Hobbes wrote in ''The Elements of Law'' that Patrimonial kingdoms were not necessarily formed by the consent of the governed, while in ''Leviathan'' he argued that they were. This was perhaps a reflection either of Hobbes's thoughts about the [[engagement controversy]] or of his reaction to treatises published by [[Patriarchalism|Patriarchalists]], such as [[Sir Robert Filmer]], between 1640 and 1651.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nWhen in November 1640 the [[Long Parliament]] succeeded the Short, Hobbes felt he was a in disfavor due to the circulation of his treatise, and fled to Paris. He did not return for 11 years. In Paris, he rejoined the coterie about Mersenne, and wrote a critique of the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' of [[Descartes]], which was printed as third among the sets of \"Objections\" appended, with \"Replies\" from Descartes in 1641. A different set of remarks on other works by Descartes succeeded only in ending all correspondence between the two.\n\nHobbes also extended his own works somewhat, working on the third section, ''[[De Cive]]'', which was finished in November 1641. Although it was initially only circulated privately, it was well received, and included lines of argumentation that were repeated a decade later in the ''Leviathan''. He then returned to hard work on the first two sections of his work and published little except a short treatise on optics (''Tractatus opticus'') included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne as ''Cogitata physico-mathematica'' in 1644. He built a good reputation in philosophic circles and in 1645 was chosen with Descartes, [[Gilles de Roberval]] and others, to referee the controversy between [[John Pell]] and [[Longomontanus]] over the problem of [[squaring the circle]].\n\n==Civil war in England==\nThe [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1642, and when the [[Cavalier|royalist]] cause began to decline in mid-1644, the king's supporters fled to Europe. Many came to Paris and were known to Hobbes. This revitalised Hobbes's political interests and the ''De Cive'' was republished and more widely distributed. The printing began in 1646 by [[Samuel de Sorbiere]] through the [[House of Elzevir|Elsevier press]] at [[Amsterdam]] with a new preface and some new notes in reply to objections.\n\nIn 1647, Hobbes took up a position as mathematical instructor to the young [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nndb.com/people/691/000031598// |title = People |publisher=NNDB |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref> who had come over from [[Jersey]] around July.  This engagement lasted until 1648 when Charles went to Holland.\n\nThe company of the exiled royalists led Hobbes to produce ''Leviathan'', which set forth his theory of civil government in relation to the political crisis resulting from the war. Hobbes compared the State to a monster ([[leviathan]]) composed of men, created under pressure of human needs and dissolved by civil strife due to human passions. The work closed with a general \"Review and Conclusion\", in response to the war, which answered the question: Does a subject have the right to change allegiance when a former sovereign's power to protect is irrevocably lost?\n\n[[File:Hobbes de cive.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece from ''De Cive'' (1642)]]\n\nDuring the years of composing ''Leviathan'', Hobbes remained in or near Paris. In 1647, a serious illness that nearly killed him disabled him for six months. On recovering, he resumed his literary task and completed it by 1650. Meanwhile, a translation of ''De Cive'' was being produced; scholars disagree about whether it was Hobbes who translated it.\n\nIn 1650, a pirated edition of ''The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic'' was published. It was divided into two small volumes (''Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policie'' and ''De corpore politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politick''). In 1651, the translation of ''[[De Cive]]'' was published under the title ''Philosophicall Rudiments concerning Government and Society''. Meanwhile, the printing of the greater work proceeded, and finally appeared in mid-1651, titled ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common Wealth, Ecclesiasticall and Civil.'' It had a famous title-page engraving depicting a crowned giant above the waste towering above hills overlooking a landscape, holding a sword and a [[crozier]] and made up of tiny human figures.\n\nThe work had immediate impact. Soon, Hobbes was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time. The first effect of its publication was to sever his link with the exiled royalists, who might well have killed him. The secularist spirit of his book greatly angered both Anglicans and French Catholics. Hobbes appealed to the revolutionary English government for protection and fled back to London in winter 1651. After his submission to the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], he was allowed to subside into private life in [[Fetter Lane]].\n\n==''Leviathan''==\n{{Main|Leviathan (book)}}\n\n[[File:Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of ''Leviathan'']]\nIn ''Leviathan'', Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of [[State (polity)|states]] and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality. This gave rise to [[social contract theory]]. ''Leviathan'' was written during the [[English Civil War]]; much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.\n\nBeginning from a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] understanding of human beings and the passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the [[state of nature]]. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a \"war of all against all\" (''[[bellum omnium contra omnes]]''). The description contains what has been called one of the best known passages in English philosophy, which describes the natural state humankind would be in, were it not for political community:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Introduction|title=Human Nature and De Corpore Politico|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xxx|ref=harv}}</ref>\n{{quotation|In such condition, there is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain: and consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building; no instruments of moving, and removing, such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth; no account of time; no arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Leviathan|chapter=Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.|url=http://www.bartleby.com/34/5/13.html|ref=harv}}</ref>}}\n\nIn such a state, people fear death, and lack both the things necessary to [[wikt:commodious|commodious]] living, and the hope of being able to toil to obtain them. So in order to avoid it, people accede to a [[social contract theory|social contract]] and establish a [[civil society]]. According to Hobbes, society is a population beneath a [[sovereign]] [[authority]], to whom all individuals in that society cede some rights for the sake of protection. Any power exercised by this authority cannot be resisted because the protector's sovereign power derives from individuals' surrendering their own sovereign power for protection. The individuals are thereby the authors of all decisions made by the sovereign.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gaskin|chapter=Of the Rights of Sovereigns by Institution|title= Leviathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=117|ref=harv}}</ref> \"he that complaineth of injury from his sovereign complaineth that whereof he himself is the author, and therefore ought not to accuse any man but himself, no nor himself of injury because to do injury to one's self is impossible\". There is no doctrine of [[separation of powers]] in Hobbes's discussion.<ref>\"1000 Makers of the Millennium\", page 42. Dorling Kindersley, 1999</ref> According to Hobbes, the sovereign must control civil, military, judicial, and [[Cuius regio, eius religio|ecclesiastical]] powers.\n\n==Opposition==\n\n===John Bramhall===\nHobbes now turned to complete the fundamental treatise of his philosophical system. He worked so steadily that ''[[De Corpore]]'' was first printed in 1654. Also in 1654, a small treatise, ''Of Liberty and Necessity'', was published by Bishop [[John Bramhall]], addressed at Hobbes. Bramhall, a strong [[Arminianism|Arminian]], had met and debated with Hobbes and afterwards wrote down his views and sent them privately to be answered in this form by Hobbes. Hobbes duly replied, but not for publication. But a French acquaintance took a copy of the reply and published it with \"an extravagantly laudatory epistle.\" Bramhall countered in 1655, when he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of ''A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity''). In 1656, Hobbes was ready with ''The Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance'', in which he replied \"with astonishing force\" to the bishop. As perhaps the first clear exposition of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes's own two pieces were important in the history of the [[Free will|free-will]] controversy. The bishop returned to the charge in 1658 with ''Castigations of Mr Hobbes's Animadversions'', and also included a bulky appendix entitled ''The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale''.\n\n===John Wallis===\n{{details|Hobbes–Wallis controversy}}\nHobbes opposed the existing academic arrangements, and assailed the system of the original universities in ''Leviathan''. He went on to publish \"[[De Corpore]]\", which contained not only tendentious views on mathematics, but also an unacceptable proof of the [[squaring of the circle]]. This all led mathematicians to target him for [[polemics]] and sparked [[John Wallis]] to become one of his most persistent opponents. From 1655, the publishing date of \"De Corpore\", Hobbes and Wallis went round after round trying to disprove each other's positions. After years of debate, the spat over proving the squaring of the circle gained such notoriety that this feud has become one of the most infamous in mathematical history.\n\n===Atheism===\nHobbes has been accused of [[atheism]], or (in the case of Bramhall) of teachings which could lead to atheism. This was an important accusation, and Hobbes himself wrote, in his answer to Bramhall's \"The Catching of Leviathan\" that \"atheism, impiety, and the like are words of the greatest defamation possible\".<ref>p. 282 of Molesworth's edition.</ref> Hobbes always defended himself from such accusations.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Martinich|1995|p=35}}</ref> In more recent times also, much has been made of his religious views by scholars such as Richard Tuck and [[J. G. A. Pocock]], but there is still widespread disagreement about the exact significance of Hobbes's unusual views on religion.\n\nAs {{Harvtxt|Martinich|1995|p=31}} has pointed out, in Hobbes's time, the term \"atheist\" was often applied to people who believed in God, but not [[divine providence]], or to people who believed in God, but also maintained other beliefs which were inconsistent with such belief. He says that this \"sort of discrepancy has led to many errors in determining who was an atheist in the [[early modern period]]\". In this extended early modern sense of atheism, Hobbes did take positions which strongly disagreed with church teachings of his time. For example, Hobbes argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things, including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal, matter in motion. He argued that \"though Scripture acknowledge spirits, yet doth it nowhere say, that they are incorporeal, meaning thereby without dimensions and quantity\".<ref>''Human Nature'' I.XI.5.</ref> (In this view, Hobbes claimed to be following [[Tertullian]], whose views were not condemned in the [[First Council of Nicaea]].) He also, like [[John Locke|Locke]], stated that true [[revelation]] can never disagree with human reason and experience,<ref>''Leviathan'' III.xxxii.2. \"...we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor (that which is undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason\".</ref> although he also argued that people should accept revelation and its interpretations also for the reason that they should accept the commands of their sovereign, in order to avoid war.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Tomb of Thomas Hobbes - geograph.org.uk - 1592556.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Thomas Hobbes in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]]]]\nIn 1658, Hobbes published the final section of his philosophical system, completing the scheme he had planned more than 20 years before. ''De Homine'' consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision. The remainder of the treatise dealt cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the ''Human Nature'' and the ''Leviathan''. In addition to publishing some controversial writings on mathematics and physics, Hobbes also continued to produce philosophical works. From the time of the [[The Restoration|Restoration]], he acquired a new prominence; \"Hobbism\" became a byword for all that respectable society ought to denounce. The young king, Hobbes' former pupil, now Charles II, remembered Hobbes and called him to the court to grant him a pension of £100.\n\nThe king was important in protecting Hobbes when, in 1666, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness. That same year, on 17 October 1666, it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred \"should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy and profaneness... in particular... the book of Mr. Hobbes called the ''Leviathan''\".<ref>{{cite web|title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8|work=British History Online|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26780|accessdate=14 January 2005}}</ref> Hobbes was terrified at the prospect of being labelled a heretic, and proceeded to burn some of his compromising papers. At the same time, he examined the actual state of the law of [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added as an ''Appendix'' to his ''Latin translation of Leviathan'', published in Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, Hobbes aimed to show that, since the [[Court of High Commission|High Court of Commission]] had been put down, there remained no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that nothing could be heresy except opposing the [[Nicene Creed]], which, he maintained, ''Leviathan'' did not do.\n\nThe only consequence that came of the bill was that Hobbes could never thereafter publish anything in England on subjects relating to human conduct. The 1668 edition of his works was printed in Amsterdam because he could not obtain the censor's licence for its publication in England. Other writings were not made public until after his death, including ''Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the year 1640 to the year 1662''. For some time, Hobbes was not even allowed to respond, whatever his enemies tried. Despite this, his reputation abroad was formidable, and noble or learned foreigners who came to England never forgot to pay their respects to the old philosopher.\n\nHis final works were a curious mixture: an autobiography in Latin verse in 1672, and a translation of four books of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' into \"rugged\" English rhymes that in 1673 led to a complete translation of both ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''Odyssey'' in 1675.\n\nIn October 1679, Hobbes suffered a bladder disorder, and then a paralytic stroke from which he died on 4 December 1679. His last words are said to have been \"A great leap in the dark\" in his final moments.<ref>Norman Davies, ''Europe: A history'' p. 687</ref> He was interred in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Ault Hucknall]], in Derbyshire.\n\n==Works==\n* 1602.
