Before that, he taught at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in [[Geneva, NY]], while finishing his Ph.D. at [[Syracuse University]] in 1991. He is a descendant of [[William Wallace]].\n\nIn ethics,  Norcross defends a version of act [[utilitarianism]] known as ''scalar utilitarianism'', which is the theory that there are no right or wrong actions, only better or worse actions ranked along a continuum from the action (or actions) that contributes most to overall [[utility]] to the action (or actions) that contributes the least.\n\n==Selected works==\n*(2006) 'Scalar Act-Utilitarianism'.
