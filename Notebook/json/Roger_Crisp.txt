His work falls principally within the field of [[ethics]], in particular [[metaethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]].  In addition, he is Chairman of the Management Committee of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics.<ref>[http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/nstaff.htm Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics]</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\nOriginally from [[Brentwood, Essex]], Crisp began his higher education at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St. Anne’s College, Oxford]] in 1979, where he read [[Literae Humaniores]].  He was amongst the first male cohort to study at this previously all-female college.  He was taught by, amongst others, [[Margaret Howatson]], [[Gabriele Taylor]], [[Iris Murdoch]], and [[Peter Derow]].  In 1983 he commenced the [[B.Phil]], and from 1985 until 1988 he worked on his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]], writing his thesis on [[utilitarianism]].\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1986 Crisp began his first academic post, as a junior lecturer in [[philosophy]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; he returned to St. Anne’s for two years beginning 1987 as a lecturer in [[philosophy]], before taking up a lecturing post at [[Hertford College, Oxford]] in 1988-1989. 1989-1991 saw Crisp move to [[University College, Oxford]], as a [[British Academy]] [[Research Fellow]] and Honorary [[Junior Research Fellow]].  Finally, Crisp returned once more to St. Anne’s in 1991, to take up a permanent post as Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy, succeeding [[Gabriele Taylor]].  For the first time in his career, Crisp temporarily left Oxford and spent the academic year 2010-2011 at [[Boston University]] to explore his interest in the moral philosophy of [[Henry Sidgwick]].<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/phpbin/news-cms/news/?dept=1283&id=56485 Boston University, news.]</ref>\n\nArguably Crisp’s most significant work to date has been ''Reasons and the Good'' ([[Clarendon Press]], 2006), in which he advances some novel approaches to the oldest questions in ethics.  The central claim of this work is that a fundamental issue in normative ethics is what ultimate reasons might underlie our actions; Crisp argues that the best exposition of such reasons will not employ moral concepts.  So far, ''Reasons and the Good'' <ref>{{cite book | last = Crisp | first = Roger | title = Reasons and the good | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780199290338 }}</ref> has generally been very well received.\n\nCrisp is currently editing an Oxford Handbook on the History of Ethics.  Other major works include a translation of [[Aristotle|Aristotle’s]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',<ref>{{cite book  | last1 = Crisp | first1 = Roger | title = Aristotle: Nicomachean ethics | publisher = Cambridge University Press: Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy | location = Cambridge, U.K. New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780521635462 }}</ref> and the ''Routledge Guidebook to [[John Stuart Mill|Mill]] on [[Utilitarianism]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Crisp | first = Roger | title = Routledge philosophy guidebook to Mill on utilitarianism | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415109789 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nCrisp is married with two daughters.  Aside from his work, his interests include [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass guitar]] and [[wine tasting]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== Select publications ==\nThis is a selection of Crisp's recent publications.
