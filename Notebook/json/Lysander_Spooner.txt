Although Spooner had finally found commercial success with his mail company, legal challenges by the government eventually exhausted his financial resources. A law enacted in 1851 that strengthened the federal government's monopoly finally put him out of business. The lasting legacy of Spooner's challenge to the postal service was the three-cent stamp, adopted in response to the competition his company provided.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/STAMP3.htm |title=Spooner vs. U.S. Postal System |first=Lucille J. |last=Goodyear |work=[http://www.lysanderspooner.org lysanderspooner.org], originally published in [http://www.legion.org/magazine American Legion Magazine] |date=January 1981 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Abolitionism==\n{{Anarchism sidebar}}\nSpooner attained his greatest fame as a figure in the abolitionist movement. His most famous work, a book titled ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'', was published in 1845. Spooner's book contributed to a controversy among abolitionists over whether the [[United States Constitution]] supported the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The \"disunionist\" faction, led by [[William Lloyd Garrison]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], argued the Constitution legally recognized and enforced the oppression of slaves (as, for example, in the provisions for the capture of fugitive slaves in Article IV, Section 2).<ref>[[Randy Barnett|Barnett, Randy]] [scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1475&context=facpub Whence Comes Section One?: The Abolitionist Origins of the Fourteenth Amendment], pg. 4</ref>  They also cited the frequent appeals to Constitutional compromise by Southern politicians, who insisted that protection of the \"peculiar institution\" was part of the sectional compromise on which the Constitution was based.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} The disunionists thus argued that keeping the free states in a political union with the slave states made the citizens of the free states complicit in the slave system, and denounced the Constitution as \"a covenant with death and an agreement with hell\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/objects/2005july.cfm |title=Donald Yacovone, Massachusetts Historical Society: \"A Covenant with Death and an Agreement with Hell\" |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> More generally, Wendell Phillips disputed Spooner's notion that any unjust law should be held legally void by judges.<ref>Phillips, Wendell.  ''[https://archive.org/details/reviewoflysander00lcphil Review of Spooner's Essay on the Unconstitutionality of Slavery]'' (1847).</ref>\n\nSpooner challenged the claim that the text of the Constitution permitted slavery.<ref name=UOS>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/UnconstitutionalityOfSlaveryContents.htm |title=The Unconstitutionality of Slavery |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> Although he recognized that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had probably not intended to outlaw slavery when writing the Constitution, he argued that only the meaning of the text, not the private intentions of its writers, was enforceable. Spooner used a complex system of legal and natural law arguments in order to show that the clauses usually interpreted as supporting slavery did not, in fact, support it, and that several clauses of the Constitution prohibited the states from establishing slavery.<ref name=UOS/> Spooner's arguments were cited by other pro-Constitution abolitionists, such as [[Gerrit Smith]] and the [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]], which adopted it as an official text in its 1848 platform. [[Frederick Douglass]], originally a Garrisonian disunionist, later came to accept the pro-Constitution position, and cited Spooner's arguments to explain his change of mind.<ref>Cf. Douglass, \"[[What to a slave is the 4th of July?|What to the Slave is the Fourth of July]]?\"</ref>\n\nFrom the publication of this book until 1861, Spooner actively campaigned against slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lysanderspooner.org/node/7 |title=Letters by Lysander Spooner |publisher=Lysanderspooner.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> He published subsequent pamphlets on [[Jury nullification]] and other legal defenses for escaped slaves and offered his legal services, often free of charge, to fugitives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2181&Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, ''An Essay on the Trial by Jury'' (1852) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> In the late 1850s, copies of his book were distributed to members of Congress sparking some debate over their contents. Even Senator [[Albert G. Brown|Albert Gallatin Brown]] of [[Mississippi]], a slavery proponent, praised the argument's intellectual rigor and conceded it was the most formidable legal challenge he had seen from the abolitionists to date. In 1858, Spooner circulated a \"Plan for the Abolition of Slavery\", calling for the use of [[guerrilla warfare]] against slaveholders by black slaves and non-slaveholding free Southerners, with aid from Northern abolitionists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/LS-PAS.htm |title=Lysander Spooner – Plan for the Abolition of Slavery |publisher=Praxeology.net |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> Spooner also \"conspir[ed] with [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] to promote a servile insurrection in the South\", and participated in an aborted plot to free Brown after his capture following the failed raid on [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harper's Ferry]], [[Virginia]] (Harper's Ferry is now part of the state of [[West Virginia]]).<ref name=Raico>[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [https://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Spooner was actively courted by [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] to support the fledgling [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].{{citation needed|date=June 2009}} An admitted sympathizer with [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] political philosophy, Spooner adamantly refused the request and soon became an outspoken abolitionist critic of the party. To Spooner, the Republicans were hypocrites for purporting to oppose slavery's expansion but refusing to take a strong, consistent moral stance against slavery itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lysanderspooner.org/letters/SESP012260.htm |title=Letter Spooner-William H.

He published several letters and pamphlets about the war, arguing that the Republican objective was not to eradicate slavery, but rather to preserve the Union by force. He blamed the bloodshed on Republican political leaders, such as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] and Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who often criticized slavery but would not attack it on a constitutional basis, and who pursued military policies seen as vengeful and abusive.<ref name=\"oll.libertyfund.org\">{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2233&Itemid=28 |title=Lysander Spooner, Letter to Charles Sumner (1864) |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo87.html |title=Spooner's Fiery Attack on Lincolnite Hypocrisy by Thomas DiLorenzo |publisher=Lewrockwell.com |date=2004-11-26 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he denounced the institution of slavery, Spooner recognized the right of the [[Confederate States of America]] to secede as the manifestation of government by consent, a constitutional and legal principle fundamental to Spooner's philosophy; the Northern states, in contrast, were trying to deny the [[Southern United States|Southerners]] that right through military force.<ref>''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xvii and further</ref> He \"vociferously opposed the Civil War, arguing that it violated the right of the southern states to secede from a Union that no longer represented them\".<ref name=Raico/> He believed they were attempting to restore the Southern states to the Union, against the wishes of Southerners. He argued that the right of the states to secede derives from the natural right of slaves to be free.<ref name=\"oll.libertyfund.org\"/> This argument was unpopular in the North and in the South after the War began, as it conflicted with the official position of both governments.<ref>''The Lysander Spooner Reader'', by George H. Smith, p. xix</ref>\n\n==Views on economics and self-employment==\nSpooner believed that it was beneficial for people to be [[Self-employment|self-employed]] so that they could enjoy the full benefits of their labor rather than having to share them with an employer. He argued that various forms of government intervention in the free market made it difficult for people to start their own businesses. For one, he believed that laws against high interest rates, or \"[[usury]]\", prevented those with [[Capital (economics)|capital]] from extending credit because they could not be compensated for high risks of not being repaid: \"If a man have not capital of his own, upon which to bestow his labor, it is necessary that he be allowed to obtain it on credit. And in order that he may be able to obtain it on credit, it is necessary that he be allowed to contract for such a rate of interest as will induce a man, having surplus capital, to loan it to him; for the capitalist cannot, consistently with natural law, be compelled to loan his capital against his will. All legislative restraints upon the rate of interest, are, therefore, nothing less than arbitrary and tyrannical restraints upon a man's natural capacity amid natural right to hire capital, upon which to bestow his labor...The effect of usury laws, then, is to give a monopoly of the right of borrowing money, to those few, who can offer the most approved security\".<ref>Spooner, Lysander. 1846. ''Poverty: Its Illegal Causes and Legal Cure''. Boston: [[Bela Marsh]].</ref>\n\nSpooner also believed that government restrictions on issuance of private money made it inordinately difficult for individuals to obtain the capital on credit to start their own businesses, thereby putting them in a situation where \"a very large portion of them, to save themselves from starvation, have no alternative but to sell their labor to others\" and those who do employ others are only able to afford to pay \"far below what the laborers could produce, [than] if they themselves had the necessary capital to work with.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland May 15, 1886</ref> Spooner said that there was \"a prohibitory tax – a tax of ten per cent. – on all notes issued for circulation as money, other than the notes of the United States and the national banks\" which he argued caused an artificial shortage of credit, and that eliminating this tax would result in making plenty of money available for lending<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> such that: \"All the great establishments, of every kind, now in the hands of a few proprietors, but employing a great number of wage labourers, would be broken up; for few or no persons, who could hire capital and do business for themselves would consent to labour for wages for another\".<ref>quoted from Spooner's Letter to Grover Cleveland by Eunice Minette Schuster, ''Native American Anarchism'', p. 148</ref>\n\n==American Civil War and Reconstruction==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\nSpooner harshly condemned the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] period that followed. Though he approved of the abolition of slavery, he criticized the North for failing to make this the purpose of their cause. Instead of fighting to abolish slavery, they fought to \"preserve the union\" and, according to Spooner, to associate business interests with that union. Spooner believed a war of this type was hypocritical and dishonest, especially on the part of Radical Republicans like Sumner who were by then claiming to be abolitionist heroes for ending slavery. Spooner also argued that the war came at a great cost to liberty and proved that the rights expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] were no longer true – the people could not \"dissolve the political bands\" that tie them to a government that \"becomes destructive\" of the [[consent of the governed]] because if they did so, as Spooner believed the South had attempted to do, they would have their obedience to the former government enforced with military action.\n\nThe Union government's actions during the war caused Spooner to espouse [[individualist anarchism]]. He published a series of political tracts, ''[[No Treason]]'', the most famous of which is ''No Treason No. VI: The Constitution of No Authority''. In this lengthy essay, Spooner argued that the Constitution was a contract of government (see [[social contract]] theory) which could not logically apply to anyone other than the individuals who signed it, and was thus void. Furthermore, since the government now existing under the Constitution pursued coercive policies that were contrary to the Natural Law and to the consent of the governed, it had been demonstrated that that document could not adequately stop many abuses against liberty or prevent tyranny. Spooner bolstered his argument by noting that the federal government, as established by a legal contract, could not legally bind all persons living in the nation since none had ever signed their names or given their consent to it – that consent had always been assumed, which fails one of the most basic burdens of proof for a valid contract in the courtroom.\n\nSpooner widely circulated the ''No Treason'' pamphlets, which also contained a legal defense against the crime of [[treason]] itself intended for former Confederate soldiers (hence the name of the pamphlet, arguing that \"no treason\" had been committed in the war by the South). These excerpts were published in ''[[De Bow's Review]]'' and in some other well-known southern periodicals of the time.\n\n==Anarchism==\n[[George Woodcock]] describes Spooner's essays as an \"eloquent elaboration\" of [[Josiah Warren]] and the early American development of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's ideas]], and associates his works with that of [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]].<ref name=\"Woodcock\">{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=G.|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne|page=434}}</ref> Woodcock also reports that both Lysander Spooner and [[William Batchelder Greene]] had been members of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]]<ref name=\"Woodcock\">{{cite book|last=Woodcock|first=G.|authorlink=George Woodcock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|publisher=Penguin|location=Melbourne|page=460}}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\n[[File:Lysander Spooner Grave.JPG|thumb|250px|''Spooner's tombstone, he is interred in the historic [[Forest Hills Cemetery]]'']]\nSpooner continued to write and publish extensively during the decades following Reconstruction, producing works such as \"Natural Law or The Science of Justice\" and \"Trial By Jury\". In \"Trial By Jury\" he defended the doctrine of [[jury nullification]], which holds that in a free society a trial jury not only has the authority to rule on the facts of the case, but also on the legitimacy of the law under which the case is tried. This doctrine would further allow juries to refuse to convict if they regard the law by which they are asked to convict as illegitimate. He became associated with [[Benjamin Tucker]]'s [[anarchism|anarchist]] journal ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'', which published all of his later works in serial format, and for which he wrote several editorial columns on current events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uncletaz.com/liberty/spooner.html |title=Lysander Spooner, Tucker & Liberty |publisher=Uncletaz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> He argued that \"almost all fortunes are made out of the capital and labour of other men than those who realize them.
