The prolific author or co-author of over 30 books and over 300 scholarly articles, Hintikka contributed to [[mathematical logic]], [[philosophical logic]], the [[philosophy of mathematics]], [[epistemology]], [[Philosophy of language|language theory]], and the [[philosophy of science]]. His works have appeared in over nine languages.\n\nHintikka is regarded as the founder of formal [[epistemic logic]] and of [[game semantics]] for logic. Early in his career, he devised a [[semantics of modal logic]] essentially analogous to [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|frame semantics]], and discovered the now widely taught [[semantic tableau]], independently of [[Evert Willem Beth]]. Later, he worked mainly on game semantics, and on [[independence-friendly logic]], known for its \"[[branching quantifier]]s\", which he believed do better justice to our intuitions about [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]] than does conventional [[first-order logic]]. He did important exegetical work on [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Hintikka's work can be seen as a continuation of the analytic tendency in philosophy founded by [[Franz Brentano]] and Peirce, advanced by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], and continued by [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], and by Hintikka's teacher [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]. For instance, in 1998 he wrote ''The Principles of Mathematics Revisited'', which takes an exploratory stance comparable to that Russell made with his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' in 1903.\n\nProfessor Hintikka was a student of G. H. von Wright, a Junior Fellow at Harvard (1956–9), and held several professorial appointments at the University of Helsinki, the Academy of Finland, Florida State University and finally Boston University from 1990 until his death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Floyd|first1=Juliet|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/2015/08/13/professor-jaakko-hintikka-1929-2015/|website=Boston University Philosophy Department|publisher=Boston University|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nHintikka edited the [[academic journal]] ''[[Synthese]]'' from 1962 to 2002, and was a consultant editor for more than ten journals. He was the first vice-president of the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies|Fédération Internationale des Sociétés de Philosophie]], the Vice-President of the [[Institut International de Philosophie]] (1993–1996), as well as a member of the [[American Philosophical Association]], the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]], [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], and a member of the governing board of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]]. In 2005, he won the [[Rolf Schock prize]] in logic and philosophy \"for his pioneering contributions to the logical analysis of modal concepts, in particular the concepts of knowledge and belief\". In 1985, he was president of the [[Florida Philosophical Association]].\n\nHe was a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40104|title=Gruppe 3: Idéfag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> On \nMay 26, 2000\nHintikka \nreceived an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of History and Philosophy at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]] <ref>http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/</ref>\n\n==Selected books==\nFor a bibliography, see Auxier and Hahn (2006).\n*Primary\n** 1962.
