Under Longinus he studied [[grammar]] and [[rhetoric]].\n\nIn 262 he went to [[Rome]], attracted by the reputation of [[Plotinus]], and for six years devoted himself to the practice of [[Neoplatonism]], during which time he severely modified his diet. At one point he became suicidal.<ref name=Eunapius>[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Philosophers''</ref> On the advice of Plotinus he went to live in [[Sicily]] for five years to recover his mental health. On returning to Rome, he lectured on [[philosophy]] and completed an edition of the writings of Plotinus (who had died in the meantime) together with a biography of his teacher. [[Iamblichus]] is mentioned in ancient Neoplatonic writings as his pupil, but this most likely means only that he was the dominant figure in the next generation of philosophers. The two men differed publicly on the issue of [[theurgy]].\n\nIn his later years, he married Marcella, a widow with seven children and an enthusiastic student of philosophy. Little more is known of his life, and the date of his death is uncertain.\n\n== Introduction (''Isagoge'') ==\n[[File:AverroesAndPorphyry.JPG|thumb|Imaginary debate between [[Averroes]] (1126–1198 AD) and Porphyry (234–c. 305 AD). Monfredo de Monte Imperiali ''Liber de herbis'', 14th century.<ref>\"Inventions et decouvertes au Moyen-Age\", Samuel Sadaune, p.112</ref>]]\nPorphyry is best known for his contributions to philosophy. Apart from writing the ''Aids to the Study of the Intelligibles'' (Ἀφορμαὶ πρὸς τὰ νοητά; ''Sententiae Ad Intelligibilia Ducentes''), a basic summary of Neoplatonism, he is especially appreciated for his ''Introduction to Categories'' (''Introductio in Praedicamenta'' or ''Isagoge et in Aristotelis Categorias commentarium''), a very short work often considered to be a commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', hence the title.<ref>Barnes 2003, p. xiv outlines the history of the opinion that Porphyry meant for his ''Isagoge'' to be an introductory work to the ''Categories''.</ref> According to {{Harvtxt|Barnes|2003}}, however, the correct title is simply ''Introduction'' (Εἰσαγωγή ''Isagoge''), and the book is an introduction not to the ''Categories'' in particular, but to ''logic'' in general, comprising as it does the theories of predication, definition, and proof. The Introduction describes how qualities attributed to things may be classified, famously breaking down the philosophical concept of substance into the five components ''genus'', ''species'', ''difference'', ''property'', ''accident''.\n\nAs Porphyry's most influential contribution to philosophy, the ''Introduction to Categories'' incorporated Aristotle's logic into Neoplatonism, in particular the doctrine of the [[category of being|categories of being]] interpreted in terms of entities (in later philosophy, \"[[universal (metaphysics)|universal]]\"). [[Boethius]]' ''Isagoge'', a Latin translation of Porphyry's \"Introduction\", became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, which set the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the problem of universals. In medieval textbooks, the all-important ''[[Arbor porphyriana]]'' (\"Porphyrian Tree\") illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in Porphyry's Tree, in classifying living organisms (see [[cladistics]]).\n\nThe ''Introduction'' was translated into Arabic by [[Abd-Allāh Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ]] from a Syriac version. With the Arabicized name ''Isāghūjī'' (إيساغوجي) it long remained the standard introductory logic text in the Muslim world and influenced the study of theology, philosophy, grammar, and jurisprudence. Besides the adaptations and epitomes of this work, many independent works on logic by Muslim philosophers have been entitled Isāghūjī. Porphyry's discussion of ''accident'' sparked a long-running debate on the application of ''accident'' and ''essence''.<ref>Encyclopedia Iranica, \"Araz\" (accident)</ref>\n\n== ''Philosophy from Oracles'' (''De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda'') ==\nPorphyry is also known as an opponent of [[Christianity]] and defender of [[Paganism]]; his precise contribution to the philosophical approach to traditional religion may be discovered in the fragments of ''Philosophy from Oracles'' (Περὶ τῆς ἐκ λογίων φιλοσοφίας; ''De Philosophia ex Oraculis Haurienda''), which was originally three books in length.  There is debate as to whether it was written in his youth (as Eunapius reports<ref name=Eunapius />) or closer in time to the persecutions of Christians under [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]].<ref>The Christian apologist [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] states that \"some Greek\" might say \"How can these people be thought worthy of forbearance? They have not only turned away from those who from earliest time have been thought of as divine among all Greeks and barbarians... but by emperors, law-givers and philosophers— all of a given mind... And to what sort of penalties might they not be subjected who... are fugitives from the things of their Fathers?\"  This material, once thought to be part of ''Against the Christians'', but reassigned by Wilken 1979 to ''Philosophy from Oracles'', is quoted in Digeser 1998, p. 129.  However, it may not have been by Porphyry at all. See Aaron Johnson, \"Rethinking the Authenticity of Porphyry, c.Christ. fr. 1,\" Studia Patristica 46 (2010): 53-58.</ref>\n\nWhether or not Porphyry was the pagan philosopher opponent in [[Lactantius]]' ''Divine Institutes'', written at the time of the persecutions, has long been discussed. The fragments of the ''Philosophy from Oracles'' are only quoted by Christians, especially [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], [[Theodoret]], [[Augustine]], and [[John Philoponus]]. The fragments contain oracles identifying proper sacrificial procedure, the nature of astrological fate, and other topics relevant for Greek and Roman religion in the third century.  Whether this work contradicts his treatise defending vegetarianism, which also warned the philosopher to avoid animal sacrifice, is disputed among scholars.<ref>Aaron Johnson, ''Religion and Identity in Porphyry of Tyre'', Cambridge, 2013.</ref>\n\n== ''Against the Christians'' (''Adversus Christianos'') ==\nDuring his retirement in Sicily, Porphyry wrote ''Against the Christians'' (Κατὰ Χριστιανῶν; ''Adversus Christianos'') which consisted of fifteen books. Porphyry acknowledged [[Jesus Christ]] only as an outstanding philosopher. Some thirty Christian apologists, such as Methodius, Eusebius, Apollinaris, Augustine, Jerome, etc., responded to his challenge. In fact, everything known about Porphyry’s arguments is found in these refutations, largely because Theodosius II ordered every copy burned in A.D. 435 and again in 448.<ref>\"Constantine and other emperors banned and burned Porphyry's work\" (Digeser 1998:130).</ref><ref>Letter of Constantine proscribing the works of Porphyry and Arius, ''To the Bishops and People'', in Socrates Scholasticus, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', i.9.30-31; Gelasius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', II.36; translated in Stevenson, J., (Editor; Revised with additional documents by [[W. H. C. Frend]]), ''A New Eusebius, Documents illustrating the history of the Church to AD 337'' (SPCK, 1987).</ref>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=326}}\n\nPorphyry became one of the most able pagan adversaries of Christianity of his day. His aim was not to disprove the substance of Christianity’s teachings but rather the records within which the teachings are communicated.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=327}}\n\nHis criticisms may have targeted Christians more than Christ; he is reported to have said in another work (the ''Philosophy from Oracles''): \"The gods have proclaimed Christ to have been most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect.\"\n\nAccording to Jerome, Porphyry especially attacked the prophecy of Daniel because Jews and Christians pointed to the historical fulfillment of its prophecies as a decisive argument. But these prophecies, he maintained, were written not by Daniel but by some Jew who in the time of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] (d. 164 B.C.) gathered up the traditions of Daniel's life and wrote a history of recent past events but in the future tense, falsely dating them back to Daniel's time.\n\n:Daniel did not predict so much future events as he narrated past ones. Finally what he had told up to Antiochus contained true history; if anything was guessed beyond that point it was false, for he had not known the future. (quoted by Jerome)\n\nThe first part of Daniel, with the exception of the dream in Daniel 2, is historic, not prophetic. Porphyry, attacking only the prophetic portion, declares it to be merely a late anonymous narrative of past events, purporting to have been predicted long before by Daniel. Thus Porphyry's scheme was based on the supposed spuriousness of Daniel's prophecies.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=328}}\n\nPorphyry devised his own interpretation where the third “prophetic kingdom” was Alexander, and assigned the Macedonian Ptolemies and Seleucids to the fourth kingdom. From among these he chose ten kings, making the eleventh to be Antiochus Epiphanes. In this way he threw his main strength against the book of Daniel, recognizing that if this pillar of faith be shaken, the whole structure of prophecy must tremble. If the writer was not Daniel, then he lied on a frightful scale, ascribing to God prophecies which were never uttered, and making claim of miracles that were never wrought. And if Daniel's authorship could be shown to be false, then Christ Himself would be proved to bear witness to an imposter. (Matt. 24: 15.){{sfn|Froom|1950|p=329}} Porphyry's thesis was adopted by [[Edward Gibbon]], the English deist [[Anthony Collins]], and most [[Modernist]] scholars.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=330}}\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and the 5th-century ecclesiastical historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]], assert that Porphyry was once a Christian.<ref>Historia Ecclesiastica III.23.</ref>\n\n== Other subjects ==\nPorphyry was opposed to the [[theurgy]] of his disciple [[Iamblichus]]. Much of Iamblichus' mysteries is dedicated to the defense of mystic theurgic divine possession against the critiques of Porphyry. French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]] maintains that for Porphyry, spiritual exercises are an essential part of spiritual development.<ref>Hadot, P.: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'' (Oxford: Blackwells, 1995), p. 100.</ref>\n\nPorphyry was, like [[Pythagoras]], an advocate of [[vegetarianism]] on spiritual and ethical grounds. These two philosophers are perhaps the most famous vegetarians of classical antiquity. He wrote the ''On Abstinence from Animal Food'' (Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων; ''De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium''), advocating against the consumption of animals, and he is cited with approval in vegetarian literature up to the present day.\n\nPorphyry also wrote widely on [[astrology]], religion, philosophy, and [[musical theory]]. He produced a ''History of Philosophy'' (''Philosophos historia'') with ''[[Biography|vitae]]'' of philosophers that included a life of his teacher, Plotinus. His life of Plato from book iv exists only in quotes by [[Cyril of Alexandria]].<ref>James A. Notopoulos, \"Porphyry's Life of Plato\" ''Classical Philology'' '''35'''.3 (July 1940), pp. 284-293, attempted a reconstruction from Apuleius' use of it.</ref> His book ''Vita Pythagorae'' on the life of [[Pythagoras]] is not to be confused with the book of the same name by [[Iamblichus]].
