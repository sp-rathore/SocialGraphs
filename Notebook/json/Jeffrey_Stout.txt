His works focus on the possibility of ethical discourse in a religiously pluralistic society.  Recently, he has championed what he calls \"the moral tradition of [[democracy]]\" as a \"background of agreement\" shared by participants in the political/social debates taking place in America today.  This is his answer to such thinkers as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Stanley Hauerwas]] who believe that participants in such debates do not share enough common ground to prevent their arguments from being intractable.  Stout has been influenced by [[Richard Rorty]] and more recently [[Robert Brandom]] and, albeit with qualifications, aligns himself with the school of [[philosophy]] known as [[American Pragmatism]].\n\nSince obtaining his Ph.D in 1976 from [[Princeton University]], Stout has remained there as a Professor of Religion.\n\nHis two most well-known books, for both of which he won the American Academy of Religion Award for Excellence, are ''Ethics After Babel'' (1989) and ''Democracy and Tradition'' (2003). His most recent book, ''Blessed Are the Organized: Grassroots Democracy in America'' (2010), takes an ethnographic turn, investigating the engaged democratic practices that he has endorsed in his previous work.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theotherjournal.com/article.php?id=864 An Interview with Jeffrey Stout Part I] and [http://www.theotherjournal.com/article.php?id=867 Part II]\n*[https://www.princeton.edu/~stout/stout_hmp.htm Stout's personal website]\n*[https://www.princeton.edu/~stout/cv.htm Stout's C.V.]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stout, Jeffrey}}\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:American academics]]\n[[Category:Princeton University faculty]]\n[[Category:Princeton University alumni, 1970â€“79]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Jeffrey Stout"}}}}
