Resisting the [[empiricism]] of his day, he denounced most [[Western philosophy]] since [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]] as trending towards [[atheism]] and has been considered a revival of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] school. He was one of the most influential theologians of his age but his influence on subsequent philosophy has been less marked.\n\n== Life ==\nBenedikt Franz Xaver Baader{{sfnp|''D18GP''|2010}} was born in [[Munich]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], on 27 March 1765.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=173}} He was the third son of Joseph Franz von Paula Baader{{refn|group=n|His first name is spelled \"Josef\" in some records.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}}} (15 September 1733&nbsp;- 16 February 1794) and Maria Dorothea Rosalia von Schöpf (25 October 1742&nbsp;- 5 February 1829),{{sfnp|Hoffman|1857|pp=1–3}}<ref>[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz45575.html 1].</ref><ref>[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/ppn118505378.html 2].</ref>{{refn|group=n|In some records her middle name is spelled \"Rosalie.\" Also, in some records her last name is spelled \"von Schöpff\".

(The elector died two years later.) Franz' two older brothers were both distinguished men.

H. Jacobi]], with whom he became close friends.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=173}} He also came into contact with [[Friedrich Schelling]], and the works he published during this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher. Yet Baader is no disciple of Schelling, and he probably gave more than he received.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=173}}<ref>{{citation |first=Marie-Élise |last=Zovko |title=Natur und Gott: Das wirkungsgeschichtliche Verhältnis Schellings und Baaders |location=Würzburg |publisher=Königshausen & Neumann |date=1996 |isbn=978-3-8260-1187-0 }}.</ref>{{refn|group=n|On Baader's influence on and friendship with Schelling and the reasons for their eventual break with one another, see [[Marie-Élise Zovko|Zovko]].{{sfnp|Zovko|1996|pp=86-139, 191-269, 270-312}}}} Their friendship continued till about the year 1822, when Baader's denunciation of modern philosophy in his letter to the [[Russian Empire|tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]] entirely alienated Schelling.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|pp=173–174}}\n\nAll this time, Baader continued to apply himself to his profession.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} He gained a prize of 12,000 [[Bavarian gulden|gulden]] (≈117&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]] [[silver]]) for his new method of employing [[sodium sulfate]] instead of [[potash]] in the making of [[glass]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} From 1817 to 1820, he held the post of superintendent of mines and was raised to the rank of nobility for his services.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} He retired in 1820, and thereafter published one of the best of his works, ''Fermenta Cognitionis'' in 6 parts from 1822 to 1825.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} In it, he combats modern philosophy and recommends the study of Böhme.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} In 1826, when the new university was opened in Munich, he was appointed professor of philosophy and speculative theology.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} He published some of his lectures there in 4 parts from 1827 to 1836 under the title ''{{lang|de|Spekulative Dogmatik}}''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} In 1838, he publicly opposed the interference of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in civil matters and, in consequence, was interdicted from lecturing on the philosophy of religion during the last three years of his life.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}}  He died on 23 May 1841.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} He is buried in the [[Alter Südfriedhof]] in Munich.\n\n==Philosophy==\nIt is difficult to summarize Baader's philosophy, for he expressed his deepest thoughts in obscure [[aphorism]]s or mystical symbols and analogies.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}}<ref>{{citation |last=Zeller |first=Eduard |author-link=Eduard Zeller |title=Ges. d. deut. Phil. |pp=732, 736 }}. {{de icon}}</ref> His doctrines are mostly expounded in short detached essays, in comments on the writings of Böhme and St-Martin, or in his extensive correspondence and journals.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=88}} However, there are salient points which mark the outline of his thought. Baader starts from the position that human reason by itself can never reach the end it aims at and maintains that we cannot throw aside the presuppositions of faith, church, and tradition. His point of view may be described as [[Scholasticism]], since like the Scholastics he believed that theology and philosophy are not opposed but that reason has to make clear the truths given by authority and revelation.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} In his attempts to draw the realms of faith and knowledge still closer, however, he approaches the mysticism of [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Paracelsus]], and Böhme.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Our existence depends upon God's cognition of us.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=88}}{{refn|group=n|In [[Latin]]: ''{{lang|la|cogitor ergo cogito et sum}}''. (\"I am thought of, therefore I think and am.\"){{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=88}} See also [[Rene Descartes|Descartes]]'s ''[[cogito ergo sum]]''.}} All self-consciousness is at the same time God-consciousness, and all knowledge is knowing with, consciousness of, or participation in God.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}}\n\n==Theology==\nBaader's philosophy is thus essentially a form of [[theosophy (history of philosophy)|theosophy]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} God is not to be conceived as mere abstract Being ({{lang-la|substantia}}) but as the primary [[will (philosophy)|Will]] at the basis of all things and an everlasting process or activity (''{{lang|la|actus}}'').{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} This process functions as a self-generation of God, in which we may distinguish two aspects&mdash;the immanent or esoteric and the eminent or exoteric.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Only insofar as the \"primitive will\" thinks or is conscious of itself can it distinguish knower and known, producer and produced, from which proceeds the power to become spirit.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} God has His reality only insofar as He is absolute spirit.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} The [[Trinity (Christianity)|Trinity]] (called ''{{lang|la|Ternar}}'' in Baader) is not a given but is rendered possible, is mirrored in, and takes place through the eternal and impersonal idea or wisdom of God, which exists beside through not distinct from the \"primitive will\".{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Personality and concrete reality is given to separate aspects of this Trinity through nature, which is eternally and necessarily produced by God.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} These aspects of existence do not occur successively within time but occur ''{{lang|la|[[sub specie aeternitatis]]}}'' as necessary elements of the self-evolution of divine Being.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Its \"nature\" is not to be confused with the [[nature]] of [[Creation (mythology)|Creation]], which is an unnecessary, free, and non-temporal act of God's love and will which cannot be speculatively deduced but must be accepted as a historic fact.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}}\n\nCreated beings were originally of three orders: the intelligent or [[angel]]s; the non-intelligent material world; and [[humans|man]], who mediated between them.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Angels and man were endowed with [[free will (theology)|freedom]]. The [[Fall of Man|Fall of Adam]] and [[Fallen angel|Lucifer]] were historic facts which were possible, though not necessary.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Baader considered the angels to have fallen through a desire to ascend to equality with God (i.e., [[pride]]) and man through permitting himself to sink to the level of nature (via the [[seven deadly sins|various bodily sins]]).{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Baader considered that the world as we know it—with [[time]], [[space]], and [[matter]]—only began after the fall of mankind and was created as a gift from God permitting humanity the opportunity for [[redemption (theology)|redemption]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Baader developed theories of [[physiology]] and [[anthropology]] over a number of works based upon this understanding of the universe, but in the main coincides with the ideas of Böhme.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} Principally, he traces the adverse effects of various [[sin]]s and advocates the restoration of natural harmonies by its removal.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}}\n\nHis system of [[ethics]] rejects the idea that obedience to moral laws alone (as in [[Kantianism]]) is enough. Instead, though humanity has lost the ability to accomplish this on its own, it is necessary to realize and participate in our place in the divine order.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} As [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] is required for such a realization, no ethical theory neglecting sin and [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] is satisfactory or even possible.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=174}} [[Good works|Mere works]] are never sufficient, but [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s healing virtue must be received, chiefly through [[prayer]] and the [[Catholic Sacraments|sacraments of the church]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|pp=174–175}}\n\nBaader was regarded as among the greatest speculative theologians of 19th-century [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and influenced, among others, [[Richard Rothe]], [[Julius Müller]], and [[Hans Lassen Martensen]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=175}}\n\n==Politics==\nBaader argued that two things were requisite in the [[state (polity)|state]]: common submission to the ruler (without which there would be [[civil war]] or [[invasion]]) and inequality of rank (without which there would be no [[government|organization]]).{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=175}} As Baader considered God alone to be the true ruler of mankind, he argued that loyalty to a government can only be secured or given when it was truly Christian;{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=175}} he opposed [[despotism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]] equally.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=175}} His [[utopia|idea state]] was a civil community ruled by the [[Catholic Church]], whose principles opposed both passive and irrational [[pietism]] and the excessively rational doctrines of [[Protestantism]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=175}}\n\n==Gender issues==\nOne of Baader’s central ideas is his concept of [[androgyny]]:\n{{Quotation|The Androgyne is the harmonious fusion of the sexes, resulting in a certain [[asexuality]], a synthesis which creates an entirely new being, and which does not merely juxtapose the two sexes 'in an enflamed opposition' as the [[hermaphrodite]] does. }}\nFollowing the literal wording of the first of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'s [[Creation of Man|two accounts of the creation of man]], Baader says that Man was originally an androgynous being. Neither man nor woman is the \"image and likeness of God\" but only the androgyne. Both sexes are equally fallen from the original divinity of the androgyne. Androgynism is man's likeness to God, his supernatural upsurge. Hence it follows that sexes must cease and vanish. From these positions Baader interpreted the sacrament of marriage as a symbolic restitution of angelic bisexuality: {{Quotation|The secret and the sacrament of true love in the indissoluble bond of the two lovers, consists in each helping the other, each in himself, towards the restoration of the androgyne, the pure and whole humanity. }} Ultimately Christ's sacrifice will make possible a restoration of the primal androgyny. Baader believed that primordial androgyny would return as the world neared its end.{{sfnp|''EH''|1990|p=57}}\n\n==Works==\nSeveral years after his death, Baader's works were collected and edited by a number of his disciples.
