Kilwardby was the first member of a [[mendicant order]] to attain a high ecclesiastical office in the English Church.\n\n==Life==\nKilwardby studied at the [[University of Paris]], then was a teacher of [[grammar]] and [[logic]] there. He then joined the [[Dominican Order]] and studied [[theology]],<ref name=Lawrence146>Lawrence \"Thirteenth Century\" ''English Church and the Papacy'' p. 146</ref> and became regent at [[Oxford University]] before 1261,<ref name=Thought288>Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 288</ref> probably by 1245.<ref name=Leff290>Leff ''Paris and Oxford Universities'' pp. 290–293</ref> He was named [[provincial superior|provincial]] [[prior]] of the Dominicans for England in 1261,<ref name=BHOCant>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=33853 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066-1300: Volume 2: Monastic Cathedrals (Northern and Southern Provinces): Canterbury: Archbishops]''</ref> and in October 1272 Pope [[Pope Gregory X|Gregory X]] appointed him as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to end a dispute over the election. Kilwardby was provided to the archbishopric on 11 October 1272, given the temporalities on 12 December 1272, and consecrated on 26 February 1273.<ref name=Handbook233>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233</ref>\n\nKilwardby crowned [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] and his wife [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]] as king and queen of England in August 1274, but otherwise took little part in politics. He instead concentrated on his ecclesiastical duties, including charity to the poor and donating to the Dominicans.<ref name=Moorman371>Moorman ''Church Life'' p. 371</ref>\n\nIn 1278 Pope [[Pope Nicholas III|Nicholas III]] named Kilwardby [[Cardinal Bishop of Porto and Santa Rufina]].<ref name=Princes173>Bellenger and Fletcher ''Princes of the Church'' p. 173</ref> He then resigned Canterbury and left England,<ref name=Handbook233/> taking with him papers, registers and documents belonging to the see. He also left the see deep in debt again, after his predecessor had cleared the debt.<ref name=Moorman173>Moorman ''Church Life'' p. 173</ref> He died in Italy in 1279 and was buried in the Dominican convent in Viterbo, Italy.<ref name=Princes173/> While in theory this was a promotion, probably it was not, as the pope was unhappy with Kilwardby's support of efforts to resist the payment of papal revenues and with the lack of effort towards the reforms demanded at the [[Second Council of Lyon]] in 1274.<ref name=Edward249>Prestwich ''Edward I'' p. 249</ref>\n\nKilwardby's theological and philosophical views were summed up by [[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]] who said that he was a \"conservative eclectic, holding the doctrine of seminal tendencies and opposing...the Aristotelian doctrine of the unity of form in beings, including man.\"<ref name=Thought249>Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 249</ref> Some sources state that he was the author of ''Summa Philosophiae'', a history and description of the schools of philosophical thought then current, but the writing style is not similar to his other works, and Knowles, for one, does not believe it was authored by Kilwardby.<ref name=Thought287>Knowles ''Evolution of Medieval Thought'' p. 287</ref>\n\nIt has been alleged that Kilwardby was an opponent of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In 1277 he prohibited the teaching of thirty theses, some of which have been thought to touch upon Thomas Aquinas' teaching. Recent scholars, however, such as Roland Hissette, have challenged this interpretation.<ref name=Burton206>Burton,''Monastic and Religious Orders'' pp. 206–207</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n'''Writings on Grammar'''\n* Commentaria Priscianus minor (A Commentary on the books 17 and 18 of Priscian's ''Institutiones grammaticae'')\n\n'''Wrings on Logic'''\n* Notulae super librum Praedicamentorum\n* Notulae super librum Perihermeneias\n* Notule libri Priorum\n* Notule libri Posteriorum\n* Comentum super librum Topicorum\n* Notulae super librum Porphyrii\n* De natura relationis\n* Priorum Analyticorum expositio\n* Notuale super librum Sex Principiorum\n\n'''Writings on Natural Philosophy'''\n* De spiritu fantastico sive de recptione specierum\n* De tempore\n\n+'''Writings on Ethics'''\n* Quaestiones supra libros Ethicorum\n* Quaestiones in librum primun Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum secundum Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum tertium Sententiarum\n* Quaestiones in librum quartum Sententiarum\n* De ortu scientiarum\n\n''De tempore'' has been translated and edited by [[Alexander Broadie]], and published as ''On Time and Imagination, Part 2: Introduction and Translation''. A critical edition of ''De orto scientiarum'' was published by Albert G.
