Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[[Averroism]]\" or \"radical [[Aristotelianism]]\" in the universities. In response to these perceived evils, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he blasts Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.<ref>Stump, ''Aquinas'', pp. 10–11.</ref> During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi'',<ref name=\"davies5\"/> the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.<ref name=\"stump11\">Stump, ''Aquinas'', p. 11.</ref>\n\nDisputes with some important Franciscans such as [[Bonaventure]] and [[John Peckham]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266–67 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, calling him the \"blind leader of the blind\". Thomas called these individuals the ''murmurantes'' (''Grumblers'').<ref name=\"stump11\"/>\n\nIn reality, Thomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [[Siger of Brabant]] teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.<ref>Aquinas, ''Reader'', pp. 9–11.</ref>\nOn 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [[Etienne Tempier]], issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.<ref>McInerney, ''Against the Averroists'', p. 10.</ref> Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called Augustinians, were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: ''De virtutibus in communi'' (''On Virtues in General''), ''De virtutibus cardinalibus'' (''On Cardinal Virtues''), ''De spe'' (''On Hope'').<ref>Aquinas, ''Reader'', p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Final days and \"straw\" (1272–1274)===\n[[File:Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Icon of the crufixion speaking to Thomas Aquinas is depicted on this stained glass window in [[Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio)]]]]\nIn 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a ''studium generale'' wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased.

Thomas' philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general. Thomas stands as a vehicle and modifier of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In fact, Thomas modified both [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] by way of heavy reliance on the [[Pseudo-Dionysius]]. This source has arguably been assessed not as a communicator of tradition, but as a polemicist, who tried to alter Neo-Platonic tradition in a novel way for the Christian world that would make notions of complicated Divine Hierarchies more of an emphasis than notions of direct relationship with the figure of Christ as Mediator.<ref>\"One might ask why it is necessary [in the Pseudo-Dionysian Corpus] to have an ordered hierarchy of angels at all in the Christian tradition, considering that the Bible has no concept of celestial hierarchy....That it was found necessary to invent a system of this nature [in the Pseudo-Dionysisn Corpus] after 500 years is tantamount to denying the efficacy of Christ as mediator altogether.\" Rosemarie A. Arthur \"The Pseudo Dionysius as Polemicist: The Development and Purpose of the Angelic Hierarchy in Sixth Century Syria\" London: Ashgate, 2011, pp. 63–64.</ref> Indeed, a number of Catholic sources contend that Thomas was influenced more by this concoction than any other source, including Aristotle.<ref>The Catholic source that shows Thomas having been influenced by this concoction more than any other source is discussed in Peter Paul Fuchs \"Medieval Confabulations, The Mendicant Controversy, and the Real Templar-Masonic Philosophy\" The Association of Masonic Arts http://masonicarts.net/medieval-confabulations-the-mendicant-controversy-and-the-real-templar-masonic-philosophy/</ref>\n\n===Commentaries on Aristotle===\nThomas wrote several important commentaries on [[Aristotle]]'s works, including ''[[On the Soul]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.

But if we speak of virtuous acts, considered in themselves, i.e., in their proper species, thus not all virtuous acts are prescribed by the natural law: for many things are done virtuously, to which nature does not incline at first; but that, through the inquiry of reason, have been found by men to be conductive to well living.\" Therefore, we must determine if we are speaking of virtuous acts as under the aspect of virtuous or as an act in its species.<ref>Summa Question 94, A.3</ref>\n\nThomas defined the four [[cardinal virtues]] as [[prudence]], [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[courage|fortitude]]. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three [[theological virtues]]: [[faith]], [[hope]], and [[charity (virtue)|charity]]. Aquinas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:\n\n{{quote|Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason.

The need for human behavior to be directed made it necessary to have Divine law. Divine law is the specially revealed law in the [[scriptures]]. Aquinas quotes, \"The Apostle says (Hebrews 7.12): The priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation also be made of the law. But the priesthood is twofold, as stated in the same passage, viz, the levitical priesthood, and the priesthood of Christ.

Thomas denied that human beings have any duty of charity to animals because they are not persons. Otherwise, it would be unlawful to use them for food.

He sees man as a social being that lives in a community and interacts with its other members. That leads, among other things, to the [[division of labour]].\n\nThomas thinks that [[monarchy]] is the best form of government, because a monarch does not have to form compromises with other persons. Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.\n\nThe kings are God's representatives in their territories. But the church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, the kings and other worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic church's doctrines and ethics. For example, the worldly authorities have to execute persons whom the church has sentenced to death for [[heresy]] and they have to fight and subdue groups of heretics such as the [[Albigenses]] and [[Waldensians]] to restore the unity of the church.\n\nFollowing Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].<ref>Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''.

He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\n\nIn his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' Aquinas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Aquinas | first1 = Thomas | title = Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas | chapter = Question 75, Article 1 | volume = Second and Revised Edition | editors = Literally Translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province | year = 1920}}</ref> The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body.

If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Aquinas | first1 = Thomas | title = Summa Contra Gentiles | chapter = 5 volumes. | editors = Translated by Anton C.

Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.\n\nThese distinctions can be better understood in the light of Aquinas' understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] (\"matter/form\") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance – what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Aquinas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.\n\nWalter Freeman proposes that [[Thomism]] is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[Neural oscillation|neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.\"<ref>http://philpapers.org/rec/FRENBD</ref>\n\n==Theology==\n{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]\nThomas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,<ref name=Stanford/> the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary—or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary—for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas' mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth.\n\n===Revelation===\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hankey|first1=Wayne|title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=CSU East Bay|isbn=978-0-415-78295-1|pages=134–135|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n====Preserving nature within grace====\nRevealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ \"according to genus\". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).\n \nFaith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.\n\n===Creation===\n[[Image:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]\nAs a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:\n\n{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated. Hence animals generated from the corruption of inanimate things, or of plants, may have been generated then.<ref>Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP072.html#FPQ72OUTP1 ''Summa Theologica''], ''On the Work of the Sixth Day, Reply to Objection 5'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Tommaso - Super Physicam Aristotelis, 1595 - 4733624.tif|thumb|''Super Physicam Aristotelis'', 1595]]\nAdditionally Thomas considered [[Empedocles]]'s theory that various mutated [[species]] emerged at the dawn of Creation. Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':\n\n{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the ‘ox-progeny’, i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.<ref>Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Physics2.htm#14 Physica], ''Book 2, Lecture 14'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province</ref>}}\n\n===Just war===\n{{See also|Just War}}\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. For example, he routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.<ref>[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia</ref> Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.<ref>[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]</ref>\n\nClearly, some special characteristics sets apart \"war\" from \"schism\", \"brawling\", and \"sedition.\" While it would be contradictory to speak of a \"just schism\", a \"just brawling\" or a \"just sedition\" (the three terms denote sin and sin only) \"war\" alone permits sub classification into good and bad kinds. Curiously, however, Aquinas does not work up a terminological contrast between \"just\" and \"unjust\" war.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reichberg |first=Gregory |title=Thomas Aquinas between Just War and Pacificism|journal=Journal of Religious Ethics |date=June 2010 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=219–241 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9795.2010.00427.x}}</ref>\nThomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just.<ref>[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]</ref> He laid these out in his historic work, Summa Theologica:\n* First, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.\n* Second, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.\n* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}</ref>\n\n====School of Salamanca====\nThe [[School of Salamanca]] expanded Aquinas' understanding of [[natural law]] and just war. Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. <!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --> Examples of \"[[The Just War tradition|just war]]\" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.\n* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.\n* War to punish a guilty enemy.\n\nA war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.\n* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.\n* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.\n* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is only legitimate as a last resort.\n\nUnder this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.\n\n===Nature of God===\nThomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject.... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature—namely, by effects.\"<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1</ref>\n\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}\n{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}\n\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# \n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# \n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# \n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}\n# \n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. {{H:title|Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas' view the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well.|This we call God}}<ref>Summa of Theology I, q.2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence</ref>\n\nConcerning the nature of God, Thomas felt the best approach, commonly called the ''[[negative theology|via negativa]]'', is to consider what God is not. This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\n# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.<ref>Kreeft, pp. 74–77.</ref>\n# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.<ref>Kreeft, pp. 86–87.</ref> Thomas defined God as the ‘''Ipse <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi]</span> subsistens'',’ subsisting act of being.<ref>See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''. See also Online Resources: ''<span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi Electronic Journal]</span>''.</ref>\n# God is infinite. That is, God is not finite in the ways that created beings are physically, intellectually, and emotionally limited. This infinity is to be distinguished from infinity of size and infinity of number.<ref>Kreeft, pp. 97–99.</ref>\n# God is immutable, incapable of change on the levels of God's essence and character.<ref>Kreeft, p. 105.</ref>\n# God is one, without diversification within God's self. The unity of God is such that God's essence is the same as God's existence. In Thomas' words, \"in itself the proposition 'God exists' is [[logical truth|necessarily true]], for in it subject and predicate are the same.\"<ref>Kreeft, pp. 111–112.</ref>\n\n===Nature of Sin===\nFollowing [[St. Augustine of Hippo]], Thomas defines [[sin]] as \"a word, deed, or desire, contrary to the [[Divine law|eternal law]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2071.htm#article6 |title=''Summa'', II–I, Q.71, art.6 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> It is important to note the analogous nature of law in Thomas' legal philosophy. Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 ''Summa'', II–I, Q.75, art.1.] \"For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing.\"</ref>). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.\n\n===Nature of the Trinity===\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3</ref> The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\n\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.<ref>{{cite book | author=Nichols, Aidan | title = Discovering Aquinas | publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | year = 2002 | pages = 173–174}}</ref>\n\n===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===\nThomas' five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being. For God as ''[[prima causa]]'' (\"first cause\") comes from Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] and asserts that God is the ultimate cause of all things.<ref>{{cite book | author=Nichols, Aidan | title = Discovering Aquinas | publisher=Eerdmans Publishing Company | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan | year = 2002 | pages = 80–82}}</ref>\n\n===Nature of Jesus Christ===\nIn the ''Summa Theologica'' Thomas begins his discussion of Jesus Christ by recounting the biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] and by describing the negative effects of [[original sin]]. The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"<ref>Aquinas, pp. 228–229.</ref> Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |title=''Summa'', III, Q.50, art.1 |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]'s views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].<ref>Aquinas, pp. 231–239.</ref>\n\nWith respect to [[Saint Paul's]] assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God... emptied himself\" ([[Philippians]] 2:6–7) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Aquinas held the doctrine of divine immutability.<ref>“The Profession of Faith of the 318 Fathers,” First Council of Nicaea – 325 AD, available at http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum01.htm, §2.</ref><ref>Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.</ref><ref>For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17</ref> Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas “The mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.”<ref>ST III.1.1.</ref> Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"<ref>Commentary on Saint Paul’s Letter to the Philippians, available at http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm, §2-2.</ref> For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty.\"<ref>Commentary on Saint Paul’s Letter to the Philippians, available at http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm, §2-2.</</ref> Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\n\nIn short \"Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''.\" Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.<ref>Aquinas, pp. 241, 245–249. Emphasis is the author's.</ref>\n\n{{quote|I answer that, The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in two ways. First as it is in itself, and thus it is altogether simple, even as the Nature of the Word. Secondly, in the aspect of person or hypostasis to which it belongs to subsist in a nature; and thus the Person of Christ subsists in two natures. Hence though there is one subsisting being in Him, yet there are different aspects of subsistence, and hence He is said to be a composite person, insomuch as one being subsists in two.<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4002.htm#article4</ref>}}\n\nEchoing [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], he said that \"The only begotten Son of God...assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last = Weigel |first = George |authorlink = George Weigel |title = The Truth of Catholicism |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |year = 2001 |location = New York City |page =9 |url = |isbn = 0-06-621330-4}}</ref>\n\n===Goal of human life===\nThomas identified the goal of human existence as union and eternal fellowship with God. This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\n\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.<ref>Kreeft, p. 383.</ref>\n\n===Treatment of heretics===\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the Albigensian Crusade. In the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'', he wrote: <blockquote>With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.\n\nOn the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 ''Summa'', II–II, Q.11, art.3.])</blockquote>\n\nHeresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century, which had a limited prison capacity. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\n\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas' point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas' suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life (\"For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV |publisher=Biblegateway.com |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref>). Nevertheless, his point is clear: heretics should be executed by the state. He elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:<blockquote>In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death. ([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])</blockquote>\n\nFor [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]], Aquinas argues for toleration, not only of their persons but also of their public rites.<ref>http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics</ref>\n\n===Thoughts on afterlife and resurrection===\nA grasp of Aquinas' psychology is essential for understanding his beliefs around the afterlife and resurrection. Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=194}}</ref> So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter—which allows for the separation of soul from body. Aquinas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also only comes into existence in the material body.\n\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=200}}</ref> Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\n\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet, Aquinas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Aquinas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Aquinas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=192}}</ref> For Aquinas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Aquinas' soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\n\nAquinas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump|first=Eleanore|title=Aquinas, (in the series The Arguments of the Philosophers)|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|pages=461, 473}}</ref> Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Thomas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Aquinas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Aquinas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Aquinas' account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Aquinas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]\nMany modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas' virtue ethics as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [[deontology]]). Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] (especially in her book ''Intention''), Thomas' [[principle of double effect]] specifically and his theory of intentional activity generally have been influential.\n\nIn recent years the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' entitled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas.\"\n\nThomas' aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers.  Joyce refers to Aquinas' doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013</ref>  For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref>''A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'', James Joyce, Wordsworth 1992 edition, Introduction and Notes by Jacqueline Belanger, 2001, p. 136, note 309: \"''Synopsis Philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae''  This appears to be a reference to ''Elementa Philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis'', a selection of Thomas Aquinas' writings edited and published by G. M. Mancini in 1898. (G)\"  https://books.google.com/books?id=C_rPXanc_HAC&pg=PA221#v=onepage&q&f=false Accessed 3-6-2013</ref>\n\nThe influence of Thomas' aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).\n\n==Criticism of Aquinas as philosopher==\n[[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Aquinas' philosophy stating that,\n\n<blockquote>He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.<ref>{{harv |Russell|1967|p= 463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", Allen & Unwin, London; Simon & Schuster, New York 1946, 484-.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis critique is illustrated on the following examples: According to Russell, Aquinas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\">{{harv |Russell|1967|p= 462}}</ref> Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\"/> It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Aquinas.<ref>http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm</ref> Moreover, as noted above,<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]</ref> Aquinas' introduction of arguments and concepts from the pagan [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.\n\nAquinas' views of God as first cause, cf. ''[[quinque viae]]'', \"depend upon the supposed impossibility of a series having no first term. Every mathematician knows that there is no such impossibility; the series of negative integers ending with minus one is an instance to the contrary.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\"/> Moreover, according to Russell, statements regarding God's essence and existence that are reached within the Aristotelian logic are based on \"some kind of syntactical confusion, without which much of the argumentation about God would lose its plausibility.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{main article|List of works by Thomas Aquinas}}\nThe first edition of Aquinas' opera omnia, the so-called ''editio Piana'' (from [[Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the ''studium'' of the Roman convent at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].<ref>In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great, Christopher J.
