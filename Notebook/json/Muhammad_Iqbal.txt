He was a critic of the mainstream [[Indian National Congress]], which he regarded as dominated by [[Hindus]], and was disappointed with the League when during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by [[Sir Muhammad Shafi]] and the centrist group led by Jinnah.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\"/>{{unreliable source?|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[File:Iqbalpolitics.jpg|thumb|250px|Iqbal with Muslim politicians.<br/>\n(L to R): M.

Discontent with factional leaders like Muhammad Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was an influential force in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress:\n\n{{quote|I know you are a busy man but I do hope you won't mind my writing to you often, as you are the only Muslim in India today to whom the community has right to look up for safe guidance through the storm which is coming to North-West India and, perhaps, to the whole of India.<ref name=\"igbalandpakmovement\"/>\n}}\n\nWhile Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.<ref name=\"jalal14\">Ayesha Jalal, ''The Sole Spokesman'', pp. 14</ref> Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan.

Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:\n\n{{quote|There is only one way out. Muslims should strengthen Jinnah's hands. They should join the Muslim League. Indian question, as is now being solved, can be countered by our united front against both the Hindus and the English. Without it, our demands are not going to be accepted. People say our demands smack of communalism. This is sheer propaganda. These demands relate to the defense of our national existence.... The united front can be formed under the leadership of the Muslim League. And the Muslim League can succeed only on account of Jinnah. Now none but Jinnah is capable of leading the Muslims.<ref name=\"igbalandpakmovement\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/movement/move_main.htm |title=Iqbal and Pakistan Movement |publisher=Allamaiqbal.com |date= |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Revival of Islamic polity==\n[[File:Iqbal-RahmatAli.jpg|thumb|left|Iqbal with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]] and other Muslim leaders]]\nIqbal's six English lectures were published in Lahore in 1930, and then by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1934 in a book titled [[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]. The lectures had been delivered at [[Madras]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and [[Aligarh]].<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses.\n\nIqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's [[Hindu]]-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to [[Egypt]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]], he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim provinces in India. Under a single Indian union he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects especially with regard to their existentially separate entity as Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]], as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his presidential address on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|I would like to see the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North-West Frontier Province]], [[Sind province (1936-1955)|Sind]] and [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan]] amalgamated into a single state. Self-government within the [[British Empire]], or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated Northwest Indian Muslim state appears to me to be the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of Northwest India.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>}}\n\nIn his speech, Iqbal emphasised that unlike Christianity, Islam came with \"legal concepts\" with \"civic significance,\" with its \"religious ideals\" considered as inseparable from social order: \"therefore, the construction of a policy on national lines, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\"<ref name=\"Naipaul\">{{cite book |last=Naipaul |first=V. S. |title=Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples |pages=250–52}}</ref> Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles.\n\nHe thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the ''[[Two-nation theory]]''—that Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. However, he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would construe a [[theocracy]], even as he rejected secularism and nationalism. The latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League, he reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the [[Indian Round Table Conferences 1931-1933|Third round-Table Conference]], he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces.\n\nHe would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians averse to the League. Many unnoticed accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two nation theory.\n\n===Patron of the Journal Tolu-e-Islam===\n[[File:TolueIslam1.jpg|thumb|Copy of the first journal of ''Tolu-e-Islam''.]]\n\nIqbal was the first patron of [[The Journal Tolu-e-Islam|Tolu-e-Islam]], a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India. In 1935, according to his instructions, [[Syed Nazeer Niazi]] initiated and edited the journal,<ref>[http://www.tolueislam.com/Urdu/mag/1935/1935_Oct.djvu .djvu text in Arabic]</ref> named after the famous poem of Iqbal, ''[[Tulu'i Islam]]''. Niazi also dedicated the first edition of this journal to Iqbal. For a long time, Iqbal wanted a journal to propagate his ideas and the aims and objectives of the [[All India Muslim League]]. The journal played an important role in the Pakistan movement.<ref name=\"brightpk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brightpk.com/personalities/allama-iqbal/|title=Allama Iqbal – The Great Poet And Philosopher:|publisher=Bright PK.com|date=15 February 2012|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nLater, the journal was continued<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tolueislam.com/Urdu/urdu.htm |title=Urdu Articles and Books |publisher=Tolueislam.com |date= |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> by [[Ghulam Ahmed Pervez]], who had already contributed many articles in its early editions.\n\n==Literary work==\n{{Main article|Works of Muhammad Iqbal}}\n\n===Persian===\nIqbal's poetic works are written primarily in [[Persian language|Persian]] rather than [[Urdu]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Among his 12,000 verses of poetry, about 7,000 verses are in Persian.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the ''[[Asrar-e-Khudi]]'' (''Secrets of the Self'') in Persian. The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious, spiritual perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com|title=Asrar-e-Khudi|first=Allama Iqbal Academy |last=Official website|accessdate=30 May 2006}}</ref> In ''Asrar-e-Khudi'', Iqbal explains his philosophy of \"Khudi,\" or \"Self.\"<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Iqbal's use of the term \"Khudi\" is synonymous with the word [[Ruh|\"Rooh\"]] mentioned in the Quran. \"Rooh\" is that divine spark which is present in every human being, and was present in Adam, for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam. One has to make a great journey of transformation to realise that divine spirit.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nThe same concept was used by Farid ud Din Attar in his \"Mantaq-ul-Tair\". He proves by various means that the whole universe obeys the will of the \"Self.\" Iqbal condemns self-destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \"Self\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \"Self\" to become a vice-regent of God.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIn his ''[[Rumuz-e-Bekhudi]]'' (''Hints of Selflessness''), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his individual characteristics intact, but once this is achieved he should sacrifice his personal ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \"Self\" outside of society. Also in Persian and published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community,<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he is true throughout to Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive analogous aspects of other religions. The ''Rumuz-e-Bekhudi'' complements the emphasis on the self in the ''Asrar-e-Khudi'' and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title ''Asrar-e-Rumuz'' (''Hinting Secrets''). It is addressed to the world's Muslims.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIqbal's 1924 publication, the ''Payam-e-Mashriq'' (''The Message of the East'') is closely connected to the ''West-östlicher Diwan'' by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardour and dynamism. He explains that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented his book \"Payam-e Mashreq\" to [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah Khan]] in which he admired the liberal movements of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of [[Kabul University]].<ref name=\" A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/>\n\nThe ''[[Zabur-e-Ajam]]'' (''[[Persian Psalms]]''), published in 1927, includes the poems ''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed'' (''Garden of New Secrets'') and ''[[Bandagi Nama]]'' (''Book of Slavery''). In ''Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed'', Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight, showing how it affects and concerns the world of action. ''Bandagi Nama'' denounces slavery by attempting to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIqbal's 1932 work, the ''[[Javed Nama]]'' (''Book of Javed'') is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', through [[magic realism|mystical and exaggerated depictions]] across time. Iqbal depicts himself as ''[[Zinda Rud]]'' (\"A stream full of life\") guided by Rumi, \"the master,\" through various heavens and spheres, and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage re-living a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslim who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab [[Siraj-ud-Daula]] of [[Bengal]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] respectively by betraying them for the benefit of the [[British East India Company|British colonists]], and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. At the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and provides guidance to the \"new generation.\"<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nHis love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems:<ref>''Kuliyat Iqbal'', Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|{{nastaliq|گرچہ ہندی در عذوبت شکر است}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/works/poetry/persian/asrar/text/01.htm|title=1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''garche Hindi dar uzūbat <u>sh</u>ekkar ast''\n\n{{nastaliq|طرز گفتار دري شيرين تر است}}\n\n''tarz-e goftar-e Dari <u>sh</u>irin tar ast''}}\n\nTranslation: ''Even though in sweetness [[Hindi]]* is sugar'' – ''(but) speech method in [[Dari language|Dari]] (Persian dialect) is sweeter *''\n\n===Urdu===\nIqbal's ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (The Call of the Marching Bell), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> The poems he wrote up to 1905—the year he left for England—reflect patriotism and imagery of nature, including the ''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]'' (The song of India),<ref name=\" A Spiritual Bridge between East and West\"/> and ''[[Tarana-e-Milli]]'' (The song of the Community). The second set of poems date from 1905-1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of [[European culture|European society]], which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the ''[[Ummah]]'', to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIqbal's works were in Persian for most  of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, the ''[[Gabriel's Wing|Bal-e-Jibril]]'' (Wings of [[Gabriel]]) is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry, and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the [[Al-Andalus|kingdom of the Moors]]. It consists of [[ghazals]], poems, [[quatrains]], [[epigrams]] and carries a strong sense of religious passion.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nThe ''[[What should then be done O people of the East|Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq]]'' (''What are we to do, O Nations of the East?'') includes the poem ''Musafir'' (''Traveler''). Again, Iqbal depicts [[Rumi]] as a character and an exposition of the mysteries of [[Shariah|Islamic laws]] and [[Sufi]] perceptions is given. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. ''Musafir'' is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the [[Pashtun people]] are counselled to learn the \"secret of Islam\" and to \"build up the self\" within themselves.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/> Iqbal's final work was the ''[[Gift from Hijaz|Armughan-e-Hijaz]]'' (''The Gift of Hijaz''), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and [[epigram]]s in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the [[Hijaz]] in his imagination. Profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n[[File:Miqbal4.jpg|thumb|right|Iqbal wearing a [[bow tie]].]]\n\nIqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals which was written in London during his days of studying there. Some verses of that ghazal are:<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|At last the silent tongue of Hijaz has<br />\nannounced to the ardent ear the tiding<br />\nThat the covenant which had been given to the<br />\ndesert-[dwellers] is going to be renewed<br />\nvigorously:<br />\nThe lion who had emerged from the desert and<br />\nhad toppled the Roman Empire is<br />\nAs I am told by the angels, about to get up<br />\nagain (from his slumbers.)<br />\nYou the [dwellers] of the West, should know that<br />\nthe world of God is not a shop (of yours).<br />\nYour imagined pure gold is about to lose it<br />\nstandard value (as fixed by you).<br />\nYour civilization will commit suicide with its\nown daggers.<br />\nFor a house built on a fragile bark of wood is not longlasting<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>}}\n\n===English===\nIqbal also wrote two books on the topic of ''[[The Development of Metaphysics in Persia]]'' and ''[[The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam]]'' and many letters in the English language. In these, he revealed his thoughts regarding Persian ideology and Islamic Sufism – in particular, his beliefs that Islamic Sufism activates the searching soul to a superior perception of life. He also discussed philosophy, God and the meaning of prayer, human spirit and Muslim culture, as well as other political, social and religious problems.<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\nIqbal was invited to Cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931, where he expressed his views, including that on [[Separation of church and state]] to participants which included the students of that university :<ref name=\"allamaiqbal.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|I would like to offer a few pieces of advice to the youngmen who are at present studying at Cambridge. ...

I had twenty-five years ago seen through the drawbacks of this civilization and therefore, had made some prophecies. They had been delivered by my tongue although I did not quite understand them.
