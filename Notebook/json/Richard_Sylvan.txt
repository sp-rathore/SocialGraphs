He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now [[Victoria University of Wellington]]), and then [[Princeton University]], before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the [[University of Sydney]]. From 1971 until his death in [[Bali, Indonesia]], he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]]. \n\nSylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist [[Val Plumwood|Val Routley]] (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982.<ref>Hyde, Dominic (2014). Eco-Logical Lives. The Philosophical Lives of Richard Routley/Sylvan and Val Routley/Plumwood. Cambridge: White Horse Press.</ref> After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (née Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name ''Sylvan'' (an English word meaning \"of the forest\") to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to [[environmentalism]].\n\n== Work in logic and metaphysics ==\nSylvan was instrumental in the development and study of [[relevance logic]]. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed a semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers [[Nuel Belnap]] and [[Alan Ross Anderson]].<ref>Routley, R. and V. Routley (1972). “Semantics of First Degree Entailment”, Noûs, 3: 335-359.</ref> Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into a semantics for a large number of logical systems.\nTheir work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley's work had particular influence for [[Graham Priest]], a well-known proponent of non-classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic.<ref>Priest, G., Routley, R., and Norman, J. (eds.) (1989). Paraconsistent Logic: Essays on the Inconsistent, München: Philosophia Verlag.</ref> Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on [[dialetheism]] — the view that some contradictions are true.<ref>See Routley, Richard and Meyer, Robert K. (1976), \"Dialectical Logic, Classical Logic and the Consistency of the World\", Studies in Soviet Thought 16: 1-25.</ref> Not long after meeting Priest, then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.<ref>Routley, Richard (1979), \"Dialectical Logic, Semantics and Metamathematics\", Erkenntnis 14: 301-331.</ref>\n\nSylvan's studies ranged over a variety of topics in [[logic]] and the [[philosophy of logic]]. He wrote important papers on [[free logic]], general [[modal logic]],<ref>\"Existence and identity in quantified modal logics,\" Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 10: 113-149 (1969)</ref> and [[natural deduction]] systems.<ref>\"A simple natural deduction system,\" Logique et Analyse 12: 129-152 (1969)</ref> However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository).\n\nFrom early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]]-inspired ontology (which he called \"noneism\"), first presented in his 1966 paper, \"Some Things Do Not Exist.\"<ref>Routley, Richard (1966): “Some Things Do Not Exist”. Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 7, 251–276.</ref> After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, ''Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond''.<ref>Routley, Richard (1982). Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond. Ridgeview Pub Co</ref> The view—also defended in recent years by Priest<ref>Priest, Graham (2005): Towards Non-Being. The Logic and Metaphysics of Intentionality. Oxford: Clarendon.</ref>—utilizes a [[modal logic|modal theory]] including \"impossible worlds\" to deal with supposed objects, like the \"round square.\" Sylvan's formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong's original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.<ref>Reicher., \"Non-Existent Objects\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/</ref><ref>Hyde, Dominic (2001), ‘Richard (Routley) Sylvan: Writings on Logic and Metaphysics’,  History and Philosophy of Logic 22: 181-205.</ref>\n\n== Environmental ethics and politics ==\n\nOutside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of [[environmental ethics]] (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by [[Arne Næss]]). In his important 1973 paper \"Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?\",<ref>Routley, Richard (1973), \"Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?\", Proceedings of the XVth World \nCongress of Philosophy, Varna, 1: 205-10. Reprinted in \"Environmental Philosophy: from Animal Rights to Radical Ecology\", (ed. M. Zimmerman et al.), Prentice Hall: New Jersey, 1993, pp.12-21.</ref> he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of [[deep ecology]], but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain.<ref>Sylvan, Richard (1985), \"A Critique of Deep Ecology\", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #12, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, 60 pages. Also in serialised form: ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part I’, Radical Philosophy 40 (1985): 2-12; and ‘A Critique of Deep Ecology, Part II’, Radical Philosophy 41 (1985): 10-22.  Reprinted in M. Redelift and G. Woodgate (eds), The Sociology of the Environment, Edward Elgar: London, 1994.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, Sylvan published several other notable articles and books on environmental ethics and issues,<ref>Beginning with: Routley, R., 1973. “Is there a need for a new, an environmental ethic?” Proceedings of the 15th World congress of Philosophy, vol. 1 pp. 205-10, Sophia: Sophia Press; and Routley, R. and Routley, V.

The Greening of Ethics, Cambridge: White Horse Press.</ref> From his work in environmental ethics, Sylvan took an interest in [[anarchism]], contributing an often-cited entry on the subject to ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy''.<ref>Sylvan, Richard (1995). \"Anarchism\". in Goodwin, Robert E. and Pettit.
