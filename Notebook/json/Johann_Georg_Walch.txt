He studied at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[University of Jena|Jena]], amongst his teachers being [[Johann Franz Buddeus|JF Buddeus]], whose only daughter he married. He published in 1716 a work, ''Historia critica [[Latin]]ae linguae'', which soon came into wide use. Two years later he became professor extraordinarius of [[philosophy]] at [[university of Jena|Jena]]. In 1719, he was appointed professor ordinarius of [[rhetoric]], in 1721 of [[poetry]], and in 1724 professor extraordinarius of [[theology]]. In 1728 he became professor ordinarius of theology, and in 1750 professor primarius.\n\nHis theological position was that of moderate [[Lutheran orthodoxy|orthodoxy]], greatly influenced by the philosophy and controversies of the [[deism|Deistic]] period. His university lectures and published works ranged over the wide fields of church history in its various branches, particularly the literature and the controversies of the church, dogmatics, ethics and pastoral theology.\n\nOf his works the most valuable were ''Bibliotheca theologica'' (1757–1765); ''Bibliotheca patristica'' (1770); his edition of [[Martin Luther|Luther]]'s works in 24 vols. (1740–1752); ''Historische und theologische Einleitung in die religiösen Streitigkeiten, welche sonderlich ausser der evangelische-lutherischen Kirche entstanden'' (5 vols., 1733 ff.); the companion work to this, ''Einleitung in die Religionsstreitigkeiten der evangel.-luth. Kirche'' (1730–1739), and ''Philosophisches Lexikon'' (1726, 4th ed. 1775).\n\nAlso important is the ''Historia logicae'', published at Leipzig in 1721.\n\nHis life, with a complete list of his writings, which amounted to 287, ''Leben und Charakter des Kirchenraths J. G. Walch'', was published anonymously by his son CWF Walch (Jena, 1777). Cf. [[Wilhelm Gass]], ''Protestantische Dogmatik'', iii. p.&nbsp;205 sq.\n\nHis sons, [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch|Johann Ernst Immanuel]] and [[Christian Wilhelm Franz Walch]] were also noted theologians.\n\nJohann Georg Walch died in [[Jena]], [[Germany]], on 13 January 1775 at 81 years of age.\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle =Walch, Johann Georg|volume=28 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Walch, Johann Georg}}\n[[Category:1693 births]]\n[[Category:1775 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century German Protestant theologians]]\n[[Category:People from Meiningen]]\n[[Category:People from Saxe-Meiningen]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Johann Georg Walch"}}}}
