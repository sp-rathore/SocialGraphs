As a celebrated [[scholastic philosopher]] and [[doctor of theology]], he is often called '''''Doctor Profundus''''', ([[medieval epithet]], meaning \"the Profound Doctor\").\n\n==Life==\nBradwardine was born in [[Sussex]] either at [[Hartfield]] or at [[Chichester]], where his family were settled, members of the smaller gentry or burghers.\n\nBradwardine was a precocious student, educated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] where he was a fellow by 1321; he took the degree of doctor of divinity, and acquired the reputation of a profound scholar, a skillful [[mathematics|mathematician]] and an able [[theology|theologian]]. He was also a gifted [[logician]] with theories on the ''[[insolubilia|insolubles]]'' and in particular the [[liar paradox]].\n\nBradwardine subsequently moved to [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a fellowship. He was afterwards raised to the high offices of chancellor of the university and professor of divinity. Bradwardine (like his contemporary [[William of Occam]]) was a culminating figure of the great intellectual movement at Oxford that had begun in the 1240s.\n\nBradwardine was an ordinary secular cleric, which gave him intellectual freedom but deprived him of the security and wherewithal that the Preaching Orders would have afforded; instead he turned to royal patronage. From being chancellor of the [[diocese of London]] as [[Dean of St Paul's]], he became chaplain and confessor to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], whom he attended during his wars in France at the [[Battle of Crécy]], where he preached at the victory Mass, and at the subsequent [[Siege of Calais (1346)|siege of Calais]]. Edward repeatedly entrusted him with diplomatic missions. On his return to England, he was successively appointed [[prebendary]] of Lincoln and [[Dean of Lincoln|dean]] (1348). In 1349 the canons of the chapter at Canterbury elected him Archbishop following the death of Archbishop John Stratford, but [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] withheld his consent, preferring his chancellor [[John de Ufford]], perhaps loth to lose his trusted confessor. After Ufford died of the [[Black Death]], 2 May, Bradwardine went to receive confirmation from Pope [[Pope Clement VI|Clement VI]] at Avignon, but on his return he died of the plague at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qaojnr_ii-0C&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=bradwardine+-wikipedia+rochester&source=bl&ots=VciLej3lLn&sig=CRs1ycSMXdtku4iivjqtRmG1sy4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X50AT8P0OseItwfPg73QBg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=bradwardine%20-wikipedia%20rochester&f=false Norman F. Cantor, ''In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made'']</ref> on 26 August 1349,<ref name=Handbook233>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 233</ref> forty days after his consecration. He was buried at Canterbury.\n\n[[Chaucer]] in [[The Nun's Priest's Tale]] (line 476) ranks Bradwardine with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]. His great theological work, to modern eyes, is a treatise against the [[Pelagians]], entitled ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum''. Bradwardine's major treatise argued that space was an infinite void in which God could have created other worlds, which he would rule as he ruled this one. The \"causes of virtue\" include the [[astrology|influences of the planets]], not as predestining a human career, but influencing a subject's essential nature. This astrophysical treatise was not published until it was edited by Sir Henry Savile and printed in London, 1618; its circulation in manuscript was very limited. The implications of the infinite void were revolutionary; to have pursued them would have threatened the singular relationship of man and this natural world to God (Cantor 2001); in it he treated theology mathematically. He wrote also ''De Geometria speculativa'' (printed at Paris, 1530); ''De Arithmetica practica'' (printed at Paris, 1502); ''De proportionibus velocitatum in motibus (1328)'' (printed at Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505); ''De Quadratura Circuli'' (Paris, 1495); and an ''Ars Memorative'', Sloane manuscripts. No. 3974 in the [[British Museum]]—earning from the Pope the title of the Profound Doctor. Another text, ''De Continuo'' is more tenuously credited to him and thought to be written sometime between 1328 and 1325.\n\n==Science==\n[[Image:Bradwardine - Geometria speculativa, 1495 - 66918.jpg |thumb|''Geometria speculativa'', 1495]]\nMerton College sheltered a group of dons devoted to natural science, mainly physics, astronomy and mathematics, rivals of the intellectuals at the [[University of Paris]]. Bradwardine was one of these [[Oxford Calculators]], studying mechanics with [[William Heytesbury]], [[Richard Swineshead]], and [[John Dumbleton]]. The Oxford Calculators distinguished [[kinematics]] from [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], emphasising kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the [[mean speed theorem]]: a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body. They also demonstrated this theorem&nbsp;— the foundation of \"The Law of Falling Bodies\"&nbsp;— long before [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who is generally credited with it.\n\nThe mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:<ref>Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968), p. 30</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}\n\nIn ''Tractatus de proportionibus'' (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] to anticipate the concept of [[exponential growth]], later developed by the [[Jakob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], with [[interest|compound interest]] as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern mathematical concept of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] writes, \"Bradwardine developed the [[Musical note|Boethian theory]] of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion\".\n\nBoyer also writes that \"the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of [[trigonometry]] gleaned from [[Islam|Muslim]] sources\". Yet \"Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science\" (Cantor 2001, p.&nbsp;122). The most essential missing tool was [[calculus]].<!--not sure this shouldn't be algebra from the Cantor reference. References, not facts, are important-->\n\n==Art of memory==\nBradwardine was also a practitioner and exponent of the [[art of memory]], a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques used to organise memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas. His ''De Memoria Artificiali'' (''c.'' 1335) discusses memory training current during his time.<ref>Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory, Cambridge, 1990, p. 130</ref><ref>Edith Wilks Dolnikowski, \"De Memoria Artificiali: Time and Memory in the Thought of Thomas Bradwardine.\" In: ''Constructions of Time in the Late Middle Ages''. Ed. Carol Poster and Richard Utz. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1997. Pp. 197–203.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nBradwardine's theories on the ''[[insolubilia|insolubles]]'' including the [[liar paradox]] were a great influence on the work of [[Jean Buridan]] and therefore in turn of the more recent philosopher [[A. N. Prior]].<ref>His work on the liar paradox has been most recently studied by Paul Spade and Stephen Read (for which see Spade's entry, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/insolubles/ Insolubles],\" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which offers a brief exposition).</ref> Bradwardine's work on kinematics was also influential to Buridan.\n\nHis ''De Causa Dei'' influenced the theology of [[John Wycliffe]] on [[grace (Christianity)|grace]] and [[predestination]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval Science, Technology and Medicine|date=27 January 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135459321|page=100|author=Thomas F.
