This paper, together with his thesis, \"showed that Ramsey cardinals were weaker than measurable cardinals, and that their existence implied the constructible real continuum was countable; he further proved that this followed also from weaker partition and two cardinal properties.\"<ref name=ASL>{{citation|contribution=In Memoriam: Frederick Rowbottom|title=Notices|url=http://www.math.ucla.edu/~asl/bsl/1602/1602-007.ps|journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic|volume=16|issue=2|year=2010|page=299|doi=10.2178/bsl/1286889129}}.</ref>  The [[large cardinal]] notion of [[Rowbottom cardinal]]s is named after him,<ref>{{citation | last = Tryba | first = Jan | issue = 3–4 | journal = Israel Journal of Mathematics | pages = 193–196 | title = A few remarks on Rowbottom cardinals | doi = 10.1007/BF02761361 | volume = 40\n | year = 1981}}.</ref> as is the notion of a Rowbottom [[ultrafilter]].<ref>{{citation | last = Feng | first = Qi | issue = 4\n | journal = Journal of Symbolic Logic | pages = 990–993 | title = On the Rowbottom ''M''-ultrafilters | jstor = 2273832 | volume = 52 | year = 1987 | doi = 10.2307/2273832 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Keith Devlin]] studied [[set theory]] under Rowbottom.
