Known for his [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] convictions, he had a major role on the reception and development of [[Modernism]] in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] and [[Art of Romania|art]]. He was married to [[Elena Vianu]], herself a literary critic, and was the father of [[Ion Vianu]], a well-known writer.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Giurgiu]] to a [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]] family<ref>Papuc; Șimonca</ref> (whose members had converted to [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodoxy]]),<ref name=\"Papuc\">Papuc</ref> he completed his primary and secondary education in the city, attending the [[Gheorghe Lazăr National College (Bucharest)|Gheorghe Lazăr High School]]. Around 1910, he began writing poetry &mdash; which he never published.\n\nIn 1915, Vianu became a student at the Department of Philosophy and Law at the [[University of Bucharest]]. During the period, Vianu began attending [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] literary circle, and, in 1916, he published a study on Macedonski and later his own verses in ''[[Flacăra]]'' magazine.\n\nUpon Romania's entry in [[World War I]], he was into the [[Romanian Army]], trained as an [[artillery]] [[cadet]] in [[Botoşani]], and took part in the [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|Moldavian campaign]]. In 1918, he returned to [[Bucharest]], where he was editor of Macedonski's ''[[Literatorul]]'', and resumed his studies, graduating in 1919. Vianu also worked on the editorial staff for [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]'s ''Ideea Europeană'' and for ''Luceafărul''. In 1921, he began his long collaboration with ''[[Viaţa Românească]]'', while he contributed to [[Eugen Lovinescu]]'s ''[[Sburătorul]]''.\n\nIn 1923, he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate in Philosophy]] at the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|Eberhard Karls University]] of [[Tübingen]], with the thesis ''Das Wertungsproblem in Schiller Poetik'' (\"The Judgment of Values in [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s Poetics\"), his first major study in [[aesthetics]] (delivered in November 1923). The work was praised by [[Lucian Blaga]], who was subsequently Vianu's colleague during their time as staff members for ''[[Gândirea]]'';<ref>Grigorescu, p.432-433</ref> the two shared an appreciation of [[Expressionism]].<ref>Grigorescu, p.382, 384, 432-433</ref> With Blaga, he stood for ''Gândirea'''s early modernist tendencies, and grew opposed to [[Nichifor Crainic]]'s intense advocacy of traditionalism (at a time when the magazine's editor, [[Cezar Petrescu]], was occupying a middle position).<ref>Livezeanu, p.125-126</ref>\n\nWith the publishing of his ''Dualismul artei'' in 1925 (followed by a long succession of collections of essays and studies), Vianu secured his place in the cultural landscape of modern Romania, and became the titular professor of aesthetics at the University of Bucharest. At around the same period, he distanced himself from ''Gândirea'' (which was becoming the mouthpiece of Crainic's [[far right]] traditionalism), and instead advocated [[Democracy|democratic government]].<ref>Ornea, p.36, 69-70, 116-117</ref>\n\nThroughout the [[interwar period]], Vianu was an adversary of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], and polemized with its press (becoming the target of attacks serialized in ''[[Cuvântul]]'').<ref>Ornea, p.163, 453-454</ref> His status as a professor was in peril during the ([[National Legionary State]] established by the Guard in 1940), and he felt the imminent danger of physical assaults.<ref>Papuc; Scurtu, p.11</ref> [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] authorities began alluding to his Jewish origins, and several violent remarks were aimed at him.<ref name=\"Papuc\"/> Following the [[Legionnaires' Rebellion and Bucharest Pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]] and the Guard's defeat, he sent a congratulatory telegram to ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]].<ref>Scurtu, p.11</ref> In 1945, after the end of [[Romania during World War II|Antonescu's regime]] and [[World War II]], he was the recipient of a letter from his friend [[Eugène Ionesco]]: the document forms a list of [[intellectual]]s whom Ionesco harshly criticized for their pro-Iron Guard activism (they include [[Nae Ionescu]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Constantin Noica]], [[Dan Botta]], [[Mircea Vulcănescu]], [[Horia Stamatu]], [[Paul Sterian]], [[Mihail Polihroniade]], [[Haig Acterian]], [[Dumitru Cristian Amzăr]], [[Costin Deleanu]] and [[Paul Deleanu]]).<ref>Ornea, p.30-31, 184-185, 197-198, 202</ref>\n\nIn charge of [[National Theatre Bucharest|Romania's National Theater]] in 1945, ambassador to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1946, Vianu was an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]] starting in 1955. He made several concessions to the new [[Communist Romania|Communist authorities]], which [[Ion Vianu]] has described as \"purely formal\"<ref>Șimonca</ref> (an assessment shared by [[Ion Papuc]], who argued that Vianu joined the [[Romanian Communist Party]] \"for lack of a way out\").<ref name=\"Papuc\"/> He gave active support to literary figures who, as former members of the Iron Guard, faced imprisonment &mdash; Vianu was a defense witness in the trial of [[Traian Herseni]], and, with [[Mihai Ralea]], the author of an appeal for the release of [[Petre Ţuţea]].<ref name=\"Papuc\"/>\n\nDuring his late years, he translated several of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works into [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. In the beginning of summer 1964, he completed ''Arghezi, poet al omului'' (\"[[Tudor Arghezi|Arghezi]], Poet of Mankind\"), carrying the subtitle ''Cântare Omului'' (\"A Chant to Mankind\"), a work in the field of comparative literature. It began printing on the very day of its author's death, which was due to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].\n\n==Philosophy==\nVianu's investigations into [[cultural history]], coupled with his vivid interest in the [[sociology of culture]], allowed him to develop an influential philosophy, which attributed culture a seminal role in shaping human destiny.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pop</ref> According to his views, culture, which had liberated humans from natural imperatives, was an asset that [[intellectual]]s were required to preserve by intervening in social life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn his analysis of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[19th-century philosophy]], Vianu celebrated [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] for having unified the competing trends of [[Universality (philosophy)|universalist]] [[Rationalism]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] [[Historicism]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> A sizable part of his analysis was focused on the modern crisis of values, which he attributed to the inability of values to impose themselves on all individuals, and which he evidenced in the ideas of philosophers as diverse as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Selected works==\n* ''Dualismul artei'' (\"The Dualism of Art\") - 1925;\n* ''Fragmente moderne'' (\"Modernist Pieces\") - 1925;\n* ''Poezia lui Eminescu'' (\"The Poetry of [[Mihai Eminescu|Eminescu]]\") - 1930;\n* ''Arta și Frumosul'' (\"Art and Beauty\") -1932;\n* ''Idealul clasic al omului'' (\"The Classic Idea of Man\") -1934;\n* ''Estetica'' (\"Aesthetics\"), a work in two volumes - 1934-1936;\n* ''Filosofie și poezie'' (\"Philosophy and Poetry\") - 1937;\n* ''Istorism și naționalism'' (\"Historicism and [[Nationalism]]\") - 1938;\n* ''Introducere in teoria valorilor'' (\"Introduction to the Theory of Values\") - 1942;\n* ''Istoria literaturii române moderne'' (\"The History of Modern Romanian Literature\"), in collaboration with [[Şerban Cioculescu]] and [[Vladimir Streinu]] - 1944;\n* ''Filosofia Culturii'' (''Philosophy of Culture'') - 1945;\n* ''Dicționar de maxime (comentat)'' (\"Dictionary of Maxims (Annotated)\") - 1962.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dan Grigorescu, ''Istoria unei generații pierdute: expresioniștii'', Bucharest, Editura Eminescu, 1980\n* Pompiliu Marcea, \"Tabel cronologic\" in Tudor Vianu, ''Scriitori români'', Bucharest, Editura Minerva, 1970\n* Z.
