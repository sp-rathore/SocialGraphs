He assisted in the formation of the Henry George School in New York City and conducted public seminars there on community organization in the early 1930s.<ref name=Lowi/> School Director [[Frank Chodorov]] later fired him for straying from the Georgist line.<ref name=SHM-looking/>  Heath had rejected the Georgist antipathy toward landlords and had come to believe that society only could outgrow its subservience to the state through a particular use of land. In 1936, he self-published his views in a monograph entitled \"Politics versus Proprietorship.\" It was the first statement of the proprietary community principle.<ref name=SHM-liberty/> In 1952, ''[[The Freeman]]'' published Heath’s polemic “Progress and Poverty Reviewed”, a critique of Henry George's tax argument.<ref name=Lowi/>\n\nHeath completed his major work, ''Citadel, Market and Altar'', in 1946, publishing it through his Science of Society Foundation, Inc. in 1957.  In a review of the book [[Manas journal]] wrote: <blockquote> Mr. Heath returns to the socio-economic relationships of pre-Norman England for the foundation of an ideal society which will combine freedom and justice. This is a serious book with carefully worked-out plans and precise definitions. Mr. Heath's notion of ownership is very like Gandhi's conception of the stewardship of wealth: “In its Anglo-Saxon meaning, now only dimly realized, to own was to owe. Ownership was inclusive of others, not exclusive. What was owned, chiefly land, was held in trust, as it were.”<ref>[http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeX_1957/X-40.pdf Changing Allegiances], Manas Journal, Vol. X, No. 43, October 23, 1957.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeath wrote:<blockquote> To obviate the essential tyranny (coercion) of political administration the proprietary authority, suitably organized, must extend its jurisdiction, and thus its revenues, by itself supplying police and other community services without coercion, out of its own revenues and properties, and thus raise its own values and voluntary incomes.<ref name=Foldvary/></blockquote>\n\nThe model for Heathian [[anarchism]] is proprietary communities, multi-tenant properties such as hotels, shopping centers, industrial parks, and apartment buildings. Multi-tenant properties are the opposite of traditional real-estate developments; the developers would lease the homes rather than sell them, and thus be responsible for providing community services to maintain rental income and land value.<ref name=Foldvary/><ref name=Lowi/>\n\n==Influence==\nMurray Rothbard based much of his criticism of Henry George on Spencer Heath’s writings. These in turn have influenced many libertarians.<ref name=Foldvary/> He also mentioned Heath’s views on community a number of times in his book ''[[Man, Economy and State]]''.<ref>Murray Rothbard, ''Man, Economy, and State'' Scholars Edition, Mises Institute, Auburn, AL, 2004, pp. 565, 660, 670, 891, 936, 1131, 1203, 1204, 1207-08, 1281.</ref>\n\nHeath's system has been the model for [[intentional community]] and \"new country\" projects such as Werner K.

They point out that private single-family housing is historically quite new, and see an evolutionary trend toward the leasehold type of ownership. The term \"multi-tenant income property\" and the very existence of shopping malls is a phenomenon of the last 50 years. Heathians generally believe that the multi-tenant property approach will, over time, evolve to take over traditional public services such as water, sewer, and street maintenance from municipal governments. They see the Heathian landlord as protecting the individual from two different sources of aggression: criminals and governments. Land-holding firms would compete on how well they can protect their tenants from crime and taxation, a distinct improvement over monopoly government. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nHeath's system differs from the standard anarcho-capitalist [[private defense agency]] (PDA) model. Heath himself eschewed the term, and did not refer to himself as an anarchist. The PDA model envisions competing security agencies in the same geographical area rather than a proprietary zone. Citing Spencer MacCallum, economist Edward Stringham discusses how a system composed of many proprietary communities would encourage landlords to provide police in a way that their tenants value most, even if there were one provider of law in a given area. Stringham contrasts that vision with one that focuses on having multiple law enforcement agencies.<ref>Stringham, E.P.
