He is currently Research Professor at the [[University of Reading]] and Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Texas at Austin]].\n\n==Career==\nDancy was educated at [[Winchester College]], where he was [[Head Boy]] and played cricket for the school, and [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], where he obtained a double first in classics (1965-7:Classical Honour Moderations:  First Class Honours; 1967-9:   Literae Humaniores:  First Class Honours, BA).<ref name=CV>{{cite web | url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/files/4071124 | title=Jonathan Dancy | accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> \n\nAfter graduating he served as a lecturer at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] for a year. In 1971 he became a lecturer at [[Keele University]], becoming professor there in 1991.<ref name=CV/> \n\nAfter being mentioned by his daughter-in-law, American actress [[Claire Danes]], during an appearance on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', Dancy appeared as a guest on the program on 1 April 2010.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VthiiIhN3wg</ref>\n\nHe was elected a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] in 2016.<ref>http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/british-academy-announces-new-president-and-elects-66-new-fellows</ref>\n\n==Philosophical Work==\n\nAfter having worked on problems of [[epistemology]], and more particularly on the nature of perception ([[argument from illusion]]), he emerged as the leading proponent in ethics of [[moral particularism]], the idea that all moral reasons are particular and context-sensitive, rather than general. He also defends what he calls the [[holism]] of reasons, namely the idea that a consideration that is a reason for acting in a certain way in one case may not be a reason for acting in that way, or even a reason for not acting in that way, in other cases. In this sense, reasons are context-dependent. Dancy argues that the holism of reasons provides a major support for the main claim of his particularism, i.e., that there are no moral ''principles'' but that ''morality'' can get on perfectly well without them. Dancy edited some of [[George Berkeley]] writings<ref name=Parigi>Silvia Parigi. [http://people.hsc.edu/berkeleystudies/berkbib.php Berkeley Bibliography (1979-2010)]</ref> and dedicated a book to the [[Anglo-Irish]] thinker.<ref name=Parigi />\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1973 he married Sarah Birley; they have three children the actor [[Hugh Dancy]], husband of actress [[Claire Danes]]; Jack Dancy who runs a travel company and Kate Redman<ref>https://www.twitter.com/rougewoman</ref> who works for UNESCO.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Articles===\n* \"On Moral Properties\", ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', 1981, XC, pp.&nbsp;367–385.\n*“Ethical Particularism and Morally Relevant Properties.”  ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', n.s.; 92, 368 (Oct., 1983): 530 – 547.\n*“The Role of Imaginary Cases in Ethics.”  ''Pacific Philosophical Quarterly'', 66 (1985): 141 – 153.\n* “An Ethic of Prima Facie Duties.”  In ''A Companion to Ethics'', ed.
