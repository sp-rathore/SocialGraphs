He was a student of [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] and a member of the [[Lwów–Warsaw School of Logic]]. Upon his death his name was added to the Genius Wall of Fame. He was the President (rector) of the [[Nicolaus Copernicus University]] in [[Toruń]].\n\nJaśkowski is considered to be one of the founders of [[natural deduction]], which he discovered independently of [[Gerhard Gentzen]] in the 1930s.  (Gentzen's approach initially became more popular with logicians because it could be used to prove the [[cut-elimination theorem]]. But Jaśkowski's is closer to the way that proofs are done in practice.)  He was also one of the first, if not ''the'' first, to propose a formal calculus of [[paraconsistent logic|inconsistency-tolerant (or paraconsistent) logic]]. Furthermore, Jaśkowski was a pioneer in the investigation of both [[intuitionistic logic]] and [[free logic]].\n\n==Works==\n\n* [http://www.logik.ch/daten/jaskowski.pdf ''On the Rules of Suppositions in Formal Logic''] Studia Logica 1, 1934 pp.&nbsp;5–32 (reprinted in: Storrs McCall (ed.), ''Polish logic 1920-1939'', Oxford University Press, 1967 pp.&nbsp;232–258\n* ''Investigations into the System of Intuitionist Logic'' 1936 (translated in: Storrs McCall (ed.), ''Polish logic 1920-1939'', Oxford University Press, 1967 pp.&nbsp;259–263 \n* ''A propositional Calculus for Inconsistent Deductive Systems'' 1948 (reprinted in: Studia Logica, 24 1969, pp 143–157 and in: Logic and Logical Philosophy 7, 1999 pp.&nbsp;35–56)\n* ''On the Discussive Conjunction in the Propositional Calculus for Inconsistent Deductive Systems'' 1949 (reprinted in: Logic and Logical Philosophy 7, 1999 pp.&nbsp;57–59)\n* ''On Formulas in which no Individual Variable occurs more than Twice'', Journal of Symbolic Logic, 31, 1966, pp.&nbsp;1–6)\n\n; in Polish:\n* ''O symetrii w zdobnictwie i przyrodzie - matematyczna teoria ornamentów'' (English title: ''On Symmetry in Art and Nature''), PWS, Warszawa, 1952 (book 168 pages)\n* ''Matematyczna teoria ornamentów'' (English title: ''Mathematical Theory of Ornaments''), PWN, Warszawa, 1957 (book 100 pages)\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | author=Jerzy Perzanowski | authorlink= | title=Fifty Years of Parainconsistent Logics | journal=Logic and Logical Philosophy | year=1999 | volume=7 | pages=21&ndash;24 | url=http://www.logika.uni.torun.pl/llp/07/50l.pdf }}\n* {{cite web | author=Woleński, Jan| year=2003| title=Lvov-Warsaw School | work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2003 Edition) | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2003/entries/lvov-warsaw/ | accessdate=2006-03-11}}\n* Jerzy Kotas, August Pieczkowski.
