In addition to his other siblings, Dietrich had a twin sister, [[Bonhoeffer family|Sabine Bonhoeffer Leibholz]]:  he and Sabine were the sixth and seventh children out of eight. His father was [[psychiatrist]] and [[neurologist]] Karl Bonhoeffer. His mother Paula Bonhoeffer, née von Hase, was a teacher and the granddaughter of Protestant theologian [[Karl Hase|Karl von Hase]] and painter Stanislaus Kalckreuth. His oldest brother [[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] became a chemist, and, along with [[Paul Harteck]], discovered the [[spin isomers of hydrogen]] in 1929. Walter Bonhoeffer, the second born of the Bonhoeffer family, was killed in action during [[World War I]], when the twins were 12. The third Bonhoeffer child, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer|Klaus]], was involved in the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]], along with Dietrich; he, too, was executed by the Nazis. Both of Bonhoeffer's older sisters, [[Bonhoeffer family|Ursula Bonhoeffer Schleicher and Christel Bonhoeffer von Dohnanyi]], married men who were eventually executed by the Nazis. Christel was imprisoned by the Nazis but survived. Sabine and their youngest sister Susanne Bonhoeffer Dress each married men who survived Nazism. His cousin [[Karl-Günther von Hase]] was the [[German Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] from 1970 to 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nBonhoeffer completed his ''[[Staatsexamen]]'', the equivalent of both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the University. He went on to complete his Doctor of Theology degree (Dr. theol.) from [Berlin University] in 1927, graduating '[[summa cum laude]]'.\n\n===Studies in America===\nStill too young to be ordained, the 24-year-old Bonhoeffer went to the United States in 1930 for [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] study and a teaching fellowship at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]. Although Bonhoeffer found the American seminary not up to his exacting German standards (\"There is no theology here.\"),<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\">David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p 45</ref> he had life-changing experiences and friendships. He studied under [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and met Frank Fisher, a black fellow seminarian who introduced him to [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]], where Bonhoeffer taught Sunday school and formed a lifelong love for African-American [[Spiritual (music)|spirituals]], a collection of which he took back to Germany. He heard [[Adam Clayton Powell, Sr.]], preach the Gospel of Social Justice and became sensitive to not only social injustices experienced by minorities but also the ineptitude of the church to bring about integration.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html |work=PBS|title=Bonhoeffer Timeline}}</ref> Bonhoeffer began to see things \"from below\"—from the perspective of those who suffer oppression. He observed, \"Here one can truly speak and hear about sin and grace and the love of God...the Black Christ is preached with rapturous passion and vision.\" Later Bonhoeffer referred to his impressions abroad as the point at which he \"turned from phraseology to reality.\"<ref name=\"David Ford p 45\"/> He also learned to drive an automobile, although he failed the driving test three times.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Galli, Mark and Barbara | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/1991/issue32/3202.html |title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Did You Know?| journal=Christian History| issue =32| date=1991}}</ref> He traveled by car through the United States to Mexico, where he had been invited to speak on the subject of peace.

Deeply interested in ecumenism, he was appointed by the World Alliance for Promoting International Friendship through the Churches (a forerunner of the [[World Council of Churches]]) as one of its three European youth secretaries. At this time he seems to have undergone something of a personal conversion from being a theologian primarily attracted to the intellectual side of Christianity to being a dedicated man of faith, resolved to carry out the teaching of Christ as he found it revealed in the Gospels.<ref name = \"Michael Balfour p216\">Michael Balfour, ''Withstanding Hitler'', p 216</ref> On 15 November 1931—at the age of 25—he was ordained at the [[Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union|Old-Prussian United]] St. Matthew's Church ({{lang-de|[[:de:St. Matthäuskirche (Berlin-Tiergarten)|St. Matthäuskirche]]}}) in Berlin.\n\n=== Confessing Church ===\n[[File:Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Skulptur an der Hauptkirche Sankt Petri (Hamburg).JPG|thumb|Memorial of Dietrich Bonhoeffer in front of [[St. Peter's Church, Hamburg|St. Peter's Church]], Hamburg]]Bonhoeffer's promising academic and ecclesiastical career was dramatically altered with Nazi ascension to power on 30 January 1933. He was a determined opponent of the regime from its first days. Two days after Hitler was installed as Chancellor, Bonhoeffer delivered a radio address in which he attacked Hitler and warned Germany against slipping into an idolatrous cult of the ''Führer'' (leader), who could very well turn out to be ''Verführer'' (mis-leader, or seducer). He was cut off the air in the middle of a sentence, though it is unclear whether the newly elected Nazi regime was responsible.<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', pp 259–60</ref> In April 1933, Bonhoeffer raised the first voice for church resistance to Hitler's persecution of Jews, declaring that the church must not simply \"bandage the victims under the wheel, but jam the spoke in the wheel itself.\"<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p 38</ref> In retrospect, his famous speech can be seen as anti-semitic, and playing into the hands of the Nazi regime. He ascribed the suffering of the Jews to God's righteous punishment for the [[Jewish deicide|killing of Jesus]]. He used the anti-semitic terminology \"[[Jewish problem]]\", and accepted the authority of the state to deal with the \"problem\" as it saw fit.<ref>Robert P. Ericksen. (2012).

This election was marked by a struggle within the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church between the nationalistic [[German Christian]] (Deutsche Christen) movement and Young Reformers—a struggle which threatened to explode into [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. In July 1933, Hitler unconstitutionally imposed new church elections. Bonhoeffer put all his efforts into the election, campaigning for the selection of independent, non-Nazi officials.\n\nDespite Bonhoeffer's efforts, in the rigged July election an overwhelming majority of key church positions went to Nazi-supported Deutsche Christen people.<ref>Elizabeth Raum, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer'', p 72</ref> The Deutsche Christen won a majority in the general synod of the Old-Prussian Union Evangelical Church and all its provincial synods except [[Evangelical Church of Westphalia|Westphalia]], and in synods of all other Protestant church bodies, except for the Lutheran churches of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Hanover]], and [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg|Württemberg]]. The non-Nazi opposition regarded these bodies as uncorrupted \"intact churches\", as opposed to the other so-called \"destroyed churches.\"\n\nIn opposition to Nazification, Bonhoeffer urged an interdict upon all pastoral services (baptisms, weddings, funerals, etc.), but [[Karl Barth]] and others advised against such a radical proposal.<ref>{{Citation |date=June 2007 | contribution-url = http://faith-theology.blogspot.com/2007/06/ten-theses-on-dietrich-bonhoeffer.html | title = Faith and Theology | contribution = Ten theses on Dietrich Bonhoeffer | publisher = [[Blogspot]]}}.</ref> In August 1933, Bonhoeffer and [[Hermann Sasse]] were deputized by opposition church leaders to draft the Bethel Confession,<ref>http://www.lutheranwiki.org/Bethel_Confession</ref> a new statement of faith in opposition to the Deutsche Christen movement. Notable for affirming God's faithfulness to Jews as His chosen people, the Bethel Confession was so watered down to make it more palatable that Bonhoeffer ultimately refused to sign it.<ref>David Ford, ''The Modern Theologians'', p 47</ref>\n\nIn September 1933, the national church synod at [[Wittenberg]] voluntarily passed a resolution to apply the [[Aryan paragraph]] within the church, meaning that pastors and church officials of Jewish descent were to be removed from their posts. Regarding this as an affront to the principle of [[baptism]], [[Martin Niemöller]] founded the ''[[Pfarrernotbund]]'' (Pastors' Emergency League). In November, a rally of 20,000 Deutsche Christens demanded the removal of the [[Old Testament]] from the Bible, which was seen by many as [[heresy]], further swelling the ranks of the Emergency League.<ref>Robert P.

He sharply rebuked Bonhoeffer, saying, \"I can only reply to all the reasons and excuses which you put forward: 'And what of the German Church?'\" Barth accused Bonhoeffer of abandoning his post and wasting his \"splendid theological armory\" while \"the house of your church is on fire\" and chided him to return to Berlin \"by the next ship.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works: London 1933–1935'', p 40</ref>\n\nBonhoeffer however did not go to England simply to avoid trouble at home, but he had hoped to put the ecumenical movement to work in the interest of the Confessing Church. He continued his involvement with the Confessing Church, running up a high telephone bill to maintain his contact with Martin Niemöller. In international gatherings, Bonhoeffer rallied people to oppose the Deutsche Christen movement and its attempt to amalgamate Nazi nationalism with the Christian gospel. When Bishop {{ill|de|Theodor Heckel}}—the official in charge of German Lutheran Church foreign affairs—traveled to London to warn Bonhoeffer to abstain from any ecumenical activity not directly authorized by Berlin, Bonhoeffer refused to abstain.<ref name = \"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p 19\">Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom'', ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p 19</ref>\n\n===Underground seminaries===\nIn 1935, Bonhoeffer was presented with a much-sought-after opportunity to study non-violent resistance under [[Gandhi]] in his [[ashram]], but, perhaps remembering Barth's rebuke, decided to return to Germany in order to head an underground seminary for training Confessing Church pastors in [[Szczecin-Zdroje|Finkenwalde]]. As the Nazi suppression of the Confessing Church intensified, Barth was driven back to [[Switzerland]] in 1935; Niemöller was arrested in July 1937; and in August 1936, Bonhoeffer's authorization to teach at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] was revoked after he was denounced as a \"[[pacifist]] and enemy of the state\" by Theodor Heckel.\n\nBonhoeffer's efforts for the underground seminaries included securing necessary funds, and he found a great benefactor in Ruth von Kleist-Retzow. In times of trouble, Bonhoeffer's former students and their wives would take refuge in von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate, and Bonhoeffer was a frequent guest. Later he fell in love with Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter Maria von Wedemeyer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/februaryweb-only/33.0a.html|title=Bonhoeffer in Love|author=Wendy Murray Zoba|work=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref> to whom he became engaged three months before his arrest. By August 1937, [[Himmler]] decreed the education and examination of Confessing Church ministry candidates illegal. In September 1937, the [[Gestapo]] closed the seminary at Finkenwalde and by November arrested 27 pastors and former students. It was around this time that Bonhoeffer published his best-known book, ''[[The Cost of Discipleship]]'', a study on the [[Sermon on the Mount]], in which he not only attacked \"cheap grace\" as a cover for ethical laxity but also preached \"costly grace\".\n\nBonhoeffer spent the next two years secretly traveling from one eastern German village to another to conduct \"seminary on the run\" supervision of his students, most of whom were working illegally in small parishes within the old-Prussian [[Ecclesiastical Province of Pomerania]]. The [[von Blumenthal]] family hosted the seminary in its estate of [[Słonowice, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Groß Schlönwitz]]. The pastors of Groß Schlönwitz and neighbouring villages supported the education by employing and housing the students (among whom was Eberhard Bethge, who later edited Bonhoeffer's \"Letters and Papers from Prison\") as vicars in their congregations.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\">''Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Pfarrer, Berlin-Charlottenburg 9, Marienburger Allee 43: Begleitheft zur Ausstellung'', corr. a. ext. ed., Kuratorium Bonhoeffer Haus (ed.), Berlin: Erinnerungs- und Begegnungsstätte Bonhoeffer Haus, ²1996, p 51.

In summer 1939, the seminary was able to move to Sigurdshof, an outlying estate ([[Folwark|Vorwerk]]) of the [[von Kleist]] family in [[Tychowo, Sławno County|Wendish Tychow]]. In March 1940, the Gestapo shut down the seminary there following the outbreak of World War II.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer 1996, p 51\"/> Bonhoeffer's monastic communal life and teaching at Finkenwalde seminary formed the basis of his books, ''The Cost of Discipleship'' and ''Life Together''.\n\nBonhoeffer's sister Sabine, along with her Jewish-classified husband Gerhard Leibholz and their two daughters, escaped to England by way of Switzerland in September 1940.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.pbs.org/bonhoeffer/timeline.html | publisher = PBS | title = Bonhoeffer | contribution = Timeline}}.</ref>\n\n===Return to the United States===\nIn February 1938, Bonhoeffer made an initial contact with members of the [[German Resistance]] when his brother-in-law [[Hans von Dohnányi]] introduced him to a group seeking Hitler's overthrow at [[Abwehr]], German military intelligence.\n\nBonhoeffer also learned from Dohnányi that war was imminent and was particularly troubled by the prospect of being conscripted. As a committed pacifist opposed to the Nazi regime, he could never swear an oath to Hitler and fight in his army. Not to do so was potentially a capital offense. He worried also about consequences his refusing military service could have for the Confessing Church, as it was a move that would be frowned upon by most Christians and their churches at the time.<ref name=\"Dietrich Bonhoeffer p 19\" />\n\nIt was at this juncture that Bonhoeffer left for the United States in June 1939 at the invitation of Union Theological Seminary in New York. Amid much inner turmoil, he soon regretted his decision despite strong pressures from his friends to stay in the United States. He wrote to [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]: \"I have come to the conclusion that I made a mistake in coming to America. I must live through this difficult period in our national history with the people of Germany. I will have no right to participate in the reconstruction of Christian life in Germany after the war if I do not share the trials of this time with my people... Christians in Germany will have to face the terrible alternative of either willing the defeat of their nation in order that [[Christian civilization]] may survive or willing the victory of their nation and thereby destroying civilization. I know which of these alternatives I must choose but I cannot make that choice from security.\"<ref>Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: Eine Biographie'', p 736</ref> He returned to Germany on the last scheduled [[Steamboat|steamer]] to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom'', ed. Geffrey B. Kelly, p 35</ref>\n\n===Abwehr agent===\n[[File:Bonhoeffer-Haus Studienzimmer.jpg|thumb|Dietrich Bonhoeffer's study]]\nBack in Germany, Bonhoeffer was further harassed by the Nazi authorities as he was forbidden to speak in public and was required to regularly report his activities to the police. In 1941, he was forbidden to print or to publish. In the meantime, Bonhoeffer joined the Abwehr (a German military intelligence organization). Dohnányi, already part of the Abwehr, brought him into the organization on the claim his wide ecumenical contacts would be of use to Germany, thus protecting him from conscription to active service.<ref name=nyrb/> Bonhoeffer presumably knew about [[Operation Spark (1940)|various 1943 plots]] against Hitler through Dohnányi, who was actively involved in the planning.<ref name=nyrb>{{cite news|title=The Tragedy of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohnányi|url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/oct/25/tragedy-dietrich-bonhoeffer-and-hans-von-dohnanyi/ | accessdate =12 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Review of Books|date=25 October 2012| first1 =Elisabeth | last1 = Sifton| first2=Fritz | last2 = Stern}}</ref> In the face of Nazi atrocities, the full scale of which Bonhoeffer learned through the Abwehr, he concluded that \"the ultimate question for a responsible man to ask is not how he is to extricate himself heroically from the affair, but how the coming generation shall continue to live.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' p 7. N.Y. 1997, Touchstone.</ref> He did not justify his action but accepted that he was taking guilt upon himself as he wrote \"when a man takes guilt upon himself in responsibility, he imputes his guilt to himself and no one else. He answers for it... Before other men he is justified by dire necessity; before himself he is acquitted by his conscience, but before God he hopes only for grace.\"<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'', p 244</ref> (In a 1932 sermon, Bonhoeffer said: \"the blood of martyrs might once again be demanded, but this blood, if we really have the courage and loyalty to shed it, will not be innocent, shining like that of the first witnesses for the faith. On our blood lies heavy guilt, the guilt of the unprofitable servant who is cast into outer darkness.\"<ref>Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', 1975, p 155</ref>)\n\nUnder cover of the Abwehr, Bonhoeffer served as a courier for the German resistance movement to reveal its existence and intentions to the allies in hope of garnering their support, and, through his ecumenical contacts abroad, to secure possible peace terms with the Allies for a post-Hitler government. His visits to Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland were camouflaged as legitimate intelligence activities for the Abwehr. In May 1942, he met Anglican [[Bishop George Bell]] of Chichester, a member of the [[House of Lords]] and an ally of the Confessing Church, contacted by Bonhoeffer's exiled brother-in-law Leibholz; through him feelers were sent to British foreign minister [[Sir Anthony Eden|Anthony Eden]]. However, the British government ignored these, as it had all other approaches from the German resistance.<ref>Slack, \"George Bell\", SCM, 1971, pp 93–94</ref> Dohnányi and Bonhoeffer were also involved in Abwehr operations to help German Jews escape to Switzerland. During this time Bonhoeffer worked on ''[[Ethics (Bonhoeffer)|Ethics]]'' and wrote letters to keep up the spirits of his former students. He intended ''Ethics'' as his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', but it remained unfinished when he was arrested. On 5 April 1943, Bonhoeffer and Dohnányi were arrested and imprisoned.\n\n=== Engagement ===\nOn 13 January 1943, Bonhoeffer became engaged to Maria von Wedemeyer, the granddaughter of his close friend and Finkenwalde seminary supporter, Ruth von Kleist Retzow. Ruth had campaigned for this marriage for several years, although up until late October 1942, Bonhoeffer remained a reluctant suitor despite Ruth being part of his innermost circle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Doubled Life of Dietrich Bonhoeffer|last=Reynolds|first=Diane|publisher=Wipf & Stock|year=2016|isbn=9781498206563|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=289|via=}}</ref> A large age gap loomed between Bonhoeffer and Maria: he was 36 to her 18. The two also spent almost no time alone together prior to the engagement and did not see each other between becoming engaged and Bonhoeffer's 5 April arrest. Once he was in prison, however, Maria's status as fiancee became invaluable, as it meant she could visit Bonhoeffer  and correspond with him.

There he continued his work in religious outreach among his fellow prisoners and guards. Sympathetic guards helped smuggle his letters out of prison to [[Eberhard Bethge]] and others, and these uncensored letters were posthumously published in ''Letters and Papers from Prison''. One of those guards, a Corporal named Knobloch, even offered to help him escape from the prison and \"disappear\" with him, and plans were made for that end. But Bonhoeffer declined it fearing Nazi retribution on his family, especially his brother Klaus and brother-in-law Hans von Dohnányi who were also imprisoned.<ref>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, ''A Testament to Freedom'', ed.

He was transferred from the military prison Tegel in Berlin, where he had been held for 18 months, to the detention cellar of the house prison of the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt|Reich Security Head Office]], the Gestapo's high-security prison. In February 1945, he was secretly moved to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], and finally to [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].\n\nOn 4 April 1945, the diaries of [[Admiral]] [[Wilhelm Canaris]], head of the Abwehr, were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that the Abwehr conspirators be destroyed.<ref name=PlottingHitler>{{cite book|year=1994|author=[[Joachim Fest]]|isbn=0-297-81774-4|title=[[Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933-1945]]|publisher=Weidenfield & Nicholson}}</ref> Bonhoeffer was led away just as he concluded his final Sunday service and asked an English prisoner [[Sigismund Payne Best|Payne Best]] to remember him to Bishop George Bell of Chichester if he should ever reach his home: \"This is the end—for me the beginning of life.\"<ref name=\"Eberhard Bethge p 927\">Eberhard Bethge, ''Dietrich Bonhoeffer: A Biography'', p 927</ref>\n\n===Execution===\nBonhoeffer was condemned to death on 8 April 1945 by SS judge [[Otto Thorbeck]] at a [[drumhead court-martial]] without witnesses, records of proceedings or a defense in [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]].<ref name=GermanResistance>{{cite book|year=1996|author=Peter Hoffman|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=The History of the German Resistance, 1933–1945|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}</ref> He was executed there by [[hanging]] at dawn on 9 April 1945, just two weeks before soldiers from the United States [[90th Infantry Division (United States)|90th]] and [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Infantry Divisions]] liberated the camp,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.97thdivision.com/flossenberg4.html|title=Flossenberg|work=97thdivision.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.97thid.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?show&flos&line=Flossenburg+Concentration+Camp&f=97thid/flossenburg&dpt=9&id=12817776922&cr=1|title= Memories of the chaplain to the US 97th Infantry Division at the online Museum of the division in WWII|date= 29 May 2011}}</ref> three weeks before the Soviet capture of [[Berlin]] and a month before the [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of Nazi Germany.\n\nBonhoeffer was stripped of his clothing and led naked into the execution yard, where he was hanged, along with fellow conspirators Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], Canaris's deputy General [[Hans Oster]], military jurist General [[Karl Sack]], General [[Friedrich von Rabenau]],<ref>http://canaris.fotopic.net/p47817740.html</ref> businessman [[Theodor Strünck]], and German resistance fighter [[Ludwig Gehre]]. Bonhoeffer's brother, [[Klaus Bonhoeffer]], and his brother-in-law [[Rüdiger Schleicher]] were executed in Berlin on the night of 22–23 April as Soviet troops were already fighting in the capital. His brother-in-law Hans von Dohnányi had been executed in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] on 8 or 9 April.\n\n[[Eberhard Bethge]], a student and friend of Bonhoeffer's, writes of a man who saw the execution: \"I saw Pastor Bonhoeffer... kneeling on the floor praying fervently to God. I was most deeply moved by the way this lovable man prayed, so devout and so certain that God heard his prayer. At the place of execution, he again said a short prayer and then climbed the few steps to the gallows, brave and composed. His death ensued after a few seconds. In the almost fifty years that I worked as a doctor, I have hardly ever seen a man die so entirely submissive to the will of God.\"<ref name=\"Eberhard Bethge p 927\"/>\n\nSuch is the traditional account of Bonhoeffer's death. Over the decades it achieved almost the status of an epitaph; for instance, Eric Metaxas's best-selling biography quotes it without comment.<ref>{{cite book|year=2010|author=Eric Metaxas|isbn=978-1595551382|title=Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy|publisher=Thomas Nelson}}</ref> But many recent biographers see problems with the story, not due to Bethge but his source. The purported witness was a doctor at Flossenbürg concentration camp, Hermann Fischer-Hüllstrung<ref>;little seems to be known about this doctor. A secondary work in German says Fischer-Hüllstrung was tried for killing prisoners by a variety of means and acquitted, but retried later and sentenced to three years in prison.

J.L.F. Mogensen, a former prisoner at Flossenbürg, cited the length of time it took for the execution to be completed (almost six hours), plus departures from ordinary camp procedure that hardly would have been allowed the prisoners so late in the war, as jarring inconsistencies. Considering that the sentences had been confirmed at the highest levels of Nazi government, by individuals with a pattern of torturing prisoners who dared to challenge the regime, it is more likely that \"the physical details of Bonhoeffer's death may have been much more difficult than we earlier had imagined.\"<ref>{{cite book|year=2004|author=Craig J.

One terms the Fischer-Hüllstrung story as \"unfortunately a lie,\" citing additional factual inconsistencies (the doctor described Bonhoeffer climbing the steps to the noose, but at Flossenbürg the gallows had none), and observing that \"Fischer-Hüllstrung had the job of reviving political prisoners after they had been hanged until they were almost dead, in order to prolong the agony of their dying.\"<ref>{{cite book|year=2010|author=Ferdinand Schlingensiepen|isbn=0-7735-1531-3|title=Dietrich Bonhoeffer, 1906–1945: Martyr, Thinker, Man of Resistance|publisher=Continuum/T & T Clark}}</ref> Another charges that Fischer-Hüllstrung's \"subsequent statement about Bonhoeffer as kneeling in wordy prayer . . . belongs to the realm of legend.\"<ref>Kaiser p 311.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Westminster Abbey C20th martyrs.jpg|thumb|Gallery of 20th Century Martyrs at [[Westminster Abbey]].

A replacement church was built in 1958 and named ''Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Kirche'' in his honor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Homan|first=Roger|title=The Victorian Churches of Kent|year=1984|publisher=Phillimore & Co.|location=Chichester|isbn=0-85033-466-7|page=59}}</ref>\n\n===Theological legacy===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Breckwoldt-prüfung.JPG|thumbnail|left|Sculpture by Edith Breckwoldt, ''The ordeal. No man in the whole world can change the truth. One can only look for the truth, find it and serve it. The truth is in all places. ''  citation by Dietrich Bonhoeffer]]\n\nOvershadowed by the dramatic events of his life, Bonhoeffer's theology has nevertheless been influential. His theology has a fragmentary, unsystematic nature, due at least in part to his untimely death, and is subject to diverse and contradictory interpretations, sometimes necessarily based on speculation and projection. So, for example, while his [[Christocentric]] approach appeals to conservative, confession-minded Protestants, his commitment to justice and ideas about \"religionless Christianity\" are emphasized by liberal Protestants, though some of their interpretations have been challenged by [[John G. Stackhouse]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Stackhouse|first=John|year=2011|title=Making the Best of it: Following Christ in the Real World}}</ref>\n\nCentral to Bonhoeffer's theology is Christ, in whom God and the world are reconciled. Bonhoeffer's God is a suffering God, whose manifestation is found in this-worldliness. Bonhoeffer believed that the [[Incarnation]] of God in flesh made it unacceptable to speak of God and the world \"in terms of two spheres\"—an implicit attack upon Luther's [[doctrine of the two kingdoms]]. Bonhoeffer stressed personal and collective piety and revived the idea of imitation of Christ. He argued that Christians should not retreat from the world but act within it. He believed that two elements were constitutive of faith: the implementation of justice and the acceptance of divine suffering.<ref>Edward Craig, ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', p 835</ref> Bonhoeffer insisted that the church, like the Christians, \"had to share in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world\" if it were to be a true church of Christ.\n\nIn his prison letters, Bonhoeffer raised tantalizing questions about the role of Christianity and the church in a \"world come of age\", where human beings no longer need a metaphysical God as a stop-gap to human limitations; and mused about the emergence of a \"religionless Christianity\", where God would be unclouded from metaphysical constructs of the previous 1900 years. Influenced by Barth's distinction between faith and religion, Bonhoeffer had a critical view of the phenomenon of religion and asserted that revelation abolished religion (which he called the \"garment\" of faith). Having witnessed the complete failure of the German Protestant church as an institution in the face of Nazism, he saw this challenge as an opportunity of renewal for Christianity.\n\nYears after Bonhoeffer's death, some Protestant thinkers developed his critique into a thoroughgoing attack against traditional Christianity in the \"[[Death of God#Death of God theological movement|Death of God]]\" movement, which briefly attracted the attention of the mainstream culture in the mid-1960s. However, some critics—such as [[Jacques Ellul]] and others—have charged that those radical interpretations of Bonhoeffer's insights amount to a grave distortion, that Bonhoeffer did not mean to say that God no longer had anything to do with humanity and had become a mere cultural artifact. More recent Bonhoeffer interpretation is more cautious in this regard, respecting the parameters of the [[neo-orthodox]] school to which he belonged. Bonhoeffer also influenced [[Daniel Comboni|Comboni]] missionary Father [[Ezechiele Ramin]].\n\n===Works by Bonhoeffer===\nEnglish translations of Bonhoeffer's works, most of which were originally written in German, are available. Many of his lectures and books were translated into English over the years and are available from multiple publishers. These works are listed following the Fortress Press edition of Bonhoeffer's writings which, when completed, will be the definitive edition of Bonhoeffer's theological works and correspondence. The English language edition of Bonhoeffer's Works contains, in many cases, more material than the German Works series because of the discovery of hitherto unknown correspondence.\n\nAll sixteen volumes of the English Bonhoeffer Works Edition of Bonhoeffer's Oeuvre have been published as of October 2013. A newly published volume of selected readings entitled '''''The Dietrich Bonhoeffer Reader''''' which presents a chronological view of Bonhoeffer's theological development is now available as of 1 November 2013.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Bonhoeffer reader | url = http://store.fortresspress.com/store/product/18463/The-Bonhoeffer-Reader | publisher = Fortress Press}}.</ref>\n\n====Definitive Fortress Press editions of Bonhoeffer's works====\n* '''''Sanctorum Communio.

Bonhoeffer's dissertation, completed in 1927 and first published in 1930 as ''Sanctorum Communio: eine Dogmatische Untersuchung zur Soziologie der Kirche''. In it he attempts to work out a theology of the person in society, and particularly in the church. Along with explaining his early positions on sin, evil, solidarity, collective spirit, and [[collective guilt]], it unfolds a systematic theology of the Spirit at work in the church and what it implies for questions on authority, freedom, ritual, and eschatology.\n* '''''Act and Being.

Bonhoeffer's second dissertation, written in 1929–30 and published in 1931 as ''Akt und Sein'', deals with the consciousness and conscience in theology from the perspective of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]'s insight into the origin sinfulness in the \"heart turned in upon itself and thus open neither to the revelation of God nor to the encounter with the neighbor.\" Bonhoeffer's thoughts about power, revelation, Otherness, theological method, and theological anthropology are explained.\n* '''''Creation and Fall. Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works, Volume 3'''''.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer; John W. De Gruchy, Editor Translated by Douglas Stephen Bax.

''Life Together'' is a classic which contains Bonhoeffer's meditation on the nature of Christian community. ''Prayerbook of the Bible'' is a classic meditation on the importance of the Psalms for ''Christian prayer''. In this theological interpretation of the Psalms, Bonhoeffer describes the moods of an individual's relationship with God and also the turns of love and heartbreak, of joy and sorrow, that are themselves the Christian community's path to God.\n* '''''Ethics.

Hardcover, 288 pp: ISBN 978-0-8006-8307-8. Writing fiction—an incomplete drama, a novel fragment, and a short story—occupied much of Bonhoeffer's first year in Tegel prison, as well as writing to his family and his fiancée and dealing with his interrogation. \"There is a good deal of autobiography mixed in with it,\" he explained to his friend and biographer Eberhard Bethge. Richly annotated by German editors Renate Bethge and Ilse Todt and by Clifford Green, the writings in this book disclose a great deal of Bonhoeffer's family context, social world, and cultural milieu. Events from his life are recounted in a way that illuminates his theology. Characters and situations that represent Nazi types and attitudes became a form of social criticism and help to explain Bonhoeffer's participation in the resistance movement and the plot to kill Hitler.\n* '''''Letters and Papers from Prison.

The seminary existed for two years before the Gestapo ordered it closed in August 1937. The two years of Finkenwalde's existence produced some of Bonhoeffer's most significant theological work as he prepared these young seminarians for the turbulence and risk of parish ministry in the Confessing Church. Bonhoeffer and his seminarians were under Gestapo surveillance; some of them were arrested and imprisoned. Throughout, he remained dedicated to training them for the ministry and its challenges in a difficult time.

Bonhoeffer's most widely read book begins, \"Cheap grace is the mortal enemy of our church. Our struggle today is for costly grace.\" That was a sharp warning to his own church, which was engaged in bitter conflict with the official Nazified state church, The book was first published in 1937 as ''Nachfolge'' (Discipleship).  It soon became a classic exposition of what it means to follow Christ in a modern world beset by a dangerous and criminal government. At its center stands an interpretation of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: what Jesus demanded of his followers—and how the life of discipleship is to be continued in all ages of the post-resurrection church.\n* ''Life Together''. The stimulus for the writing of ''[[Life Together]]'' was the closing of the preachers' seminary at Finkenwalde.  The treatise contains Bonhoeffer's thoughts about the nature of Christian community based on the common life that he and his seminarians experienced at the seminary and in the \"Brother's House\" there. ''Life Together'' was completed in 1938, published in 1939 as ''Gemeinsames Leben'', and first translated into English in 1954.

Though caught up in the vortex of momentous forces in the Nazi period, Bonhoeffer systematically envisioned a radically Christocentric, incarnational ethic for a post-war world, purposefully recasting Christians' relation to history, politics, and public life.\n* ''Letters and Papers from Prison'' (first English translation 1953 by SCM Press).
