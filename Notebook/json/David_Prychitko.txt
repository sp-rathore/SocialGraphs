Prychitko is a critic of [[Marxism]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/Marxism.html|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|title=Marxism|date=2002}}</ref> but defends the idea of workers' self-managed firms in a freed market system. Prychitko is a tenured professor at [[Northern Michigan University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nmu.edu/economics/node/7|publisher=Northern Michigan University|title=Economics Department Faculty and Staff}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nPrychitko was born in [[Evergreen Park, Illinois]] to Harry and Joanne Prychitko. He is of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] descent. He was raised in Worth, Illinois, and is a 1980 graduate of [[Alan Shepard]] High School in [[Palos Heights]], Illinois. He remained in Worth until he moved to Michigan to attend [[Northern Michigan University]] in Marquette, a small city in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]. After completing his B.S. in Economics (1984), Prychitko attended [[George Mason University]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], where he earned an M.A. (1987) and a Ph.D. (1989) in economics. At George Mason he was a student of [[Kenneth Boulding]], [[James M. Buchanan|James Buchanan]], [[Don Lavoie]], and [[Thelma Z. Lavine]]. Lavoie chaired Prychitko's dissertation committee. Michael Alexeev, Jack High, and Karen I. Vaughn served as the economists on the committee, and [[Tom R. Burns|Tom Burns]], a [[sociologist]], served as the \"outside the discipline\" committee member.\n\nBefore completing his Ph.D., Prychitko was also a Junior Fellow in the Program on Participation and Labor-Managed systems in the Department of Economics at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca]], New York (1988). He finished writing his dissertation research there, with some influence under the program's director, [[Jaroslav Vanek]].\n\n==Professional history==\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Prychitko conducted post-doctoral research on a [[Fulbright]] Grant in the Philosophical Faculty at the [[University of Zagreb]], in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] (1989). While there he had also participated in several courses at the [[Inter-University Centre]] of Postgraduate Studies in [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia, including Political Theory and Political Education—Anarchism: Community and Utopia. That course was celebrated as the first gathering in [[Yugoslavia]] of scholars of anarchism in forty or more years. During his stay at the Inter-University Centre, Prychitko also critically discussed the theory and practice of workers' self-managed socialism with several members of the Yugoslav [[Praxis School]], including [[Zagorka Golubovic]], [[Mihailo Markovic]], Svetozar Stojanovic, and [[Rudi Supek]].\n\nAfter his return from Yugoslavia, Prychitko served as a faculty member in the Department of Economics at the [[State University of New York at Oswego]], in [[Oswego, New York]] (1989–1997). During that time, he participated as a Summer Fellow in the Faculty Seminar on Economy, Values, and Culture, at the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture, [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] (1992), a program directed by the noted sociologist, [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]].\n\nPrychitko was also a Faculty Affiliate in the Program in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics of the James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy, George Mason University (2001–2004). Additionally, he held the Cecil and Ida Green Chair in Economics at [[Texas Christian University]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (2003–2004). Prychitko has been a faculty member in the Department of Economics at Northern Michigan University since 1997.<ref>http://aditweb.nmu.edu/telephone/directory/web/dept_listing.php?searchname=ECONOMICS&return=yes&outside=yes</ref>\n\nNon-professionally, Prychitko was a college-radio blues disc jockey for several years, a volunteer position he held at radio stations [[WNYO (FM)|WNYO]] in Oswego, New York and [[WUPX (FM)|WUPX]] in Marquette, Michigan. He is now a member of WUPX's Board of Control. He has since become a devotee of old-time fiddle music, and is one of a handful of Appalachian-style fiddlers in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\n\nHe lives in [[Marquette, Michigan]] with his wife Julie.  They have four children, Sonja, Emily, Anthony, and Anna.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===As author or co-author===\n* ''Marxism and Workers' Self-Management: The Essential Tension'' (Greenwood Press, 1991) ISBN 0-313-27854-7.\n* ''Markets, Planning and Democracy: Essays after the Collapse of Communism'' (Elgar, 2002) ISBN 1-84064-519-9.\n* ''The Economic Way of Thinking'' co-authored with [[Paul Heyne]] and [[Peter Boettke]] (Pearson 2014) ISBN 978-0-13-299129-2.
