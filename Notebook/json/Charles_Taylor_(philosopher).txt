This work has earned him the prestigious [[Kyoto Prize]], the [[Templeton Prize]], and the [[Kluge Prize|John W. Kluge Prize]], in addition to widespread esteem among philosophers.\n\nIn 2007, Taylor served with [[Gérard Bouchard]] on the Bouchard-Taylor Commission on [[Reasonable accommodation]] with regard to cultural differences in the province of Quebec. He is a practising [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholic]].\n\n==Career==\nTaylor attended [[Selwyn House School]] from 1941 to 1946<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Taylor '46 receives world's largest cash award|url=http://www.selwyn.ca/podium/default.aspx?t=204&tn=Charles+Taylor+%2746+receives+world%E2%80%99s+largest+cash+award&nid=374132&ptid=39795&sdb=False&pf=pglw&mode=0&vcm=False |publisher=Selwyn House School |accessdate=October 11, 2015 |date=March 15, 2007}}</ref> and began his undergraduate education at [[McGill University]] ([[B.A.]] in History in 1952). He continued his studies at the [[University of Oxford]], first as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Balliol College]] (B.A. in  [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]) in 1955, and then as a post-graduate ([[D.Phil.]] in 1961), under the supervision of [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].{{sfn|Brown|Collinson|Wilkinson|1996|pp=774–776}}\n\nHe succeeded [[John Plamenatz]] as [[Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and became a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. For many years, both before and after Oxford, he was Professor of [[political science|Political Science]] and [[Philosophy]] at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], where he is now [[professor emeritus]].{{sfn|Brown|Collinson|Wilkinson|1996|pp=774–776}} Taylor was also a Board of Trustees Professor of Law and Philosophy at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]] for several years after his retirement from McGill.\n\nTaylor was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1986.{{sfn|American Academy of Arts and Sciences|p=536}} In 1991, Taylor was appointed to the [[Conseil de la langue française]] in the province of [[Quebec]], at which point he critiqued Quebec's commercial sign laws.  In 1995, he was made a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]]. In 2000, he was made a Grand Officer of the [[National Order of Quebec]]. He was awarded the 2007 [[Templeton Prize]] for progress towards research or discoveries about spiritual realities, which includes a cash award of US$1.5 million. In 2007 he and [[Gérard Bouchard]] were appointed to head a one-year Commission of Inquiry into what would constitute \"reasonable accommodation\" for minority cultures in his home province of Quebec, Canada.<ref>[http://www.accommodements.qc.ca/index-en.html Commission de consultation sur les pratiques d'accommodement reliées aux différences culturelles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In June 2008, he was awarded the [[Kyoto Prize]] in the arts and philosophy category.

Taylor rejects [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and formalist [[epistemology|epistemologies]]. He is part of an influential intellectual tradition of [[Canadian Idealism]] that includes [[John Watson (philosopher)|John Watson]], Paxton Young, [[C.B. Macpherson]], and [[George Parkin Grant]].{{sfn|Meynell|2011}}\n\nIn his essay \"To Follow a Rule\", Taylor explores why people can fail to follow [[wiktionary:rule|rule]]s, and what kind of [[knowledge]] it is that allows a person to successfully follow a rule, such as the arrow on a sign. The intellectualist tradition presupposes that to follow directions, we must know a set of [[proposition]]s and [[premise]]s about how to follow directions.\n\nTaylor argues that Wittgenstein's solution is that all interpretation of rules draws upon a tacit background. This background is not more rules or premises, but what [[Wittgenstein]] calls [[Form of life (philosophy)|\"forms of life\"]]. More specifically, Wittgenstein says in the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' that \"Obeying a rule is a practice.\" Taylor situates the interpretation of rules within the practices that are incorporated into our bodies in the form of habits, dispositions, and tendencies.\n\nFollowing Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Michael Polanyi]], and Wittgenstein, Taylor argues that it is mistaken to presuppose that our understanding of the world is primarily mediated by representations. It is only against an unarticulated background that representations can make sense to us. On occasion we do follow rules by explicitly representing them to ourselves, but Taylor reminds us that rules do not contain the principles of their own application: application requires that we draw on an unarticulated understanding or  \"sense of things\"—the background.\n\n==Taylor's critique of naturalism==\nTaylor defines naturalism as a family of various, often quite diverse theories that all hold \"the ambition to model the study of man on the natural sciences.\"<ref>Taylor, ''Human Agency and Language: Philosophical Papers 1'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 1.</ref>\n\nPhilosophically, naturalism was largely popularized and defended by the unity of science movement that was advanced by [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] philosophy. In many ways, Taylor's early philosophy springs from a critical reaction against the logical positivism and naturalism that was ascendant in Oxford while he was a student.\n\nInitially, much of Taylor's philosophical work consisted of careful conceptual critiques of various naturalist research programs. This began with his 1964 dissertation ''The Explanation of Behaviour'', which was a detailed and systematic criticism of the [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] psychology of [[B. F. Skinner]]{{sfn|Taylor|1964}} that was highly influential at mid-century.\n\nFrom there, Taylor also spread his critique to other disciplines. The still hugely influential essay \"Interpretation and the Sciences of Man\" was published in 1972 as a critique of the political science of the behavioural revolution advanced by giants of the field like David Easton, Robert Dahl, Gabriel Almond, and Sydney Verba.<ref>Taylor, Philosophy and The Human Sciences: Philosophical Papers 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985) 15-57.</ref> In an essay entitled \"The Signiﬁcance of Signiﬁcance: The Case for Cognitive Psychology\", Taylor criticized the naturalism he saw distorting the major research program that had replaced B. F. Skinner's behaviourism.{{sfn|Taylor|1983|pp=141–169}}\n\nBut Taylor also detected naturalism in fields where it was not immediately apparent. For example, in 1978's \"Language and Human Nature\", he found naturalist distortions in various modern \"designative\" theories of language,<ref>Taylor, Human Agency and Language, 215-247.</ref> while in ''[[Sources of the Self]]'' (1989) he found both naturalist error and the deep moral, motivational sources for this outlook in various individualist and [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] conceptions of selfhood.\n\n==Taylor and hermeneutics==\nConcurrent to Taylor's critique of naturalism was his development of an alternative. Indeed, Taylor's mature philosophy begins when as a doctoral student at Oxford he turned away, disappointed, from [[analytic philosophy]] in search of other philosophical resources which he found in French and German [[hermeneutics]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].<ref>\"Interview with Charles Taylor: The Malaise of Modernity\" by David Cayley: http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2011/04/11/the-malaise-of-modernity-part-1---5/</ref>\n\nThe hermeneutic tradition develops a view of human understanding and cognition as centred on the decipherment of meanings (as opposed to, say, foundational theories of brute verification or an apodictic rationalism). Taylor's own philosophical outlook can broadly and fairly be characterized as hermeneutic. This is clear in his championing of the works of major figures within the hermeneutic tradition such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], Heidegger, Merleau Ponty, and Gadamer.<ref name=\"Taylor_45_76\">Taylor, \"Self-Interpreting Animals\", in Human Agency and Language, 45-76.</ref> It is also evident in his own original contributions to hermeneutic and interpretive theory.<ref name=\"Taylor_45_76\"/>\n\n==Communitarian critique of liberalism==\nTaylor (as well as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Michael Walzer]], and [[Michael Sandel]]) is associated with a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] critique of [[Liberalism|liberal]] theory's understanding of the \"self\". Communitarians emphasize the importance of social institutions in the development of individual meaning and identity.\n\nIn his 1991 [[Massey Lecture]] \"The Malaise of Modernity\", Taylor argued that political theorists—from [[John Locke]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] to [[John Rawls]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]]—have neglected the way in which individuals arise within the context supplied by societies. A more realistic understanding of the \"self\" recognizes the social background against which life choices gain importance and meaning.\n\n==Philosophy and sociology of religion==\n{{further|A Secular Age}}\n\nTaylor's later work has turned to the philosophy of religion, as evident in several pieces, including the lecture \"A Catholic Modernity\" and the short monograph \"Varieties of Religion Today: William James Revisited\".<ref>A Catholic Modernity?: Charles Taylor's Marianist Award Lecture, ed. James Heft (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999); Varieties of Religion Today (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002).</ref>\n\nTaylor's most significant contribution in this field to date is his book ''A Secular Age'' which argues against the [[secularization]] thesis of [[Max Weber]], Steve Bruce, and others.{{sfn|Taylor|2007}} In rough form, the secularization thesis holds that as modernity (a bundle of phenomena including science, technology, and rational forms of authority) progresses, religion gradually diminishes in influence. Taylor begins from the fact that the modern world has not seen the disappearance of religion but rather its diversification and in many places its growth.{{sfn|Taylor|2007|pp=1–22}}  He then develops a complex alternative notion of what secularization actually means given that the secularization thesis has not been borne out. In the process, Taylor also greatly deepens his account of moral, political, and spiritual modernity that he had begun in ''Sources of the Self''.\n\n==Politics==\nTaylor was a candidate for the [[social democratic]] [[New Democratic Party]] in [[Mount Royal (electoral district)|Mount Royal]] on three occasions in the 1960s, beginning with the [[Canadian federal election, 1962|1962 federal election]] when he came in third behind [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Alan Macnaughton|Alan MacNaughton]]. He improved his standing in [[Canadian federal election, 1963|1963]], coming in second. Most famously, he also lost in the [[Canadian federal election, 1965|1965 election]] to newcomer and future [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], [[Pierre Trudeau]]. This campaign garnered national attention. Taylor's fourth and final attempt to enter the [[Canadian House of Commons]] was in the [[Canadian federal election, 1968|1968 federal election]], when he came in second as an NDP candidate in the riding of [[Dollard (electoral district)|Dollard]]. In 1994 he coedited a paper on human rights with [[Vitit Muntarbhorn]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Muntarbhorn|Taylor|1994}} In 2008, he endorsed the NDP candidate in Westmount—Ville-Marie, [[Anne Lagacé Dowson]]. He was also a professor to Canadian politician and former leader of the New Democratic Party [[Jack Layton]].\n\nIn 2010, Taylor said [[multiculturalism]] was a work in progress that faced challenges. He identified tackling [[Islamophobia]] in Canada as the next challenge.<ref>{{cite news |title=Part 5: 10 leaders on how to change multiculturalism |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/multiculturalism/part-5-10-leaders-on-how-to-change-multiculturalism/article1745221/?from=1923091 |department=Our Time to Lead |newspaper=The Globe and Mail | date=June 21, 2012 |access-date=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Interlocutors==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*[[Richard Rorty]]\n*[[Bernard Williams]]\n*[[Alasdair MacIntyre]]: [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)#Communitarian critique of liberalism|critique of liberalism]]\n*[[Will Kymlicka]]\n*[[Martha Nussbaum]]\n*[[Kwame Appiah]]: [[Kwame Anthony Appiah#Selected essays|on Taylor's \"The Politics of Recognition\"]]\n*[[Hubert Dreyfus]]: [[Hubert Dreyfus#Background|philosophical influence]]; [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)#Selected books by Taylor|co-author]]\n*[[Quentin Skinner]]\n*[[Talal Asad]]\n*[[Arjun Appadurai]]: [[Arjun Appadurai#The social imaginary|on the imaginary]]\n*[[Paul Berman]]\n*[[William E.
