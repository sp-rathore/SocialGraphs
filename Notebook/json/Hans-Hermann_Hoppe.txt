He continues: \"As for homosexuality, it is entirely possible that some areas of the country, parts of Gotham and San Francisco for example, will require this practice, and ban, entirely, heterosexuality.

Employing a [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument, he argues that Hoppe's logic implies that flagrantly unlibertarian laws such as regulations on prostitution and drug use \"could be defended on the basis that many tax-paying property owners would not want such behavior on their own private property\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Another libertarian author, Simon Guenzl, writing for ''Libertarian Papers'' argues that: \"supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state’s role in society.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Guenzl|first=Simon|date=June 23, 2016|title=Public Property and the Libertarian Immigration Debate|journal=Libertarian Papers|volume=Vol 8|quote=I conclude that supporting a legitimate role for the state as an immigration gatekeeper is inconsistent with Rothbardian and Hoppean libertarian anarchism, as well as with the associated strategy of advocating always and in every instance reductions in the state’s role in society.}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of specific immigration restrictions, Hoppe argued that an appropriate policy will require immigrants to the United States to display proficiency in English in addition to \"superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values\".<ref>Walter Block and Gene Callahan, [http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block-callahan_right-immigrate-2003.pdf Is There a Right to Immigration?: A Libertarian Perspective], [[Human Rights Review]], October–December 2003.</ref> These requirements will, he argued, result in a \"systematic pro-European immigration bias\".
