A [[list of members of the Romanian Academy|member of the Romanian Academy]] after 1923, he was its vice president in 1935–1938, 1941–1944, and its president between 1938 and 1941.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Butoieşti]], [[Mehedinţi County]], he was the son of Radu Poppescu, whose natural father was [[Eufrosin Poteca]],<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, ''Revizuiri şi adăugiri...''</ref> and Judita Butoi. His mother died during childbirth, and Radu Poppescu married Ecaterina Cernăianu, who gave birth to Constantin's nine siblings.\n\nDuring his childhood, Constantin fell ill with [[malaria]]. He also fractured a leg, resulting in a permanent physical impediment.\n\nRadu Poppescu, who worked as a secretary for Poteca for part of his life, inherited a certain sum after the death of his employer and father; this was to take the form of a [[scholarship]] for Constantin Rădulescu. He ultimately refused to make use of it, indicating that he would use instead revenue from his [[Estate (land)|estate]] in Butoieşti; the scholarship was eventually awarded to [[Gheorghe Ţiţeica]], the renowned mathematician.\n\nIn 1885, he graduated from [[Carol I National College|Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]], and subsequently entered the [[University of Bucharest]], applying to both its Faculty of Law and Faculty of Letters. He was taught by [[Titu Maiorescu]], who was to become his mentor, and attended lectures by [[Constantin Dumitrescu-Iaşi]], [[V. A. Urechia]], [[Grigore Tocilescu]], and [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]]. He was part of the last generation of [[intellectual]]s to participate in the activities of the ''[[Junimea]]'' [[literary society]] (where Maiorescu had endured as the major influence).<ref>Stahl; Vulcănescu</ref>\n\nRădulescu-Motru was awarded a law degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1888, and passed his philosophy exam the following year.\n\n==Studies abroad==\nIn the summer of 1889, he accompanied Maiorescu on a trip to [[Austria-Hungary]], [[German Empire|Germany]], and [[Switzerland]], notably visiting the [[University of Vienna]] and the [[University of Munich]], establishing contacts with German academics. This brought his inclusion into the last stage of a program initiated by Maiorescu as the [[Kingdom of Romania]]'s Minister of Education: alongside other important cultural and scientific figures (such as [[Alexandru A. Philippide]], [[Ştefan Zeletin]], [[Ion Rădulescu-Pogoneanu]], [[Iorgu Iordan]], [[Simion Mehedinţi]], [[Nicolae Bănescu]], [[P. P. Negulescu]], [[Teohari Antonescu]], and [[Constantin Litzica]]), he was given official assistance in order complete his education abroad (in order to provide Romania with a new generation of academics).<ref>Nastasă</ref> Initially, he directed his interest towards studies in [[France]], attending [[Henry Beaunis]]' lectures in psychology at the [[University of Paris]] during the fall of 1899.<ref>Nastasă; Ornea 1995, p.188</ref>\n\nBetween 1890 and 1893, Rădulescu settled in Germany&nbsp;– he lived in [[Munich]] and studied at the university for one semester (as a student of [[Carl Stumpf]]), and then moved to [[Leipzig]], where he began working in the laboratory of [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[University of Leipzig|local university]]. While completing his training with Wundt, he attended classes in physics, [[physiology]], [[chemistry]], [[psychiatry]], and mathematics, as well as [[Gustav Weigand]]'s lectures in [[Romanian language|Romanian philology]]. He married a German woman, who later refused to accompany him back to Romania; they eventually divorced. He took his [[doctorate]] in 1893, with a thesis on [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy (''Zur Entwickelung von Kant's Theorie der Naturkausalität''), one notably quoted by [[Henri Bergson]] in his ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Bergson)|Introduction à la Métaphysique]]''.\n\n==Academic and political career==\nAfter 1897, [[Spiru Haret]], he served on the editorial board of [[Spiru Haret]]'s ''Albina'' [[popular science]] magazine.<ref>Antonescu</ref> On January 1, 1900, he also founded and edited ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'' (which published articles by, among others, [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], [[George Coşbuc]], [[Lazăr Şăineanu]], [[Ioan Nădejde]], [[Ovid Densusianu]], [[H. Sanielevici]], and [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]]).<ref>Adamescu</ref> Appointed to the chair of Philosophy at the University of Bucharest in 1906 (after three years of employment at the cultural foundation created by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]]),<ref>Ornea 1995, p.188</ref> he was also the founder of the review ''Studii filosofice'' (later renamed ''Revista de filosofie''), and, in 1918, became head of the [[National Theatre Bucharest]].\n\nIn 1923, Rădulescu-Motru joined [[Virgil Madgearu]], [[Constantin Costa-Foru]], [[Victor Eftimiu]], [[Grigore Iunian]], [[Radu D. Rosetti]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]], and the [[Socialism|socialists]] [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], and [[Constantin Mille]], in creating ''Liga Drepturilor Omului'' (the League for [[Human Rights]]), protesting against measures taken by the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] cabinet of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] in dealing with left-wing opposition forces.<ref>''Constantin Titel Petrescu''</ref> In 1925, Rădulescu-Motru, [[Nicolae Basilescu]], and [[Traian Bratu]] were part of a government-appointed committee investigating the roles of [[A. C. Cuza]] and [[Corneliu Şumuleanu]] in the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] violence having occurred at the [[University of Iaşi]] in 1923-1925.<ref>''Evreii în prima universitate...''</ref>\n\nInitially a [[Conservatism|conservative]],<ref name=\"Ornea, p.119\">Ornea 1995, p.119</ref> he became active inside the newly created [[National Peasants' Party]] towards the end of the 1920s,<ref>Niculae et al., p.15</ref> and adapted the group's advocacy of a peasant state that would favour small-scale agricultural property (an echo of [[Poporanism]]), while taking a more [[Centrism|centrist]] stand than his friend Madgearu.<ref>Ornea 1995, p.120</ref> A member of the party's Study Circle, he took part in drafting a new party program (a 1935 initiative taken by [[Ion Mihalache]] and [[Mihai Ralea]], it also involved the left-wingers [[Ernest Ene]], [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]], and [[Petre Andrei]]).<ref name=\"Ornea, p.119\"/>\n\nIt was at this time that his ideas on [[ethnicity]] (''Romanianism'') came to be debated by various figures on the [[Right-wing politics|Right]], and were the subject of virulent criticism from [[intellectual]]s sympathetic to the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]], who notably rejected his commitment to [[secularism]] and Maiorescu's ''[[Junimea]]'' tradition ([[Mircea Vulcănescu]] spoke against \"his hostile attitude, shared by his ''Junimist'' colleagues, against the penetration of a new, religious spirit, inside the University [of Bucharest]\"),<ref>Vulcănescu, in Ornea 1995, p.78</ref> as well as from the nationalist [[Modernism|modernist]] [[Lucian Blaga]].<ref>Ornea 1995, p.84, 119-129</ref>  According to a later assessment of his work by Vulcănescu, who had since become influenced by the centrist National Peasants' Party member [[Dimitrie Gusti]], the latter's outlook on [[sociology]] was also in disagreement with Rădulescu-Motru's adherence to ''Junimist'' guidelines.<ref>Vulcănescu</ref>\n\nToward the end of the 1930s, Rădulescu-Motru was involved in a dispute with the [[far right]] philosopher [[Nae Ionescu]], who, although appointed his assistant at the Philosophy department, had begun to criticize his views in the pro-Iron Guard journal ''[[Cuvântul]]''; writing to [[Mircea Eliade]] in 1938, he accused Ionescu of various unacademic practices, including using lectures on Logic to promote \"a sort of dilettante [[mysticism]]\".<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Handoca</ref>\n\nThe President of the Academy at the moment when [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] assumed dictatorial powers, he chose to support the new [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) regime, and moved away from party politics.<ref name=\"Ţurlea\">Ţurlea</ref> He remained in office after Carol's fall from power of and the establishment of the Iron Guard's [[National Legionary State]] government; in the autumn of 1940, as Madgearu and [[Nicolae Iorga]], who had been assassinated by the Guard's armed groups, were being buried, he led the delegation of Academy members who defied the policies of [[Horia Sima]] by attending the funeral.<ref>Ornea 1995, p.341</ref> During [[World War II]], he was supportive of the dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]] and Romania's alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] against the [[Soviet Union]]. As late as 1944 he abhorred the attempts of the Romanian opposition to negotiate the country's switch to the camp of the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]]. Even after the war, in his personal journals he continued to adopt a position sympathetic to the Romanian and Nazi [[war criminal]]s, dismissing the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Romanian People's Tribunals|People's Tribunals]].<ref name=\"Ornea 1999\">Ornea 1999</ref>\n\n==Communist persecution==\nCritical of Romania's exit from the [[Axis Powers]] during [[World War II]] (''see [[Romania during World War II]]''),<ref name=\"Ornea 1999\"/> he was alarmed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] advances and the [[Soviet occupation of Romania|eventual occupation]]; in his private notes, he deplored the fact that Romania failed to adopt the [[Marshall Plan]].<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Lăcustă</ref> In June 1948, six months after the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], Rădulescu-Motru was among [[List of purged members of the Romanian Academy|the members of the Academy purged]] by the new authorities (he was reinstated post-mortem in 1990).<ref>Dumitrescu</ref> Despite his protests, his entire work was dismissed by official [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] rhetoric as \"[[idealism]]\".<ref name=\"Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu\">Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu</ref>\n\nHe was denied employment in his field of expertise, until two years before his death, when he was admitted to the minor post of researcher at the Psychology Institute; according to his biographer N. Bagdasar, his final years were marked by extreme poverty.<ref name=\"Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu\"/> Granted assistance following the interventions of [[Miron Constantinescu]] and [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], Rădulescu-Motru was hospitalized in a [[Bucharest]] clinic for much of his final years.<ref name=\"Bagdasar, in Dumitrescu\"/> He died while in there, and was buried in [[Bellu cemetery]].\n\n==Philosophy and politics==\n\n===Outlook===\nInfluenced by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s theories on [[introspection]], Rădulescu-Motru moved away from [[Kantianism|Kantian]] philosophy and its tenet regarding the impossibility of transcending reality as perceived through the senses. He considered [[metaphysics]] to be open to [[Epistemology|objective]] scrutiny, and placed their knowledge at the summit of philosophical approaches.<ref>Isac; Ornea 1995, p.121-122</ref>\n\nStating that there was, in effect, a unity between [[person]] and material nature, Rădulescu-Motru developed his own version of [[Personalism]], which thought of the human being and its [[Personality psychology|personality]] as the goal of [[evolution]] in nature&nbsp;– a theory he called ''Energetic Personalism''.<ref>Isac</ref> He recognized the influence of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s views on the relation between [[being]] and the [[Holism|whole]], arguing that his [[Idealism|idealist]] concept of [[externalization]] (\"the belief that the world is being led by our ideal\",<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Vianu, p.313</ref> which he deemed \"transitory Personalism\")<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Vianu, p.314</ref> had been the driving force behind all modern ideologies, from [[Socialism]] and [[Anarchism]] to [[Liberalism]] (''see [[Right Hegelians]] and [[Left Hegelians]]'').<ref>Vianu, p.313</ref>\n\nOwing to Wundt's ''[[Völkerpsychologie]]'', Rădulescu-Motru dedicated much of his work to assessing and defining [[nationalism]] in Romanian social context. Concentrating his analysis on the impact of [[modernization]] and [[Westernization]], he argued for a need to adapt forms to the [[Romanians|Romanian ethnicity]] (which he defined through [[heredity]]),<ref name=\"Caraiani\">Caraiani</ref> and represented as the true social fundament (the \"community of spirit\").<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Stahl</ref> He supported the existence of [[Racism|human races and differences among them]], as well as [[eugenics]], even after the defeat of Nazi Germany led to the abandonment of such theories in the mainstream scientific world.<ref name=\"Ornea 1999\"/>\n\n===Views on modernization===\nIn his ''Cultura română şi politicianismul'' (\"Romanian culture and petty politics\"), he devised a [[hierarchy]] of cultures, placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the top of the scale, and the [[Far East]] at its bottom;<ref>Pantelimon; Stahl</ref> he later confessed to [[Mircea Eliade]] his reticence in dealing with [[Hindu philosophy]] (conversations between the two centered instead on [[Indian nationalism]] in general and ''[[Satyagraha]]'' in particular).<ref>Handoca</ref> The system placed Romania in the margin of European progress, still subject to adopting cultural forms from Western societies:\n<blockquote>\"Nowhere have [[bourgeois]] institutions stemmed out of natural spiritual needs of the peoples, but rather out of the needs of [[capitalism]]; the complete harmonizing of these institutions with the popular [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] was a gradual, difficult enterprise, the more so in our country, where the dazzling development of capitalism has left the spiritual evolution, always more laborious, far behind.\"<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.25</ref></blockquote>\n\nElsewhere, he argued that, despite a traditional pattern of [[individualism]], Romanians lacked \"[[Initiative (enterprise)|initiative]] in economic and social life, the two characteristics traits of individualism as experienced by the cultured [[Western world|Western peoples]] and constituting bourgeois spirit\";<ref name=\"Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al.\">Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al.</ref> according to him, the common folk relied on collective work, which had ensured the survival of village communities during \"cursed centuries\"<ref name=\"Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al.\"/> (maintaining the mobility of villages \"from plain to mountains\",<ref name=\"Rădulescu-Motru, in Scurtu et al.\"/> but preventing their actual breakup during the [[Romania in the Middle Ages|medieval period]]).\n\nIn his chapters on the [[universal suffrage]], the [[parliamentary system]], and the [[1923 Constitution of Romania|Romanian Constitution of 1923]], Rădulescu-Motru expanded on this fundamentally [[Conservatism|conservative]] thesis, arguing that such reforms had come too soon to be properly integrated.<ref name=\"Antonesei; Pantelimon\">Antonesei; Pantelimon</ref> The main danger he saw in the process was the appearance of \"petty politics\" (''politicianism''), which, he argued, had a potential of destroying natural developments inside the nation.<ref name=\"Antonesei; Pantelimon\"/>\n\nTaking in view the characteristics of this evolution towards petty politics, he vehemently rejected [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s theory on the almost exclusively foreign origin of the bourgeoisie inside the post-[[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]].<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Dumitrescu</ref> Instead, Rădulescu-Motru expanded on [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s criticism of \"forms without fundament\" (in reference to the discrepancy between the Westernized facade and the underdeveloped economic and social setting), viewing the class of low-ranking [[boyars]], increasingly attracted to [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Liberal currents]] during the 19th century, as the main agents of incoherent change&nbsp;– this attracted him the criticism of the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], who argued that ''[[Junimea]]'' was an [[Exclusivism|exclusivist]] school of criticism that \"has never said [of foreign models] what, how much, and when should be imported\".<ref>Ibrăileanu, ''Primul junimist...''</ref> In this context, Ibrăileanu emphasized the gestures of boyars before and during the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Regulation]]'' government, as indicative of a skeptical nationalist mood (rather than of a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] ideology).<ref>Ibrăileanu, ''Evoluţia spiritului critic...''</ref>\n\n===''Romanianism'' and secularism===\nWith ''Învăţământul filosofic în România'' (\"Philosophical education in Romania\"), his 1931 essay first published in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', Rădulescu-Motru introduced a polemic that was to mark numerous other writings of his during the following period: reacting to the growth in appeal of [[far right]] magazines that claimed to follow a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] philosophy&nbsp;– ''[[Cuvântul]]'' and ''[[Gândirea]]''&nbsp;–, he made a difference between a \"[[Belles-lettres|belletristic]]\" trend in higher learning and a \"scientific\" one, arguing in favour of the latter, and presenting the former as the objective source of [[Anti-intellectualism|anti-intellectualist]] attitudes he observed inside the new political phenomenon<ref>Ornea 1995, p.77-78</ref> (which emphasized the \"human need for mystery\").<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.83</ref> In essence, the [[Secularism|secularist]] Rădulescu-Motru followed the ''Junimea'' tradition of rejecting [[mysticism]], viewing it as the unwanted characteristic of a [[working class]] mentality.<ref name=\"Caraiani\"/>\n\nHe questioned the [[Subjectivism|subjective]] approaches of [[Lucian Blaga]], [[Nichifor Crainic]], and [[Nae Ionescu]]: developing his ''Romanianism'', Rădulescu-Motru stated his support for cultural and national dialogue (\"and not the isolation of each people in its own ethnicity\"),<ref name=\"Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.85\">Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.85</ref> and for the ultimate integration of Romanian culture in the highest section of European culture.<ref>Ornea 1995, p.120-121</ref> He even argued that principles supported by the Right in defining Romanian specificity were in fact being shared with other cultures (answering Blaga's emphasis on [[Romanian folklore]], he pointed out that its themes were commonplace in neighbouring [[Balkans|Balkan]] cultures;<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.84</ref> replying to Ionescu's views on allegedly particular tendencies toward [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]] inside national culture, he stated his belief that \"the prestige of the [[metaphor]], the attraction towards mystery and the [[ontology]] of the [[Ethnic group|ethnos]] [...] only show themselves from the second quarter of the 20th century onwards, [and are under the influence of] foreign university circles [...]\";<ref name=\"Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea, p.85\"/> he also rejected Crainic's views on Orthodoxy as the source for specificity, arguing for [[Christianity and world religions|Christian universalism]] in detriment of \"nationalist spirituality\"<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Ornea 1995, p.122</ref>&nbsp;– an idea nevertheless interpreted by Crainic as evidence of \"militant philosophical [[atheism]]\").<ref>Crainic, in Ornea 1995, p.125</ref>\n\n===Peasant doctrine===\nAfter joining the [[National Peasants' Party]], Rădulescu-Motru maintained a particular approach towards the group's doctrines and policies after 1935: adapting his criticism of [[individualism]] (a trait he associated with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberals]]) to the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] doctrine of the \"peasant state\", he defined the latter as necessarily \"[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]\":\n<blockquote>\"[It] differs from other totalitarian states in that it sets among its norms, first and foremost, the preeminence of the permanent interests of the peasant population. Unlike the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist]], the [[Nazi Germany|National-Socialist]], and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] states, it believes that it can serve the totality of the population it is supposed to govern, not on the basis of a glorious [[Imperialism|imperialist]] tradition, or through the cultivation of a [[Aryan race|race relation]], or through industrial structuring on the basis of [[First Five-Year Plan|a dictatorial plan]], but through the creation of a healthy, moral, and labouring peasantry, ready to defend the country's borders as the geographical and historical conditions demand it.\"<ref>Rădulescu-Motru, in Niculae et al., p.209</ref></blockquote>\n\nA pro-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] critic soon reproached that such an ideal, despite its aim to compete with purely nationalist trends, was in fact [[social class]]-based, and its \"numerical, that is to say [[Democracy|democratic]]\" definition (around the argument that peasants formed the majority in Romania) was leading to \"peasant [[Anomie|anarchy]]\".<ref>Nicolae Roşu, in Ornea 1995, p.126</ref>\n\nRădulescu-Motru came to support [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN) and the [[One-party state|one-party system]] in 1938, speaking out in favour of the kings' initiative to introduce [[uniform]]s for members of the Academy (clashing over the matter with his fellow academic [[Nicolae Iorga]], in February 1939).<ref name=\"Ţurlea\"/>\n\n==Works==\n*''F.
