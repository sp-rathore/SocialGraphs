To him it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two [[pendulum]]s of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of [[Christiaan Huygens]], almost one hundred years later, that the [[Tautochrone curve|tautochrone]] nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece.<ref name=Asimov>Asimov, Isaac (1964). ''Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology''. ISBN 978-0385177719</ref> Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and [[natural philosophy]] instead of medicine.<ref name=Asimov/> He created a [[thermoscope]], a forerunner of the [[thermometer]], and in 1586 published a small book on the design of a [[hydrostatic]] balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied ''disegno'', a term encompassing fine art, and in 1588 obtained the position of instructor in the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] in Florence, teaching perspective and [[chiaroscuro]]. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter [[Cigoli]], who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.<ref name=\"edgerton\"/><ref name=\"panofsky\"/>\n\nIn 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother [[Michelagnolo Galilei|Michelagnolo]]. In 1592, he moved to the [[University of Padua]] where he taught geometry, [[mechanics]], and astronomy until 1610.<ref>[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 45–66).]]</ref> During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure [[fundamental science]] (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical [[applied science]] (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope).

Portrait by [[Ottavio Leoni|Leoni]]]]\nCardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]] could not be defended without \"a true [[physical entity|physical]] demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun\".<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 67–9.</ref> Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his ''Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems'' the ''Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea''.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), p. 354, n. 52</ref> The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.\n\nFor Galileo, the [[tide]]s were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 119–133</ref> His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the [[Adriatic Sea]] compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.\n\nIf this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at [[Venice]] instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 127–131 and Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), pp. 432–6</ref> Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, [[Albert Einstein]] expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his \"fascinating arguments\" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth.<ref>Einstein (1953) p. xvii</ref> Galileo dismissed the idea, held by his contemporary [[Johannes Kepler]], that the moon caused the tides.<ref>Galilei, ([[#CITEREFGalilei1953|1953]]), p.&nbsp;462.</ref> (Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.)<ref>James Robert Voelkel.

It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published ''[[The Assayer]]'' (''Il Saggiatore'') in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider [[controversy]] over the very nature of [[science]] itself. The title page of the book describes Galileo as philosopher and \"Matematico Primario\" of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nBecause ''The Assayer'' contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto.<ref name=\"scientific manifesto\">[[#Reference-Drake-1960|Drake (1960, pp.vii, xxiii–xxiv)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp. 139–140)]].</ref> Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, ''An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618'',<!--- ''[[The Assayer#disputatio|An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618]]'' This should eventually link to a section in the article on the Assayer --><ref name=\"disputatio\">[[#Reference-Grassi-1960a|Grassi (1960a)]].</ref> which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year.

Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.<ref name=\"Graney and Danielson, 2014\">Graney and Danielson ([[#CITEREFGraneyDanielson2014|2014]]).</ref>\n\nReligious opposition to heliocentrism arose from Biblical references such as [[Psalms|Psalm]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Psalm|93:1|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|96:10|KJV}}, and [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Chronicles|16:30|KJV}} which include text stating that \"the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.\" In the same manner, {{bibleverse||Psalm|104:5|NIV}} says, \"the Lord set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.\"  Further, [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleverse-nb ||Ecclesiastes|1:5|1000}} states that \"And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place.\"<ref name=\"Bellarmine quote\">[[#Reference-Brodrick-1965|Brodrick (1965, c1964, p. 95)]] quoting [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine's]] letter to [[:it:Paolo Antonio Foscarini|Foscarini]], dated 12 April 1615.

In December 1613 the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, [[Benedetto Castelli]], with biblical objections to the motion of the earth.  According to Maurice Finocchiaro this was done in a friendly and gracious manner, out of curiosity. Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals, not on science.  This letter was not published, but circulated widely.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 27-28.</ref>\n\nBy 1615 Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the [[Roman Inquisition]] by Father Niccolo Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the [[Council of Trent]] and looked dangerously like Protestantism.<ref name= \"Langford 1992, p.56-57\">Langford (1992), pp. 56–57</ref> Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli.<ref>Finocchiaro (1989), pp. 28 & 134.</ref>  Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his Copernican and biblical ideas. At the start of 1616, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed.<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68-69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.</ref>  According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the \"chief direct basis\" for the Inquisition's actions.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]</ref> The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned Brahe's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory \"clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.\"<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]</ref>  The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas.<ref>[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66-76, 164-175, 187-195)]]</ref> In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\" The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith\".<ref name=wcumf>{{cite web |last=Finocchiaro |first=Maurice |url=http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |id=ESS 362 / 562 |title=West Chester University—History of Astronomy; Lecture notes: Texts from The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History |publisher=West Chester University |accessdate=18 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013053/http://astro.wcupa.edu/mgagne/ess362/resources/finocchiaro.html#conreport |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}</ref>  (The [http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1402/1402.6168.pdf original document] from the Inquisitorial commission was made widely available in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esmateria.com/2014/02/28/una-errata-reproducida-durante-siglos-cambia-la-censura-de-la-iglesia-a-galileo/ |title=Una errata reproducida durante siglos cambia la censura de la Iglesia a Galileo|work=Materia}}</ref>)\n\n[[Pope Paul V]] instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo, and to order him to abandon the opinion that heliocentrism was physically true. On 26 February, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered:\n\n{{quote | ... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing.<ref name=h218>Heilbron (2010), p. 218</ref>}}\n\nThe decree of the [[Congregation of the Index]] banned Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' and other heliocentric works until correction.<ref name=h218 /> Bellarmine's instructions did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, so long as he did not advocate for its physical truth.<ref name=\"Hannam, James 2011. p329-344\"/><ref>Sharratt [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|(1994]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB0rHzrpJOMC&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 126–31)].</ref>\n\nFor the next decade, Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo [[Barberini]] as [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the [[Inquisition]] and papal permission.<ref name = \"Pope Urban VIII\">{{cite web| work =Galileo Project | title = Pope Urban VIII Biography|url= http://galileo.rice.edu/gal/urban.html}}</ref>\n\nEarlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.\n\nWhether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, \"Simplicio\" in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\".<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref> This portrayal of Simplicio made ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory. Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio.\n\nMost historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.<ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says \"this of course is untrue\" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].</ref> However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy.\n\nGalileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings<ref>{{cite web |last=Lindberg |first=David |title=Beyond War and Peace: A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}</ref> in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor [[Vincenzo Maculani]] to be [[Criminal charge|charged]]. Throughout his trial Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his ''Dialogue'' could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the ''Dialogue'', his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.<ref>Sharratt ([[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|1994]], pp. 171–75); Heilbron ([[#CITEREFHeilbron2010|2010]], pp. 308–17); Gingerich ([[#Reference-Gingerich-1992|1992]], pp. 117–18).</ref>\n\nThe sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts:\n* Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to [[Abjuration|\"abjure, curse and detest\"]] those opinions.<ref>[[#Reference-Fantoli-2005|Fantoli (2005, p. 139)]], [[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93)]].

He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using [[inductive reasoning]].\n\nGalileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the [[parabola]], both in terms of [[conic section]]s and in terms of the [[ordinate]] (y) varying as the square of the [[abscissa]] (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal [[trajectory]] of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of [[air resistance]] or other disturbances.

He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to [[Venice|Venetian]] lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (''Starry Messenger'').<ref>[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TgYAq3P0P8C&pg=PA1 pp. 1–2])</ref>\n\n===Kepler's supernova===\nTycho and others had observed the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed [[Kepler's Supernova|Kepler's supernova]] in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable [[Parallax#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]], Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and therefore disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.<ref>See Nicholas Kollerstrom, http://www.dioi.org/kn/NewStar.pdf</ref>\n\n===Jupiter's moons===\nOn 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as \"three fixed stars, totally invisible<ref name=invisible>''i.e.'', invisible to the naked eye.</ref> by their smallness\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.<ref name=\"jupiter's moons\">[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 146).]]</ref> Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \"stars\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were [[orbit]]ing Jupiter:<ref name=moonconclusion>In ''Sidereus Nuncius'' [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]],[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=3&VOLPAG=81 1892, 3:81] {{la icon}}) Galileo stated that he had reached this conclusion on 11 January. [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 152)]], however, after studying unpublished manuscript records of Galileo's observations, concluded that he did not do so until 15 January.</ref> he had discovered [[Moons of Jupiter|three of Jupiter's four largest moons]]. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the ''Medicean stars'', in honour of his future patron, [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], and Cosimo's three brothers.<ref name=\"medicean stars\">[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, p. 17).</ref> Later astronomers, however, renamed them ''[[Galilean moons|Galilean satellites]]'' in honour of their discoverer. These satellites are now called [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]].\n\nHis observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]], which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth,<ref>[[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton (2004, pp. 98,205)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 157)]].</ref> and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing.<ref name=scepticism>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp. 158–68)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, pp. 18–19).</ref> His observations were confirmed by the observatory of [[Christopher Clavius]] and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611.<ref>''God's Philosophers'' ju James Hannam Orion 2009 p313</ref> Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] had believed impossible.<ref name=periods>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 168)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]] (1994, p. 93).</ref>\n\n===Venus, Saturn, and Neptune===\nFrom September 1610, Galileo observed that [[Venus]] exhibited a full set of [[Lunar phase|phases]] similar to that of the [[Moon]]. The [[heliocentric model]] of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the [[Sun]] would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in [[geocentric model#Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy's geocentric model]] it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century as a result of his discovery the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models,<ref>Thoren (1989), p. 8; Hoskin (1999) p. 117.</ref> such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models,<ref>In the Capellan model only Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun, whilst in its extended version such as expounded by Riccioli, Mars also orbits the Sun, but the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are centred on the Earth</ref> each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.\n\nGalileo observed the planet [[Saturn]], and at first mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.<ref>Baalke, Ron. [http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html Historical Background of Saturn's Rings.] Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, NASA. Retrieved on 2007-03-11</ref>\n\nGalileo also observed the planet [[Neptune]] in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.<ref>Drake & Kowal (1980)</ref>\n\n===Sunspots===\nGalileo was one of the first Europeans to observe [[sunspot]]s, although Kepler had unwittingly observed one in 1607, but mistook it for a [[transit of Mercury]]. He{{who|date=August 2015}} also reinterpreted a sunspot observation from the time of [[Charlemagne]], which formerly had been attributed (impossibly) to a transit of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The very existence of sunspots showed another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics. And the annual variations in sunspots' motions, discovered by [[Francesco Sizzi]] and others in 1612–1613,<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 209)]]. Sizzi reported the observations he and his companions had made over the course of a year to Orazio Morandi in a letter dated 10 April 1613 [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|(Favaro]],[http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=11&VOLPAG=491 1901, 11:491)] {{it icon}}. Morandi subsequently forwarded a copy to Galileo.</ref> provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of [[Tycho Brahe]].<ref name=\"sunspot argument\">In geostatic systems the apparent annual variation in the motion of sunspots could only be explained as the result of an implausibly complicated precession of the Sun's axis of rotation [[#Reference-Linton-2004|(Linton, 2004, p. 212;]] [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt]], 1994, p. 166; [[#Reference-Drake-1970|Drake, 1970, pp. 191–196)]]. This did not apply, however, to the modified version of Tycho's system introduced by his protegé, [[Longomontanus]], in which the Earth was assumed to rotate. Longomontanus's system could account for the apparent motions of sunspots just as well as the Copernican.</ref> A dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the [[Jesuit]] [[Christoph Scheiner]].\n\nIn fact, there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by [[David Fabricius]] and his son [[Johannes Fabricius|Johannes]]. Scheiner quickly adopted Kepler's 1615 proposal of the modern telescope design, which gave larger magnification at the cost of inverted images; Galileo apparently never changed to Kepler's design.\n\n===Moon===\nPrior to Galileo's construction of his version of a telescope, [[Thomas Harriot]], an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a \"perspective tube\" to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only \"strange spottednesse\" in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, due in part to his artistic training<ref name=\"panofsky\">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/348450 |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |author-link=Erwin Panofsky |title=Galileo as a Critic of the Arts: Aesthetic Attitude and Scientific Thought |journal=Isis |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=3–15 |date=1956 |jstor=227542}}</ref> and the knowledge of [[chiaroscuro]],<ref name=\"edgerton\">Edgerton, Samuel Y. ''The Mirror, the Window, and the Telescope'', 2009</ref> had understood the patterns of light and shadow were in fact topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and [[impact crater|craters]]. In his study he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first \"planet\", an \"eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian\", as put forth by [[Dante]].\n\n===Milky Way and stars===\nGalileo observed the [[Milky Way]], previously believed to be [[Nebula|nebulous]], and found it to be a multitude of [[star]]s packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He observed the double star [[Mizar (star)|Mizar]] in Ursa Major in 1617.<ref>[[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004), p. 72–73]]</ref>\n\nIn the ''Starry Messenger'', Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his letters on sunspots, he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be \"quite round\". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter.<ref>Graney (2010, p. 455); Graney & Grayson (2011, p. 353).</ref> He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his ''Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems'', his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point.<ref>[[#CITEREFVan Helden1985|Van Helden]], (1985, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-yb7GX9mQIC&pg=PA75 p. 75]); [[#CITEREFChalmers1999|Chalmers]], (1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WQh5wDlE8cwC&pg=PA25 p. 25]); [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei]] (1953, pp. 361–62).</ref> In his ''Dialogue'', he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of [[stellar magnitude|first magnitude]] to be no more than 5 [[arcsecond]]s, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about <sup>5</sup>/<sub>6</sub> arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see [[Astronomical seeing#The effects of astronomical seeing|seeing disk]] or [[Airy disk]]), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by [[Tycho brahe#Tycho's geo-heliocentric astronomy|Tycho Brahe]] (see [[Magnitude (astronomy)|Magnitude]]) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable.<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1989|Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 167–76)]], [[#CITEREFGalilei1953|Galilei (1953, pp. 359–60)]], [[#Reference-Ondra-2004|Ondra (2004, pp. 74–5)]].</ref> Other astronomers such as [[Simon Marius]], [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], and [[Martin van den Hove|Martinus Hortensius]] made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.<ref>Graney (2010, p. 454-462); Graney & Grayson (2011, p. 352-355).</ref>\n\n==Engineering==\n[[File:Galileo's geometrical and military compass in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|Galileo's geometrical and military compass, thought to have been made c. 1604 by his personal instrument-maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]]]]\n\nGalileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a ''Geometric and Military Compass'' suitable for use by [[artillery|gunners]] and [[surveying|surveyors]]. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by [[Niccolò Tartaglia]] and [[Guidobaldo del Monte]]. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating [[cannon]]s accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of [[gunpowder]] for [[Round shot|cannonballs]] of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular [[polygon]], computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker [[Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni]] produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.<ref>[[#Reference-Reston-2000|Reston (2000, p. 56).]]</ref>\n\nIn [[Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology|about 1593]], Galileo constructed a [[Galileo thermometer|thermometer]], using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.\n\n[[File:Galileo telescope replica.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of the earliest surviving telescope attributed to Galileo Galilei, on display at the [[Griffith Observatory]].]]\n\nIn 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman [[Thomas Harriot]] and others, among the first to use a [[refracting telescope]] as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, [[Giovanni Demisiani]],<ref>[[#Reference-Sobel-2000|Sobel (2000, p. 43)]], [[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 196)]].

The actual inventors of the telescope and microscope remain debatable. A general view on this can be found in the article [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/optics/timeline/people/lippershey.html Hans Lippershey] (last updated 2003-08-01), © 1995–2007 by Davidson, Michael W.<!--NO LINK to the Republican political activist--> and the [[Florida State University]].

He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life; but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by [[Zebulon Pike]] of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable [[marine chronometer]], such as that of [[John Harrison]].<ref>''Longitude: the true story of a lone genius who solved the greatest scientific problem of his time'', Dava Sobel Penguin, 1996 ISBN 0-14-025879-5, ISBN 978-0-14-025879-0</ref> Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an [[escapement]] mechanism for a pendulum clock (called [[Galileo's escapement]]), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in the 1650s.\n\n== Physics ==\n[[File:Tito Lessi - Galileo and Viviani.jpg|thumb|''Galileo e [[Vincenzo Viviani|Viviani]]'', 1892, [[Tito Lessi]]]]\n\nGalileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and [[René Descartes]], was a precursor of the [[classical mechanics]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]]. Galileo conducted several experiments with [[pendulum]]s. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by [[Vincenzo Viviani]]) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his ''[[Two New Sciences]]''. Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is [[Pendulum#Period of oscillation|isochronous]], i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the [[amplitude]]. In fact, this is only approximately true,<ref>{{cite book |last=Newton |first=R. G. |date=2004 |title=Galileo's Pendulum: From the Rhythm of Time to the Making of Matter |page=51 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-01331-X}}</ref> as was discovered by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its [[verge escapement]], would have been a poor timekeeper. (See [[#Engineering|Engineering]] above.)\n\nGalileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the [[Speed of light#Measurement|speed of light]] by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously.<ref>Galileo Galilei, ''Two New Sciences,'' (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Pr., 1974) p. 50.</ref> Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine ''[[Accademia del Cimento]]'' repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result.<ref>I. Bernard Cohen, \"Roemer and the First Determination of the Velocity of Light (1676)\", ''Isis'', 31 (1940): 327–379, see pp. 332–333</ref> We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).\n\nGalileo put forward [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]], that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[special theory of relativity]].\n\n=== Falling bodies ===\n{{see also|Equations for a falling body}}\n[[File:Apollo 15 feather and hammer drop.ogg|right|thumb|During the [[Apollo 15]] mission in 1971, astronaut [[David Scott]] showed that Galileo was right: acceleration is the same for all bodies subject to gravity on the Moon, even for a hammer and a feather.]]A biography by Galileo's pupil [[Vincenzo Viviani]] stated that Galileo had [[Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment|dropped balls]] of the same material, but different [[mass]]es, from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass.<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, pp. 19,20)]]. At the time when Viviani asserts that the experiment took place, Galileo had not yet formulated the final version of his law of free fall. He had, however, formulated an earlier version which predicted that bodies ''of the same material'' falling through the same medium would fall at the same speed [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(Drake, 1978, p. 20)]].</ref> This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight.<ref>[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p. 9)]]; [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 31)]].</ref> While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a [[thought experiment]] which did not actually take place.<ref>{{cite web |last=Groleau |first=Rick |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/galileo/experiments.html |title=Galileo's Battle for the Heavens.

Oresme, however, regarded this discovery as a purely intellectual exercise having no relevance to the description of any natural phenomena, and consequently failed to recognise any connection with the motion of falling bodies ([[#CITEREFGrant1996|Grant]], 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyvmEyX6rZgC&pg=PA103#v=onepage&q&f=false p.103]).</ref> and [[Domingo de Soto]] had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated.<ref>[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, p. 198)]], [[#Reference-Wallace-2004|Wallace (2004, pp.II 384, II 400, III 272)]] Soto, however, did not anticipate many of the qualifications and refinements contained in Galileo's theory of falling bodies. He did not, for instance, recognise, as Galileo did, that a body would fall with a strictly uniform acceleration only in a vacuum, and that it would otherwise eventually reach a uniform terminal velocity.</ref> Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).\n\nHe also concluded that objects ''retain their velocity'' in the absence of any impediments to their motion,{{Citation needed|date= January 2016}} thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called [[Aristotelian physics#Unnatural motion|\"violent\", \"unnatural\", or \"forced\" motion]] so long as an agent of change (the \"mover\") continued to act on it.<ref>Jung ([[#CITEREFJung2011|2011]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=x5FiMR3kd_8C&pg=PA540#v=onepage&q&f=false p.504]). This aspect of Aristotle's theory of motion is covered in Books VII and VIII of his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''.</ref> Philosophical ideas relating to [[inertia]] had been proposed by [[John Philoponus]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Galileo stated: \"Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits\"<ref>http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/753#Galileo_0416_799 or [[Inertia#Classical inertia]]</ref> This was incorporated into [[Newton's laws of motion]] (first law).[[File:Pisa.Duomo.dome.Riminaldi01.jpg|thumb|Dome of the [[Cathedral of Pisa]] with the \"lamp of Galileo\"]]\n\n==Mathematics==\nWhile Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion [[square root]] method passed down from [[Fibonacci]] and [[Archimedes]]. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the [[Eudoxus of Cnidus#Mathematics|Eudoxian theory of proportion]], as set forth in the fifth book of [[Euclid's Elements]]. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by [[Niccolò Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].\n\nThe concept now named [[Galileo's paradox]] was not original with him. His proposed solution, that infinite numbers cannot be compared, is no longer considered useful.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Galileo Galilei01.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue outside the [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]\n\nGalileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled ''The Little Balance'' (''La Billancetta'') describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/instruments/balance.html|title=Hydrostatic balance|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> and the 1606 printed manual ''Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare'' on the operation of a geometrical and military compass.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&exbid=10&exbpg=1|title=The Works of Galileo|publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>\n\nHis early works in dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his 1590 Pisan ''De Motu'' (On Motion) and his ''circa'' 1600 Paduan ''Le Meccaniche'' (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan [[impetus dynamics]] in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.\n\nGalileo's 1610 ''[[Sidereus Nuncius|The Starry Messenger]]'' (''Sidereus Nuncius'') was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope. It reported his discoveries of:\n\n*the [[Galilean moons]]\n*the roughness of the Moon's surface\n*the existence of a large number of stars invisible to the naked eye, particularly those responsible for the appearance of the [[Milky Way]]\n*differences between the appearances of the planets and those of the fixed stars—the former appearing as small discs, while the latter appeared as unmagnified points of light\n\nGalileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled ''Letters on Sunspots''<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&exbid=13&exbpg=2 |title=Sunspots and Floating Bodies |publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024203933/http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&exbid=13&exbpg=2 |archivedate=24 October 2008 }}</ref> suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible. The ''Letters on Sunspots'' also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling \"appendages\" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615 Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the ''[[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]'' which was not published in printed form until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the ''Letter to Castelli'', which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://hsci.ou.edu/exhibits/exhibit.php?exbgrp=1&exbid=14&exbpg=3|title=Galileo, Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina|publisher=The University of Oklahoma, College of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> In 1616, after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the ''[[Discourse on the Tides]]'' (''Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare'') based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to [[Alessandro Orsini (cardinal)|Cardinal Orsini]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/tides.html|title=Galileo's Theory of the Tides|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title ''Discourse on the Comets'' (''Discorso Delle Comete''), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/galileo.html|title=Galileo Timeline|publisher=The Galileo Project|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1623, Galileo published ''[[The Assayer]]—Il Saggiatore'', which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/galileo.html|title=Galileo Galilei|publisher=Tel-Aviv University, Science and Technology Education Center|accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Following the success of The Assayer, Galileo published the ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'' (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his ''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences]]'' (''Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze'') in 1638 in [[House of Elzevir|Holland]], outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.\n\n===Published written works===\nGalileo's main written works are as follows:\n*''The Little Balance'' (1586; in Italian: ''La Billancetta'')\n*''On Motion'' (c. 1590; in Latin: ''De Motu Antiquiora'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/content/scientific_revolution/galileo|title=Collection of Galileo Galilei's Manuscripts and Related Translations|accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref>\n*''Mechanics'' (c. 1600; in Italian: ''Le mecaniche''<!--[sic]-->)\n*''The Operations of Geometrical and Military Compass'' (1606; in Italian: ''Le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare'')\n*''[[Sidereus Nuncius|The Starry Messenger]]'' (1610; in Latin: ''Sidereus Nuncius'')\n*''Discourse on Floating Bodies'' (1612; in Italian: ''Discorso intorno alle cose che stanno in su l'acqua, o che in quella si muovono'', \"Discourse on Bodies that Stay Atop Water, or Move in It\")\n*''History and Demonstration Concerning Sunspots'' (1613; in Italian: ''Istoria e dimostrazioni intorno alle macchie solari''; work based on the ''Three Letters on Sunspots'', ''Tre lettere sulle macchie solari'', 1612)\n*''[[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]'' (1615; published in 1636)\n*''[[Discourse on the Tides]]'' (1616; in Italian: ''Discorso del flusso e reflusso del mare'')\n*''Discourse on the Comets'' (1619; in Italian: ''Discorso delle Comete'')\n*''[[The Assayer]]'' (1623; in Italian: ''Il Saggiatore'')\n*''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'' (1632; in Italian: ''Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo'')\n*''[[Two New Sciences|Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences]]'' (1638; in Italian: ''Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze'')\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Later Church reassessments===\nThe Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo's death, and the controversy subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned ''Dialogue'') in Florence.<ref name=\"incomplete works\">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 299)]].</ref> In 1741 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works<ref name=\"complete works 1\">Two of his non-scientific works, the letters to Castelli and the Grand Duchess Christina, were explicitly not allowed to be included [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|(Coyne 2005, p. 347)]].</ref> which included a mildly censored version of the ''Dialogue''.<ref name=\"complete works 2\">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp. 303–04)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]]. The uncensored version of the ''Dialogue'' remained on the Index of prohibited books, however [[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|(Heilbron 2005, p. 279)]].</ref> In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of prohibited books]], although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the ''Dialogue'' and Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' remained.<ref name=\"ban not lifted\">[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, p. 307)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 347)]] The practical effect of the ban in its later years seems to have been that clergy could publish discussions of heliocentric physics with a formal disclaimer assuring its hypothetical character and their obedience to the church decrees against motion of the earth: see for example the commented edition (1742) of Newton's 'Principia' by Fathers Le Seur and Jacquier, which contains such a disclaimer ('Declaratio') before the third book (Propositions 25 onwards) dealing with the lunar theory.</ref> All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.<ref name=\"ban lifted\">[[#Reference-McMullin-2005|McMullin (2005, p. 6)]]; [[#Reference-Coyne-2005|Coyne (2005, p. 346)]]. In fact, the Church's opposition had effectively ended in 1820 when a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, was given permission to publish a work which treated heliocentrism as a physical fact rather than a mathematical fiction. The 1835 edition of the Index was the first to be issued after that year.</ref>\n\nInterest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the [[Flat Earth Myth]]) to attack Roman Catholicism.<ref name=\"Hannam, James 2011. p329-344\"/> Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939 [[Pope Pius XII]], in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the \"most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments\".<ref>Discourse of His Holiness Pope Pius XII given on 3 December 1939 at the Solemn Audience granted to the Plenary Session of the Academy, Discourses of the Popes from Pius XI to John Paul II to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pontifical Academy of the Sciences]] 1939–1986, Vatican City, p. 34</ref> His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: \"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely.

According to Feyerabend himself, Ratzinger had also mentioned him \"in support of\" his own views in a speech in Parma around the same time [[#Reference-Feyerabend-1995|(Feyerabend, 1995, p. 178)]].</ref> [[Cardinal Ratzinger]] (later to become [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called \"a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today\".<ref name=self-doubt>Ratzinger [[#Reference-Ratzinger-1994|(1994, p. 98)]].</ref> Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]], whom he quoted as saying \"The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too.
