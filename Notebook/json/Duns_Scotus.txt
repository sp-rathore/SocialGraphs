The doctrines for which he is best known are the \"[[univocity of being]],\" that existence is the most abstract concept we have, applicable to everything that exists; the [[formal distinction]], a way of distinguishing between different aspects of the same thing; and the idea of [[haecceity]], the property supposed to be in each individual thing that makes it an individual. Scotus also developed a complex argument for the [[existence of God]], and argued for the [[Immaculate Conception]] of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].\n\nDuns Scotus was given the [[scholastic accolades|scholastic accolade]] ''Doctor Subtilis'' (''Subtle Doctor'') for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. He was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1993.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Duns Scotus plaque University Church Oxford.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating Duns Scotus in the University Church, Oxford]]\nLittle is known of Duns Scotus apart from his work. His date of birth is thought to have been between 23 December 1265 and 17 March 1266, born into a leading family of the region. The site of his birth, in front of the Pavilion Lodge, near the North Lodge of Duns Castle, is now marked by a [[cairn]] which was erected in 1966 by the Franciscan friars of the United Kingdom to mark the 700th anniversary of his birth. Duns Scotus received the [[religious habit]] of the Friars Minor at [[Dumfries]], where his uncle, Elias Duns, was [[custos (Franciscans)|guardian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duns.bordernet.co.uk/history/dunsscotus.html|work=Duns, Scotland|title=People of Note: John Duns Scotus}}</ref>\n\nDuns Scotus's age is based on the first certain date for his life, that of his ordination to the [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at [[St Andrew's Priory, Northampton|St Andrew's]], [[Northampton]], England on 17 March 1291. The minimum [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical]] age for receiving [[holy orders]] is 25 and it is generally assumed that he would have been ordained as soon as it was permitted.<ref>Williams 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VRV9Tr_A-98C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 2]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Brampton |first=C.

He began lecturing on [[Peter Lombard]]'s ''[[Sentences]]'' at the prestigious University of Paris towards the end of 1302. Later in that academic year, however, he was expelled from the University of Paris for siding with [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in his feud with King [[Philip IV of France]] over the taxation of church property.\n\nDuns Scotus was back in Paris before the end of 1304, probably returning in May. He continued lecturing there until, for reasons that are still mysterious, he was dispatched to the Franciscan ''studium'' at [[Cologne]], probably in October 1307. According to the 15th-century writer [[William Vorilong]], his departure was sudden and unexpected. He was relaxing or talking with students in the ''Prato clericorum'' or ''Pre-aux-Clercs'' – an open area of the [[Rive Gauche]] used by scholars for recreation – when orders arrived from the Franciscan [[Minister General (Franciscan)|Minister General]]; Scotus left immediately, taking few or no personal belongings.<ref>''Narratur de Doctori Subtili qui in Prato clericorum, visa Generalis Ministri obedentia, dum actu Regens esse in scholis Parisiensibus, aut pauca aut nulla de rebus habita dispositione, Parisis exivit ut Coloniam iret, secundum ministri sententiam''.

Fratris J. duns de ordine fratrum Minorum, qui floruit Cant Oxon et Parisius et obiit in Colonia''.\" Quoted in Little 1932, p. 571, citing Callebaut 1928.</ref>\n\n== Work ==\nScotus’s great work is his commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], which contains nearly all the philosophical views and arguments for which he is well known, including the [[univocity of being]], the [[formal distinction]], less than numerical unity, individual nature or ‘thisness' ([[haecceity]]), his critique of [[illuminationism]] and his renowned argument for the [[existence of God]]. His commentary exists in several versions. The standard version is the ''Ordinatio'' (also known as the ''Opus oxoniense''), a revised version of lectures he gave as a bachelor at Oxford. The initial revision was probably begun in the summer of 1300 — see the remarks in the Prologue, question 2, alluding to the [[Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar]] in 1299, news of which probably reached Oxford in the summer of 1300. It was still incomplete when Scotus left for Paris in 1302. The original lectures were also transcribed and recently published as the ''Lectura''.<ref>See the Bibliography under ''The Examined Report of the Paris Lecture, Reportatio I-A''.</ref>\n\nThe two other versions of the work are Scotus's notes for the Oxford lectures, recently published as the ''Lectura'', the first book of which was probably written in Oxford in the late 1290s,<ref name=\"Pini 2005\"/> and the ''Reportatio parisiensis'' (or ''Opus parisiense''), consisting of transcriptions of the lectures on the ''Sentences'' given by Scotus when he was in Paris. A ''reportatio'' is a student report or transcription of the original lecture of a master. A version that has been checked by the master himself is known as a ''reportatio examinata''.\n\nBy the time of Scotus, these 'commentaries' on the ''Sentences'' were no longer literal commentaries. Instead, [[Peter Lombard]]'s original text was used as a starting point for highly original discussions on topics of theological or philosophical interest.<ref>See e.g. Wolter 1995, p. 76 and ''passim''</ref> For example, Book II Distinction 2, about the location of angels, is a starting point for a complex discussion about continuous motion, and whether the same thing can be in two different places at the same time ([[bilocation]]). In the same book, Distinction 3, he uses the question of how angels can be different from one another, given that they have no material bodies, to investigate the difficult question of [[individuation]] in general.\n\n[[File:By23 colophonsmaller.jpg|thumb|[[Colophon (publishing)|Colophon]] from the edition of Scotus' ''Sentences'' commentary edited by Thomas Penketh (died 1487) and Bartolomeo Bellati (died 1479), printed by Johannes de Colonia and Johannes Manthen, Venice in 1477. It reads ''Explicit Scriptum super Primum Sententiarum: editum a fratre Johanne Duns: ordinis fratrum minorum'' Printed versions of scholastic manuscripts became popular in the late fifteenth century.]]\n\nScotus wrote purely philosophical and logical works at an early stage of his career, consisting of commentaries on Aristotle's ''[[Organon]]''. These are the ''Questions'' on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'' and Aristotle's ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'', ''[[De Interpretatione|Peri hermeneias]]'', and ''[[Sophistical Refutations|De sophisticis elenchis]]'', probably dating to around 1295.<ref>See the introduction to the critical edition: ''Duns Scoti Quaestiones in librum Porphyrii Isagoge et Quaestiones super Praedicamenta Aristotelis'' (''Opera philosophica'', I), xxix–xxxiv, xli–xlii.</ref> His commentary on Aristotle's ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' was probably written in stages, the first version having started around 1297,<ref name=\"Pini 2005\">{{cite journal |last=Pini |first=Giorgio |title=Univocity in Scotus’s Quaestiones super Metaphysicam: The Solution to a Riddle |journal=Medioevo |year=2005 |volume=30 |pages=69–110 |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/pini/pini/Blank_files/Univocity%20in%20Scotus.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref> with significant additions and amendments possibly after the completion of the main body of the ''Ordinatio''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pini |first=Giorgio |title=Univocity in Scotus’s Quaestiones super Metaphysicam: The Solution to a Riddle|journal=Medioevo|year=2005|volume=30 |pages=69–110 |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/pini/pini/Blank_files/Univocity%20in%20Scotus.pdf|format=PDF}}, although this is speculative</ref> His ''Expositio'' on the ''Metaphysics'' was lost for centuries but was recently rediscovered and edited by Giorgio Pini.<ref name=\"StanW\">Thomas Williams (2009).

There were already concerns about this within two centuries of his death, when the 16th-century logician [[Jacobus Naveros]] noted inconsistencies between these texts and his commentary on the ''Sentences'', leading him to doubt whether he had written any logical works at all.<ref>Ashworth 1987</ref> ''The Questions on the Prior Analytics'' (''In Librum Priorum Analyticorum Aristotelis Quaestiones'') were also discovered to be mistakenly attributed.<ref>R.P.E. Longpre</ref> In 1922, [[Martin Grabmann|Grabmann]] showed that the logical work ''De modis significandi'' was actually by Thomas of Erfurt, a 14th-century logician of the [[modistae|modist school]]. Thus the claim that [[Martin Heidegger]] wrote his ''Habilitationsschrift'' on Scotus<ref>''Die Kategorien- und Bedeutungslehre des Duns Scotus'' (\"Duns Scotus' Theory of the Categories and of Meaning\", 1915)</ref> is only half true, as the second part is actually based on the work by Erfurt.\n\n== Metaphysics ==\n\n=== Realism ===\nScotus is generally considered to be a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] (as opposed to a [[nominalist]]) in that he treated universals as real. He attacks a position close to that later defended by [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], arguing that things have a common nature – for example the humanity common to [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Plutarch]].\n\n=== Univocity of being ===\nHe followed [[Aristotle]] in asserting that the subject matter of [[metaphysics]] is \"being qua being\" (''ens inquantum ens''). Being in general (''ens in communi''), as a univocal notion, was for him the first object of the intellect. Metaphysics includes the study of the transcendentals, so called because they transcend the division of being into finite and infinite and the further division of finite being into the ten [[Categories (Aristotle)|Aristotelian categories]]. Being itself is a transcendental, and so are the \"attributes\" of being—\"one,\" \"true,\" and \"good\"—which are coextensive with being, but which each add something to it. {{or|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe doctrine of the [[univocity of being]] implies the denial of any real distinction between [[essence]] and [[existence]]. [[Aquinas]] had argued that in all finite being (i.e. all except God) the essence of a thing is distinct from its existence. Scotus rejected the distinction. Scotus argued that we cannot conceive of what it is to be something, without conceiving it as existing. We should not make any distinction between whether a thing exists (''si est'') and what it is (''quid est''), for we never know whether something exists, unless we have some concept of what we know to exist.<ref>''Opus Oxoniense'' I iii 1–2, quoted in Grenz 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VjHTcrWmguQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 55]</ref>\n\n=== Individuation ===\nScotus elaborates a distinct view on [[hylomorphism]], with three important strong theses that differentiate him. He held: 1) that there exists [[matter]] that has no form whatsoever, or prime matter, as the stuff underlying all change, against Aquinas (cf. his ''Quaestiones in Metaphysicam'' 7, q. 5; ''Lectura'' 2, d. 12, q. un.), 2) that not all created substances are composites of form and matter (cf. ''Lectura'' 2, d. 12, q. un., n. 55), that is, that purely spiritual substances do exist, and 3) that one and the same substance can have more than one substantial form—for instance, humans have at least two substantial forms, the soul and the form of the body (''forma corporeitas'') (cf. ''Ordinatio'' 4, d. 11, q. 3, n. 54). He argued for an original principle of [[individuation]] (cf. ''Ordinatio'' 2, d. 3, pars 1, qq. 1–6), the \"[[haecceity]]\" as the ultimate unity of a unique individual (''haecceitas'', an entity's 'thisness'), as opposed to the common [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] (''natura communis''), feature existing in any number of individuals. For Scotus, the axiom stating that only the individual exists is a dominating principle of the understanding of reality. For the apprehension of individuals, an intuitive cognition is required, which gives us the present existence or the non-existence of an individual, as opposed to abstract cognition. Thus the human soul, in its separated state from the body, will be capable of knowing the spiritual intuitively.\n\n=== Formal distinction ===\nLike other realist philosophers of the period (such as Aquinas and [[Henry of Ghent]]) Scotus recognised the need for an intermediate distinction that was not merely conceptual but not fully real or mind-dependent either. Scotus argued for a [[formal distinction]] (''distinctio formalis a parte rei''), which holds between entities which are inseparable and indistinct in reality but whose definitions are not identical. For example, the personal properties of the [[Trinity]] are formally distinct from the Divine essence. Similarly, the distinction between the 'thisness' or ''haecceity'' of a thing is intermediate between a real and a conceptual distinction.<ref>Honderich p. 209</ref> There is also a formal distinction between the divine attributes and the powers of the soul.\n\n== Theology ==\n\n=== Voluntarism ===\nScotus was an Augustinian theologian. He is usually associated with [[Medieval theological voluntarism|theological voluntarism]], the tendency to emphasize God's will and human freedom in all philosophical issues. The main difference between [[Aquinas]]'s rational theology and that of Scotus is that Scotus believed certain predicates may be applied univocally&nbsp;– with exactly the same meaning&nbsp;– to God and creatures, whereas Aquinas insisted that this is impossible and that only analogical predication can be employed, in which a word as applied to God has a meaning different from, although related to, the meaning of that same word as applied to creatures. Duns struggled throughout his works in demonstrating his univocity theory against Aquinas's analogy doctrine.\n\n===Metaphysical argument for the existence of God===\nDuns Scotus argued that it is better to construct a metaphysical argument for the existence of God, rather than the more common physical argument from motion<ref>Lectura I, d. 2, q. 2, 40 Now efficiency can be considered either as a metaphysical or as a physical property. The metaphysical property is more extensive than the physical for “to give existence to another” is of broader scope than “to give existence by way of movement or change.” And even if all existence were given in the latter fashion, the notion of the one is still not that of the other. It is not efficiency as a physical attribute, however, but efficiency as the metaphysician considers it that provides a more effective way of proving God’s existence, for there are more attributes in metaphysics than in physics whereby the existence of God can be established. It can be shown, for example, from “composition and simplicity,” from “act and potency,” from “one and many,” from those features which are properties of being. Wherefore, if you find one extreme of the disjunction imperfectly realized in a creature, you conclude that the alternate, the perfect extreme exists in God.\nAverroës, therefore, in attacking Avicenna at the end of Bk. I of the Physics, 14 is incorrect when he claims that to prove that God exists is the job of the physicist alone, because this can be established only by way of motion, and in no other way —as if metaphysics began with a conclusion which was not evident in itself, but needed to be proved in physics (For Averroës asserts this falsehood at the end of the first book of the Physics). In point of fact, however, [God’s existence] can be shown more truly and in a greater variety of ways by means of those metaphysical attributes which characterize being. The proof lies in this that the first efficient cause imparts not merely this fluid existence [called motion] but existence in an unqualified sense, which is still more perfect and widespread.</ref> favoured by Aquinas,<ref>Summa Contra Gentiles, I, 13 http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13</ref> following Aristotle.<ref>\"We shall first set forth the arguments by which Aristotle proceeds to prove that God exists.\" SCG I, 13.2  http://dhspriory.org/thomas/ContraGentiles1.htm#13</ref> Though the version in ''De Primo Principio'' is the most complete and final version, the ''Ordinatio'' proof is usually offered. However, the ''De Primo'' version is fascinating and worth looking into for a wider understanding of the argument as well as Scotus's metaphysical underpinnings for his argument for God's existence, but we shall base this section of the article on the ''Ordinatio'' version. Let us briefly outline Scotus’s argument. He begins his proof by explaining that there are two angles we must take in arguing for the existence of an actually infinite being. First we must approach from the view of the Relative Properties of God; second, from the Absolute Properties of God. Relative properties are those which are predicable of God in relation to creation; absolute properties are those which belong to God whether or not He chose to create. Under the first heading of Relative Properties, Scotus argues for a triple primacy of efficiency, finality and pre-eminence. From there he shows that one primacy implies the others, and finally there can only be one nature that is the First Efficient Cause, Ultimate End, and the Most Perfect Nature. From there the Subtle Doctor discusses the Absolute Properties of God. The First Being is intellectual and volitional, and the intellect and will are identical with the essence of this supreme nature. The First Being is also infinite being. While discussing the infinity of God, Scotus resurrects Anselm’s That Than Which argument and responds to the criticism that Anselm makes an illicit leap from concept to reality. Finally, he gives a definite answer of ‘yes’ to the question of whether there exists an actually infinite being. The very next question of the ''Ordinatio'' deals with the unicity of the nature thus proved to exist. However, the ''De Primo Principio'' version concludes with this argument.\n\nSince the argument is very long and has many parts, we shall content ourselves in this article with stating the premises for the existence of the first efficient cause, assuming that the reader will follow the citations to read the rest of the argument.\nThe proof for the conclusion that \"some efficient cause is simply first such that neither can it be an effect nor can it, by virtue of something other than itself, cause an effect\" ''Ordinatio'' I.2.43<ref>[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus - Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] logicmuseum.com</ref> runs something like this:\n\n#\tSomething, A, is produced.\n#\tIt is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.\n#\tNot by nothing, for nothing causes nothing.\n#\tNot by itself, for an effect never causes itself.\n#\tTherefore, by another; call it B.\n#\tWe return to 2). B is produced either by itself, nothing, or another.  The ascending series will either continue infinitely or we finally reach something which has nothing prior to it.\n#\tAn infinite ascending series is impossible.\n#\tTherefore, a simply first efficient cause exists.\n\nScotus acknowledges two objections and deals with them accordingly. First is that he begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally ordered series of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially ordered series. Scotus explains the differences between the two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially order causes in a series is impossible.<ref>See paragraphs 46-55 at [http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus - Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] logicmuseum.com</ref> Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. \"It is possible that something can be produced\" is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He assures us that the last claim will be proved later in the argument.<ref>[http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B Duns Scotus - Ordinatio I/D2/Q2B] (See paragraph 56) logicmuseum.com</ref> In the ''Lectura'' proof, Scotus argues the following way:\n\n''Although beings different from God are actually contingent with respect to their factual existence, nevertheless, they are not with respect to their possible existence. Hence, those entities which are called contingent with respect to their factual existence are necessary with respect to their possible existence – for instance, although “There exists a man” is contingent, nevertheless “It is possible that he exists” is necessary, because his existence does not include any contradiction. Therefore, “Something – different from God – is possible” is necessary, because being is divided into the contingent and the necessary. Just as necessity belongs to a necessary being in virtue of its condition or its quiddity, so possibility belongs to a possible being in virtue of its quiddity. If the first argument is alternatively qualified with the notion of ontological possibility, then we have necessary propositions as follows: It is possible that there is something different from God – it is not of itself (because then it would not be the case that it were possible), nor from nothing. Therefore, it is possible that it is from something else. Either it is possible that the other agent acts by virtue of itself – and not by virtue of something else, not being from something else – or it is not possible. If so, then it is possible that there is a first agent, and if it [is] possible that it exists, then it exists, just as we have proved before. If not and if there is no infinite regress, then the argument at once comes to a standstill.''\n\nMore can and should be said about this fascinating argument, but we leave it to the reader to search out more of the argument. See especially http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Authors/Duns_Scotus/Ordinatio/Ordinatio_I/D2/Q2B.\n\n=== Illuminationism ===\nScotus argued against the version of [[illuminationism]] that had been defended earlier in the century by [[Henry of Ghent]]. In his ''Ordinatio'' (I.3.1.4) he argued against the sceptical consequences that Henry claimed would follow from abandoning divine illumination. Scotus argued that if our thinking were fallible in the way Henry had believed, such illumination could not, even in principle, ensure \"certain and pure knowledge.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Pasnau|first=Robert|title=Divine Illumination|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/illumination/ |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n:When one of those that come together is incompatible with certainty, then certainty cannot be achieved. For just as from one premise that is necessary and one that is contingent nothing follows but a contingent conclusion, so from something certain and something uncertain, coming together in some cognition, no cognition that is certain follows (''Ordinatio'' I.3.1.4 n.221).\n\n=== Immaculate conception ===\nPerhaps the most influential point of Duns Scotus's theology was his defense of the [[Immaculate Conception]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]] (i.e., that Mary herself was conceived without sin). At the time, there was a great deal of argument about the subject. The general opinion was that it was appropriately deferential to the [[Mother of God]], but it could not be seen how to resolve the problem that only with [[Jesus|Christ]]'s death would the stain of [[original sin]] be removed. The great philosophers and theologians of the West were divided on the subject (indeed, it appears that even [[Thomas Aquinas]] sided with those who denied the doctrine, though some [[Thomism|Thomists]] dispute this). The [[feast of the Immaculate Conception|feast day]] had existed in the East (though in the East, the feast is just of the Conception of Mary) since the seventh century and had been introduced in several dioceses in the West as well, even though the philosophical basis was lacking. Citing [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s principle, \"''potuit, decuit, ergo fecit''\" (He [i.e., God] could do it, it was appropriate, therefore He did it), Duns Scotus devised the following argument: Mary was in need of redemption like all other human beings, but through the merits of Jesus' [[crucifixion]], given in advance, she was conceived without the stain of original sin. God could have brought it about (1) that she was never in original sin, (2) she was in sin only for an instant, (3) she was in sin for a period of time, being purged at the last instant. Whichever of these options was most excellent should probably be attributed to Mary.<ref>''Ordinatio'' III, d.3, q.1</ref> This apparently careful statement provoked a storm of opposition at Paris, and suggested the line 'fired France for Mary without spot' in the famous poem \"Duns Scotus's Oxford,\" by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]].\n\nScotus's argument appears in [[Pope Pius IX]]'s 1854 declaration of the [[dogma]] of the Immaculate Conception, \"at the first moment of Her conception, Mary was preserved free from the stain of original sin, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ.\"<ref name=\"Life\">{{cite web |title=The Life of Blessed John Duns Scotus|publisher=EWTN|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/scotus.htm}}</ref> Scotus's position was hailed as \"a correct expression of the faith of the Apostles.\"<ref name=\"Life\"/>\n\nAnother of Scotus's positions also gained official approval of the Roman Catholic Church: his doctrine on the universal primacy of Christ became the underlying rationale for the feast of Christ the King instituted in 1925.<ref name=\"Life\"/>\n\nDuring his pontificate, [[Pope John XXIII]] recommended the reading of Duns Scotus's theology to modern theology students.\n\n== Veneration ==\nLong honored as a [[beatification|Blessed]] by the Order of Friars Minor, as well as in the [[Archdiocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] and [[Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]], in the 19th-century the process was started seeking his recognition as such by the [[Holy See]], on the basis of a ''[[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] immemorabilis'', i.e., one of ancient standing.<ref name=\"CE\" /> He was declared [[Venerable]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1991, who officially recognized his liturgical cult, effectively [[beatification|beatifying]] him on 20 March 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1993/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19930320_scoto-belanger_sp.html|work=Vatican News Service|title=Ceremonia de Reconocimiento del Culto Litúrgico a Duns Escoto y Beatificación de Dina Bélanger|date=20 March 1993}}{{es}}</ref>\n\n== Later reputation and influence ==\n\n=== Later medieval period ===\nOwing to Scotus's early and unexpected death, he left behind a large body of work in an unfinished or unedited condition. His students and disciples extensively edited his papers, often confusing them with works by other writers, in many cases leading to misattribution and confused transmission. Most 13th-century Franciscans followed [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], but the influence of Scotus (as well as that of his arch-rival [[William of Ockham]]) spread in the fourteenth century. Franciscan theologians in the late Middle Ages were thus divided between so-called Scotists and Ockhamists.<ref>Janz</ref> Fourteenth century followers included [[Francis of Mayrone]] (died 1325), [[Antonius Andreas]] (died 1320), [[William of Alnwick]] (died 1333), and John of Bassolis (died 1347), supposedly Scotus's favourite student.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Courtenay|first=William|title=Early Scotists at Paris: A Reconsideration|journal=Franciscan Studies|date=January 2012|volume=69|issue=1|pages=175–229|doi=10.1353/frc.2012.0009|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/franciscan_studies/v069/69.courtenay.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Sixteenth to nineteenth centuries ===\nHis reputation suffered during the [[English reformation]], probably due to its association with the Franciscans. In a letter to [[Thomas Cromwell]] about his visit to Oxford in 1535, [[Richard Layton]] described how he saw the court of New College full of pages from Scotus's work, \"the wind blowing them into every corner.\"<ref>R.W. Dixon, ''History of the Church of England from the Abolition of the Roman Jurisdiction'', 1:303</ref> [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described the Oxford Greyfriar's library in 1538 (just prior to its dissolution) as an accumulation of 'cobwebs, moths and bookworms.'<ref>Catto, Jeremy, \"Franciscan Learning in England, 1450–1540\", in ''The Religious Orders in Pre-Reformation England'', ed. Clarke 2002</ref>\n\nDespite this, Scotism grew in Catholic Europe. Scotus's works were collected into many editions, particularly in the late fifteenth century with the advent of [[printing]]. His school was probably at the height of its popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries there were even special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcalá, Padua, and Pavia. It flourished well into the seventeenth century, and its influence can be seen in such writers as [[Descartes]] and Bramhall. Interest dwindled in the eighteenth century, and the revival of scholastic philosophy, known as [[Neo-Scholasticism]], was essentially a revival of Thomistic thinking.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nThe twentieth century saw a resurgence of interest in Scotus, with a range of assessments of his thought.\n\nOn the one hand, Scotus has received interest from secular philosophers such as Peter King, Gyula Klima, Paul Vincent Spade, and others.\n\nFor some today, Scotus is one of the most important [[Franciscan]] theologians and the founder of [[Scotism]], a special form of [[Scholasticism]]. He came out of the Old Franciscan School, to which [[Haymo of Faversham]] (died 1244), [[Alexander of Hales]] (died 1245), [[John of Rupella]] (died 1245), [[William of Melitona]] (died 1260), St. [[Bonaventure]] (died 1274), [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Matthew of Aquasparta]] (died 1289), [[John Peckham]], Archbishop of Canterbury (died 1292), [[Richard of Middletown]] (died c. 1300), etc., belonged. He was known as \"Doctor Subtilis\" because of the subtle distinctions and nuances of his thinking. Later philosophers in the sixteenth century were less complimentary about his work and accused him of [[Sophism|sophistry]]. This led to the word \"[[dunce]],\" which developed from the name \"Dunse\" given to his followers in the 1500s, becoming used for \"somebody who is incapable of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]].\"\n\nAn important question since the 1960s has revolved over whether Scotus's thought heralded a change in thinking on the nature of 'being,' a change which marked a shift from Aquinas and other previous thinkers; this question has been particularly significant in recent years because it has come to be seen as a debate over the origins of 'modernity.' This line of argument first emerged in the 1960s among popular French philosophers who, in passing, singled out Duns Scotus as the figure whose theory of univocal being changed an earlier approach which Aquinas had shared with his predecessors.<ref>J Derrida, ''L'Écriture et la différence'', (Paris, 1967), p216; G Deleuze, ''Différence et répétition,'' (Paris, 1968), pp. 52–8, cited in John Marenbon, \"Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth\", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, ''Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth'', (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56.</ref> Then, in 1990, the historian of philosophy Jean-Francois Courtine argued that, between the time of Aquinas in the mid-thirteenth century and [[Francisco Suárez]] at the turn of the seventeenth, a fundamentally new approach to being was developed, with Scotus taking a major part in its development.<ref>John Marenbon, \"Aquinas, Radical Orthodoxy, and the importance of truth\", in Wayne J Hankey and Douglas Hedley, eds, ''Deconstructing radical orthodoxy: postmodern theology, rhetoric and truth'', (Ashgate, 2005), p. 56.</ref> During the 1990s, various scholars extended this argument to locate Scotus as the first thinker who succumbed to what [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] termed 'onto-theology'. In recent years, this criticism of Scotus has become disseminated in particular through the writings of the 'Radical Orthodox' group of theologians, centred around [[John Milbank]] and [[Catherine Pickstock]].\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n;Works in rough chronological order\n* Before 1295:\n** ''Parva logicalia''\n*** ''Quaestiones super Porphyrii Isagogem''\n*** ''Quaestiones in librum Praedicamentorum''\n*** ''Quaestiones in I et II librum Perihermeneias''\n*** ''Octo quaestiones in duos libros Perihermeneias''\n*** ''Quaestiones in libros Elenchorum''\n* ''Quaestiones super libros De anima'' (1295–1298?)\n* ''Quaestiones super libros Metaphysicorum Aristotelis'' (1298–1300?; revised later)\n* ''Notabilia Scoti super Metaphysicam'' (a set of notes concerning books II-X and XII of Aristotle’s ''Metaphysics'', discovered only in 1996<ref>Giorgio Pini, \"Duns Scotus' Literal Commentary on the «Metaphysics» and the «Notabilia Scoti super Metaphysicam» (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, C 62 Sup, ff.51r-98r)\", ''Bulletin de philosophie médiévale'', 38 (1996), 141–142.</ref>)\n* ''Lectura'' (Early Oxford Lectures on the four books of the ''Sentences'' of Peter Lombard)\n** Books 1 and 2 (1300–1301)\n** Book 3 (probably written in Paris, 1303–04)\n** Book 4 (not extant)\n* ''Ordinatio'' or ''Opus Oxoniense'' (Oxford Lectures: a revision of the lectures given at Oxford, books 1 and 2 summer 1300-1302, books 3 and 4, 1303–1304)\n* ''Collationes oxonienses'' (1303–04 or 1305–08)\n* ''Collationes parisienses'' (1302–07)\n* ''Reportatio parisiensis'' (Paris Lectures, 1302–07)\n* ''Quaestiones Quodlibetales'' (edited by Felix Alluntis in ‘’Obras del Doctor Sutil, Juan Duns Escoto,’’ Madrid, Biblioteca de Autores Cristianos, 1963)\n* ''Tractatus de Primo Principio'' (Treatise on the First Principle) [http://www.ewtn.com/library/THEOLOGY/GODASFIR.HTM English Translation]\n* ''Theoremata'' (uncertain date)\n\n;Dubious works\n* ''Theoremata''\n\n;Spurious works\n* ''De Rerum Principio'' (Of the Beginning of Things).
