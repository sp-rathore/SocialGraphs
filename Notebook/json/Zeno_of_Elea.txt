The main sources on the nature of Zeno's arguments on motion, in fact, come from the writings of [[Aristotle]] and [[Simplicius of Cilicia]].<ref name=Cajori1920>{{cite journal |last1=Cajori |first1=Florian |title=The Purpose of Zeno's Arguments on Motion |journal=Isis |date=1920 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7–20 |doi=10.1086/357889}}</ref>\n\nPlato says that Zeno's writings were \"brought to Athens for the first time on the occasion of\" the visit of Zeno and Parmenides.<ref name=parm /> Plato also has Zeno say that this work, \"meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides\",<ref name=parm /> was written in Zeno's youth, stolen, and published without his consent.

Parmenides is said{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} to be the first individual to implement this style of argument.  This form of argument soon became known as the ''epicheirema'' (ἐπιχείρημα). In Book VII of his ''Topics'', [[Aristotle]] says that an ''epicheirema'' is \"a dialectical [[syllogism]].\" It is a connected piece of reasoning which an opponent has put forward as true. The disputant sets out to break down the dialectical syllogism. This destructive method of argument was maintained by him to such a degree that [[Seneca the Younger]] commented a few centuries later, \"If I accede to Parmenides there is nothing left but the One; if I accede to Zeno, not even the One is left.\"<ref name=zeno>''Zeno'' in ''The Presocratics'', Philip Wheelwright ed., The Odyssey Press, 1966, pp. 106–107.</ref>\n\nZeno is also regarded as the first philosopher who dealt with the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical [[infinity]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nAccording to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], in [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] (1870)<ref name=Smith>{{cite DGRBM |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pr8_AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA125&dq=cosmogony+of+Parmenides,+which+was+carried+out+very&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8oBpVcvrAa2v7AaezoP4Dg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=cosmogony%20of%20Parmenides%2C%20which%20was%20carried%20out%20very&f=false |title=Parmenides |year=1870 |page=125}}</ref>\n:''Others content themselves with reckoning [[Parmenides]] as well as ''Zeno'' as belonging to the [[Pythagorean school]], or with speaking of a ''Parraenidean life'', in the same way as a ''Pythagorean life'' is spoken of; and even the censorious Timon allows Parmenides to have been a high-minded man; while Plato speaks of him with veneration, and Aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the Eleatics.''\n\n== Zeno's paradoxes ==\n{{Main| Zeno's paradoxes}}\nZeno's paradoxes have puzzled, challenged, influenced, inspired, infuriated, and amused philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists for over two millennia.
