Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.<ref>Robert Cecil, ''The Myth of the Master Race: Alfred Rosenberg and Nazi Ideology'', pp. 42–3.

He later formed the \"[[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question|Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question]],\" dedicated to identifying and attacking Jewish influence in German culture and to recording the history of Judaism from a radical nationalist perspective. He became a [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Deputy in 1930 and published his book on [[Master race|racial theory]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (''Der Mythus des 20.

Another event of 1933 was Rosenberg's visit to Britain, intended to give the impression that the Nazis would not be a threat and to encourage links between the new regime and the [[British Empire]].

Rosenberg built on the works of [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Madison Grant]], as well as on the beliefs of Hitler. He placed Blacks and Jews at the very bottom of the ladder, while at the very top stood the white \"[[Aryan]]\" race. Rosenberg promoted the [[Nordic theory]] which regarded Nordics as the \"[[master race]]\",<ref>\nRosenberg wrote: \"No people of Europe is racially homogeneous, also Germany is not. According to the latest research, we accept five races all of which reveal perceptibly different types. But it is beyond question that the true culture bearer for Europe has been in the first place the Nordic race. Great heroes, artists and founders of states have grown from this blood.\"  (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Pages 576 - 1930\n</ref><ref>\nThough Rosenberg does not use the word \"master race\". He uses the word \"Herrenvolk\" (i.e. ruling people) twice in his book ''The Myth'', first referring to the [[Amorite]]s (saying that [[Archibald Sayce|Sayce]] described them as fair skinned and blue eyed) and secondly quoting [[Victor Wallace Germains]]' description of the English in \"The Truth about Kitchener\". (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Pages 26, 660 - 1930\n</ref>\nsuperior to all others, including to other Aryans (Indo-Europeans).\n\nRosenberg reshaped Nazi racial policy over the years, but it always consisted of Aryan supremacy, extreme German nationalism and rabid antisemitism. Rosenberg also outspokenly opposed homosexuality – notably in his pamphlet \"Der Sumpf\" (\"The Swamp\", 1927) – he viewed homosexuality (particularly lesbianism{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}) as a hindrance to the expansion of the Nordic population.\n\nRosenberg's attitude towards [[Slav]]s was flexible and depended on the particular nation involved.<ref>Rosenberg wrote: \"The Czechs, for their part, were stratified by race into a Nordic-Slavic nobility, and lower orders of an Alpine Dinaric stamp, thus displaying that type which the modern Czech so plainly embodies.\" Page 108, \"The one eyed maniacal Ziska of Trocnow, whose head in the Prague National Museum shows him to have been an eastern hither Asiatic type, was the first expression of this totally destructive Taborite movement, which the Czechs must thank for the extermination of the last remaining Germanic powers active within them, as well as the repression of all that was truly Slavic.

His personality often makes its appearance as soft and pitying, then, again, bluff and rough. But it is always supported by inward fire. It was in the interest of the Roman church, with its lust for power, to represent subservient humility as the essence of Christ in order to create as many servants as possible for this motivated \"ideal\". To correct this representation is a further ineradicable requirement of the German movement for renewal. Jesus appears to us today as self-confident lord in the best and highest sense of the word.\" (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Page 604 - 1930</ref><ref>Rosenberg wrote: \"For this reason Jesus, in spite of all Christian churches, signifies a pivotal point in our history. He became the god of the Europeans, yet, not seldom did he appear in a repellent distortion. <br> If the concentrated feeling of personality which built Gothic cathedrals and inspired a [[w:Rembrandt|Rembrandt]] portrait penetrated more clearly into the consciousness of the general public, a new wave of culture would begin. But the prerequisite for this is the overcoming of the former statutory values of the \"Christian\" churches.\" (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - page 391 - 1930</ref> based on Chamberlain's claim that Jesus was a member of an Indo-European, Nordic enclave resident in ancient [[Galilee]] who struggled against Judaism.<ref>Rosenberg quotes Dr. Emil Jung referring to statements by the Syrian Christian preacher [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephraem]] (4th century): \"Jesus' mother was a Danaite woman, (that is, someone born in Dan) and he had a Latin as father. Ephraem sees this to be not unhonorable and adds: 'Jesus thus derived his ancestry from two of the greatest and most famous nations, namely, from the Syrians on the maternal side and from the Romans on the paternal.'\" (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Page 76 - 1930</ref><ref>Rosenberg wrote: \"Herder once demanded that the religion dedicated to Jesus should become a religion of Jesus. This was what Chamberlain strove for. A completely free man who disposed inwardly over the entire culture of our times, he has shown the deepest sensitivity for the superhuman simplicity of Christ. He represented Jesus as what he had once appeared to be: a mediator between man and god.\" (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Page 623 - 1930</ref> Significantly, in his work explicating the Nazi intellectual belief system, ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', Rosenberg cryptically alludes to and lauds the anti-Judaic arch-heretic [[Marcionism|Marcion]] and the Manichaean-inspired, \"Aryo-Iranian\" [[Cathari]], as being the more authentic interpreters of Christianity versus historically dominant Judaeo-Christianity;<ref>Rosenberg writes: \"It is characteristic of Roman Christianity that where possible it eliminates the personality of its founder, in order to put in its place the church structure of a rulership by priests.\" (''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'') - pages 160 - 1930</ref> moreover these ancient, externally Christian metaphysical forms were more \"organically compatible with the Nordic sense of the spiritual and the Nordic 'blood-soul'.\" For Rosenberg, the anti-intellectual intellectual, religious [[doctrine]] was inseparable,<ref>Rosenberg wrote: \"The ancient Germanic idea of god is likewise inconceivable without spiritual freedom. Jesus also spoke of the kingdom of heaven within us. The strength of spiritual search already shows itself in the world wanderer, Odin, and can be seen in the seeker and believer, [[Meister Eckhart|Eckehart]], and we see it in all great men from [[Martin Luther|Luther]] to [[Paul de Lagarde|Lagarde]]. This soul also lived within the venerable [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas of Aquinas]]<!--[sic]--> and in the majority of the occidental fathers of the church.\" (\"The Myth of the Twentieth Century\") - Page 247 - 1930</ref> from serving the interests of the Nordic race, connecting the individual to his racial nature.<ref>Rosenberg wrote:\"A keen observer has correctly remarked that the Jesus child of the Sistine Madonna is “frankly heroic” in gaze and posture (Wölfflin). That is aptly expressed except that the fundamental ground is lacking as to why the allegedly Jewish family had a heroic look to it. Here, only composition and color distribution, not \"inwardness\" and \"dedication\", are determining. These are the prerequisites to the success of a formative will, once again, the racial ideal of beauty. To see in place of the light-brown haired, light skinned Jesus child a blue black, woolly haired, brown skinned Jew boy would be an impossibility. Equally, we cannot think of a Jewish Mother of god next to the holy, even if the latter had the \"noble face\" of an Offenbach or Disraeli.\" (''The Myth of the Twentieth Century'') - page 297 - 1930</ref>  Rosenberg stated that \"The general ideas of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman]] and of the Protestant churches are negative Christianity and do not, therefore, accord with our (German) soul.\"<ref>{{cite news | author= | title=Churchmen to Hitler | date=10 August 1936 | work= [[Time Magazine]] | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762289,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate= 14 August 2008}}</ref><ref>Rosenberg wrote: \"The Jewish idea of the \"slave of god\", one who receives mercy from an arbitrary, absolutist god, has thus passed over to Rome and Wittenberg, and can be attributed to Paul as the actual creator of this doctrine, which is to say that our churches are not Christian but Pauline. Jesus unquestionably praised the One-Being with god. This was his redemption, his goal. He did not preach a condescending granting of mercy from an almighty being in the face of which even the greatest human soul represented a pure nothingness. This doctrine of mercy is naturally very welcome to every church. With such misinterpretation the church and its leaders appear as the \"representatives of god\".

[[Hermann Goering]] used the ERR to collect art for his own personal gratification. \nHe created a \"Special Task Force for Music\" (''Sonderstab Musik'') to collect the best [[musical instrument]]s and scores for use in a university to be built in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]], [[Austria]]. The orders given the ''Sonderstab Musik'' were to loot all forms of Jewish property in Germany and of those found in any country taken over by the German army and any musical instruments or scores were to be immediately shipped to [[Berlin]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories===\n[[File:D318029 k.jpg|thumbnail|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]\nFollowing [[Operation Barbarossa|the invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], Rosenberg was appointed head of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] (''Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete''). [[Alfred Meyer]] served as his deputy and represented him at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Another official of the Ministry, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], also attended the conference, at Rosenberg's request.\n\nRosenberg had presented Hitler with his plan for the organization of the conquered Eastern territories, suggesting the establishment of new administrative districts, to replace the previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories with new [[Reichskommissar]]iats. These would be:\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)\n\nAlthough Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,<ref>David Irving, Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich, p.769</ref> such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical \"[[Lebensraum]] im Osten\" plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.\n\nFollowing these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.<ref name = \"kev\">Kevin P.

The Jewish Question will only be solved for Germany when the last Jew has left German territory, and for Europe when not a single Jew stands on the European continent as far as the Urals... And to this end it is necessary to force them beyond the Urals or otherwise bring about their eradication.<ref>Peter Longerich, Holocaust: The Nazi Persecution and Murder of the Jews, p.289</ref>}}\n\nHe made no complaints about the murders of Jews. At the [[Nuremberg Trials]] he claimed to be ignorant of the [[Holocaust]], despite the fact that Leibbrandt and Meyer were present at the [[Wannsee conference]].<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Leibbrandt.html|title=Georg Leibbrandt &#124; Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Wartime propaganda efforts===\nSince the invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] intended to impose the [[New Order (political system)|New Order]], it was essentially a war of conquest. German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as the Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were ''somewhat'' able to win him over.<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]</ref>\n\nAmongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann Göring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as \"stupid\".<ref>Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941–1945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169–171.</ref>\n\nThere were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for \"volunteer\" labour, with inscriptions like \"Come work with us to shorten the war\", hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother of Rosenberg's initiatives, the \"Free Caucasus\" campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the Eastern Front.\n\n===Trial and execution===\n[[File:Alfred Jodl, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|upright|thumb|Alfred Rosenberg (right) at the Nuremberg trials, with [[Hans Frank]] (centre) and [[Alfred Jodl]]]]\n[[File:Defendants Nuremberg-War-Crimes-Tribunal 1945-11-27.jpg|thumb|1946 Nuremberg courtroom: Rosenberg (front row, left)]]\nRosenberg was captured by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops at the end of the war in [[Flensburg]]-[[Mürwik]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99007254 |title=Allies Capture Nazi Pagan Philosopher. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star|Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876–1954)]] |location=Lismore, NSW |date=22 May 1945 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was tried at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and found guilty of all four counts: conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[wars of aggression]]; [[war crimes]]; and [[crimes against humanity]].

ISBN 0-396-06577-5</ref>\n\nRosenberg's influence in the Nazi Party is controversial. He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views: rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure \"Race\" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by \"Providence\". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a \"positive Christianity\".\n\nAfter Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|page= 109|isbn= 0-19-280206-2|oclc = 47063365\n|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations.

Further, Hitler felt that Catholic-Protestant infighting had been a major factor in weakening the German state and allowing its dominance by foreign powers.\n\nSome Nazi leaders, such as [[Martin Bormann]], were [[anti-Christian]] and sympathetic to Rosenberg.<ref>Stiegmann-Gall, Richard, ''The Holy Reich'', CUP, pp. 243–5</ref> Once in power, Hitler and most Nazi leaders sought to unify the Christian denominations in favor of \"positive Christianity\".
