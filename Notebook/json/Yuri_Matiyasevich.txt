He is best known for his negative solution of [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] ([[Matiyasevich's theorem]]), presented in his [[doctoral thesis]], at [[LOMI]] (the Leningrad Department of the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]]).\n\n== Biography ==\n\n* In 1962–1963, Matiyasevich studied at [[Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239]];  \t\n* In 1963–1964, he studied at [http://www.pms.ru/glavnaya/1.html Kolmogorov School];\n* In 1964–1969, Matiyasevich studied at [http://www.math.spbu.ru/en/ Mathematics & Mechanics Faculty] of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]]. As a winner of [[International Mathematical Olympiad|IMO]] Yuri Matiyasevich was accepted without exams to [[Saint Petersburg State University|LSU]], skipping the last year of high school studies.\n* In 1966, he presented a talk at [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] held in [[Moscow]]. He was a second-year undergraduate student at that time.\n* In 1969–1970, he pursued Ph.D. studies at [[LOMI|Leningrad Department]] of [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] under supervision of [http://www.mathsoc.spb.ru/pers/maslov/ Sergey Maslov]. \n* In 1970, he received his Ph.D. degree at [[LOMI]].\n* In 1970–1974, he was a researcher at [[LOMI]]. \n* In 1972, he obtained a second doctoral degree (called \"doktor nauk\" in [[Soviet Union]]).\n* In 1974–1980, he was a senior researcher at [[LOMI]]. \n* Since 1980, Yuri Matiyasevich has been the head of [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru Laboratory of mathematical logic] at [[LOMI]].\n* Since 1995, he has been a professor of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint-Petersburg State University]], initially at the chair of software engineering, later at the chair of algebra and number theory. \n* In 1997, he was elected as a corresponding member of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].\n* Since 1998, Yuri Matiyasevich has been a vice-president of [[St. Petersburg Mathematical Society]].\n* Since 2002, he has been a head of [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~olymp/ St.Petersburg City Mathematical Olympiad].\n* Since 2003, Matiyasevich has been a co-director of annual German–Russian student school [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/jass07/ JASS].\n* In 2008, he was elected as a full member of [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n* 1964: gold medal at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] held in [[Moscow]].\n* 1970:  \"Young mathematician prize\" of the [[St. Petersburg Mathematical Society|Leningrad Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.mathsoc.spb.ru/prizes.html]</ref>\n* 1980: Markov Prize of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]].\n* 1996: Honorary Degree, Université d'Auvergne.\n* 1998: he received [[The Humboldt Prize|Humboldt Research Award to Outstanding Scholars]].\n* 2003: Honorary Degree, [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]] (UPMC).\n* 2007: Member of the [[Bavaria|Bayern]] Academy of Sciences.\n\n== Notable facts ==\n\n* A polynomial related to colorings of triangulation of sphere was named after Matiyasevich; see [http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~duzhin/papers/mati-pol.ps.gz The Matiyasevich polynomial, four colour theorem and weight systems].\n* He was a member of the [[American Mathematical Society]] and the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]]; and also of the editorial boards for the journals [https://web.archive.org/web/20070405101041/http://www.vsppub.com/journals/jn-DisMatApp.html Discrete Mathematics and Applications] and [http://www.ipo.spb.ru/journal/ Computer Instruments in Education].\n* Notable students include: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070112070241/http://www.eldar.com/eldar/eldar.htm Eldar Musayev], [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~vsemir/ Maxim Vsemirnov], [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~pastor/ Alexei Pastor], [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~dvk/ Dmitri Karpov].\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Book ===\n*Yuri Matiyasevich [http://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/~yumat/H10Pbook/index.html  ''Hilbert's 10th Problem''], Foreword by [[Martin Davis]] and [[Hilary Putnam]], The MIT Press, 1993.
