Through a detailed investigation of the nature of the [[succession to Muhammad]], she cast doubt on the validity of some of the ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings and traditions attributed to him), and therefore the subordination of women that she sees in Islam, but not necessarily in the [[Qur'an]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/Public/fatima_mernissi.html |title=Mernissi, Fatima |author=<!--Oxford Islamic Studies; no by-line.-->|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}</ref> She wrote extensively about life within harems, gender, and public and private spheres.<ref>{{cite web|title=WISE|url=http://www.wisemuslimwomen.org/muslimwomen/bio/fatema_mernissi/|work=Fatema Mernissi|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAs a sociologist, Mernissi mainly did field work in Morocco. On several occasions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she conducted interviews in order to map prevailing attitudes to women and work. She did sociological research for [[UNESCO]] and [[ILO]] as well as for the Moroccan authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morocco.com/blog/notable-feminist-fatema-mernissi/|title=Notable Feminist Fatema Mernissi |accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref>   In the same period, Mernissi contributed articles to periodicals and other publications on women in Morocco and women and Islam from a contemporary as well as from a historical perspective.

''Beyond the Veil'' has become a classic, especially in the fields of anthropology and sociology on women in the Arab World, the Mediterranean area or Muslim societies in general.\n\nHer most famous book, as an Islamic feminist, ''The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam'', is a quasi-historical study of role of the [[Muhammad's marriages|wives of Muhammad]]. It was first published in French in 1987, and translated into English in 1991. The book was banned in Morocco, Iran, and the Gulf states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/mightymuslimah/fatima-mernissi-beyond-veil/80726/|title=Fatima Mernissi: going beyond the veil to fight misogynist interpretations of Islam|last=Evita Saraswati|first=Raquel|date=2014-10-16|website=Aquila Style|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n\nFor ''Doing Daily Battle: Interviews with Moroccan Women'' (1991), she interviewed peasant women, women labourers, clairvoyants and maidservants.
