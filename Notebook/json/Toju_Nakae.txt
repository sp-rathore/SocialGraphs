He taught that the highest virtue was [[filial piety]] (''kō''), and acted upon this, giving up his official post in 1634 in order to return to his home in [[Takashima District, Shiga|Takashima]], Ōmi to care of his mother.  He distinguished, however, between ''sho-kō'' and ''dai-kō'': lesser and greater filial piety.  ''Sho-kō'' involves the normal care owed by children to their parents; ''dai-kō'' involves the notion that our human parents are themselves the children of the divine parents &mdash; thus, if one's parents are wrong, then one should encourage them to return to virtue.\n\nHe was unusual in believing that his teaching would be useful to women as well as men.  While accepting the then standard view of women as usually lacking such virtues as compassion and honesty, he argued: \"if a wife's disposition is healthy and pious, obedient, sympathetic and honest, then ... every member of her family will be at peace and the entire household in perfect order.\"<ref>Bodart-Bailey, Beatrice.

Nakae added a more religious aspect to Wang's \"School of Intuition of Mind\", calling the human conscience the \"divine light of heaven\".  Nakae's works also supplied his followers (such as [[Kumazawa Banzan]] [1619&ndash;1691]) with \"the moral foundation for political action\".<ref>Bodart-Bailey, p. 741.</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nIn a statistical overview derived from writings by and about Toju Nakae, [[OCLC]]/[[WorldCat]] encompasses roughly 130+ works in 200 publications in 5 languages and 740+ library holdings.<ref>[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm  WorldCat Identities]: [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n81-127208  中江藤樹 1608-1648]</ref>\n{{dynamic list}}\n* 1650 -- ''Dialogue with the elder'' (''Okina mondō'').<ref>Shirane, Haruo.
