His [[political philosophy]] influenced the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in France and across Europe, as well as aspects of the [[French Revolution]] and the overall development of modern political and educational thought.\n\nRousseau's novel ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' is a treatise on the education of the whole person for citizenship. His [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' was of importance to the development of pre-romanticism<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/preromanticism |title=Preromanticism Criticism |publisher=Enotes |accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> and [[romanticism]] in fiction.<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Darnton | title = The Great Cat Massacre | chapter = 6.

His ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' are cornerstones in modern political and social thought.\n\nDuring the period of the [[French Revolution]], Rousseau was the most popular of the [[philosophes]] among members of the [[Jacobin Club]]. Rousseau was interred as a national hero in the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]] in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth===\nRousseau was born in [[Geneva]], which was at the time a [[History of Geneva#Reformation|city-state]] and a Protestant associate of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]. Since 1536, Geneva had been a [[Huguenot]] republic and the seat of [[Calvinism]]. Five generations before Rousseau, his ancestor Didier, a bookseller who may have published Protestant tracts, had escaped persecution from French Catholics by fleeing to Geneva in 1549, where he became a wine merchant.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nRousseau was proud that his family, of the ''moyen'' order (or middle-class), had voting rights in the city. Throughout his life, he generally signed his books \"Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Citizen of Geneva\".{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 31}}\n\nGeneva, in theory, was governed democratically by its male voting \"citizens\". The citizens were a minority of the population when compared to the immigrants, referred to as \"inhabitants\", whose descendants were called \"natives\" and continued to lack suffrage. In fact, rather than being run by vote of the \"citizens\", the city was ruled by a small number of wealthy families that made up the \"Council of Two Hundred\"; these delegated their power to a twenty-five member executive group from among them called the \"Little Council\".\n\nThere was much political debate within Geneva, extending down to the tradespeople. Much discussion was over the idea of the sovereignty of the people, of which the ruling class oligarchy was making a mockery. In 1707, a democratic reformer named [[Pierre Fatio]] protested this situation, saying \"a sovereign that never performs an act of sovereignty is an imaginary being\".{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} He was shot by order of the Little Council. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's father, Isaac, was not in the city at this time, but Jean-Jacques’s grandfather supported Fatio and was penalized for it.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 31}}\n\n[[File:Rousseau Geneve House.JPG|thumb|upright|The house where Rousseau was born at number 40, Grand-Rue.]]\nThe trade of watchmaking had become a family tradition by the time of Rousseau's father, Isaac Rousseau. Isaac followed his grandfather, father and brothers into the business, except for a short stint teaching dance as a dance master.{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  Isaac, notwithstanding his artisan status, was well educated and a lover of music. \"A Genevan watchmaker\", Rousseau wrote, \"is a man who can be introduced anywhere; a Parisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches\".{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005| p = 31 | ps =: \"And indeed, a British visitor commented, 'Even the lower class of people [of Geneva] are exceedingly well informed, and there is perhaps no city in Europe where learning is more universally diffused'; another at mid-century noticed that Genevan workmen were fond of reading the works of Locke and Montesquieu.\"}} In 1699, Isaac ran into political difficulty by entering a quarrel with visiting English officers, who in response drew their swords and threatened him. After local officials stepped in, it was Isaac who was punished, as Geneva was concerned with maintaining its ties to foreign powers.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nRousseau's mother, Suzanne Bernard Rousseau, was from an upper-class family. She was raised by her uncle Samuel Bernard, a Calvinist preacher. He cared for Suzanne after her father Jacques (who had run into trouble with the legal and religious authorities for fornication and having a mistress) died in his early thirties.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  In 1695, Suzanne had to answer charges that she had attended a street theater disguised as a peasant woman so she could gaze upon M. Vincent Sarrasin, whom she fancied despite his continuing marriage. After a hearing, she was ordered by the [[Genevan Consistory]] to never interact with him again.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} She married Rousseau's father at the age of 31. Isaac's sister had married Suzanne's brother eight years earlier, after she had become pregnant and they had been chastised by the Consistory. The child died at birth. Later, the young Rousseau was told a romantic fairy-tale about the situation by the adults in his family—a tale where young love was denied by a disapproving patriarch but that prevailed by sibling loyalty that, in the story, resulted in love conquering all and two marriages uniting the families on the same day. Rousseau never learnt the truth.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nRousseau was born on 28 June 1712, and he would later relate: \"I was born almost dying, they had little hope of saving me\".{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} He was baptized on 4 July 1712, in the great cathedral.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} His mother died of [[puerperal fever]] nine days after his birth, which he later described as \"the first of my misfortunes\".{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nHe and his older brother François were brought up by their father and a paternal aunt, also named Suzanne. When Rousseau was five, his father sold the house that the family had received from his mother's relatives. While the idea was that his sons would inherit the principal when grown up and he would live off the interest in the meantime, in the end the father took most of the substantial proceeds.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} With the selling of the house, the Rousseau family moved out of the upper-class neighborhood and moved into an apartment house in a neighborhood of craftsmen—silversmiths, engravers, and other watchmakers.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} Growing up around craftsmen, Rousseau would later contrast them favorably to those who produced more aesthetic works, writing \"those important persons who are called artists rather than artisans, work solely for the idle and rich, and put an arbitrary price on their baubles\".{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} Rousseau was also exposed to class politics in this environment, as the artisans often agitated in a campaign of resistance against the privileged class running Geneva.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nRousseau had no recollection of learning to read, but he remembered how when he was 5 or 6 his father encouraged his love of reading:\n{{quote |text=Every night, after supper, we read some part of a small collection of romances [i.e., adventure stories], which had been my mother's. My father's design was only to improve me in reading, and he thought these entertaining works were calculated to give me a fondness for it; but we soon found ourselves so interested in the adventures they contained, that we alternately read whole nights together and could not bear to give over until at the conclusion of a volume. Sometimes, in the morning, on hearing the swallows at our window, my father, quite ashamed of this weakness, would cry, \"Come, come, let us go to bed; I am more a child than thou art.\" (Confessions, Book 1)}} Rousseau's reading of escapist stories (such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' by [[Honoré d'Urfé]]) had an effect on him; he later wrote that they \"gave me bizarre and romantic notions of human life, which experience and reflection have never been able to cure me of\".{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} After they had finished reading the novels, they began to read a collection of ancient and modern classics left by his mother's uncle. Of these, his favorite was [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'', which he would read to his father while he made watches. Rousseau saw Plutarch's work as another kind of novel—the noble actions of heroes—and he would act out the deeds of the characters he was reading about.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nWitnessing the local townsfolk participate in [[militia]]s made a big impression on Rousseau. Throughout his life, he would recall one scene where, after the volunteer militia had finished its manoeuvres, they began to dance around a fountain and most of the people from neighboring buildings came out to join them, including him and his father. Rousseau would always see militias as the embodiment of popular spirit in opposition to the armies of the rulers, whom he saw as disgraceful mercenaries.{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nWhen Rousseau was 10, his father, an avid hunter, got into a legal quarrel with a wealthy landowner on whose lands he had been caught trespassing. To avoid certain defeat in the courts, he moved away to Nyon in the territory of Bern, taking Rousseau's aunt Suzanne with him. He remarried, and from that point Jean-Jacques saw little of him.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 24}} Jean-Jacques was left with his maternal uncle, who packed him, along with his own son, Abraham Bernard, away to board for two years with a Calvinist minister in a hamlet outside Geneva. Here, the boys picked up the elements of mathematics and drawing. Rousseau, who was always deeply moved by religious services, for a time even dreamed of becoming a Protestant minister.\n\n[[File:LesCharmettes.jpg|thumb|Les Charmettes, where Rousseau lived with [[Françoise-Louise de Warens|Mme. de Warens]] in 1735–6, now a museum dedicated to Rousseau.]]\n\nVirtually all our information about Rousseau's youth has come from his posthumously published ''Confessions'', in which the chronology is somewhat confused, though recent scholars have combed the archives for confirming evidence to fill in the blanks. At age 13, Rousseau was apprenticed first to a [[civil law notary|notary]] and then to an engraver who beat him. At 15, he ran away from Geneva (on 14 March 1728) after returning to the city and finding the city gates locked due to the curfew.\n\nIn adjoining [[Savoy]] he took shelter with a Roman Catholic priest, who introduced him to [[Françoise-Louise de Warens]], age 29. She was a noblewoman of Protestant background who was separated from her husband. As professional lay proselytizer, she was paid by the King of [[Piedmont]] to help bring Protestants to Catholicism. They sent the boy to [[Turin]], the capital of Savoy (which included Piedmont, in what is now Italy), to complete his conversion. This resulted in his having to give up his Genevan citizenship, although he would later revert to Calvinism in order to regain it.\n\nIn converting to Catholicism, both De Warens and Rousseau were likely reacting to Calvinism's insistence on the [[total depravity]] of man. Leo Damrosch writes: \"An eighteenth-century Genevan liturgy still required believers to declare 'that we are miserable sinners, born in corruption, inclined to evil, incapable by ourselves of doing good'\".{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005|p = 121}} De Warens, a [[deist]] by inclination, was attracted to Catholicism's doctrine of forgiveness of sins.\n\n===Adulthood===\nFinding himself on his own, since his father and uncle had more or less disowned him, the teenage Rousseau supported himself for a time as a servant, secretary, and tutor, wandering in Italy (Piedmont and Savoy) and France. During this time, he lived on and off with De Warens, whom he idolized and called his \"''maman''\". Flattered by his devotion, De Warens tried to get him started in a profession, and arranged formal music lessons for him. At one point, he briefly attended a seminary with the idea of becoming a priest.\n\nWhen Rousseau reached 20, De Warens took him as her lover, while intimate also with the steward of her house. The sexual aspect of their relationship (in fact a ''[[ménage à trois]]'') confused Rousseau and made him uncomfortable, but he always considered De Warens the greatest love of his life. A rather profligate spender, she had a large library and loved to entertain and listen to music. She and her circle, comprising educated members of the Catholic clergy, introduced Rousseau to the world of letters and ideas.\n\nRousseau had been an indifferent student, but during his 20s, which were marked by long bouts of [[hypochondria]], he applied himself in earnest to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and music.  At 25, he came into a small inheritance from his mother and used a portion of it to repay De Warens for her financial support of him. At 27, he took a job as a tutor in [[Lyon]].\n\nIn 1742, Rousseau moved to Paris in order to present the [[Académie des Sciences]] with a new system of [[numbered musical notation]] he believed would make his fortune. His system, intended to be compatible with [[typography]], is based on a single line, displaying numbers representing [[interval (music)|intervals]] between notes and dots and commas indicating rhythmic values. Believing the system was impractical, the Academy rejected it, though they praised his mastery of the subject, and urged him to try again.\n\n[[File:Palazzo Surian Bellotto (Venice).jpg|thumb|upright|Palazzo belonging to Tommaso Querini at 968 Cannaregio [[Venice]] that served as the French Embassy during Rousseau's period as Secretary to the Ambassador]]\nFrom 1743 to 1744, Rousseau had an honorable but ill-paying post as a secretary to the Comte de Montaigue, the French ambassador to [[Venice]]. This awoke in him a lifelong love for Italian music, particularly opera:\n{{Quote | I had brought with me from Paris the prejudice of that city against Italian music; but I had also received from nature a sensibility and niceness of distinction which prejudice cannot withstand. I soon contracted that passion for Italian music with which it inspires all those who are capable of feeling its excellence.

Although Rousseau did most of the work of the embassy, he was treated like a valet.}}  After 11 months, Rousseau quit, taking from the experience a profound distrust of government bureaucracy.\n\n====Return to Paris====\nReturning to Paris, the penniless Rousseau befriended and became the lover of [[Thérèse Levasseur]], a seamstress who was the sole support of her mother and numerous ne'er-do-well siblings. At first, they did not live together, though later Rousseau took Thérèse and her mother in to live with him as his servants, and himself assumed the burden of supporting her large family. According to his ''Confessions'', before she moved in with him, Thérèse bore him a son and as many as four other children (there is no independent verification for this number<ref>Some of Rousseau's contemporaries believed the babies were not his. George Sand has written an essai, \"Les Charmettes\" (1865. Printed in the same volume as \"Laura\" from the same year) in which she explains why Rousseau may have accused himself falsely. She quotes her grandmother, in whose family Rousseau had been a tutor, and who stated that Rousseau could not get children.</ref>).\n\nRousseau wrote that he persuaded Thérèse to give each of the newborns up to a foundling hospital, for the sake of her \"honor\". \"Her mother, who feared the inconvenience of a brat, came to my aid, and she [Thérèse] allowed herself to be overcome\" (''Confessions''). In his letter to Madame de Francueil in 1751, he first pretended that he wasn't rich enough to raise his children, but in Book IX of the ''Confessions'' he gave the true reasons of his choice: \"I trembled at the thought of intrusting them to a family ill brought up, to be still worse educated. The risk of the education of the [[foundling hospital]] was much less\".\n\nTen years later, Rousseau made inquiries about the fate of his son, but no record could be found. When Rousseau subsequently became celebrated as a theorist of education and child-rearing, his abandonment of his children was used by his critics, including [[Voltaire]] and [[Edmund Burke]], as the basis for ''ad hominem'' attacks.\n\nWhile in Paris, Rousseau became a close friend of French philosopher [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and, beginning with some articles on music in 1749,<ref>Rousseau in his musical articles in the ''Encyclopédie'' engaged in lively controversy with other musicians, e.g. with Rameau, as in his article on Temperament, for which see [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.897 Encyclopédie: Tempérament] (English translation), also [[Temperament Ordinaire]].</ref> contributed numerous articles to Diderot and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]]'s great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', the most famous of which was an article on political economy written in 1755.\n\nRousseau's ideas were the result of an almost obsessive dialogue with writers of the past, filtered in many cases through conversations with Diderot. In 1749, Rousseau was paying daily visits to Diderot, who had been thrown into the fortress of [[Vincennes]] under a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'' for opinions in his \"''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient|Lettre sur les aveugles]]''\", that hinted at [[materialism]], a belief in [[atoms]], and [[natural selection]].\n\nAccording to science historian [[Conway Zirkle]], Rousseau saw the concept of natural selection \"as an agent for improving the human species.\"<ref>{{Citation\n| last    = Zirkle\n| first   = Conway\n| date     = 25 April 1941\n| title    =Natural Selection before the ''Origin of Species''\n| journal =[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]\n| volume  = 84\n| issue   =1\n| publisher =[[American Philosophical Society]]\n| place    =Philadelphia\n| pages =71–123\n| url =http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/984852?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103890164577 \n| accessdate  =2 December 2015\n| doi=10.2307/984852}}</ref>\n\nRousseau had read about an essay competition sponsored by the [[Académie de Dijon]] to be published in the ''Mercure de France'' on the theme of whether the development of the arts and sciences had been morally beneficial. He wrote that while walking to Vincennes (about three miles from Paris), he had a revelation that the arts and sciences were responsible for the moral degeneration of mankind, who were basically good by nature. Rousseau's 1750 ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'' was awarded the first prize and gained him significant fame.\n\nRousseau continued his interest in music. He wrote both the words and music of his opera ''[[Le devin du village]]'' (''The Village Soothsayer''), which was performed for [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] in 1752. The king was so pleased by the work that he offered Rousseau a lifelong pension. To the exasperation of his friends, Rousseau turned down the great honor, bringing him notoriety as \"the man who had refused a king's pension\". He also turned down several other advantageous offers, sometimes with a brusqueness bordering on truculence that gave offense and caused him problems. The same year, the visit of a troupe of Italian musicians to Paris, and their performance of [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s ''[[La serva padrona]]'', prompted the [[Querelle des Bouffons]], which pitted protagonists of French music against supporters of the Italian style. Rousseau as noted above, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Italians against [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and others, making an important contribution with his ''Letter on French Music''.\n\n====Return to Geneva (1754)====\nOn returning to Geneva in 1754, Rousseau reconverted to [[Calvinism]] and regained his official Genevan citizenship. In 1755, Rousseau completed his second major work, the ''Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men'' (the ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]''), which elaborated on the arguments of the ''Discourse on the Arts and Sciences''.\n\nHe also pursued an unconsummated romantic attachment with the 25-year-old [[Sophie d'Houdetot]], which partly inspired his [[epistolary novel]], ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (also based on memories of his idyllic youthful relationship with Mme de Warens). Sophie was the cousin and houseguest of Rousseau's patroness and landlady [[Louise d'Épinay|Madame d'Épinay]], whom he treated rather highhandedly. He resented being at Mme. d'Épinay's beck and call and detested the insincere conversation and shallow atheism of the ''Encyclopedistes'' whom he met at her table. Wounded feelings gave rise to a bitter three-way quarrel between Rousseau and Madame d'Épinay; her lover, the journalist [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]]; and their mutual friend, Diderot, who took their side against Rousseau. Diderot later described Rousseau as being \"false, vain as Satan, ungrateful, cruel, hypocritical, and wicked... He sucked ideas from me, used them himself, and then affected to despise me\".{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 304}}\n\n[[File:Pierre Alexandre du Peyrou.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierre Alexandre du Peyrou, rich inhabitant of Neufchâtel, plantation owner, writer, friend and publisher of some of Rousseau's oeuvre. His mansion was [[Le Palais du Peyrou]].]]\n\nRousseau's break with the ''Encyclopedistes'' coincided with the composition of his three major works, in all of which he emphasized his fervent belief in a spiritual origin of man's soul and the universe, in contradistinction to the [[materialism]] of Diderot, [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]] and [[Baron d'Holbach|D'Holbach]]. During this period, Rousseau enjoyed the support and patronage of [[Duc de Piney|Charles François Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg]] and the [[Louis François I de Bourbon, prince de Conti|Prince de Conti]], two of the richest and most powerful nobles in France. These men truly liked Rousseau and enjoyed his ability to converse on any subject, but they also used him as a way of getting back at [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and the political faction surrounding his mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]]. Even with them, however, Rousseau went too far, courting rejection when he criticized the practice of [[tax farming]], in which some of them engaged.{{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 357}}\n\nRousseau's 800-page novel of [[Sentimentality|sentiment]], ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'', was published in 1761 to immense success. The book's rhapsodic descriptions of the natural beauty of the Swiss countryside struck a chord in the public and may have helped spark the subsequent nineteenth-century craze for Alpine scenery. In 1762, Rousseau published ''Du Contrat Social, Principes du droit politique'' (in English, literally ''[[The Social Contract|Of the Social Contract, Principles of Political Right]]'') in April. Even his friend [[Antoine-Jacques Roustan]] felt impelled to write a polite rebuttal of the chapter on Civil Religion in the ''Social Contract'', which implied that the concept of a [[Christian republic]] was paradoxical since Christianity taught submission rather than participation in public affairs. Rousseau helped Roustan find a publisher for the rebuttal.<ref name=Rosenblatt1997>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hGoNncv-CkC&pg=PA264 |pages= 264–5 | title = Rousseau and Geneva: from the first discourse to the social contract, 1749–1762 | first =Helena | last = Rosenblatt |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |ISBN=0-521-57004-2}}</ref>\n\nRousseau published ''[[Emile, or On Education]]'' in May. A famous section of ''Emile'', \"The Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar\", was intended to be a defense of religious belief. Rousseau's choice of a Catholic vicar of humble peasant background (plausibly based on a kindly prelate he had met as a teenager) as a spokesman for the defense of religion was in itself a daring innovation for the time.  The vicar's creed was that of [[Socinianism]] (or [[Unitarianism]] as it is called today). Because it rejected original sin and [[Revelation|divine revelation]], both Protestant and Catholic authorities took offense.{{Efn|Rousseau's biographer Leo Damrosch believes that the authorities chose to condemn him on religious rather than political grounds for tactical reasons.{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}}}\n\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712 - 1778) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|{{Citation | year = 1766 | type = portrait | title = Rousseau wearing an [[Armenians|Armenian]] costume | author-link = Allan Ramsay (1713-1784)| first = Allan | last =Ramsay}}.]]\n\nMoreover, Rousseau advocated the opinion that, insofar as they lead people to virtue, all religions are equally worthy, and that people should therefore conform to the religion in which they have been brought up. This religious [[indifferentism]] caused Rousseau and his books to be banned from France and Geneva. He was condemned from the pulpit by the Archbishop of Paris, his [[book burning|books were burned]] and warrants were issued for his arrest.{{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} Former friends such as [[Jacob Vernes]] of Geneva could not accept his views, and wrote violent rebuttals.<ref name=Blackwoods1842>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f7ECAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA165 |page=165 |title=Protestantism in Geneva | work =Blackwood's magazine | volume = 51 |year=1842}}</ref>\n\nA sympathetic observer, [[David Hume]] \"professed no surprise when he learned that Rousseau's books were banned in Geneva and elsewhere\".

Subsequently when the Swiss authorities also proved unsympathetic to him—condemning both ''Emile'', and also ''[[The Social Contract]]''—Voltaire issued an invitation to Rousseau to come and reside with him, commenting that: \"I shall always love the author of the 'Vicaire savoyard' whatever he has done, and whatever he may do...Let him come here [to Ferney]! He must come! I shall receive him with open arms. He shall be master here more than I. I shall treat him like my own son.\"<ref>{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|pages= 190–1|year= 1967}}</ref>\n\nRousseau later expressed regret that he had not replied to Voltaire's invitation. In July 1762, after Rousseau was informed that he could not continue to reside in Bern, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] advised him to move to the [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Principality of Neuchâtel]], ruled by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia. Subsequently, Rousseau accepted an invitation to reside in [[Môtiers]], fifteen miles from Neuchâtel. On 11 July 1762, Rousseau wrote to Frederick, describing how he had been driven from France, from Geneva, and from Bern; and seeking Frederick's protection. He also mentioned that he had criticized Frederick in the past and would continue to be critical of Frederick in the future, stating however: \"Your Majesty may dispose of me as you like.\" Frederick, still in the middle of the [[Seven Years' War]], then wrote to the local governor of Neuchatel, [[George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal|Marischal Keith]]:\n\n{{Quotation|We must succor this poor unfortunate. His only offense is to have strange opinions which he thinks are good ones. I will send a hundred crowns, from which you will be kind enough to give him as much as he needs. I think he will accept them in kind more readily than in cash. If we were not at war, if we were not ruined, I would build him a hermitage with a garden, where he could live as I believe our first fathers did...I think poor Rousseau has missed his vocation; he was obviously born to be a famous anchorite, a desert father, celebrated for his austerities and flagellations...I conclude that the morals of your savage are as pure as his mind is illogical.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|page= 191|year= 1967}}</ref>}}\n\nRousseau, touched by the help he received from Frederick, stated that from then onwards he took a keen interest in Frederick's activities. As the Seven Years' War was about to end, Rousseau wrote to Frederick again, thanking him for the help received and urging him to put an end to military activities and to endeavor to keep his subjects happy instead. Frederick made no known reply, but commented to Keith that Rousseau had given him a \"scolding\".<ref>{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|page= 192|year= 1967}}</ref>\n\n====Fugitive====\nFor two years Rousseau lived at Môtiers spending his time in reading and writing, and meeting visitors.<ref name = \"Durant 1967 205\">{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|page= 205|year= 1967}}</ref> In the meantime, the local ministers had become aware of the apostasies in some of his writings, and resolved not to let him stay in the vicinity.

Although it was within the [[Canton of Bern]], from where he was expelled two years ago, he was informally assured that he could move into this island house without fear of arrest, and he did so. However, on 17 October 1765, the Senate of Bern ordered Rousseau to leave the island and all Bernese territory within fifteen days. He replied, requesting permission to extend his stay, and offered to be incarcerated in any place within their jurisdiction with only a few books in his possession and permission to walk occasionally in a garden while living at his own expense. The Senate's response was to direct Rousseau to leave the island, and all Bernese territory, within twenty four hours. On 29 October, he left the Ile de St.-Pierre, and moved to Strasbourg.

Gradually articles critical of Rousseau started appearing in the British press; Rousseau felt that Hume, as his host, ought to have defended him. Moreover, in Rousseau's estimate, some of the public criticism contained details which only Hume was privy to.<ref name = \"Durant 1967 212\">{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|page= 212|year= 1967}}</ref> Further, Rousseau was aggrieved to find that Hume had been lodging in London with Francois Tronchin, son of Rousseau's enemy in Geneva.<ref name = \"Restless Genius 409\">{{cite book|title= Jean-Jacques Rousseau: Restless Genius|author= Leo Damrosch|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|pages= 419, 421|year= 2005}}</ref><ref name = \"Durant 1967 212-13\">{{cite book|title= The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author= Will Durant|publisher= Simon & Schuster|pages= 212–13|year= 1967}}</ref>\n\nAbout this time, Voltaire anonymously published his ''Letter to Dr. J.-J.

At Rousseau's suggestion, Coignet composed musical interludes for Rousseau's prose poem ''Pygmalion''; this was performed in Lyon together with Rousseau's romance ''The Village Soothsayer'' to public acclaim.

On the contrary, Rousseau holds that \"uncorrupted morals\" prevail in the \"state of nature\" and he especially praised the admirable moderation of the Caribbeans in expressing the sexual urge{{Sfn | Rousseau | pp = 72–73}} despite the fact that they live in a hot climate, which \"always seems to inflame the passions\".{{Sfn | Rousseau | 1754 | p = 78}}\n\nRousseau asserted that the stage of human development associated with what he called \"savages\" was the best or optimal in human development, between the less-than-optimal extreme of brute animals on the one hand and the extreme of decadent civilization on the other. \"...[N]othing is so gentle as man in his primitive state, when placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] of civil man\".<ref>{{Citation | contribution = Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, part two | year = 1754 | page = 64 | first = Jean-Jacques | last = Rousseau | author-link = Jean-Jacques Rousseau | title = The Basic Political Writings | publisher = Hackett}}</ref> Referring to the stage of human development which Rousseau associates with savages, Rousseau writes:\n{{Quote | Hence although men had become less forebearing, and although natural pity had already undergone some alteration, this period of the development of human faculties, maintaining a middle position between the indolence of our primitive state and the petulant activity of our egocentrism, must have been the happiest and most durable epoch. The more one reflects on it, the more one finds that this state was the least subject to upheavals and the best for man, and that he must have left it only by virtue of some fatal chance happening that, for the common good, ought never to have happened. The example of savages, almost all of whom have been found in this state, seems to confirm that the human race had been made to remain in it always; that this state is the veritable youth of the world; and that all the subsequent progress has been in appearance so many steps toward the perfection of the individual, and in fact toward the decay of the species.\"{{Sfn | Rousseau | 1754 | p = 65}}}}\n\nThe perspective of many of today's environmentalists can be traced back to Rousseau who believed that the more men deviated from the state of nature, the worse off they would be. Espousing the belief that all degenerates in men's hands, Rousseau taught that men would be free, wise, and good in the state of nature and that instinct and emotion, when not distorted by the unnatural limitations of civilization, are nature's voices and instructions to the good life.  Rousseau’s ‘noble savage’ stands in direct opposition to the man of culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecoislibre.org/05/050715-16.htm|title=Rousseau’s ‘General Will’ & well-ordered society |work= Québecois libre}}</ref>\n\n====Stages of human development====\nRousseau believed that the savage stage was not the first stage of human development, but the third stage.

Morality proper, i.e., self-restraint, can only develop through careful education in a civil state. Humans ‘in a state of Nature’ may act with all of the ferocity of an animal. They are good only in a negative sense, insofar as they are self-sufficient and thus not subject to the vices of political society.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nIn fact, Rousseau's natural man is virtually identical to a solitary [[chimpanzee]] or other [[ape]], such as the [[orangutan]] as described by [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]; and the \"natural\" goodness of humanity is thus the goodness of an animal, which is neither good nor bad. Rousseau, a deteriorationist, proposed that, except perhaps for brief moments of balance, at or near its inception, when a relative equality among men prevailed, human civilization has always been artificial, creating inequality, envy, and unnatural desires.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nRousseau’s ideas of human development were highly interconnected with forms of mediation, or the processes that individual humans use to interact with themselves and others while using an alternate perspective or thought process. According to Rousseau, these were developed through the innate perfectibility of humanity. These include a sense of self, morality, pity, and imagination. Rousseau’s writings are purposely ambiguous concerning the formation of these processes to the point that mediation is always intrinsically part of humanity's development. An example of this is the notion that as an individual, one needs an alternative perspective to come to the realization that they are a 'self'<ref>{{cite journal|last =Einspahr|first =Jennifer|title = The Beginning that Never Was: Mediation and Freedom in Rousseau's Political Thought|journal=Review of Politics|volume=72|issue=3|pages=437–61|doi=10.1017/S0034670510000318|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=9ddf9219-f384-41e0-8790-6880c825e030%40sessionmgr4005&vid=5&hid=4114 |accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Rousseau's philosophy, society's negative influence on men centers on its transformation of ''[[amour de soi]]'', a positive self-love, into ''[[amour-propre]]'', or [[pride]]. ''Amour de soi'' represents the instinctive human desire for [[self-preservation]], combined with the human power of [[reason]].  In contrast, ''amour-propre'' is artificial and encourages man to compare himself to others, thus creating unwarranted [[fear]] and allowing men to take pleasure in the pain or weakness of others.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Rousseau was not the first to make this distinction. It had been invoked by [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|Vauvenargues]], among others.\n\nIn the ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'' Rousseau argues that the arts and sciences have not been beneficial to humankind, because they arose not from authentic human needs but rather as a result of pride and [[vanity]]. Moreover, the opportunities they create for idleness and luxury have contributed to the corruption of man. He proposed that the progress of [[knowledge]] had made governments more [[power (sociology)|power]]ful and had crushed individual [[liberty]]; and he concluded that material progress had actually undermined the possibility of true [[friendship]] by replacing it with [[jealousy]], [[fear]], and suspicion.\n\nIn contrast to the optimistic view of other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] figures, for Rousseau, [[social progress|progress]] has been inimical to the well-being of humanity, that is, unless it can be counteracted by the cultivation of civic morality and duty.\n\nOnly in [[civil society]] can man be ennobled—through the use of reason:\n{{Quote | The passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult his reason before listening to his inclinations. Although in this state he deprives himself of some advantages which he got from nature, he gains in return others so great, his faculties are so stimulated and developed, his ideas so extended, his feelings so ennobled, and his whole soul so uplifted, that, did not the abuses of this new condition often degrade him below that which he left, he would be bound to bless continually the happy moment which took him from it for ever, and, instead of a stupid and unimaginative animal, made him an intelligent being and a man.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.constitution.org/jjr/socon_01.htm| last =Rousseau | title = Social Contract | chapter = Book I, Chapter 8| publisher = Constitution}}</ref>}}\n\nSociety corrupts men only insofar as the Social Contract has not ''de facto'' succeeded, as we see in contemporary society as described in the ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754).\n\nIn this essay, which elaborates on the ideas introduced in the ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'', Rousseau traces man's social evolution from a primitive [[state of nature]] to modern society. The earliest solitary humans possessed a basic drive for self-preservation and a natural disposition to [[compassion]] or pity. They differed from animals, however, in their capacity for free will and their potential perfectibility.  As they began to live in groups and form clans they also began to experience family love, which Rousseau saw as the source of the greatest happiness known to humanity.\n\nAs long as differences in wealth and status among families were minimal, the first coming together in groups was accompanied by a fleeting golden age of human flourishing. The development of agriculture, metallurgy, private property, and the [[division of labour]] and resulting dependency on one another, however, led to [[economic inequality]] and conflict. As population pressures forced them to associate more and more closely, they underwent a psychological transformation: they began to see themselves through the eyes of others and came to value the good opinion of others as essential to their [[self-esteem]].{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nRousseau posits that the original, deeply flawed [[Social Contract]] (i.e., that of Hobbes), which led to the modern state, was made at the suggestion of the rich and powerful, who tricked the general population into surrendering their liberties to them and instituted inequality as a fundamental feature of human society. Rousseau's own conception of the Social Contract can be understood as an alternative to this fraudulent form of association.{{Citation needed |date=June 2015}}\n\nAt the end of the ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'', Rousseau explains how the desire to have value in the eyes of others comes to undermine personal integrity and authenticity in a society marked by interdependence, and [[hierarchy]].  In the last chapter of the ''Social Contract'', Rousseau would ask ’What is to be done?’  He answers that now all men can do is to cultivate virtue in themselves and submit to their lawful rulers. To his readers, however, the inescapable conclusion was that a new and more equitable Social Contract was needed.\n\nLike other Enlightenment philosophers, Rousseau was critical of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abolition.nypl.org/print/abolition/| work =Abolitionism | title = The Abolition of The Slave Trade| publisher = NYPL}}</ref>\n\n===Political theory===\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n{{Communitarianism sidebar}}\n[[File:Ile Rousseau Geneva Switzerland.JPG|thumb|Île Rousseau, Geneva.]]\n\n''[[The Social Contract]]''  outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of [[classical republicanism]]. Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition. It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article ''Economie Politique'' (''Discourse on Political Economy''), featured in Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]''. The treatise begins with the dramatic opening lines, \"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they.\"\n\nRousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom.\n\nAccording to Rousseau, by joining together into civil society through the [[social contract]] and abandoning their claims of [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]], individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free. This is because submission to the authority of the [[general will]] of the people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to the wills of others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, the authors of the law.\n\nAlthough Rousseau argues that [[sovereignty]] (or the power to make the laws) should be in the hands of the people, he also makes a sharp distinction between the sovereign and the government. The government is composed of magistrates, charged with implementing and enforcing the general will. The \"sovereign\" is the rule of law, ideally decided on by [[direct democracy]] in an assembly.\n\nRousseau opposed the idea that the people should exercise sovereignty via a [[Representative democracy|representative assembly]] (Book III, Chapter XV). He approved the kind of republican government of the city-state, for which Geneva provided a model - or would have done if renewed on Rousseau's principles. France could not meet Rousseau's criterion of an ideal state because it was too big. Much subsequent controversy about Rousseau's work has hinged on disagreements concerning his claims that citizens constrained to obey the general will are thereby rendered free:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of political legitimacy. ... It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion. Some commentators see it as no more than the dictatorship of the proletariat or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution). Such was not Rousseau's meaning. This is clear from the ''Discourse on Political Economy'', where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it. He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others. It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place\".<ref>\nEntry, \"Rousseau\" in the ''Routelege Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Edward Craig, editor, Volume Eight, p. 371\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Education and child rearing===\n[[File:Jean-Jacques Rousseau Romania1962.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Jacques Rousseau on a Romanian stamp, 1962]]\n{{Main article|Emile, or On Education}}\n{{Quote | The noblest work in education is to make a reasoning man, and we expect to train a young child by making him reason!

The hypothetical boy, Émile, is to be raised in the countryside, which, Rousseau believes, is a more natural and healthy environment than the city, under the guardianship of a tutor who will guide him through various learning experiences arranged by the tutor. Today we would call this the disciplinary method of \"natural consequences\". Rousseau felt that children learn right and wrong through experiencing the consequences of their acts rather than through physical punishment. The tutor will make sure that no harm results to Émile through his learning experiences.\n\nRousseau became an early advocate of developmentally appropriate education; his description of the stages of [[child development]] mirrors his conception of the evolution of culture. He divides childhood into stages:\n# the first to the age of about 12, when children are guided by their emotions and impulses\n# during the second stage, from 12 to about 16, reason starts to develop\n# finally the third stage, from the age of 16 onwards, when the child develops into an adult\n\nRousseau recommends that the young adult learn a manual skill such as carpentry, which requires creativity and thought, will keep him out of trouble, and will supply a fallback means of making a living in the event of a change of fortune (the most illustrious aristocratic youth to have been educated this way may have been [[Louis XVI]], whose parents had him learn the skill of locksmithing<ref>{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Michael |title=Famous Locksmiths |url= http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/72616 | work =American Chronicle|accessdate=14 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825161255/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/72616 |archive-date=2010-08-25 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>). The sixteen-year-old is also ready to have a companion of the opposite sex.\n\nAlthough his ideas foreshadowed modern ones in many ways, in one way they do not: Rousseau was a believer in the moral superiority of the [[patriarchal]] family on the antique Roman model. Sophie, the young woman Émile is destined to marry, as a representative of ideal womanhood, is educated to be governed by her husband while Émile, as representative of the ideal man, is educated to be self-governing. This is not an accidental feature of Rousseau's educational and political philosophy; it is essential to his account of the distinction between private, personal relations and the public world of political relations. The [[private sphere]] as Rousseau imagines it depends on the subordination of women, in order for both it and the public political sphere (upon which it depends) to function as Rousseau imagines it could and should. Rousseau anticipated the modern idea of the [[bourgeois]] [[nuclear family]], with the mother at home taking responsibility for the household and for childcare and early education.\n\nFeminists, beginning in the late 18th century with [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in 1792<ref>{{Cite book| last =Wollstonecraft | first = Mary|title=A Vindication of the Rights of Woman | editor-first = Miriam | editor-last = Brody |publisher= Penguin |year = 2004 | origyear =1792|isbn=978-0-14-144125-2|chapter=V}}</ref> have criticized Rousseau for his confinement of women to the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]—unless women were [[Domestication|domesticated]] and constrained by modesty and shame, he feared<ref name= Tuana>{{Cite book | last =Tuana | first = Nancy|title=The Less Noble Sex: Scientific, Religious and Philosophical Conceptions of Women's Nature|year=1993|page =161|publisher= Indiana University Press|isbn= 0-253-36098-6}}</ref> ‘men would be tyrannized by women…  For, given the ease with which women arouse men's senses– men would finally be their victims…’<ref>{{Citation | last = Rousseau | title = Emile | chapter = book V | page = 359}}</ref>  His contemporaries saw it differently because Rousseau thought that mothers should breastfeed their children.{{Sfn | Damrosch | pp = 341–42}} [[Jean-François Marmontel|Marmontel]] wrote that his wife thought, ‘One must forgive something,’ she said, ‘in one who has taught us to be mothers.’<ref>{{Cite book | last = Marmontel | first = Jean François|title= Memoirs of Marmontel, written by himself: containing his literary and political life, and anecdotes of the principal characters of the eighteenth century| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SiQoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA125 | publisher = Whittaker via Google Books|year=1826|pages= 125–26}}</ref>\n\nRousseau has been blamed for so-called modern \"child-centered\" education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} John Darling's 1994 book ''Child-Centered Education and its Critics'' portrays the history of modern [[pedagogy|educational theory]] as a series of footnotes to Rousseau, a development he regards as bad. Good or bad, the theories of educators such as Rousseau's near contemporaries [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]], [[Stéphanie Félicité Ducrest de St-Albin, comtesse de Genlis|Mme. de Genlis]] and, later, [[Maria Montessori]] and [[John Dewey]], which have directly influenced modern educational practices, do have significant points in common with those of Rousseau.{{Citation needed| date = October 2014}}\n\n==Religion==\nHaving converted to Roman Catholicism early in life and returned to the austere [[Calvinism]] of his native Geneva as part of his period of moral reform, Rousseau maintained a profession of that religious philosophy and of [[John Calvin]] as a modern lawgiver throughout the remainder of his life.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/510932/Jean-Jacques-Rousseau/23965/Major-works-of-political-philosophy Jean-Jacques Rousseau]. Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> His views on religion presented in his works of philosophy, however, may strike some as discordant with the doctrines of both Catholicism and Calvinism.\n\nAt the time, however, Rousseau's strong endorsement of religious toleration, as expounded by the Savoyard vicar in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]'', was interpreted as advocating [[indifferentism]], a heresy, and led to the condemnation of the book in both Calvinist [[Geneva]] and Catholic Paris. His assertion in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' that true followers of Jesus would not make good citizens may have been another reason for Rousseau's condemnation in Geneva.\n\nUnlike many of the more radical Enlightenment philosophers, Rousseau affirmed the necessity of religion. But he repudiated the doctrine of [[original sin]], which plays so large a part in Calvinism (in ''Émile'', Rousseau writes \"there is no original perversity in the human heart\").<ref>''il n'y a point de perversité originelle dans le cœur humain'' [[:s:Émile, ou De l'éducation/Édition 1852/Livre II|Émile, ou De l'éducation/Édition 1852/Livre II]]</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, many [[deists]] viewed God merely as an abstract and impersonal creator of the universe, which they likened to a giant machine. Rousseau's [[deism]] differed from the usual kind in its intense emotionality. He saw the presence of God in his creation, including mankind, which, apart from the harmful influence of society, is good, because God is good. Rousseau's attribution of a spiritual value to the beauty of nature anticipates the attitudes of 19th-century [[Romanticism]] towards nature and religion.\n\nRousseau was upset that his deistic views were so forcefully condemned, while those of the more atheistic ''philosophes'' were ignored. He defended himself against critics of his religious views in his \"Letter to [[Christophe de Beaumont]], the Archbishop of Paris in which he insists that freedom of discussion in religious matters is essentially more religious than the attempt to impose belief by force.\"<ref>The full text of the letter is available online only in the French original: {{Wayback |df=yes|date=20070704072055 |url=http://alain-leger.mageos.com/docs/Rousseau.pdf |title=Lettre à Mgr De Beaumont Archevêque de Paris (1762) }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Unbalanced |section|date=September 2011}}\n[[File:Rousseauplaque.jpg|thumb|{{Citation | type = plaque | title = Bicentenary of Rousseau’s birth | publisher = Geneva | date = 28 June 1912 | quote = Jean-Jacques, aime ton pays [love your country]}}, showing Rousseau’s father gesturing towards the window. The scene is drawn from a footnote to the [[Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles|Letter to d’Alembert]] where Rousseau recalls witnessing the popular celebrations following the exercises of the St Gervais regiment.]]\n\n===General Will===\nRousseau’s idea of the ''volonté générale'' (‘[[general will]]’) was not original with him but rather belonged to a well-established technical vocabulary of juridical and theological writings in use at the time.  The phrase was used by [[Diderot]] and also by [[Montesquieu]] (and by his teacher, the [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorian]] friar [[Nicolas Malebranche]]).  It served to designate the common interest embodied in legal tradition, as distinct from and transcending people’s private and particular interests at any particular time.{{Citation needed |date=September 2015}}\n\nThe concept was also an important aspect of the more radical 17th-century republican tradition of [[Spinoza]], from whom Rousseau differed in important respects, but not in his insistence on the importance of equality:\n{{Quote | While Rousseau's notion of the progressive moral degeneration of mankind from the moment civil society established itself diverges markedly from Spinoza's claim that human nature is always and everywhere the same… for both philosophers the pristine equality of the state of nature is our ultimate goal and criterion… in shaping the ‘common good’, ''volonté générale'', or Spinoza's ''mens una'', which alone can ensure stability and political salvation. Without the supreme criterion of equality, the general will would indeed be meaningless. […] When in the depths of the French Revolution the Jacobin clubs all over France regularly deployed Rousseau when demanding radical reforms. and especially anything—such as land redistribution—designed to enhance equality, they were at the same time, albeit unconsciously, invoking a radical tradition which reached back to the late seventeenth century.<ref>{{Citation | first = Jonathan I | last = Israel | title = Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of [[Modernity]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2002 | page = 274}}</ref>}}\n\n===French Revolution===\n[[Robespierre]] and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], during the [[Reign of Terror]], regarded themselves to be principled egalitarian republicans, obliged to do away with superfluities and corruption; in this they were inspired most prominently by Rousseau. According to Robespierre, the deficiencies in individuals were rectified by upholding the 'common good' which he conceptualized as the collective will of the people; this idea was derived from Rousseau's ''General Will''. The revolutionaries were also inspired by Rousseau to introduce Deism as the new official [[civil religion]] of France:\n{{Quote | Ceremonial and symbolic occurrences of the more radical phases of the Revolution invoked Rousseau and his core ideas. Thus the ceremony held at the site of the demolished Bastille, organized by the foremost artistic director of the Revolution, [[Jacques-Louis David]], in August 1793 to mark the inauguration of the new republican constitution, an event coming shortly after the final abolition of all forms of feudal privilege, featured a cantata based on Rousseau's democratic pantheistic deism as expounded in the celebrated ‘''Profession de foi d’un vicaire savoyard''’ in Book Four of ''Émile''.{{Sfn | Israel | 2002 | p = 717}}}}\n\n===Effect on the United States of America===\nAccording to some scholars, Rousseau exercised minimal influence on the American founders like Thomas Jefferson despite the similarities between their ideas, such as shared beliefs regarding the self-evidence of the claim that \"all men are created equal,\" their shared conviction that citizens of a republic be educated at public expense, and the evident parallel between the U.S. constitution Framers’ concept of the \"[[general welfare]]\" and Rousseau’s concept of the \"[[general will]]\"; and the parallels between  [[Jeffersonian democracy]], and Rousseau’s praise of Switzerland and Corsica’s economies of isolated and self-sufficient independent homesteads and his endorsement of a well-regulated citizen militia, such as Switzerland’s.<ref>{{Citation |first = Nathan | last = Schachner | title = Thomas Jefferson: A Biography | year = 1957 | page = 47}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Will Durant]] and [[Ariel Durant]] have written that Rousseau had definite political influence on America. According to Durant: {{Quote|The first sign of his political influence was in the wave of public sympathy that supported active French aid to the American Revolution.

According to Jacques Barzun, Voltaire was annoyed by the [[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences|first discourse]], and outraged by the [[Discourse on Inequality|second]]. Voltaire's reading of the second discourse was that Rousseau would like the reader to \"walk on all fours\" befitting a savage.<ref>''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life: 1500 to the Present'' (Harper Collins, 2001), p. 384</ref>\n\n[[Jacques Barzun|Barzun]] states that, contrary to myth, Rousseau was no primitivist; for him:<blockquote>The model man is the independent farmer, free of superiors and self-governing. This was cause enough for the ''philosophes''' hatred of their former friend. Rousseau's unforgivable crime was his rejection of the graces and luxuries of civilized existence. Voltaire had sung \"The superfluous, that most necessary thing.\" For the high bourgeois standard of living Rousseau would substitute the middling peasant's. It was the country versus the city—an exasperating idea for them, as was the amazing fact that every new work of Rousseau's was a huge success, whether the subject was politics, theater, education, religion, or a novel about love.<ref>Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence'' (2001) p. 384</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs early as 1788, [[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]] published her ''Letters on the works and character of J.-J.

Political scientist J.S. Maloy states that ‘the twentieth century added Nazism and Stalinism to Jacobinism on the list of horrors for which Rousseau could be blamed. […] Rousseau was considered to have advocated just the sort of invasive tampering with human nature which the totalitarian regimes of mid-century had tried to instantiate.’  But he adds that ‘The totalitarian thesis in Rousseau studies has, by now, been discredited as an attribution of real historical influence.’<ref>{{Citation | first = J.S. | last = Maloy | title = The Very Order of Things: Rousseau's Tutorial Republicanism | journal = Polity | volume = 37 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300011 | pages=235–261}}</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Melzer]], however, while conceding that Rousseau would not have approved of modern nationalism, observes that his theories do contain the \"seeds of nationalism\", insofar as they set forth the \"politics of identification\", which are rooted in sympathetic emotion.

Using Rousseau's thought as an example, Arendt identified the notion of [[sovereignty]] with that of the general will. According to her, it was this desire to establish a single, unified will based on the stifling of opinion in favor of public passion that contributed to the excesses of the French Revolution.<ref>{{Citation | first = Hannah | last = Arendt | title = On revolution | year = 1990 | page = 76}}</ref>\n\n===Appreciation and influence===\nThe book ''Rousseau and Revolution'', by [[Will Durant]], begins with the following words about Rousseau:{{Quotation|How did it come about that a man born poor, losing his mother at birth and soon deserted by his father, afflicted with a painful and humiliating disease, left to wander for twelve years among alien cities and conflicting faiths, repudiated by society and civilization, repudiating [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]], the [[Encyclopédie]] and the [[Age of Reason]], driven from place to place as a dangerous rebel, suspected of crime and insanity, and seeing, in his last months, the apotheosis of his greatest enemy--how did it come about that this man, after his death, triumphed over Voltaire, revived religion, transformed education, elevated the morals of France, inspired the Romantic movement and the French Revolution, influenced the philosophy of Kant and Schopenhauer, the plays of Schiller, the novels of Goethe, the poems of Wordsworth, Byron, and Shelley, the socialism of Marx, the ethics of Tolstoy, and, altogether, had more effect upon posterity than any other writer or thinker of that eighteenth century in which writers were more influential than they had ever been before?<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 10:Rousseau and Revolution|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|page=3|year=1967}}</ref>}}\n\nThe German writers [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] have stated that Rousseau's writings inspired them.

Indeed, they have somehow attributed to him the origin of many of the alleged evils of modern times, ranging from the restiveness of \"hippie\" youth to the rigors of totalitarian societies.
