He worked in the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[philosophy of science]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of religion]], and [[political philosophy]].\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Cambridge]], England of Scottish parents, Smart began his education locally, attending [[The Leys School]], a leading independent boarding school. His younger brothers also became professors: Alastair (1922–1992) was Professor of Art History at Nottingham University; [[Ninian Smart|Ninian]] was a professor of [[Religious Studies]] and a pioneer in that field. Their father, [[William Marshall Smart]], was John Couch Adams Astronomer at [[Cambridge University]] and later [[Regius Professor of Astronomy, Glasgow|Regius Professor of Astronomy]] at [[Glasgow]]. In 1950, W. M. Smart was President of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]]. In 1946, Jack Smart graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] with an [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|MA]], followed by a BPhil from [[Oxford University]] in 1948. He then worked as a Junior Research Fellow at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]] for two years.\n\nHe arrived in Australia in August 1950 to take up the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Adelaide]], which he occupied from 1950 until 1972. After twenty-two years in Adelaide, he moved to [[La Trobe University]] where he was Reader in Philosophy from 1972–76. He then moved to the [[Australian National University]] where he was Professor of Philosophy in the Research School of Social Sciences from 1976 until his retirement in 1985, and where the annual Jack Smart Lecture is held in his honour.<ref>[http://philrsss.anu.edu.au/smart-lecture.php ]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}</ref> Following his retirement he was [[Emeritus]] Professor at [[Monash University]].\n\nIn 1990 he was awarded the Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia.<ref name=\"monash1\">[http://arts.monash.edu.au/philosophy/staff/jsmart.php Monash University Website]</ref> In 1991 he was elected to become an honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, [[Oxford|Oxford University]] and in 2010, elected to become an honorary Fellow of [[Queen's College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"monash1\"/>\n\nAt first Smart was a [[Behaviorism#Behaviorism in philosophy|behaviourist]] before becoming an early proponent of [[Type physicalism|Type Identity Theory]].<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/#His The Identity Theory of Mind (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Metaphysics==\nSmart's main contribution to metaphysics is in the area of [[Philosophy of space and time|philosophy of time]].  He has been an influential defender of the [[B-Theory of time]], and of [[perdurantism]].\n\nHis most important original arguments in this area concern the passage of time, which he claimed is an illusion.  He argued that if time really passed, then it would make sense to ask at what rate it passes, but this requires some second time-dimension with respect to which passage of normal time can be measured. This in turn faces the same problems, and so there must be a third time-dimension, and so on.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Smart |title=Essays in Conceptual Analysis |editor=Anthony Kenny |chapter=River of Time |pages=214–215}}</ref> This is called the [[rate of passage argument]].\n\nSmart has changed his mind about the nature and causes of the illusion of the passage of time.  In the 1950s, he held that it was due to people's use of [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] temporal language.  He later came to abandon this linguistic explanation of the illusion in favour of a psychological explanation in terms of the passage of memories from [[Short-term memory|short-term]] to [[long-term memory]].\n\n==Philosophy of mind==\nRegarding the [[philosophy of mind]], Smart was a [[Physicalism|physicalist]]. In the 1950s, he was also one of the originators, with [[Ullin Place]], of the [[mind–brain identity theory]], which claims that particular states of mind are identical with particular states of the brain. Initially this view was dubbed \"[[Australian materialism]]\" by its detractors, in reference to the stereotype of Australians as down-to-earth and unsophisticated.\n\nSmart's identity theory dealt with some extremely long-standing objections to physicalism by comparing the mind–brain identity thesis to other identity theses well-known from science, such as the thesis that lightning is an electrical discharge, or that the morning star is the evening star.  Although these identity theses give rise to puzzles such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s [[Reference#Reference and meaning|puzzle of the Morning Star and Evening Star]], in the scientific cases, some claim that it would be absurd to reject the identity theses on this ground.  Since the puzzles facing physicalism are strictly analogous to the scientific identity theses, it would then also be absurd to reject physicalism on the grounds that it gives rise to these puzzles.\n\n==Ethics==\nIn ethics, Smart was a defender of [[utilitarianism]]. Specifically, he defended \"extreme\", or [[act utilitarianism]], as opposed to \"restricted\", or [[rule utilitarianism]]. The distinction between these two types of ethical theory is explained in his essay ''Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism''.<ref>J.J.C. Smart, \"[http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8094(195610)6%3A25%3C344%3AEARU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism]\", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Oct. 1956, pages 344–354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955.  Smart later stated that he made mistakes in this essay (for example, that probably maximizing benefit is not the same thing as maximizing probable benefit).  However, perhaps because of this very fact, that is, perhaps because Smart did not fall prey to what might be called the \"philosopher's disease\" of attempting to be obsessively precise, this essay lays out a good clear, readable presentation of act utilitarianism.</ref>\n\nSmart gave two arguments against rule utilitarianism.  According to the first, rule utilitarianism collapses into act utilitarianism because there is no adequate criterion on what can count as a \"rule\".  According to the second, even if there were such a criterion, the rule utilitarian would be committed to the untenable position of preferring to follow a rule, even if it would be better if the rule were broken, which Smart called \"superstitious rule worship\".<ref>J.J.C. Smart, \"[http://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0031-8094(195610)6%3A25%3C344%3AEARU%3E2.0.CO%3B2-1 Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism]\", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Oct. 1956, pages 344–354, based on a paper read to the Victorian Branch of the Australasian Association of Psychology and philosophy, Oct. 1955.  Smart's views on rule utilitarianism have been challenged, for example by [[Alan Gibbard]]</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of Smart's ethical theory is his acceptance of a preference theory of well-being, which contrasts with the [[hedonism]] associated with \"classical\" utilitarians such as [[Jeremy Bentham]].  Smart's combination of the preference theory with [[consequentialism]] is sometimes called \"preference utilitarianism\".\n\nSmart's arguments against rule utilitarianism have been very influential, contributing to a steady decline in its popularity among ethicists during the late 20th century. Worldwide, his defence of act utilitarianism and preference theory has been less prominent but has influenced philosophers who have worked or been educated in Australia, such as [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]], [[Philip Pettit]], and [[Peter Singer]].\n\nOne of Smart's two entries in the [[Philosophical Lexicon]] refers to his approach to the consequences of act utilitarianism: to \"outsmart\" an opponent is \"to embrace the conclusion of one's opponent's [[reductio ad absurdum]] argument.\"  This move is more commonly called \"biting the bullet\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*J.J.C.
