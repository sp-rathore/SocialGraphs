In ''Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics'', Armstrong states that his philosophical system rests upon \"the assumption that all that exists is the space time world, the physical world as we say\".

The ultimate ontology of universals would only be realised with the completion of physical science. [[Mass]] would thus be a universal (subject to mass not being discarded by future physicists). Armstrong realises that we will need to refer to and use properties that are not considered universals in his sparse ontology—for instance, being able to refer to something ''being a game'' (to use the example from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's]] ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]''). Armstrong then suggests that a [[supervenience]] relation exists between these second order properties and the ontologically authentic universals given to us by physics.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Armstrong |first=D.

How Armstrong's theory of universals deals with relations with varying adicities has been raised as an issue by Fraser MacBride.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last=MacBride |first=F.\n |title=The Particular–Universal Distinction: A Dogma of Metaphysics?\n |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]\n |year=2005\n |volume=114 |issue=455 |pages=565–614\n |doi=10.1093/mind/fzi565\n}}</ref> MacBride argues that there can be relations where the number of terms in the relation varies across instances. Armstrong's response is to affirm a theory he describes as the Principle of Instantial Invariance, wherein the adicity of properties are essential and invariant. According to Armstrong, complex relations which seem to challenge the principle are not ontologically real but are second-order properties that can be reduced to more basic properties that subscribe to the Principle of Instantial Invariance.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.\n |year=2010\n |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics\n |pages=23–25\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5\n}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong rejects [[nominalism|nominalist]] accounts of properties that attempt to align properties simply with classes. Coextension is a problem they face: if properties are simply classes, in a world where all blue things are also wet, class nominalists are unable to draw a distinction between the property of being blue and being wet. He provides an analogy to the argument in ''[[Euthyphro]]'': to say that electrons are electrons because they are part of the class of electrons puts the cart before the horse. They are part of the class of electrons ''because'' they ''are'' electrons.<ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|pp=23–24}}</ref>\n\nIn Armstrong's view, nominalisms can also be criticised for producing a blob theory of reality. Objects have structure: they have parts, those parts are made of molecules, which are in turn made up of atoms standing in relation to one another, which are in turn made up of subatomic particles and so on. Blobbiness also threatens Platonic universals: a particular instantiating a universal in a world of Platonic universals becomes a matter of the blob-particular having a relation to a universal ''elsewhere'' (in the Platonic heaven, say), rather than having an internal relation in the way that a chemical element does to a constituent atom.<ref name=\"Universals\" />\n\nArmstrong further rejects nominalisms that deny that properties and relations exist in reality because he suggests that these sorts of nominalisms, specifically referring to what he calls class nominalism, and resemblance nominalism, postulate primitives of either class membership or resemblance. <ref>{{cite book\n |last=Armstrong |first=D.

M.\n |year=2010\n |title=Sketch for a Systematic Metaphysics\n |pages=36\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-19-965591-5\n}}</ref> A state of affairs roughly put is an instantiation of a particular and a universal: a state of affairs might be that a particular atom exists, instantiating a universal (say, that it is of a particular element, if chemical elements are ultimately accepted as part of Armstrong's universals). The particulars in Armstrong's ontology must have at least one universal—just as he rejects uninstantiated universals, he also rejects \"unpropertied particulars\".<ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=29}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong argues that states of affairs are distinct things in ontology because they are more than the sum of their parts. If some particular ''a'' has a non-symmetric relation ''R'' to another particular ''b'', then ''R (a, b)'' differs from ''R (b, a)''. It may be the case that ''R (a, b)'' obtains in the world but ''R (b, a)'' does not. Without states of affairs instantiating the particulars and universals (including relations), we cannot account for the truth of the one case and the falsity of the other.<ref name=\"Universals\"/>\n\n==== Laws of nature ====\nArmstrong's theory of universals gives him the basis for an understanding of laws of nature as being relations between universals, a non-[[David Hume|Humean]] account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong,<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Armstrong |first=D.

Under the theory of Armstrong, Tooley and Dretske, there is a relation of necessity between the universals ravenhood and blackness, rather than there being a relationship with every single raven. This allows the explanation of laws of nature that have not been instantiated. Mumford cites the frequently-used example of the [[moa]] bird: \"It is supposed that every bird of this now-extinct species died at a young age, though not because of anything in its genetic makeup. Rather, it died mainly because of some virus that just happened to sweep through the population. One bird could have escaped the virus only to be eaten by a predator on the day before its fiftieth birthday.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Mumford |first=S.\n |year=2009\n |chapter=Laws and Dispositions\n |editor-last1=Le Poidevin |editor-first1=R.\n |editor-last2=Peter |editor-first2=S.\n |editor-last3=McGonigal |editor-first3=A.\n |editor-last4=Cameron |editor-first4=R.

Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply in the nature of the instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Armstrong|first=D.

He initially was attracted to [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' and the rejection of Cartesian dualism. Armstrong did not accept behaviourism and instead defended a theory he referred to as the \"central-state theory\" which identifies mental states with the state of the central nervous system. In ''A Materialist Theory of Mind'', he accepted that mental states such as consciousness exist, but stated that they can be explained as physical phenomena.<ref>{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|pp=133–140}}</ref> Armstrong attributes his adoption of the central-state theory to the work of [[J.

Armstrong uses the analogy of a [[thermometer]]: as a thermometer changes to reflect the temperature of the environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship).<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Lehrer |first=K.\n |year=2000\n |title=Theory of knowledge\n |page=178\n |publisher=[[Westview Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8133-9053-6\n |ol=6787085M\n}}</ref> Here, Armstrong's view is broadly similar to that of [[Alvin Goldman]] and [[Robert Nozick]].<ref>\n{{Citation\n |last=Pollock |first=J.

In a paper for the [[Aristotelian Society]], Armstrong rejects a series of linguistic arguments for a rejection of the belief condition which argue that one can have knowledge without having belief because a common usage of the word 'belief' is to imply lack of knowledge—Armstrong gives the example of if you asked a man on a railway station whether the train has just left and he said \"I believe it has\", you would take from this that he does not ''know'' that it has.<ref name=\"PAS\">\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Armstrong |first=D. M.\n |year=1969\n |title=Does Knowledge Entail Belief?\n |journal=[[Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society]]\n |volume=70 |issue= |pages=21–36\n |jstor=4544782\n}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong also argues that contradictory beliefs show that there ''is'' a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to ''believe'' her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just happens that one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.<ref name=\"PAS\" /><ref name=\"Mumford 2007 155\">{{harvnb|Mumford|2007|p=155}}</ref>\n\nArmstrong presents a response to [[Colin Radford]]'s modified version of the \"unconfident examinee\" example. A student is asked when Queen Elizabeth I died, and he hesitatingly answers \"1603\" and exhibits no confidence in his answer. He has forgotten that at some point previously, he studied English history. Radford presents this as an example of knowledge without belief. But Armstrong differs on this: the unconfident examinee has a belief that Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, he knows that she died in 1603, but he does not ''know that he knows''. Armstrong rejects the [[KK Principle]]—that to know some thing ''p'', one must know that one knows ''p''.<ref name=\"PAS\" /><ref name=\"Mumford 2007 155\"/> Armstrong's rejection of the KK Principle is consistent with his wider externalist project.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Hemp |first=D.\n |date=15 October 2006\n |title=The KK (Knowing that One Knows) Principle\n |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/kk-princ/\n |work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]\n |accessdate=2014-07-27\n}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Books ===\n* {{cite book\n |author-mask=2\n |last=Armstrong |first=D.
