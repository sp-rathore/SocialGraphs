The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to ''Dune''.\n\n''Dune'' took six years of research and writing to complete and it was much longer than commercial science fiction of the time was supposed to run.

Beverly Herbert died on February 7, 1984, the same year that ''[[Heretics of Dune]]'' was published; in his afterword to 1985's ''[[Chapterhouse: Dune]]'', Frank Herbert wrote a eulogy for her.\n\nIn 1983, British [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden (band)|Iron Maiden]] requested permission from Herbert's publisher to name a song on their album ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' after ''Dune'', but were told that the author had a strong distaste for their style of music. They instead titled the song \"To Tame a Land\".\n\n1984 was a tumultuous year in Herbert's life. During this same year of his wife's death, his career took off with the release of [[David Lynch]]'s film version of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''. Despite high expectations, a big-budget production design and an A-list cast, the movie drew mostly poor reviews in the United States.

It points in relativistic directions. It says that we have the imagination for these other opportunities, these other choices. We tend to tie ourselves down to limited choices. We say, \"Well, the only answer is&nbsp;...\" or, \"If you would just&nbsp;...\". Whatever follows these two statements narrows the choices right there. It gets the vision right down close to the ground so that you don't see anything happening outside. Humans tend not to see over a long range. Now we are required, in these generations, to have a longer range view of what we inflict on the world around us. This is where, I think, science fiction is helping. I don't think that the mere writing of such a book as ''[[Brave New World]]'' or ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]]'' prevents those things which are portrayed in those books from happening. But I do think they alert us to that possibility and make that possibility less likely.

''Dune'' considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.<ref>Building Sci-fi Moviescapes: The Science Behind the Fiction by Matt Hanson</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bestsciencefictionbooks.com/authors/frank-herbert.html|title=Frank Herbert Biography Author Page - BestScienceFictionBooks.com|work=bestsciencefictionbooks.com}}</ref>\n* ''Dune'' was the first major ecological science fiction novel. Frank Herbert was a great popularizer of scientific ideas; many of his fans credit Frank Herbert for introducing them to philosophy and psychology. In ''Dune'' he helped popularize the term ''ecology'' and some of the field's concepts, vividly imparting a sense of planetary awareness.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Gerald Jonas explains in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'': \"So completely did Mr. Herbert work out the interactions of man and beast and geography and climate that ''Dune'' became the standard for a new subgenre of 'ecological' science fiction.\" As popularity of ''Dune'' rose, Herbert embarked on a lecture tour of college campuses, explaining how the environmental concerns of Dune's inhabitants were analogous to our own.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n* ''Dune'' is considered an epic example of literary world-building. ''[[Library Journal|The Library Journal]]'' reports that \"Dune is to science fiction what ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is to fantasy.\" [[Arthur C. Clarke]] is quoted as making a similar statement on the back cover of a paper edition of ''Dune''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Herbert|first1=Frank|title=Dune|date=January 1977|publisher=Berkley Publishing Corp|location=USA|isbn=0425-04376-2|page=Back Cover|edition=Berkley Medallion|ref=berk}}</ref> Frank Herbert imagined every facet of his creation. He lovingly included glossaries, quotes, documents, and histories, to bring his universe alive to his readers. No science fiction novel before it had so vividly realized life on another world.<ref name=\"gm\" />\n\nHerbert wrote more than twenty novels after ''Dune'' that are regarded as being of variable quality. Books like ''[[The Green Brain]]'', ''[[The Santaroga Barrier]]'' seemed to hark back to the days before ''Dune'', when a good technological idea was all that was needed to drive a sci-fi novel. And some fans of the ''Dune'' saga are critical of the follow-up novels as being subpar.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nHerbert never again equalled the critical acclaim he received for ''Dune''. Neither his sequels to ''Dune'' nor any of his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although almost all of them were [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Sellers]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}<ref name=\"KJA\">Speaking at the 2006 induction of Herbert in the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Kevin J. Anderson stated that ''Children of Dune'' (1976) \"was the first SF novel ever to hit the New York Times bestseller list.\" [http://www.frankherbert.org/dune7blog/page81.html Dune 7 Blog: Wednesday, June 21, 2006: The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]. By KJA. ''Dune: The Official Website''. Retrieved 2011-07-17. KJA spoke and presented the award to son Brian Herbert.</ref> Some felt that ''Children of Dune'' was almost too literary and too dark to get the recognition it may have deserved; others felt that ''The Dosadi Experiment'' lacked an epic quality that fans had come to expect.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nLargely overlooked because of the concentration on ''Dune'' was Herbert's 1973 novel, ''[[Hellstrom's Hive]]'', with its minutely worked-out depiction of a human society modeled on [[social insects]], which could be counted a major [[utopia]]/[[dystopia]].\n\n[[Malcolm Edwards]] in the ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'' wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Much of Herbert's work makes difficult reading. His ideas were genuinely developed concepts, not merely decorative notions, but they were sometimes embodied in excessively complicated plots and articulated in prose which did not always match the level of thinking ... His best novels, however, were the work of a speculative intellect with few rivals in modern science fiction.<ref>Malcolm Edwards, \"Herbert, Frank\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', edited by [[John Clute]] and\n[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]].
