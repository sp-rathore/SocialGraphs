defends a version of [[negative utilitarianism]]:\n\n<blockquote>Ethical negative-utilitarianism is a value-system which challenges the moral symmetry of pleasure and pain. It doesn't question the value of enhancing the happiness of the already happy. Yet it attaches value in a distinctively moral sense of the term only to actions which tend to minimise or eliminate suffering. [...] [negative utilitarianism stems from] a deep sense of compassion at the sheer scale and intensity of suffering in the world. No amount of happiness or fun enjoyed by some organisms can notionally justify the indescribable horrors of Auschwitz. Nor can it outweigh the sporadic frightfulness of pain and despair that occurs every second of every day.<ref name=\"hedweb.com\">{{cite news|title=Negative Utilitarianism: Why Be Negative? |url=http://www.hedweb.com/negutil.htm |accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTherefore, abolishing suffering should be humanity's highest priority according to Pearce. Pearce believes the only realistic way to do this is \"[...] to use biotechnology to eradicate aversive experience in all sentient life. Life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed. In the post-Darwinian Era, applied nanotechnology will extend hedonic engineering to all life-forms on the planet.\"<ref name=\"hedweb.com\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=The Abolitionist Project |url=http://abolitionist.com |accessdate=10 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==BLTC Research==\n\nPearce runs a web-hosting company<ref name=\"lifeboat\"/> and owns BLTC Research, a series of websites based in [[Kemptown, Brighton|Kemptown]], Brighton, UK, originally set up by Pearce in 1995 when he published ''The Hedonistic Imperative''.
