He was educated at the [[University of Leiden]], where he studied [[Plato]]. Failing to obtain a professorship, he entered the service of the state, and for many years acted as secretary to the state council of the United Provinces. He died at the Hague on 7 July 1790. Through his philosophical writings he became acquainted with many distinguished persons--[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried von Herder|Herder]], Princess [[Adelheid Amalie Gallitzin]], and especially [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], with whom he had much in common. His most valuable contributions are in the department of aesthetics or the general analysis of feeling. His philosophy has been characterized as [[Socrates|Socratic]] in content and Platonic in form. Its foundation was the desire for self-knowledge and truth, untrammelled by the rigid bonds of any particular system.\n\nHis most important works, all of which were written in French, are:\n*''Lettre sur la sculpture'' (1769), in which occurs the well-known definition of the Beautiful as \"that which gives us the greatest number of ideas in the shortest space of time\"\n*its continuation, ''Lettre sur les désirs'' (1770)\n*''Lettre sur l'homme et ses rapports'' (1772), in which the \"moral organ\" and the theory of knowledge are discussed\n*''Sopyle'' (1778), a dialogue on the relation between the soul and the body, and also an attack on materialism\n*''Aristée'' (1779), the \"theodicy\" of Hemsterhuis, discussing the existence of God and his relation to man\n*''Simon'' (1787), on the four [[faculties of the soul]], which are the will, the imagination, the moral principle (which is both passive and active)\n*''Alexis'' (1787), an attempt to prove that there are three golden ages, the last being the life beyond the grave\n*''Lettre sur l'athéisme'' (1787).\n\nThe best collected edition of his works is by PS Meijboom (1846-1850); see also SA Gronemann, ''F. Hemsterhuis, de Nederlandische Wijsgeer'' (Utrecht, 1867); E Grucker, ''François Hemsterhuis, sa vie et ses œuvres'' (Paris, 1866); E Meyer, ''Der Philosoph Franz Hemsterhuis'' (Breslau, 1893), with bibliographical notice; Augustinus P.
