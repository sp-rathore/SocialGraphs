Field''' (born 1946) is an American philosopher. He is Silver Professor of Philosophy at [[New York University]] and notable contributor to philosophy of language, mind, and mathematics.  He previously taught at [[Princeton University]], the [[University of Southern California]] and The Graduate Center of the [[City University of New York]].  He earned his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] under the direction of [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==Biography==\nHis first work was a commentary on [[Alfred Tarski]]'s theory of [[truth]], which he has worked on since 1972.  His current view on this matter is in favor of a [[deflationary theory of truth]]. His most influential work produced in this period is probably \"Theory Change and the Indeterminacy of Reference\" (''Journal of Philosophy'', 70, 14: 462-481), in which he introduced the concept of partial [[denotation]].\n\nIn the 1980s, Field started a project in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] discussing mathematical [[fictionalism]], the doctrine that all mathematical statements are merely useful fictions, and shouldn't be taken to be literally true.  More precisely, Field holds that the existence of  [[set (mathematics)|sets]] may be denied, in opposition to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]].<ref>Yablo, Stephen.
