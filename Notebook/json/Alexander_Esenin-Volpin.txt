After graduation, Volpin was sent to the Ukrainian city of [[Chernovtsy]] to teach mathematics at the local state university. Less than a month after his arrival in Chernovtsy he was  arrested by the [[Ministry for State Security (Soviet Union)|MGB]], sent on a plane back to Moscow, and incarcerated in the [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka prison]].

A year later he was abruptly released from the prison hospital, and sentenced to five years exile in the Kazakh town of Karaganda as a \"socially dangerous element.\" In Karagada, he found employment as a teacher of evening and correspondence courses in mathematics. \n\nIn 1953, after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], Volpin was released due to a general amnesty. Soon he became a known mathematician specializing in the fields of [[ultrafinitism]] and [[intuitionism]].\n\n===The Glasnost demonstration===\n\nIn 1965, Esenin-Volpin organized a legendary \"[[Glasnost Meeting|glasnost meeting\"]] (\"митинг гласности\"), a demonstration at Pushkin Square in the center of [[Moscow]] demanding an open and fair trial for the arrested writers [[Andrei Sinyavsky]] and [[Yuli Daniel]]. The leaflets written by Volpin and distributed through [[samizdat]] asserted that the accusations and their closed-door trial were in violation of the 1936 Soviet Constitution and the more recent RSFSR Criminal Procedural Code. \n\nThe meeting was attended by about 200 people, many of whom turned out to be [[KGB]] operatives. The slogans read: \"Требуем гласности суда над Синявским и Даниэлем\" (We demand an [[Public trial|open trial]] for Sinyavski and Daniel) and \"Уважайте советскую конституцию\" (Respect the Soviet constitution).<ref>[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm {{ru-icon}} Text]</ref> The demonstrators were promptly arrested.\n\n{{quotebox|right|width=30%\n|quote=\n[Volpin] would explain to anyone who cared to listen a simple but unfamiliar idea: all laws ought to be understood in exactly the way they are written and not as they are interpreted by the government and the government ought to fulfill those laws to the letter [...].

He was one of the first [[Soviet dissidents]] who took on a \"legalist\" strategy of dissent. He proclaimed that it is possible and necessary to defend human rights by strictly observing the law, and in turn demand that the authorities observe the formally guaranteed rights.

There is the obvious “draw the line” objection, asking where in 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, … , 2<sup>100</sup> do we stop having “Platonistic reality”? Here this … is totally innocent, in that it can be easily be replaced by 100 items (names) separated by commas. I raised just this objection with the (extreme) ultrafinitist Yessenin-Volpin during a lecture of his. He asked me to be more specific. I then proceeded to start with 2<sup>1</sup> and asked him whether this is “real” or something to that effect. He virtually immediately said yes. Then I asked about 2<sup>2</sup>, and he again said yes, but with a perceptible delay. Then 2<sup>3</sup>, and yes, but with more delay. This continued for a couple of more times, till it was obvious how he was handling this objection. Sure, he was prepared to always answer yes, but he was going to take 2<sup>100</sup> times as long to answer yes to 2<sup>100</sup> then he would to answering 2<sup>1</sup>.
