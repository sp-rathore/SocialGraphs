Rector – for the second time – of the [[Babeş-Bolyai University]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]], he was a member of the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PNŢCD), serving as [[Ministry of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Minister of Education]] in the [[Romanian Democratic Convention|Democratic Convention]] (CDR) coalition governments of [[Victor Ciorbea]], [[Radu Vasile]], and [[Mugur Isărescu]] (1997-2000). In January 2001, he replaced [[Ion Diaconescu]] as PNŢCD chairman, but resigned from his post in July 2001, amid political tensions in the party. He formed a new party, the Popular Christian Party later in the year.<ref>Alan J. Day, Roger East, Richard Thomas, ''A Political and Economic Dictionary of Eastern Europe'', Europa Publications, London, 2002. p.112.</ref> Later, he affiliated with the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL).\n\nMarga has authored a large number of volumes on [[political science]], [[political philosophy]], and the [[philosophy of history]]. His work touches a variety of subjects, including the philosophical theories of [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]], the nature of [[positivism]], and trends in contemporary philosophy.<ref name=\"diaconu\">{{Ro icon}} Mădălina Diaconu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=13330&print=true \"Premiile Herder 2005\"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]''; retrieved August 4, 2007</ref> He has also lectured on specific subjects, such as the philosophic foundations of transition from [[communism]] to a [[market economy]], and the evolution of principles guiding [[European integration]].<ref name=\"diaconu\"/> In later works, he approached topics pertaining to the [[philosophy of religion]], and to the status of religion in the age of [[globalization]].<ref name=\"diaconu\"/> In 2005, Andrei Marga received the [[Herder Prize]] in recognition of his contributions.<ref name=\"diaconu\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nMarga was born in [[Bucharest]], attended the [[University of Cluj]] and also had a one-year scholarship at the [[University of Freiburg]] (West Germany).<ref>{{cite web|title=Speaker and Presenter Biographies|url=http://archive.unu.edu/globalization/2007/bio.html|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusiv Documente: Andrei Marga de la activist A.S.C. plătit de PCR la ministru liberal în Guvernul Ponta|url=http://www.napocanews.ro/2012/07/documente-andrei-marga-de-la-activist-a-s-c-platit-de-pcr-la-ministru-liberal-in-guvernul-ponta-foto.html|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he became the rector of the Babeş-Bolyai University, of Cluj-Napoca.\n\nAs minister, Andrei Marga promoted [[Education in Romania|educational system]] [[Education reform|reform]], stressing that the communist legacy had contributed to a rise in [[political corruption]], and indicating that Romanian education lacked staples of [[professionalism]] such as underlined purposes, standards in [[Professional certification|certification]], and [[evaluation]] criteria.<ref name=\"Daun & Săpătoru, p.171\">Daun & Săpătoru, p.171</ref> Marga also criticized the system for relying on \"original features\" and \"Romanian traditions\", which had been explained as a means to promote national development, but, in effect, had contributed to the gap between Romania and the Western world.<ref name=\"Daun & Săpătoru, p.171\"/> He called for [[modernization]], and defined his goals as \"increasing the links between education and the economic, administrative and cultural environment, improving the educational infrastructure, eliminating [[paternalism]] and [[populism]] from educational [[management]], and enhancing international cooperation in education\".<ref name=\"Daun & Săpătoru, p.171\"/>\n\nThe program was criticized by the political opposition, who argued that the system in place was satisfactory, and blamed the existing problems on the post-1989 political and social climate.<ref>Daun & Săpătoru, p.173</ref> In parallel, supporters of reform were dissatisfied with its slow pace and inadequate financing.<ref>Daun & Săpătoru, p.171-172</ref>\n\nIn early 1998, a controversy erupted in Romanian politics, after the CDR announced that it was planning to stand by the plan to set up separate universities for the [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian minority]].<ref name=\"survey1998\">Matyas Szabó, \"Romania. The perils of Coalition politics\", in Peter Rutland, ''Annual Survey of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union 1998'', M.E. Sharpe, Armonk, 2000, p.265. ISBN 0-7656-0360-8</ref> The decision was in turn based on a promise made to their coalition partner, the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]].<ref name=\"survey1998\"/> In this context, Marga took the middle ground, saying that he supported separate [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-language]] sections but not separate institutions (a similar view was expressed by the CDR's other coalition partner, the [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]]).<ref name=\"survey1998\"/>\n\nMarga joined the PNŢCD in 1999, and became its leader two years later. Party rules prohibited members with less than five years in the party from running for party president. During the party's congress, a few candidates resigned in support of Marga and the party's constitution was amended to allow Marga to run. Marga defeated his [[Conservatism|conservative]] opponents with the support of the congress in spite of opposition from the party hierarchy. He was brought in to reform the party and position it to recover from the losses of the [[Romanian legislative election, 2000|December 2000 election]]. His [[tenure]] failed to bring in the rapid changes desired and opposition from prominent conservative elements in his party stifled his ideas. He resigned in July 2001.<ref>Lavinia Stan, \"From Riches to Rags: The Romanian Christian Democrat Peasant Party\", in ''East European Quarterly'', Vol. 39, 2005.</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Marga joined the PNŢCD's former coalition partner, the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]]. From May to August 2012, Marga served as Foreign Minister in the government of [[Victor Ponta]].\n\n==Published works==\n* ''Herbert Marcuse. Studiu critic'' (\"Herbert Marcuse.
