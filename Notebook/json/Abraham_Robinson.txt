Nearly half of Robinson's papers were in [[applied mathematics]] rather than in [[pure mathematics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Robinson.html|title=Robinson biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2016-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born to a [[Jewish]] family with strong [[Zionist]] beliefs, in [[Wałbrzych|Waldenburg]], [[German Empire|Germany]], which is now [[Wałbrzych]], in [[Poland]]. In 1933, he [[emigrate]]d to [[British Mandate of Palestine]], where he earned a first degree from the [[Hebrew University]]. Robinson was in [[France]] when the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] invaded during [[World War II]], and escaped by train and on foot, being alternately questioned by French soldiers suspicious of his German passport and asked by them to share his map, which was more detailed than theirs. While in [[London]], he joined the [[Free French Air Force]] and contributed to the war effort by teaching himself [[aerodynamics]] and becoming an expert on the [[airfoil]]s used in the wings of fighter planes.\n\nAfter the war, Robinson worked in [[London]], [[Toronto]], and [[Jerusalem]], but ended up at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1962.\n\n==Work in model theory==\nHe became known for his approach of using the methods of [[mathematical logic]] to attack problems in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[abstract algebra]]. He \"introduced many of the fundamental notions of [[model theory]]\".<ref>Hodges, W: \"A Shorter Model Theory\", page 182. CUP, 1997</ref> Using these methods, he found a way of using [[formal logic]] to show that there are self-consistent nonstandard models of the [[real number system]] that include infinite and infinitesimal numbers. Others, such as [[Wilhelmus Luxemburg]], showed that the same results could be achieved using [[ultrafilter]]s, which made Robinson's work more accessible to mathematicians who lacked training in formal logic. Robinson's book ''Non-standard Analysis'' was published in 1966. Robinson was strongly interested in the history and philosophy of mathematics, and often remarked that he wanted to get inside the head of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], the first mathematician to attempt to articulate clearly the concept of [[infinitesimal|infinitesimal numbers]].\n\nWhile at UCLA his colleagues remember him as working hard to accommodate [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] students of all levels of ability by finding them projects of the appropriate difficulty. He was courted by [[Yale University|Yale]], and after some initial reluctance, he moved there in 1967. He died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 1974.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n* {{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Abraham | author1-link=Abraham Robinson | title=Introduction to model theory and to the metamathematics of algebra | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDQEaAEACAAJ | publisher=North-Holland | location=Amsterdam | isbn=978-0-7204-2222-1 | mr=0153570 | year=1963}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Robinson | first1=Abraham | author1-link=Abraham Robinson | editor1-last=Keisler | editor1-first=H.
