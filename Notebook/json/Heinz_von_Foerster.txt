He was the grandson of Austrian architect [[:de:Emil von Förster|Emil Ritter von Foerster]]. He studied physics at the [[Technical University of Vienna]] and at the [[University of Breslau]], where in 1944 he received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]]. His relatives included [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[:de:Erwin Lang (Maler)|Erwin Lang]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].

He also was professor of [[biophysics]] (1962–1975) and Director of the [[Biological Computer Laboratory]] (1958–1975). Additionally, in 1956–57 and 1963–64 he was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] and also President of the [http://www.wennergren.org/ Wenner-Gren-Foundation] for anthropological research from 1963–1965.<ref name=\"Constructivism\"/>\n\nHe knew well and was in conversation with [[John von Neumann]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Gordon Pask]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] and [[Margaret Mead]], among many others. He influenced generations of students as a teacher and inclusive, enthusiastic collaborator.\n\n==Work==\nVon Foerster was influenced by the [[Vienna Circle]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. He worked in the field of [[cybernetics]] and is known as the inventor of [[second-order cybernetics]].<ref name=FUP/>  He made important contributions to [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]].<ref>Segal, L. ''The Dream of Reality: Heinz Von Foerster's Constructivism'', Springer, 2001. ISBN 0-387-95130-X</ref> He is also known for his interest in computer music and [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].\n\n===The electron tube laboratory===\nIn 1949 von Foerster started work at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] at the electron tube laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department, where he succeeded [[Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner]]. With his students he developed many innovative devices, including ultra-high-frequency electronics<ref>See for example, in ''Review of Scientific Instruments'' '''25''': 640–653, 1954.</ref>\n\nHe also worked on mathematical models of population dynamics and developed a general model now called the \"[[Von Foerster equation (ecology)|von Foerster Equation]]\"\n\nThe mathematical formula can be derived from first principles and reads:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a}  = - m(a)n, </math>\n\nwhere: ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''(''t'',''a''), ''t'' stands for time and ''a'' for age. ''m''(''a'') is the death in function of the population age; ''n''(''t'',''a'') is the population density in function of age.\n\nWhen ''m''(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, we have:<ref name=\"ref1\">Murray, J.D.

It was von Foerster who suggested that Wiener's coinage \"[[Cybernetics]]\" be applied to this conference series, which had previously been called \"Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social Systems\".\n\n===Doomsday equation===\nA 1960 issue of ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' magazine included an article by von Foerster and his colleagues P. M. Mora and L. W. Amiot proposing a formula representing a best fit to available historical data on world population; the authors then predicted future population growth on the basis of this formula.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Heinz von Foerster, P.

In such a situation, doubling-time decreases over time. Von Foerster's tongue-in-cheek prediction of Doomsday on November 13, 2026, was based on an extrapolation into the future of doubling-time, with the finding that doubling-time would decrease to zero on that date.\n\nResponders to his Doomsday prediction objected on the grounds of the finite human gestation time of 9 months, and the transparent fact that biological systems rarely persist in exponential growth for any substantial length of time. Those who knew von Foerster could see in his rejoinders an evident sense of humor.\n\n====Doomsday Equation: recent research====\nThe [[hyperbolic growth]] of the [[world population]] observed until the 1970s has recently been correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows:<ref>see, e.g., [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&page=Book&id=37484&lang=en&blang=en&list=14 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics''] by [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.''</ref>\n* technological growth implies an increase in [[carrying capacity]], an increase in the number of people who can survive on any given plot of land\n* demographic growth (more people) implies more potential inventors and hence an acceleration of technological growth\n* accelerating technological growth causes accelerating growth of carrying capacity, in a positive feedback loop\n* faster population growth likewise feeds back by accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors, and then even faster technological growth\n* hence, even faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Systems science}}\n* [[Logarithmic timeline]]\n* [[Das Netz]]: interview with von Foerster, 2003\n* [[Macy conferences]]\n* [[Power law]]: The equation that he derived for the date calculated is one that nowadays is called a power law.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events]]\n\n==Publications==\nVon Foerster authored more than 100 publications.<ref>The [http://www.univie.ac.at/constructivism/HvF/bib.htm Bibliography of Heinz von Foerster 1943–2003], from Alexander Riegler, dec 2003 gives an overview of all his publications.</ref> Books, a selection:\n\n* 1949, ''Cybernetics: Transactions of the Sixth Conference'', (editor), Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation: New York, 220 pp.\n* 2002, ''Understanding understanding'', a volume of von Foerster's papers, published by Springer-Verlag, 2002.\n* 2010, with Monika Broecker: Part of the World.
