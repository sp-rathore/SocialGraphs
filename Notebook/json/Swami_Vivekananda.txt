He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the Western world{{Sfn|Georg|2002|p=600}} and is credited with raising [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] awareness, bringing [[Hinduism]] to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.{{Sfn|Clarke|2006|p=209}} He was a major force in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]] in India, and contributed to the concept of [[nationalism]] in colonial India.{{Sfn|Von Dense|1999|p=191}} Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].{{Sfn|Georg|2002|p=600}} He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, \"Sisters and brothers of America&nbsp;...,\"{{Sfn|Dutt|2005|p=121}} in which he introduced Hinduism at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in Chicago in 1893.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his [[Guru]], Ramakrishna Deva, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in [[British India]]. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of [[Hindu philosophy]] in the United States, England and Europe.

Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to \"the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.\"{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=8}} He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come \"face to face with God\", but none of their answers satisfied him.{{sfn|Sen|2006|pp=12–13}}{{sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p=106}} At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God.

Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.{{Sfn|Paranjape|2012|p=132}}\n\nIn late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna.{{Sfn|Chattopadhyaya|1999|p=43}} This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=232}} Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}} He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as \"mere figments of imagination\"{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}} and \"hallucinations\".{{Sfn|Rolland|1929a| pp = 169–193}} As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of [[Kali]].{{Sfn|Arora|1968|p=4}} He even rejected the [[Advaita Vedanta]] of \"identity with the absolute\" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea.{{Sfn|Rolland|1929a| pp = 169–193}} Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: \"Try to see the truth from all angles\", he replied.{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}}\n\nNarendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college.<!--Ref verification needed-->{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=8}} He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence,{{Sfn|Sil|1997|p=38}} but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.{{Sfn|Sil|1997|pp=39–40}}\n\nOne day Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess.{{Sfn|Kishore|2001|pp=23–25}}{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|pp=25–26}}{{Sfn|Sil|1997|p=27}} Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his [[Guru]].{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|pp=10–13}}\n\nIn 1885, Ramakrishna developed [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]], and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in [[Cossipore]]. Narendra and Ramakrishna's [[Disciples of Ramakrishna|other disciples]] took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced ''[[Nirvikalpa]] [[samadhi]]''.{{Sfn|Isherwood|1976|p=20}} Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order.{{Sfn|Pangborn|Smith|1976|p= 98}} He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1964}}{{Sfn|Isherwood|1976|p=20}} Ramakrishna asked him to care for the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader.{{Sfn|Rolland| 1929b| pp= 201–214}} Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.{{Sfn|Rolland| 1929b| pp= 201–214}}{{Sfn|Banhatti|1995|p=17}}\n\n===Founding of first Ramakrishna Math at Baranagar===\n{{Main|Baranagar Math}}\nAfter Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples.

Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by \"holy begging\" (''mādhukarī''). The math became the first building of the [[Ramakrishna Math]]: the monastery of the [[Monasticism|monastic order]] of Ramakrishna.{{Sfn|Prabhananda|2003|p=232}} Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day.{{Sfn|Nikhilananda|1953|p=40}} Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery:{{Sfn|Chetananda|1997|p=38}}\n{{quote|We underwent a lot of religious practice at the Baranagar Math.

He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|1996|pp=1–2}} He wanted \"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\".<ref name=\"Swami Vivekananda life and teaching\">{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda life and teaching|url=http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|publisher=Belur Math|accessdate=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nVivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it.{{Sfn|Bhuyan|2003|p=93}} He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have ''[[śraddhā]]'' (faith). Vivekananda supported ''[[brahmacharya]]'' (celibacy),{{Sfn|Seifer |2001|p=164}} believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence.{{Sfn|Vivekananda|2001|loc=Conversations and Dialogues, Chapter \"VI – X Shri Priya Nath Sinha\", Vol '''5'''}} He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life&nbsp;– think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\".{{Sfn|Kashyap|2012|p=12}}\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n{{Main|Influence and legacy of Swami Vivekananda}}\nVivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}} [[Agehananda Bharati]] explained, \"...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly\".{{Sfn|Rambachan|1994|pp=6–8}} Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal.{{Sfn|Shattuck|1999|pp=93–94}} However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism.{{Sfn|Shattuck|1999|pp=93–94}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer   = ''(left)'' Vivekananda statue near the [[Gateway of India]], Mumbai<br />''(right)'' at Shri Ramakrishna Vidyashala, Mysore, India\n\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Mumbai 03-2016 32 monument to Swami Vivekananda.jpg\n| width1    = 180\n| alt1      = Statue in a garden\n\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Vidyashala sv structure.jpg\n| width2    = 178\n| alt2      = at Shri Ramakrishna Vidyashala, Mysore, India\n}}\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal.

More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India\".{{Sfn|Bharathi|1998b|p=37}} Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening.{{Sfn|Bharathi|1998b|pp=37–38}} His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. [[Sri Aurobindo]] regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually.{{Sfn|Bhide|2008||p=69}} [[Mahatma Gandhi]] counted him among the few Hindu reformers \"who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition\".{{Sfn|Parel|2000|p=77}}\n[[File:Vivekananda Circle Mysore.jpg|thumbnail|Vivekananda Circle, Mysore]]\nThe first governor-general of independent India, [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]], said \"Vivekananda saved Hinduism, saved India\".{{Sfn|Shetty|2009|p=517}} According to [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], a proponent of armed struggle for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], Vivekananda was \"the maker of modern India\";<ref>{{cite web|title=Article on Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.ramakrishna.eu/EnglishVivekananda.html|accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref> for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's \"love for his country a thousandfold\".
