He is known for his writings in [[anarcho-capitalist|market anarchist]] theory, which is the subject of his most popular book, ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' (1973, revised 1989 and 2014). He has authored several other books and articles, including ''Price Theory: An Intermediate Text'' (1986), ''Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters'' (2000), ''Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life'' (1996), and ''Future Imperfect'' (2008).<ref>Free Market Mojo. [http://freemarketmojo.com/?p=5539 \"An Interview with David D. Friedman\"].</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\nDavid Friedman is the son of economists [[Rose Friedman|Rose]] and [[Milton Friedman]]. He graduated ''magna cum laude'' from Harvard University in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and physics.<ref>[http://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/friedman-david/ Faculty Profile: David Friedman]. Santa Clara Law School</ref> He later earned a master's (1967) and a [[Ph.D.]] (1971) in theoretical physics from the [[University of Chicago]].<ref>[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Academic.html David Friedman C.V.]</ref> He was previously a Markle Senior Fellow at [[New America Foundation]] from 2000 to 2002. He is currently a professor of law at [[Santa Clara University]],<ref>[http://phonebook.scu.edu/?v=pid&i=462 SCU Faculty Directory]</ref> and a contributing editor for ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine. He is an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>Friedman, David D. [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/01/atheism-and-religion.html \"Atheism and Religion\"], ''Ideas''.</ref> His son, [[Patri Friedman]], has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly [[seasteading]].\n\n===The Machinery of Freedom===\nIn his book ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' (1973), Friedman sketched a form of [[anarcho-capitalism]] where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the [[free market]]. This differs from the version proposed by [[Murray Rothbard]], where a legal code would first be consented to by the parties involved in setting up the anarcho-capitalist society. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual [[privatization]] of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing law and order itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent [[anarcho-capitalist revolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Machinery of Freedom|pages=149–150|chapter=Revolution Is the Hell of It|author=Friedman, David D|isbn=0-8126-9069-9}}</ref>\n\nHe advocates a [[Consequentialist libertarianism|consequentialist]] version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for anarchism on a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of state versus no state.<ref>Morris, Christopher. 1992. An Essay on the Modern State. Cambridge University Press. p. 62.</ref> It is contrasted with the [[Natural-rights libertarianism|natural-rights]] approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist [[Murray Rothbard]].\n\n==Non-academic interests==\nFriedman is a longtime member of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], where he is known as ''Duke Cariadoc of the Bow''. He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval [[Middle East]].<ref>[http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Medieval/Restructuring.html Friedman, David D. \"On Restructuring the SCA\"]</ref> His work is compiled in the popular ''Cariadoc's Miscellany''.<ref>[http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/cariadoc/miscellany.html Cariadoc's Miscellany]</ref> He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the [[Pennsic War]]; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge...and lost.<ref>F.L. Watkins (Fólki Þorgilsson). 2005.
