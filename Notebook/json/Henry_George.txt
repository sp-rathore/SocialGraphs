George is famous for popularizing the idea that [[Land (economics)|land]]/[[natural resource|resource]] rents be captured for public use or shared, in lieu of harmful taxes on labor and productive investment. The philosophy and reform movement were known in George's time as [[Georgism|'Single-Tax']]. His immensely popular writing is credited with sparking several reform movements of the [[Progressive Era]] and ultimately inspiring the broad economic philosophy that is today often referred to as [[Georgism]], the main tenet of which is that people legitimately own value they fairly create, but that [[natural resources]] and [[commons|common opportunities]], most importantly [[ground rent|the value of land or location]], are rightfully owned in common by individuals in a community, rather than titleholders. His most famous work, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' (1879), sold millions of copies worldwide, probably more than any other American book before that time. The treatise investigates the paradox of increasing inequality and poverty amid economic and technological progress, the [[business cycle|cyclic nature of industrialized economies]], and the use of extensive [[land value tax]] as a remedy for these and other social problems.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Life and career===\nGeorge was born in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to a lower-middle-class family, the second of ten children of Richard S. H. George and Catharine Pratt George (née Vallance). His father was a publisher of religious texts and a devout Episcopalian, and sent George to the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. George chafed at his religious upbringing and left the academy without graduating.<ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' 1st. ed., s.v. \"George, Henry,\" edited by Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone, Vol. VII (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931), pp. 211–212.</ref><ref>David Montgomery, ''American National Biography Online,'' s.v. \"George, Henry,\" Feb. 2000, http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00261.html Accessed September 3, 2011</ref> Instead he convinced his father to hire a tutor and supplemented this with avid reading and attending lectures at the Franklin institute.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"American National Biography Online.\"</ref> His formal education ended at age 14 and he went to sea as a foremast boy at age 15 in April 1855 on the ''Hindoo'', bound for [[Melbourne]] and [[Kolkata|Calcutta]].

The uncle, a prosperous, strong-minded man, was opposed to his niece's impoverished suitor. But the couple, defying him, eloped and married in late 1861, with Henry dressed in a borrowed suit and Annie bringing only a packet of books. The marriage was a happy one and four children were born to them. Fox's mother was [[Irish Catholic]], and while George remained an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Protestant]], the children were raised [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. On November 3, 1862 Annie gave birth to future [[United States Representative]] from New York, [[Henry George, Jr.]] (1862–1916). Early on, even with the birth of future sculptor, [[Richard F.

He was a strong critic of railroad and mining interests, corrupt politicians, land speculators, and labor contractors. He first articulated his views in an 1868 article entitled \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us.\" George argued that the boom in railroad construction would benefit only the lucky few who owned interests in the railroads and other related enterprises, while throwing the greater part of the population into abject poverty. This had led to him earning the enmity of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]'s executives, who helped defeat his bid for election to the [[California State Assembly]].<ref name=\"anb.org\"/><ref name=\"grundskyld.dk\">Henry George, \"What the Railroad Will Bring Us,\" ''Overland Monthly'' 1, no. 4 (Oct. 1868), http://www.grundskyld.dk/1-railway.html Accessed September 3, 2011.</ref><ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s.v. \"George, Henry,\" 213.</ref>\n\nOne day in 1871 George went for a horseback ride and stopped to rest while overlooking [[San Francisco Bay]]. He later wrote of the revelation that he had:\n\n{{quote|I asked a passing teamster, for want of something better to say, what land was worth there. He pointed to some cows grazing so far off that they looked like mice, and said, 'I don't know exactly, but there is a man over there who will sell some land for a thousand dollars an acre.' Like a flash it came over me that there was the reason of advancing poverty with advancing wealth. With the growth of population, land grows in value, and the men who work it must pay more for the privilege.<ref>[[Albert Jay Nock|Nock, Albert Jay]]. [http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/nock_henry_george_01.html Henry George: Unorthodox American, Part IV].</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, on a visit to New York City, he was struck by the apparent paradox that the poor in that long-established city were much worse off than the poor in less developed California. These observations supplied the theme and title for his 1879 book ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', which was a great success, selling over 3 million copies. In it George made the argument that a sizeable portion of the wealth created by social and technological advances in a [[free market]] economy is possessed by land owners and [[monopoly|monopolists]] via [[economic rent]]s, and that this concentration of unearned wealth is the main cause of poverty. George considered it a great injustice that private profit was being earned from restricting access to natural resources while productive activity was burdened with heavy taxes, and indicated that such a system was equivalent to [[slavery]] – a concept somewhat similar to [[wage slavery]]. This is also the work in which he made the case for a [[land value tax]] in which governments would tax the value of the land itself, thus preventing private interests from profiting upon its mere possession, but allowing the value of all improvements made to that land to remain with investors.<ref>Jurgen G. Backhaus, \"Henry George's Ingenious Tax: A Contemporary Restatement,\" ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 56, no. 4 (Oct. 1997), 453–458</ref><ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjcqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=progress+and+poverty+1886&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T5_7TviMH5SEtgeD4YjQBg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false, ''Progress and Poverty,''] (1879; reprinted, London: Kegan Paul, Tench & Co., 1886), 283–284.</ref>\n\nGeorge was in a position to discover this pattern, having experienced poverty himself, knowing many different societies from his travels, and living in California at a time of rapid growth.  In particular he had noticed that the construction of railroads in California was increasing land values and rents as fast as or faster than wages were rising.<ref name=\"grundskyld.dk\"/><ref>Charles A.

[http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.us/]</ref> George moved to New York City, becoming closely allied with the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] community despite being of [[English Americans|English]] ancestry. From there he made several speaking journeys abroad to places such as [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] where access to land was (and still is) a major political issue.  In 1886 George campaigned for mayor of New York City as the candidate of the United Labor Party, the short-lived political society of the [[Central Labor Union]].  He polled second, more than the Republican candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. The election was won by [[Tammany Hall]] candidate [[Abram Stevens Hewitt]] by what many of George's supporters believed was fraud. In the [[New York state election, 1887|1887 New York state elections]], George came in a distant third in the election for [[Secretary of State of New York]].<ref name=\"anb.org\"/><ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s.v. \"George, Henry,\" 214–215.</ref> The United Labor Party was soon weakened by internal divisions: the management was essentially Georgist, but as a party of organized labor it also included some [[Marxist]] members who did not want to distinguish between land and [[Capital (economics)|capital]], many [[Catholic]] members who were discouraged by the excommunication of Father [[Edward McGlynn]], and many who disagreed with George's free trade policy. George had particular trouble with [[Terrence Powderly|Terrence V. Powderly]], president of the [[Knights of Labor]], a key member of the United Labor coalition. While initially friendly with Powderly, George vigorously opposed the tariff policies which Powderly and many other labor leaders thought vital to the protection of American workers. George's strident criticism of the tariff set him against Powderly and others in the labor movement.<ref>Robert E. Weir, \"A Fragile Alliance: Henry George and the Knights of Labor,\" ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 56, no. 4 (Oct. 1997), 423–426.</ref>\n\n===Death and funeral===\nGeorge's first stroke occurred in 1890, after a global speaking tour concerning land rights and the relationship between rent and poverty. This stroke greatly weakened him, and he never truly recovered. Despite this, George tried to remain active in politics. Against the advice of his doctors, George campaigned for New York City mayor again in 1897, this time as an Independent Democrat. The strain of the campaign precipitated a second stroke, leading to his death four days before the election.<ref>''Dictionary of American Biography,'' s.

George believed it would remove existing incentives toward land speculation and encourage development, as landlords would not suffer tax penalties for any industry or edifice constructed on their land and could not profit by holding valuable sites vacant.<ref>Backhaus, \"Henry George's Ingenious Tax,\" 453–458.</ref>\n\nBroadly applying this principle is now commonly known as '[[Georgism]]'.

Examples of these services included the transportation of utilities (water, electricity, sewage), information (telecommunications), goods, and travelers. George advocated that these systems of transport along \"public ways\" should usually be managed as [[public utilities]] and [[Free public transport|provided for free]] or at [[marginal cost]]. In some cases, it might be possible to allow competition between private service providers along public 'rights of way', such as parcel shipping companies that operate on public roads, but wherever competition would be impossible, George supported complete [[municipalization]]. George said that these services would be provided for free because investments in beneficial public goods always [[Henry George theorem|tend to increase land values by more than the total cost of those investments]]. George used the example of urban buildings that provide free vertical transit, paid out of some of the increased value that residents derive from the addition of elevators.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=K.

Therefore, George proposed to abolish or greatly limit intellectual property privilege. In George's view, owning a monopoly over specific arrangements and interactions of materials, governed by the forces of nature, allowed title-holders to extract royalty-rents from producers, in a way similar to owners of ordinary land titles. George later supported limited copyright, on the ground that temporary property over a unique arrangement of words or colors did not in any way prevent others from laboring to make other works of art. George apparently ranked patent rents as a less significant form of monopoly than the owners of land title deeds, partly because he viewed the owners of locations as \"the robber that takes all that is left\". People could choose not to buy a specific new product, but they cannot choose to lack a place upon which to stand, so benefits gained for labor through lesser reforms would tend to eventually be captured by owners and financers of location monopoly.\n\n===Free trade===\nGeorge was opposed to [[tariffs]], which were at the time both the major method of [[protectionist]] trade policy and an important source of federal revenue (the [[federal income tax]] having not yet been introduced). He believed that tariffs kept prices high for consumers, while failing to produce any increase in wages. He also thought that tariffs protected monopolistic companies from competition, thus augmenting their power.

He opposed the use of metallic currency (such as gold or silver) and fiat money created by private commercial banks.<ref>\"To illustrate: It is not the business of government to interfere with the views which any one may hold of the Creator or with the worship he may choose to pay him, so long as the exercise of these individual rights does not conflict with the equal liberty of others; and the result of governmental interference in this domain has been hypocrisy, corruption, persecution and religious war. It is not the business of government to direct the employment of labor and capital, and to foster certain industries at the expense of other industries; and the attempt to do so leads to all the waste, loss and corruption due to protective tariffs.\"\n\n\"On the other hand it is the business of government to issue money. This is perceived as soon as the great labor saving invention of money supplants barter. To leave it to every one who chose to do so to issue money would be to entail general inconvenience and loss, to offer many temptations to roguery, and to put the poorer classes of society at a great disadvantage. These obvious considerations have everywhere, as society became well organized, led to the recognition of the coinage of money as an exclusive function of government. When in the progress of society, a further labor-saving improvement becomes possible by the substitution of paper for the precious metals as the material for money, the reasons why the issuance of this money should be made a government function become still stronger. The evils entailed by wildcat banking in the United States are too well remembered to need reference. The loss and inconvenience, the swindling and corruption that flowed from the assumption by each State of the Union of the power to license banks of issue ended with the war, and no -one would now go back to them. Yet instead of doing what every public consideration impels us to, and assuming wholly and fully as the exclusive function of the General Government the power to issue money, the private interests of bankers have, up to this, compelled us to the use of a hybrid currency, of which a large part, though guaranteed by the General Government, is issued and made profitable to corporations. The legitimate business of banking – the safekeeping and loaning of money, and the making and exchange of credits, is properly left to individuals and associations; but by leaving to them, even in part and under restrictions and guarantees, the issuance of money, the people of the United States suffer an annual loss of millions of dollars, and sensibly increase the influences which exert a corrupting effect upon their government.\" ''The Complete Works of Henry George''. \"Social Problems\", p. 178, Doubleday Page & Co, New York, 1904</ref>\n\n===Citizen's dividend and universal pension===\nGeorge proposed to create a pension and disability system, and an unconditional [[basic income]] from surplus land rents. It would be distributed to residents \"as a right\" instead of as charity. Georgists often refer to this policy as a [[citizen's dividend]] in reference to a similar proposal by [[Thomas Paine]].\n\n===Bankruptcy protection and an abolition of debtors' prisons===\nGeorge noted that most debt, though bearing the appearance of genuine capital interest, was not issued for the purpose of creating true capital, but instead as an obligation against rental flows from existing economic privilege. George therefore reasoned that the state should not provide aid to creditors in the form of sheriffs, constables, courts, and prisons to enforce collection on these illegitimate obligations. George did not provide any data to support this view, but in today's developed economies, much of the supply of credit is created to purchase claims on future land rents, rather than to finance the creation of true capital. [[Michael Hudson (economist)]] and [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Adair Turner]] estimate that about 80 percent of credit finances real estate purchases, mostly land.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Adair|title=A new era for monetary policy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVQdeb0EdWA&feature=youtu.be&t=994|date=April 13, 2012|location=Berlin|publisher=INET|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Michael|title=Scenarios for Recovery: How to Write Down the Debts and Restructure the Financial System|url=http://nowandfutures.com/large/HowToWriteDownTheDebtsAndRestructureTheFinancialSystem-hudson-michael-berlin-paper.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nGeorge acknowledged that this policy would limit the banking system but believed that would actually be an economic boon, since the financial sector, in its existing form, was mostly augmenting rent extraction, as opposed to productive investment. \"The curse of credit,\" George wrote, was \". . . that it expands when there is a tendency to speculation, and sharply contracts just when most needed to assure confidence and prevent industrial waste.\" George even said that a [[debt jubilee]] could remove the accumulation of burdensome obligations without reducing aggregate wealth.<ref>{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Henry|title=Consequences of a Growing National Debt|url=http://www.cooperative-individualism.org/george-henry_consequences-of-a-growing-national-debt-1888.htm|accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Other proposals===\nHenry George also proposed the following reforms:\n* to dramatically reduce the size of the military,\n* to replace contract patronage with the direct employment of government workers, with civil-service protections,\n* to build and maintain free mass transportation and libraries,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brechin|first1=Gray|title=Indestructable By Reason of Beauty: The Beaumanance of a Public Library Building|date=2003|publisher=Greenwood Press|url=http://graybrechin.net/_docs/books/Indestructible-by-Reason-of-Beauty-Gray-Brechin.pdf|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\n* to extend suffrage to women,<ref>{{cite news|last1=George|first1=Henry|title=Henry George on Woman Suffrage.|url=http://sos.ri.gov/virtualarchives/items/show/315|accessdate=14 December 2014|agency=Providence Evening Telegram|date=March 17, 1887}}</ref> and even to have one house of Congress entirely male and the other entirely female,\n* to implement campaign finance reform and political spending restrictions.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|Georgism}}\n\nHenry George's ideas on economics, now known as [[Georgism]], had enormous influence in his time. However, his influence slowly waned throughout the 20th century.  Nonetheless, it would be difficult to overstate George's impact on turn-of-the-century reform movements and intellectual culture.  George's self-published ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' was the first popular economics text and one of the most widely printed books ever written.  The book's explosive world-wide popularity is often marked as the beginning of the [[Progressive Era]] and various political parties, clubs, and charitable organizations around the world were founded on George's ideas. George's message attracts support widely across the [[political spectrum]], including labor union activists, socialists, anarchists, libertarians, reformers, conservatives, and wealthy investors. As a result, Henry George is still claimed as a primary intellectual influence by both [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]] and [[socialists]].

In Denmark, the [[Justice Party of Denmark|Danmarks Retsforbund]] (known in English as the Justice Party or Single-Tax Party) was founded in 1919. The party's platform is based upon the land tax principles of Henry George. The party was elected to parliament for the first time in 1926, and they were moderately successful in the post-war period and managed to join a governing coalition with the Social Democrats and the Social Liberal Party from the years 1957–60, with diminishing success afterwards.\n\nNon-political means have also been attempted to further the cause. A number of \"Single Tax Colonies\" were started, such as [[Arden, Delaware]] and [[Fairhope, Alabama]].  In 1904, [[Lizzie Magie]] created a board game called [[The Landlord's Game]] to demonstrate George's theories. This was later turned into the popular board game [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]].

And he showed that there is no inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained a clear distinction between classical factors of production, capital and land.\n\nGeorge developed what he saw as a crucial feature of his own theory of economics in a critique of an illustration used by [[Frédéric Bastiat]] in order to explain the nature of [[interest]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]]. Bastiat had asked his readers to consider James and William, both carpenters. James has built himself a plane, and has lent it to William for a year. Would James be satisfied with the return of an equally good plane a year later? Surely not! He'd expect a board along with it, as interest. The basic idea of a theory of interest is to understand why. Bastiat said that James had given William over that year \"the power, inherent in the instrument, to increase the productivity of his labor,\" and wants compensation for that increased productivity.<ref>Frédéric Bastiat, [http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html ''That Which is Seen, and That Which is Not Seen,\"] 1850.</ref>\n\nGeorge did not accept this explanation. He wrote, \"I am inclined to think that if all wealth consisted of such things as planes, and all production was such as that of carpenters – that is to say, if wealth consisted but of the inert matter of the universe, and production of working up this inert matter into different shapes – that interest would be but the robbery of industry, and could not long exist.\"<ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjcqAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=progress+and+poverty+1886&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T5_7TviMH5SEtgeD4YjQBg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false, ''Progress and Poverty,''], 161.</ref> But some wealth is inherently fruitful, like a pair of breeding cattle, or a vat of grape juice soon to ferment into wine. Planes and other sorts of inert matter (and the most lent item of all – money itself) earn interest indirectly, by being part of the same \"circle of exchange\" with fruitful forms of wealth such as those, so that tying up these forms of wealth over time incurs an [[opportunity cost]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nGeorge's theory had its share of critiques. [[Austrian school]] economist [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], for example, expressed a negative judgment of George's discussion of the carpenter's plane. In his treatise, ''Capital and Interest'', he wrote:\n\n{{quote|(T)he separation of production into two groups, in one of which the vital forces of nature form a distinct element in addition to labour, while in the other they do not, is entirely untenable[...] The natural sciences have long ago told us that the cooperation of nature is universal. [...] The muscular movement of the man who planes would be of very little use, if the natural powers and properties of the steel edge of the plane did not come to his assistance.<ref>Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KmUPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Eugen+von+B%C3%B6hm-Bawerk+capital+and+interest&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2LP7Tv6kIsyEtgeD6NjECA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Capital and Interest: A Critical History of Economic Theory''] transl. William Smart (London: Macmillan and Co., 1890), 417.</ref>}}\n\nLater, George argued that the role of time in production is pervasive.  In ''The Science of Political Economy'', he writes:\n\n{{quote|[I]f I go to a builder and say to him, \"In what time and at what price will you build me such and such a house?\" he would, after thinking, name a time, and a price based on it. This specification of time would be essential.... This I would soon find if, not quarreling with the price, I ask him largely to lessen the time.... I might get the builder somewhat to lessen the time... ; but only by greatly increasing the price, until finally a point would be reached where he would not consent to build the house in less time no matter at what price. He would say [that the house just could not be built any faster]....\n\nThe importance ... of this principle – that all production of wealth requires time as well as labor – we shall see later on; but the principle that time is a necessary element in all production we must take into account from the very first.<ref>Henry George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TgJLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+science+of+political+economy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GbX7TtzfA4y5twfq64TQDQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=if%20i%20go%20to%20a%20builder&f=false ''The Science of Political Economy''] (New York: Doubleday & McClure Co., 1898), 369–370.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Oscar B.
