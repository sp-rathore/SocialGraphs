Schmitt wrote extensively about the effective wielding of political power. His work has been a major influence on subsequent political theory, legal theory, continental philosophy and political theology.\n\nSchmitt's work has attracted the attention of numerous philosophers and political theorists, including [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Friedrich Hayek]],<ref>William E.

He studied [[law]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]], [[University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and took his graduation and state examinations in then-German Strasbourg during 1915.<ref name=\"conscience56\">[[Claudia Koonz]], ''The Nazi Conscience'', 2003, p. 56 ISBN 0-674-01172-4</ref> His 1915 doctoral thesis was titled ''Über Schuld und Schuldarten'' (''On Guilt and Types of Guilt'').\n\nHe volunteered for the army during 1916.<ref name=\"conscience56\" /> The same year, he earned his [[habilitation]] at Strasbourg with a thesis under the title ''Der Wert des Staates und die Bedeutung des Einzelnen'' (''The Value of the State and the Significance of the Individual''). He then taught at various business schools and universities, namely at the [[University of Greifswald]] (1921), the [[University of Bonn]] (1921), the [[Technische Universität München]] (1928), the [[University of Cologne]] (1933), and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] (1933–1945).\n\nDuring 1916, Schmitt married his first wife, Pavla (in Germany, usually rendered as \"Pawla\" even though the letter \"w\" is used in the Serbian auxiliary Latin alphabet only for foreign words) Dorotić,<ref name=\"conscience57\">Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 57 ISBN 0-674-01172-4</ref> a Serbian woman who pretended to be a countess. They were divorced, though an appeal to the [[Catholic Church]] for an annulment was rejected. During 1926 he married his second wife, Duška Todorović (1903–1950), also Serbian; they had one daughter, named Anima. Subsequently, Schmitt was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] because his first marriage had not been annulled by the Church.<ref name=\"conscience57\" /> His daughter Anima Schmitt de Otero (1931–1983) was married, from 1957, to [[Alfonso Otero Valera]] (1925–2001), a Spanish law professor at the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] and a member of the ruling Spanish [[Falange]] party under the Franco régime. She translated several works by her father into Spanish. Letters from Carl Schmitt to his son-in-law have also been published.\n\n==Beliefs ==\nAs a young man, Schmitt was \"a devoted Catholic until his break with the church in the mid twenties.\"<ref>McCormick, John P.

Papen was motivated to do so because Prussia, by far the largest state in [[Germany]], served as a powerful base for the political left and provided it with institutional power, particularly in the form of the Prussian police.

For Schmitt… the very essence of the bureaucratic conduct of business is reverence for the norm, a standpoint that could not but exist in great tension with the doctrines of Carl Schmitt.... Hegel had set an ignominious precedent by according this putative universal class a position of preeminence in his political thought, insofar as the primacy of the bureaucracy tends to diminish or supplant the prerogative of sovereign authority.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wolin |first=Richard |year=1992 |title=Carl Schmitt: The Conservative Revolutionary Habitus and the Aesthetics of Horror |journal=[[Political Theory (journal)|Political Theory]] |issue=3 |pages=424–5}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSchmitt joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 May 1933.<ref>Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 58 ISBN 0-674-01172-4</ref> Within days, Schmitt was party to the burning of books by Jewish authors, rejoicing in the burning of \"un-German\" and \"anti-German\" material, and calling for a much more extensive purge, to include works by authors influenced by Jewish ideas.<ref>Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 59 ISBN 0-674-01172-4</ref> In July he was appointed State Councillor for Prussia (''Preußischer Staatsrat'') by [[Hermann Göring]] and in November he became the president of the ''Vereinigung nationalsozialistischer Juristen'' (\"Union of National-Socialist Jurists\"). He also replaced Hermann Heller as professor at the [[University of Berlin]],<ref>Balakrishnan (2000), p 183-4</ref> a position he would hold until the end of [[World War II]]. He presented his theories as an ideological foundation of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] dictatorship, and a justification of the ''[[Führer]]'' state with regard to legal philosophy, particularly through the concept of ''[[auctoritas]]''.\n\n[[File:Wohnhaus 1971-1985.jpeg|left|thumb|\"San Casciano\", home of Carl Schmitt in Plettenberg-Pasel from 1971 until 1985.]]\n\nSix months later, in June 1934, Schmitt was appointed editor-in-chief of the Nazi newspaper for lawyers, the ''Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung'' (\"German Jurists' Journal\").<ref name=\"facsimile\">http://www.flechsig.biz/DJZ34_CS.pdf german original as pdf</ref> In July he published in it \"The Leader Protects the Law (''Der Führer schützt das Recht'')\", a justification of the political murders of the [[Night of the Long Knives]] with the authority of Hitler as the \"highest form of administrative justice (''höchste Form administrativer Justiz'')\".<ref name=\"DJR\">Deutsche Juristen-Zeitung, 38, 1934; trans. as \"The Führer Protects Justice\" in Detlev Vagts, ''Carl Schmitt's Ultimate Emergency: The Night of the Long Knives'' (2012) 87(2) ''The Germanic Review'' 203.</ref> Schmitt presented himself as a radical [[anti-semitism|anti-semite]] and also was the chairman of a law teachers' convention in [[Berlin]] during October 1936,<ref>Claudia Koonz, ''The Nazi Conscience'', p. 207 ISBN 0-674-01172-4</ref> where he demanded that German law be cleansed of the \"Jewish spirit (''jüdischem Geist'')\", going so far as to demand that all publications by Jewish scientists should henceforth be marked with a small symbol.\n\n[[File:Grabstein Carl Schmitts.jpeg|right|thumb|Tombstone of Carl Schmitt, catholic cemetery, Plettenberg-Eiringhausen.]]\n\nNevertheless, in December 1936, the [[SS]] publication ''[[Das schwarze Korps]]'' accused Schmitt of being an opportunist, a Hegelian state thinker, and basically a Catholic, and called his anti-semitism a mere pretense, citing earlier statements in which he criticized the Nazis' racial theories. After this, Schmitt resigned from his position as \"Reichsfachgruppenleiter\" (''Reich Professional Group Leader''), although he retained his job as a professor in Berlin and his title \"''Preußischer Staatsrat''\". Although Schmitt continued to be investigated into 1937, further reprisals were stopped by Göring.<ref name=\"Bendersky\">Bendersky, Joseph, W., ''Theorist For The Reich'', 1983, Princeton, New Jersey</ref><ref name=\"Noack\">Noack, Paul, Carl Schmitt – Eine Biographie, 1996, Frankfurt</ref>\n\n==Post–World War II==\nIn 1945, Schmitt was captured by American forces and, after spending more than a year in an internment camp, he returned to his home town of [[Plettenberg]] and later to the house of his housekeeper Anni Stand in Plettenberg-Pasel. Schmitt refused every attempt at [[de-nazification]], which effectively barred him from academic jobs. Despite being isolated from the mainstream of the scholarly and political community, he continued his studies especially of [[international law]] from the 1950s on, and he frequently received visitors, both colleagues and younger intellectuals, until well into his old age. Important among these visitors were [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Jacob Taubes]] and [[Alexandre Kojève]].\n\nIn 1962, Schmitt gave lectures in [[Francoist Spain]], two of which resulted in the publication, the next year, of ''Theory of the Partisan'' (Telos Press, 2007), in which he characterized the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a \"war of national liberation\" against \"international Communism.\" Schmitt regarded the [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] as a specific and significant phenomenon; during the latter half of the 20th century, indicated the emergence of a new theory of warfare.\n\nSchmitt died on 7 April 1985 and is buried in [[Plettenberg]].\n\n==Work==\n\n===''On Dictatorship''===\nDuring 1921, Schmitt became a professor at the [[University of Greifswald]], where he published his essay ''Die Diktatur'' (on [[dictatorship]]), in which he discussed the foundations of the newly established [[Weimar Republic]], emphasising the office of the ''[[Reichspräsident]]''. In this essay, Schmitt compared and contrasted what he saw as the effective and ineffective elements of the new constitution of his country. To him, the office of the president could be characterized as a comparatively effective element within the new constitution, because of the power granted to the president to declare a [[state of emergency]]. This power, which Schmitt discussed and implicitly praised as dictatorial,<ref name=\"DJR\" /> was seen as more in line with the underlying mentality of political power than the comparatively slow and ineffective processes of legislative political power reached through parliamentary [[discussion]] and [[compromise]].\n\nSchmitt was at pains to remove what he saw as a taboo surrounding the concept of \"dictatorship\" and to show that, in his opinion, the concept is implicit whenever power is wielded by means other than the slow processes of parliamentary politics and the bureaucracy:\n\n::\"If the constitution of a state is democratic, then every exceptional negation of democratic principles, every exercise of state power independent of the approval of the majority, can be called dictatorship.\"<ref>[http://www.hjlenger.de/reader/schmitt%20theologie%20diktatur%20leviathan.pdf ''Die Diktatur''] &sect; XV p. 11.</ref>\n\nFor Schmitt, every government capable of decisive action must include a dictatorial element within its constitution. Although the German concept of ''Ausnahmezustand'' is best translated as \"state of emergency\", it literally means state of exception which, according to Schmitt, frees the executive from any legal restraints to its power that would normally apply. The use of the term \"exceptional\" has to be underlined here: Schmitt defines [[sovereignty]] as the power to ''decide'' the instauration of [[state of emergency|state of exception]], as [[Giorgio Agamben]] has noted. According to Agamben,<ref>''State of Exception'' (2005), pp. 52–55.</ref> Schmitt's conceptualization of the \"state of exception\" as belonging to the core-concept of sovereignty was a response to [[Walter Benjamin]]'s concept of a \"pure\" or \"revolutionary\" violence, which did not enter into any relationship whatsoever with right. Through the state of exception, Schmitt included all types of violence under right, in the case of the authority of Hitler leading to the formulation \"The leader defends the law\" (\"''Der Führer schützt das Recht''\").<ref name=\"DJR\" />\n\nSchmitt opposed what he termed \"commissarial dictatorship\", or the declaration of a state of emergency in order to save the legal order (a temporary suspension of law, defined itself by moral or legal right): the state of emergency is limited (even if ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'', by law) to \"sovereign dictatorship\", in which law was suspended, as in the classical state of exception, not to \"save the [[Constitution]]\", but rather to create another Constitution. This is how he theorized [[Hitler]]'s continual suspension of the legal constitutional order during the [[Third Reich]] (the [[Weimar Republic]]'s Constitution was never abrogated, emphasized Giorgio Agamben;<ref>Agamben, ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life,'' p. 168. On the February 28, 1933 decree of the ''Ausnahmezustand'' (state of exception), Agamben notes that this very term was conspicuously absent: \"The decree remained de facto in force until the end of the Third Reich... The state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself.\"</ref> rather, it was \"suspended\" for four years, first with the 28 February 1933 [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], with the suspension renewed every four years, implying a continual state of emergency).\n\nThe reason why Schmitt has been taken so seriously by political theory, is to the theorisation of the crisis and state of emergency not as exceptional moments in political life, opposed to some stable normality, but as themselves the predominant form of the life of modern nations.\n\n===''Political Theology''===\n''On Dictatorship'' was followed by another essay in 1922, titled \"''Politische Theologie''\" ([[political theology]]); in it, Schmitt, who at the time was working as a professor at the [[University of Bonn]], gave further substance to his authoritarian theories, analysing the concept of \"free will\" influenced by Christian-Catholic thinkers. The book begins with Schmitt's famous, or notorious, definition: \"Sovereign is he who decides on the exception.\" By \"exception,\" Schmitt means the appropriate moment for stepping outside the [[rule of law]] in the public interest. (See discussion of ''On Dictatorship'' above.) Schmitt proposes this definition to those offered by contemporary theorists of sovereignty, particularly [[Hans Kelsen]], whose work is criticized at several points in the essay.\n\nThe book's title derives from Schmitt's assertion (in chapter 3) that \"all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts\" —in other words, that [[political theory]] addresses the state (and sovereignty) in much the same manner as [[theology]] does God.\n\nA year later, Schmitt supported the emergence of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] power structures in his paper \"''Die geistesgeschichtliche Lage des heutigen Parlamentarismus''\" (roughly: \"The Intellectual-Historical Situation of Today's [[Parliamentarianism]]\", translated as ''[[Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy|The Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy]]'' by Ellen Kennedy). Schmitt criticized the institutional practices of liberal politics, arguing that they are justified by a faith in rational discussion and openness that is at odds with actual parliamentary [[party politics]], in which outcomes are hammered out in [[smoke-filled room]]s by party leaders. Schmitt also posits an essential division between the liberal doctrine of [[separation of powers]] and what he holds to be the nature of [[democracy]] itself, the identity of the rulers and the ruled. Although many critics of Schmitt today, such as [[Stephen Holmes (academic)|Stephen Holmes]] in his ''The Anatomy of Anti-Liberalism'', take exception to his fundamentally [[authoritarian]] outlook, the idea of incompatibility between liberalism and democracy is one reason for the continued interest in his [[political philosophy]].<ref>William E. Scheuerman, \"Survey Article: Emergency Powers and the Rule of Law after 9/11\", ''The Journal of Political Philosophy'', Volume 14, No. 1, 2006, pp. 61–84.</ref>\n\n===''The Concept of the Political''===\nSchmitt changed universities in 1926, when he became professor of law at the Handelshochschule in [[Berlin]], and again in 1932, when he accepted a position in [[University of Cologne|Cologne]]. It was from lectures at the [[Deutsche Hochschule für Politik]] in Berlin that he wrote his most famous paper, \"''Der Begriff des Politischen''\" (\"[[The Concept of the Political]]\"), in which he developed his theory of \"the political\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Gottfried |first=Paul |title=Carl Schmitt |year=1990 |publisher=Claridge Press |isbn=1-870626-46-X |page=20}}</ref> Distinct from party politics, \"the political\" is the essence of politics. While churches are predominant in religion or society is predominant in economics, the state is predominant in politics. Yet for Schmitt the political was not an autonomous domain equivalent to the other domains, but rather the existential basis that would determine any other domain should it reach the point of politics (e.g. religion ceases to be merely theological when it makes a clear distinction between the \"friend\" and the \"enemy\"). The political is not equal to any other domain, such as the economic, but instead is the most essential to identity.\n\nSchmitt, in perhaps his best-known formulation, bases his conceptual realm of state sovereignty and autonomy upon the distinction between ''friend'' and ''enemy''. This distinction is to be determined \"existentially,\" which is to say that the enemy is whoever is \"in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible.\" (Schmitt, 1996, p.&nbsp;27) Such an enemy need not even be based on nationality: so long as the conflict is potentially intense enough to become a violent one between political entities, the actual substance of enmity may be anything.\n\nAlthough there have been divergent interpretations concerning this work, there is broad agreement that ''\"The Concept of the Political\"'' is an attempt to achieve state unity by defining the content of politics as opposition to the \"other\" (that is to say, an enemy, a stranger. This applies to any person or entity that represents a serious threat or conflict to one's own interests.) Additionally, the prominence of the state stands as a neutral force dominating potentially fractious civil society, whose various antagonisms must not be allowed to affect politics, lest civil war result.\n\n====Dialogue with Leo Strauss====\nSchmitt's positive reference for [[Leo Strauss]], and Schmitt's approval of his work, had been instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 123</ref> In turn, Strauss's critique and clarifications of ''The Concept of the Political'' led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt during 1932, Strauss summarised Schmitt's political theology thus: \"[B]ecause man is by nature evil, he therefore needs ''dominion''. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against – against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men... the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state.\"<ref>''Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: the hidden dialogue'', Heinrich Meier, University of Chicago Press 1995, 125</ref> Some of the letters between Schmitt and Strauss have been published.\n\n===''Nomos of the Earth''===\n''The Nomos of the Earth'' is Schmitt's most historical and geopolitical work. Published in 1950, it was also one of his final texts. It describes the origin of the Eurocentric global order, which Schmitt dates from the discovery of the New World, discusses its specific character and its contribution to civilisation, analyses the reasons for its decline at the end of the 19th century, and concludes with prospects for a new world order. It defends European achievements, not only in creating the first truly global order of international law, but also in limiting war to conflicts among sovereign states, which, in effect, civilised war. In Schmitt's view, the European sovereign state was the greatest achievement of [[Europe|Occidental]] rationalism; in becoming the principal agency of secularisation, the European state created the modern age.\n\nNotable in Schmitt's discussion of the European epoch of world history is the role played by the New World, which ultimately replaced the old world as the centre of the Earth and became the arbiter in European and world politics. According to Schmitt, the United States' internal conflicts between economic presence and political absence, between isolationism and interventionism, are global problems, which today continue to hamper the creation of a new world order. But however critical Schmitt is of American actions at the end of the 19th century and after World War I, he considered the United States to be the only political entity capable of resolving the crisis of global order.\n\n===''Hamlet or Hecuba''===\nPublished in 1956, ''Hamlet or Hecuba: The Intrusion of the Time into the Play'' was Schmitt's most extended piece of literary criticism. In it Schmitt focuses his attention on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''Hamlet'' and argues that the significance of the work hinges on its ability to integrate history in the form of the taboo of the queen and the deformation of the figure of the avenger. Schmitt uses this interpretation to develop a theory of myth and politics that serves as a cultural foundation for his concept of political representation. Beyond literary criticism or historical analysis, Schmitt's book also reveals a comprehensive theory of the relationship between aesthetics and politics that responds to alternative ideas developed by [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]].\n\n===''Theory of the Partisan''===\nSchmitt's ''Theory of the Partisan'' originated in two lectures delivered during 1962,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmitt |first=Carl |year=2004 |month= |title=Theory of the Partisan: Intermediate Commentary on the Concept of the Political (1963) |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=127 |pages=11}}</ref> and has been seen as a rethinking of ''The Concept of the Political''.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Michael|last1=Hoelzl |first2=Graham|last2=Ward |title=Editors' introduction to Political Theology II |publisher=Polity |year=2008|page=4|isbn=978-0-7456-4254-3}}</ref> It addressed the transformation of war in the post-European age, analysing a specific and significant phenomenon that ushered in a new theory of war and enmity. It contains an implicit theory of the terrorist, which during the 21st century has resulted in yet another new theory of war and enmity. In the lectures, Schmitt directly tackles the issues surrounding \"the problem of the Partisan\" figure: the guerrilla or revolutionary who \"fights irregularly\" (pg. 3).<ref>http://www.telospress.com/main/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=318</ref> Both because of its scope, with extended discussions on historical figures like [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Mao Zedong]], as well as the events marking the beginning of the 20th century, Schmitt's text has had a resurgence of popularity. [[Jacques Derrida]], in his ''Politics of Friendship'' remarked:\n<blockquote>\nDespite certain signs of ironic distrust in the areas of metaphysics and ontology, ''The Concept of the Political'' was, as we have seen, a philosophical type of essay to 'frame' the topic of a concept unable to constitute itself on philosophical ground. But in ''Theory of the Partisan'', it is in the same areas that the topic of this concept is both radicalised and properly uprooted, where Schmitt wished to regrasp in history the event or node of events that engaged this uprooting radicalisation, and it is precisely there that the philosophical as such intervenes again.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jacques|last=Derrida |title=The Politics of Friendship |publisher=Verso |year=1997|page=146|isbn=1-84467-054-6}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSchmitt concludes ''Theory of the Partisan'' with the statement: \"The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new ''nomos'' of the earth.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmitt |first=Carl |year=2004 |month= |title=Theory of the Partisan: Intermediate Commentary on the Concept of the Political (1963) |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=127 |pages=78}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}\nThrough [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Chantal Mouffe]] and other writers, Carl Schmitt has become a common reference in recent writings of the intellectual left as well as the right.<ref>See for example Lebovic, Nitzan (2008), \"The Jerusalem School: The Theo-Political Hour,\" ''New German Critique'' (103), 97–120.</ref> This debate concerns not only the interpretation of Schmitt's own positions, but also matters relevant to contemporary politics: the idea that laws of the state cannot strictly limit actions of its [[sovereignty|sovereign]], the problem of a \"[[state of exception]]\" (later expanded upon by Agamben).<ref>[http://fr.slideshare.net/AmineBenabdallah1/la-rception-de-carl-schmitt-par-giorgio-agamben-a-benabdallah]</ref>\n\nSchmitt's influence has also recently been seen as consequential for those interested in contemporary [[political theology]], which is much influenced by Schmitt's argument that political concepts are ''secularised theological concepts''. The German-Jewish philosopher [[Jacob Taubes]], for example, engaged Schmitt widely in his study of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], ''The Political Theology of Paul'' (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004).
