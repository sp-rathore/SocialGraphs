In his [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts]], he is referred to as ''{{IAST|Devānāmpriya}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Devānaṃpiya}}'' or \"The Beloved of the Gods\"), and ''{{IAST|Priyadarśin}}'' (Pali ''{{IAST|Piyadasī}}'' or \"He who regards everyone with affection\"). His fondness for his name's connection to the ''[[Saraca asoca]]'' tree, or the \"Ashoka tree\" is also referenced in the [[Ashokavadana]].\n\n[[H.G. Wells]] wrote of Ashoka in his book ''[[The Outline of History]]'': \"Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.\" Along with the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], his legend is related in the 2nd-century CE ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (\"''Narrative of Ashoka''\", a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''), and in the Sri Lankan text ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' (\"''Great Chronicle''\"). The emblem of the modern [[Republic of India]] is an adaptation of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Ashoka's early life===\nAshoka was born to the [[Mauryan]] emperor, [[Bindusara]] and a relatively lower ranked wife of his, [[Shubhadrangi|Dharmā]] (or Dhammā). He was the grandson of [[Chandragupta Maurya]], founder of the Mauryan dynasty. The [[Avadana]] texts mention that his mother was queen [[Shubhadrangi|Subhadrangī]]. According to the [[Ashokavadana]], she was the daughter of a Brahmin from the city of Champa.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=332}}<ref name=\"John1989\"/>{{rp|205}} Though a palace intrigue kept her away from the emperor, this eventually ended, and she bore a son. It is from her exclamation \"I am now without sorrow\", that Ashoka got his name. The [[Divyavadana|''Divyāvadāna'']] tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyānī.<ref>{{cite book | title = A text book of the history of Theravāda Buddhism | author = K.

His fighting qualities were apparent from an early age and he was given royal military training. He was known as a fearsome hunter, and according to a legend, killed a lion with just a wooden rod. Because of his reputation as a frightening warrior and a heartless general, he was sent to curb the riots in the [[Avanti (India)|Avanti]] province of the Mauryan empire.<ref>{{citation |title=Prachin bharoter itihas |first=Sunil |last=Chatterjee }}</ref>{{sfn|Ayyar|1987|p=25}}\n\n===Rise to power===\n[[File:Maurya Empire, c.250 BCE 2.png|thumb|right|Approximate extent of [[Maurya Empire|Maurya empire]] under Ashoka. The empire stretched from [[Afghanistan]] to [[Bengal]] to southern [[India]]]]\nThe Buddhist text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in [[Bindusara]]'s times. [[Taranatha]]'s account states that [[Chanakya]], Bindusara's chief advisor, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt. Following this, Ashoka was stationed at Ujjayini as governor.{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=332}}\n\nBindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession.

The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The ''[[Dipavansa]]'' and ''[[Mahavansa]]'' refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named [[Vitashoka]] or Tissa,{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2008|p=331}} although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements).

Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]]. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened  eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.<ref>prachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay</ref> When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest, rejoicing in his victory, he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Buddhist conversion===\n[[File:AshokStambhaThailand.jpg|thumb|left|A similar four \"[[Indian lion]]\" [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] atop an intact [[Ashoka Pillar]] at Wat U Mong near Chiang Mai, Thailand showing another larger  [[Dharma Chakra]] / [[Ashoka Chakra]] atop the four lions.]]\nEdict 13 on the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] Rock Inscriptions reflect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:\n\nHis Majesty felt remorse on account of the conquest of Kalinga because, during the subjugation of a previously unconquered country, slaughter, death, and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur, whereas His Majesty feels profound sorrow and regret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from Ashoka's understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too.<ref>{{cite book | last=Smith | first=Vincent A. | authorlink=Vincent Arthur Smith | title=[[s:Rulers of India/Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India|Asoka - the Buddhist Emperor of India]] | series=[[Rulers of India series]] | publisher=Oxford at the Clarendon Press | year=1901 | page=130}}</ref>\n\nLegend says that one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent [[Indology|Indologist]], [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|A. L. Basham]], Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all.<ref>{{cite book |last=Basham |first=A.

Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time.

It is said that she had got Ashoka's son [[Kunala]], the regent in [[Taxila|Takshashila]] and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily stratagem. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife [[Kanchanmala]]. In [[Pataliputra]], Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness.<ref name=\"Pradip2002\"/> Kunala was succeeded by his son, [[Samprati]], who ruled for 50 years until his death.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, had he not left behind records of his reign. These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name.

Pushyamitra Shunga founded the [[Shunga dynasty]] (185-75 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nKing Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guiding souls: dialogues on the purpose of life|page=47|publisher=Ocean Books|author=Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, Arun Tiwari}}</ref>\n\n====Buddhist kingship====\n{{Main article|History of Buddhism|History of Buddhism in India}} {{Further|Buddhism in Nepal|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism in Burma}}\nOne of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka Maurya was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nAccording to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Nirgrantha Jnatiputra]] (identified with [[Mahavira]], 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]]). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.<ref name=\"John1989\">{{cite book | author=John S. Strong | authorlink = John S.

In particular, the [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two [[Pāli]] chronicles of Sri Lanka (the [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]]) provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts (''Priyadarshi''—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya.

The legend was translated into Chinese by [[Fa Hien]] in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the [[laity]] (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion.

As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the Mahavamsa is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[Dipavamsa|Dwipavamsa]] -The Dwipavamsa, or \"Dweepavamsa\", (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from [[Atthakatha]] and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE. King Dhatusena (4th century) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahinda]] festival held annually in Anuradhapura.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Perceptions==\nThe use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nHowever, the edicts alone strongly indicate that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an \"[[upasaka]]\", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|\"dhamma\"]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. Finally, he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.<ref>Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.</ref>\n\nInterestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by a specific event. It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. ''This'' Ashoka is very different from the \"shadowy do-gooder\" of later Pali chronicles.<ref name=\"Pradip2002\"/>\n\nMuch of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|several inscriptions]] that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his \"children\" and mentions that as a father he desires their good.<ref name=\"VenSDhammika_1993\"/> These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to [[dharma]] (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some actual events ever happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Focus of debate===\nRecently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism, and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as ''dhamma'' or [[dharma]], which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2013}} have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the \"military backbone\" of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been \"grossly exaggerated\". The ''dhamma'' of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a \"sort of universal religion\", or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a \"virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Upinder Singh |title=Governing the State and the Self: Political Philosophy and Practice in the Edicts of As´oka | journal=South Asian Studies | issue=28.2 | year=2012 | publisher=Routledge | pages=131–132}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions==\n\n===Approach towards religions===\nAccording to Indian historian Romila Thapar, Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers, harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees.<ref>Microsoft Encarta Article on Ashoka</ref> Ashoka's religion contained gleanings from all religions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} He emphasized on the virtues of ''Ahimsa'', respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and on rational faith.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Global spread of Buddhism===\n[[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|left|Stupa of [[Sanchi]].]]\nAs a [[Buddhist]] emperor, Ashoka believed that [[Buddhism]] is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of [[stupas]], [[Sangharama]], [[viharas]], [[chaitya]], and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddhas relics.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strong |first=John |date=2007 |title=Relics of the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&pg=PA136 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |pages=136–137 |isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}</ref> In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strong |first=John |date=2007 |title=Relics of the Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqAB6PKyP98C&pg=PA145 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |page=145 |isbn=978-81-208-3139-1}}</ref> He gave donations to viharas and [[matha]]s. He sent his only daughter [[Sanghamitra]] and son [[Mahinda (buddhist monk)|Mahindra]] to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni). Ashoka also sent many prominent Buddhist monks (bhikshus) Sthaviras like Madhyamik Sthavira to modern [[Kashmir]] and Afghanistan; Maharaskshit Sthavira to Syria, [[Persia]] / Iran, Egypt, Greece, Italy and Turkey; Massim Sthavira to Nepal, Bhutan, China and Mongolia; Sohn Uttar Sthavira to modern Cambodia, Laos, Burma (old name Suvarnabhumi for Burma and Thailand), Thailand and Vietnam; Mahadhhamarakhhita stahvira to [[Maharashtra]] (old name Maharatthha); Maharakhhit Sthavira and Yavandhammarakhhita Sthavira to [[South India]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAshoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Taxila]]. Ashoka helped to construct  [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.<ref>N.V. Isaeva, ''Shankara and Indian philosophy''. SUNY Press, 1993, page 24.</ref> Ashoka helped and respected both Shramanas (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organise the [[Third Buddhist council]] ({{circa|250 BCE}}) at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna]]). It was conducted by the monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] who was the spiritual teacher of Ashoka.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIt is well known that Ashoka sent ''dütas'' or emissaries to convey messages or letters, written or oral (rather both), to various people. The VIth Rock Edict about \"oral orders\" reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his ''dhammavijaya,'' which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the [[Kharosthi]] script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as [[Achaemenid]] influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.<ref name=\"Hinuber2012\">{{cite journal | author=Oskar von Hinüber |title=Did Hellenistic Kings Send Letters to Aśoka? | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | issue=130.2 | year=2010 | publisher=Freiburg | pages=262–265}}</ref>\n\nIn his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic countries]] as converts to Buddhism, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remains:\n\n{{quote|Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest.

Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi.
