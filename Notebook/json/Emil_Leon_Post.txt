He is best known for his work in the field that eventually became known as [[computability theory]].\n\n==Life==\nPost was born in [[Augustów]], [[Suwałki Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Poland]]) into a [[Polish Jews|Polish-Jewish]] family that immigrated to [[New York City]] in May 1904. His parents were Arnold and Pearl Post.<ref name=\"MacTutor\">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Post}}</ref>\n\nPost had been interested in astronomy, but at age twelve lost his left arm in a car accident, which was a significant obstacle to being a professional astronomer. He decided to pursue mathematics, rather than astronomy.<ref>Urquhart (2008), p. 429.</ref>\n\nPost attended the [[Townsend Harris High School]] and continued on to graduate from [[City College of New York]] in 1917 with a B.S. in Mathematics.<ref name=\"Urquhart\"/>\n\nAfter completing his [[Doctor of philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics at [[Columbia University]], supervised by [[Cassius Jackson Keyser]], he did a post-doctorate at [[Princeton University]] in the 1920-1921 academic year. Post then became a high school mathematics teacher in New York City.\n\nPost married Gertrude Singer in 1929, with whom he had a daughter, Phyllis Goodman. Post spent at most three hours a day on research at the advice of his doctor in order to avoid manic attacks, which he had been experiencing since his year at Princeton.<ref>Urquhart (2008), p. 430.</ref>\n\nIn 1936, he was appointed to the mathematics department at the City College of New York. He died in 1954 of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] following [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock treatment]] for [[Depression (mood)|depression]];<ref>{{cite book |editor=Baaz, Matthias |year=2011 |title=Kurt Gödel and the Foundations of Mathematics: Horizons of Truth |edition=1st |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139498432}}</ref><ref>Urquhart (2008), p. 430.</ref> he was 57.\n\n==Early work==\nIn his doctoral thesis, later shortened and published as \"Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions\" (1921), Post proved, among other things, that the propositional calculus of ''Principia Mathematica'' was complete: all [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]] are [[theorem]]s, given the ''Principia'' axioms and the rules of substitution and [[modus ponens]]. Post also devised [[Truth Table|truth tables]] independently of [[Wittgenstein]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] and put them to good mathematical use.  [[Jean Van Heijenoort]]'s well-known source book on mathematical logic (1966) reprinted Post's classic article setting out these results.\n\nWhile at Princeton, Post came very close to discovering the incompleteness of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which [[Kurt Gödel]] proved in 1931. He initially failed to publish his ideas as he believed he needed a 'complete analysis' for them to be accepted.<ref name=\"MacTutor\">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Post}}</ref>\n\n==Recursion theory==\nIn 1936, Post developed, independently of [[Alan Turing]], a mathematical model of computation that was  essentially equivalent to the [[Turing machine|Turing machine model]]. Intending this as the first of a series of models of equivalent power but increasing complexity, he titled his paper [[Formulation 1]]. This model is sometimes called \"Post's machine\" or a [[Post-Turing machine]], but is not to be confused with [[Tag system|Post's tag machines]] or other special kinds of [[Post canonical system]], a computational model using [[string rewriting]] and developed by Post in the 1920s but first published in 1943. Post's rewrite technique is now ubiquitous in programming language specification and design, and so with Church's lambda-calculus is a salient influence of classical modern logic on practical computing. Post devised a method of 'auxiliary symbols' by which he could canonically represent any Post-generative language, and indeed any computable function or set at all.\n\nThe unsolvability of his [[Post correspondence problem]] turned out to be exactly what was needed to obtain unsolvability results in the theory of [[formal languages]].\n\nIn an influential address to the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1944, he raised the question of the existence of an uncomputable [[recursively enumerable]] set whose [[Turing degree]] is less than that of the [[halting problem]]. This question, which became known as [[Post's problem]], stimulated much research. It was solved in the affirmative in the 1950s by the introduction of the powerful priority method in [[recursion theory]].\n\n==Polyadic groups==\nPost made a fundamental and still influential contribution to the theory of [[n-ary group|polyadic, or ''n''-ary, groups]] in a long paper published in 1940.  His major theorem showed that a polyadic group is the iterated multiplication of elements of a normal subgroup of a group, such that the quotient group is cyclic of order ''n'' &minus; 1.  He also demonstrated that a polyadic group operation on a set can be expressed in terms of a group operation on the same set.  The paper contains many other important results.\n\n==Selected papers==\n* {{cite journal |first=Emil Leon |last=Post |year=1921 |title=Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions |work= American Journal of Mathematics |volume=43 |pages=163–185 |doi=10.2307/2370324}}\n* {{cite journal |first=Emil Leon |last=Post |year=1936 |title=Finite Combinatory Processes - Formulation 1 |work=Journal of Symbolic Logic |volume=1 |pages=103–105 |doi=10.2307/2269031}}\n* {{cite journal |first=Emil Leon |last=Post |year=1940 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1940-048-02/S0002-9947-1940-0002894-7/home.html|title=Polyadic groups |journal=Transactions of the American Mathematical Society |volume=48 |pages=208–350 |doi=10.2307/1990085}}\n* {{cite journal |first=Emil Leon |last=Post |year=1943 |title=Formal Reductions of the General Combinatorial Decision Problem |work=American Journal of Mathematics |volume=65 |pages=197–215 |doi=10.2307/2371809}}\n* {{cite journal |first=Emil Leon |last=Post |year=1944 |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1944-50-05/S0002-9904-1944-08111-1/home.html|title=Recursively enumerable sets of positive integers and their decision problems |work=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=50 |pages=284–316 |doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1944-08111-1}} Introduces the important concept of [[many-one reduction]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arithmetical hierarchy]]\n*[[Functional completeness]]\n*[[List of multiple discoveries#20th century|List of multiple discoveries]]\n*[[Post's inversion formula]]\n*[[Post's lattice]]\n*[[Post's theorem]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ualberta.ca/~francisp/papers/UrquhartPost.pdf |chapter=Emil Post |first=Alasdair |last=Urquhart |authorlink=Alasdair Urquhart |series=Handbook of the History of Logic |volume=5 |title=Logic from Russell to Church |editor1=Gabbay, Dov M. |editor2=Woods, John Woods |year=2008 |publisher=Elsevier BV}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Anshel |first1=Iris Lee |last2=Anshel |first2=Michael |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2324657  |title=From the Post-Markov Theorem Through Decision Problems to Public-Key Cryptography |work=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=100 |number=9 |date=November 1993 |pages=835–844 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |doi=10.2307/2324657}} \n*:Dedicated to Emil Post and contains special material on Post.
