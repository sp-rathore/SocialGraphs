He was [[consular prefect]] of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], headquartered in Milan, before being made bishop of Milan by popular acclamation in 374. Ambrose was a staunch opponent of [[Arianism]], and has been accused of fostering persecutions of Arians, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.\n\nTraditionally, Ambrose is credited with promoting \"antiphonal chant\", a style of chanting in which one side of the choir responds alternately to the other, as well as with composing ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'', an [[Advent]] hymn.\n\nAmbrose was one of the four original [[doctors of the Church]], and is the [[patron saint]] of Milan. He is notable for his influence on [[St. Augustine]].\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nAmbrose was born into a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Christian]] family about 340 AD and was raised in [[Trier]].<ref name=\"CE\">{{CathEncy |wstitle=St. Ambrose}}</ref> His father is sometimes identified with Aurelius Ambrosius,<ref>{{Citation | last = Greenslade | first = Stanley Lawrence | title = Early Latin theology: selections from Tertullian, Cyprian, Ambrose, and Jerome | volume = 5 | series = Library of Christian classics | place = Westminster | publisher = John Knox Press | year = 1956 | page = 175}}</ref>{{Sfn | Paredi | 1964 | p = 380 | ps = : \"S.

Ambrose's siblings, [[Satyrus of Milan|Satyrus]] (who is the subject of Ambrose's ''De excessu fratris Satyri'') and [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]], are also venerated as saints.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90298 | title = Santi Beati | place = [[Italy|IT]] | language = Italian}}</ref> There is a legend that as an infant, a swarm of [[bee]]s settled on his face while he lay in his cradle, leaving behind a drop of [[honey]]. His father considered this a [[Christian symbolism|sign]] of his future eloquence and honeyed tongue. For this reason, bees and [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] often appear in the [[Saint symbolism|saint's symbology]].\n\nAfter the early death of his father, Ambrose followed his father's career. He was educated in Rome, studying [[literature]], [[law]], and [[rhetoric]]. [[Praetorian prefect of Italy|Praetorian prefect]] [[Sextus Claudius Petronius Probus|Probus]] first gave him a place in the council and then in about 372 made him [[consular prefect]] or \"Governor\" of [[Liguria]] and [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], with headquarters at [[Milan]], which was then (beside Rome) the second capital in Italy.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}}\n\nAmbrose was the Governor of Aemilia-Liguria in northern Italy until 374 when he became the Bishop of Milan. He was a very popular political figure, and since he was the Governor in the effective capital in the Roman West, he was a recognizable figure in the court of the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Valentinian I]]. Ambrose never married.\n\n=== Bishop of Milan ===\n[[Image:Sant'Ambrogio Cript in Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan.jpg|thumb|240px|right|The body of Ambrose (with white vestments) in the crypt of Sant'Ambrogio basilica.]]\nIn the late 4th century there was a deep conflict in the [[diocese of Milan]] between the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Church]] and [[Arianism|Arians]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Wilken | title = The Spirit of Early Christian Thought | publisher = Yale University Press | location = New Haven | year = 2003 | page = 218}}</ref>{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}} In 374 [[Auxentius of Milan|the bishop of Milan, Auxentius]], an Arian, died, and the Arians challenged the [[Apostolic succession|succession]]. Ambrose went to the church where the election was to take place, to prevent an uproar, which was probable in this crisis. His address was interrupted by a call \"Ambrose, bishop!\", which was taken up by the whole assembly.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 407}}\n\nAmbrose was known to be Nicene Christian in belief, but also acceptable to Arians due to the charity shown in theological matters in this regard. At first he energetically refused the office, for which he was in no way prepared: Ambrose was neither baptized nor formally trained in [[theology]].{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}} Upon his appointment, Ambrose fled to a colleague's home seeking to hide. Upon receiving a letter from the Emperor [[Gratianus|Gratian]] praising the appropriateness of Rome appointing individuals evidently worthy of holy positions, Ambrose's host gave him up. Within a week, he was baptized, ordained and duly consecrated bishop of [[Milan]].\n\nAs bishop, he immediately adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apportioned his money to the poor, donating all of his land, making only provision for his sister [[Saint Marcellina|Marcellina]] (who later became a nun),<ref name = \"CE\" /> and committed the care of his family to his brother. This raised his popularity even further, giving him considerable political leverage over even the emperor. Ambrose also wrote a treatise by the name of \"The Goodness of Death\".\n\n=== Arianism ===\nAccording to legend, Ambrose immediately and forcefully stopped [[Arianism]] in Milan. He studied theology with [[Simplician]], a [[presbyter]] of Rome. Using his excellent knowledge of Greek, which was then rare in the West, to his advantage, he studied the Old Testament and Greek authors like [[Philo]], [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and [[Basil of Caesarea]], with whom he was also exchanging letters.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cxcviii.html | title = Letter of Basil to Ambrose | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal library | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}</ref> He applied this knowledge as preacher, concentrating especially on exegesis of the Old Testament, and his rhetorical abilities impressed [[Augustine of Hippo]], who hitherto had thought poorly of Christian preachers.\n\nIn the confrontation with Arians, Ambrose sought to theologically refute their propositions, which were contrary to the [[Nicene creed]] and thus to the officially defined orthodoxy. The Arians appealed to many high level leaders and clergy in both the Western and Eastern empires. Although the western Emperor [[Gratian]] supported orthodoxy, the younger [[Valentinian II]], who became his colleague in the Empire, adhered to the Arian creed.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose did not sway the young prince's position. In the East, Emperor [[Theodosius I]] likewise professed the Nicene creed; but there were many adherents of Arianism throughout his dominions, especially among the higher clergy.\n\nIn this contested state of religious opinion, two leaders of the Arians, bishops [[Palladius of Ratiaria]] and Secundianus of [[Singidunum]], confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation. However, Ambrose feared the consequences and prevailed upon the emperor to have the matter determined by a council of the Western bishops. Accordingly, a [[Council of Aquileia, 381|synod]] composed of thirty-two bishops was held at [[Aquileia]] in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president and Palladius, being called upon to defend his opinions, declined. A vote was then taken, when Palladius and his associate Secundianus were deposed from their episcopal offices.\n\nNevertheless, the increasing strength of the Arians proved a formidable task for Ambrose. In 385{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} or 386 the emperor and his mother [[Justina (empress)|Justina]], along with a considerable number of [[clergy]] and [[laity]], especially military, professed Arianism. They demanded two churches in [[Milan]], one in the city (the [[Basilica]] of the Apostles), the other in the suburbs (St Victor's), to the Arians.{{Sfn | Butler | 1991 | p = 408}} Ambrose refused and was required to answer for his conduct before the council.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} He went, his eloquence in defense of the Church reportedly overawing the ministers of Valentinian, so he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine service]] in the basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian basilica in the suburbs. As he still refused, certain deans or officers of the court were sent to take possession of the Portian basilica, by hanging up in it imperial escutcheons{{sfn|Butler|1991|p=408}} to prepare for the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of [[Easter]].\n\nIn spite of Imperial opposition, Bishop Ambrose declared:\n{{quote |If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage: but God alone can appease it.}}\n\n=== Imperial relations ===\n[[Image:Anthonis van Dyck 005.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral]]'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]]]]\nThe imperial court was displeased with the religious principles of Ambrose, however his aid was soon solicited by the Emperor. When [[Magnus Maximus]] usurped the supreme power in [[Gaul]], and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to dissuade him from the undertaking, and the embassy was successful.\n\nA second later embassy was unsuccessful. The enemy entered [[Italy]] and [[Milan]] was taken. Justina and her son fled but Ambrose remained at his post and did good service to many of the sufferers by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief.\n\nIn 385 Ambrose, backed by Milan's populace, refused [[Valentinian II]]'s imperial request to hand over the Portian basilica for the use of Arian troops. In 386 Justina and Valentinian received the Arian bishop [[Auxentius of Durostorum|Auxentius the younger]], and Ambrose was again ordered to hand over a church in Milan for Arian usage. Ambrose and his congregation barricaded themselves inside the church, and the imperial order was rescinded.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Cambridge Ancient History | page = 106}}</ref>\n\n[[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Justina, and regained the kingdom. Theodosius was [[Excommunication#Roman Catholic Church|excommunicated]] by Ambrose for the [[Massacre of Thessaloniki|massacre]] of 7,000 people at [[Thessalonika|Thessalonica]] in 390, after the murder of the Roman governor there by rioters.{{Sfn | Attwater | John | 1993}}{{Rp| needed = yes|date=August 2012}} Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate [[David (biblical king)|David]] in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt&nbsp;— Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. Ambrose also forced Theodosius to retreat from compensating a Jewish community in Mesopotamia when a synagogue was burnt down by militant Christians.<ref>{{Citation | first = Diarmaid | last = MacCulloch|authorlink=Diarmaid MacCulloch | title = Christianity | publisher = Viking Penguin | location = London | year = 2009|page= 300}}</ref> These incidents show the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor&nbsp;— the controversy of [[John Chrysostom]] with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop.\n\nIn 392, after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the acclamation of [[Eugenius]], Ambrose supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported Eugenius after Theodosius was eventually victorious.\n\n[[File:AmbroseGiuLungara.jpg|thumb|alt=painting of St. Ambrose|Saint Ambrose with [[scourge]] and book, a painting in the church of San Giuseppe alla Lungara, Rome]]\n\n=== Attitude towards Jews ===\nIn his treatise on [[Abraham]], Ambrose warns against intermarriage with pagans, Jews, or heretics.<ref>[http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/03d/0339-0397,_Ambrosius,_De_Abraham_Libri_Duo,_LT.pdf ''De Abraham'', ix. 84, xiv. 451]</ref> In 388, Emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the [[synagogue]] at Callinicum on the [[Euphrates]].

For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah: 'And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.

Ambrose prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and Theodosius to reject requests to restore the Altar.\n\n===Later years and death===\nIn April 393 [[Arbogast (general)|Arbogast]], ''magister militum'' of the West and his puppet Emperor [[Eugenius]] marched into Italy to consolidate their position in regard to [[Theodosius I]] and his son, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], whom Theodosius had appointed Augustus to govern the western portion of the empire. Arbogast and Eugenius courted Ambrose's support by very obliging letters; but before they arrived at Milan, he had retired to Bologna, where he assisted at the translation of the relics of SS. Vitalis and Agricola. From there he went to Florence, where he remained until Eugenius withdrew from Milan to meet Theodosius in the [[Battle of the Frigidus]] in early September 394.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/210/12/071.html Butler, Alban. \"St. Ambrose, Bishop and Confessor, Doctor of the Church\", ''Lives of the Saints'', Vol. XII, 1866]</ref>\n \nSoon after acquiring the undisputed possession of the [[Roman empire]], Theodosius died at Milan in 395, and two years later (April 4, 397) Ambrose also died. He was succeeded as bishop of Milan by [[Simplician]]. Ambrose's body may still be viewed in the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|church of S. Ambrogio]] in Milan, where it has been continuously venerated&nbsp;— along with the bodies identified in his time as being those of [[Sts. Gervase and Protase]].\n\n=== Character ===\n[[Image:AmbroseStatue.png|thumb|110px|Drawing based on a statue of St. Ambrose]]\nMany circumstances in the history of Ambrose are characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were his great popularity and the reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period. But it must also be noted that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his authority with the people.\n\nHe was generous to the [[poverty|poor]]; it was his custom to comment severely in his preaching on the public characters of his times; and he introduced popular reforms in the order and manner of public worship. It is alleged, too, that at a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he was admonished in a dream to search for, and found under the pavement of the church, the remains of two [[martyr]]s, [[Gervasius and Protasius]]. The saints, although they would have had to have been hundreds of years old, looked as if they had just died. The applause of the people was mingled with the derision of the court party.\n\n== Theology ==\nAmbrose ranks with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Jerome]], and [[Gregory the Great]], as one of the [[Latin]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]]. Theologians compare him with [[Hilary of Poitiers|Hilary]], who they claim fell short of Ambrose's administrative excellence but demonstrated greater [[theology|theological]] ability. He succeeded as a theologian despite his juridical training and his comparatively late handling of [[Biblical]] and [[doctrinal]] subjects.\n\nAmbrose's intense episcopal consciousness furthered the growing [[doctrine]] of the Church and its [[sacerdotal]] ministry, while the prevalent [[asceticism]] of the day, continuing the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Cicero]]nian training of his youth, enabled him to promulgate a lofty standard of Christian [[ethics]]. Thus we have the ''De officiis ministrorum'', ''De viduis'', ''De virginitate'' and ''De paenitentia''.\n\nAmbrose displayed a kind of liturgical flexibility that kept in mind that liturgy was a tool to serve people in worshiping God, and ought not to become a rigid entity that is invariable from place to place. His advice to Augustine of Hippo on this point was to follow local liturgical custom. \"When I am at Rome, I fast on a Saturday; when I am at Milan, I do not. Follow the custom of the church where you are.\"<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | title = Epistle to Januarius | at = II, section 18}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Augustine | last = of Hippo | title = Epistle to Casualanus | at = XXXVI, section 32}}</ref> Thus Ambrose refused to be drawn into a false conflict over which particular local church had the \"right\" liturgical form where there was no substantial problem. His advice has remained in the English language as the saying, \"[[wikt:when in Rome, do as the Romans do|When in Rome, do as the Romans do.]]\"\n\nOne interpretation of Ambrose's writings is that he was a [[Christian universalism|Christian universalist]].<ref name=\"hanson\">{{Citation | first = JW | last = Hanson | title = Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years | url = http://hellbusters.8m.com/upd18.html | chapter = 18. Additional Authorities | place = Boston and Chicago | publisher = Universalist Publishing House | year = 1899 | accessdate = 2012-12-08}}</ref> It has been noted that Ambrose's theology was significantly influenced by that of [[Origen]] and [[Didymus the Blind]], two other early Christian universalists.<ref name=\"hanson\" /> One quotation cited in favor of this belief:\n{{quote |Our Savior has appointed two kinds of resurrection in the Apocalypse. 'Blessed is he that hath part in the first resurrection,' for such come to grace without the judgment. As for those who do not come to the first, but are reserved unto the second resurrection, these shall be disciplined until their appointed times, between the first and the second resurrection.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.tentmaker.org/Quotes/churchfathersquotes.htm | title = The Church Fathers on Universalism | publisher = Tentmaker | accessdate = December 5, 2007}}</ref>}}\n\nOne could interpret this passage as being another example of the mainstream Christian belief in a general resurrection (both for those in heaven and for those in hell). Several other works by Ambrose clearly teach the mainstream view of salvation. For example:\n{{quote |The Jews feared to believe in manhood taken up into God, ''and therefore have lost the grace of redemption'', because they reject that on which salvation depends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ambrose | url = http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/34043.htm | contribution = Exposition of the Christian Faith, Book III | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | year = 1907 | place = New York | publisher = Robert Appleton Co | accessdate = February 24, 2009}} from New Advent.</ref>}}\n\n=== Giving to the poor ===\nAmbrose considered the poor not a distinct group of outsiders, but a part of the united, solidary people. Giving to the poor was not to be considered an act of generosity towards the fringes of society but as a repayment of resources that God had originally bestowed on everyone equally and that the rich had usurped.<ref>{{Cite book | first = Peter | last = Brown | title = Through the Eye of the Needle - Wealth, the Fall of Rome, and the Making of Christianity in the West, 350-550 AD. | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2012 | page=133}}</ref>\n\n===Mariology===\n[[File:Francisco de Zurbarán 032.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''St. Ambrose'', by [[Francisco de Zurbarán]]]]\nThe theological treatises of Ambrose of Milan would come to influence Popes [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus]], [[Siricius]] and [[Pope Leo the Great|Leo XIII]].

Spanish, Palencia. Wood with traces of polychromy. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]].]]\n{{Main|Ambrosian Hymnography}}\n\nAmbrose is traditionally credited but not actually known to have composed any of the repertory of [[Ambrosian chant]] also known simply as \"antiphonal [[chant]]\", a method of chanting where one side of the choir alternately responds to the other. (The later pope St. [[Gregory I the Great]] is not known to have composed any [[Gregorian chant]], the [[plainsong]] or \"[[Romish chant]]\".) However, Ambrosian chant was named in his honor due to his contributions to the music of the Church; he is credited with introducing [[hymnody]] from the Eastern Church into the West.\n\nCatching the impulse from [[Hilary of Arles|Hilary]] and confirmed in it by the success of Arian [[psalmody]], Ambrose composed several original [[hymn]]s as well, four of which still survive, along with music which may not have changed too much from the original melodies. Each of these hymns has eight four-line [[stanza]]s and is written in strict iambic dimeter (that is 2 x 2 iambs).\nMarked by dignified simplicity, they served as a fruitful model for later times.\n* ''Deus Creator Omnium''\n* ''Aeterne rerum conditor''\n* ''Jam surgit hora tertia''\n* ''Jam Christus astra ascenderat''\n* ''[[Veni redemptor gentium]]'' (a [[Christmas]] hymn)\n\nIn his writings, Ambrose refers only to the performance of [[psalms]], in which solo singing of psalm verses alternated with a congregational refrain called an ''[[antiphon]]''.\n\nSt. Ambrose was also traditionally credited with composing the hymn ''[[Te Deum]]'', which he is said to have composed when he baptised [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]], his celebrated convert.\n\n== Augustine ==\nAmbrose was Bishop of Milan at the time of Augustine's conversion, and is mentioned in [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''. It is commonly understood in the Christian Tradition that Ambrose baptized Augustine.\n\n=== Celibacy ===\nIn a passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' in which Augustine wonders why he could not share his burden with Ambrose, he makes a comment which bears on the history of celibacy:\n{{quote|Ambrose himself I esteemed a happy man, as the world counted happiness, because great personages held him in honor. Only his celibacy appeared to me a painful burden.<ref name=\"AugustineOnAmbrose\">Augustine. ''Confessions'' Book Six, Chapter Three.</ref>}}\n\n=== Reading ===\nIn this same passage of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' is a curious anecdote which bears on the history of reading:\n{{quote |When [Ambrose] read, his eyes scanned the page and his heart sought out the meaning, but his voice was silent and his tongue was still. Anyone could approach him freely and guests were not commonly announced, so that often, when we came to visit him, we found him reading like this in silence, for he never read aloud.<ref name=\"AugustineOnAmbrose\" />}}\n\nThis is a celebrated passage in modern scholarly discussion. The practice of reading to oneself without vocalizing the text was less common in antiquity than it has since become. In a culture that set a high value on oratory and public performances of all kinds, in which the production of books was very labor-intensive, the majority of the population was illiterate, and where those with the leisure to enjoy literary works also had slaves to read for them, written texts were more likely to be seen as scripts for recitation than as vehicles of silent reflection. However, there is also evidence that silent reading did occur in antiquity and that it was not generally regarded as unusual.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/jul/29/featuresreviews.guardianreview27 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Read my lips | first=James | last=Fenton | date=July 28, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first =\nAK | last = Gavrilov | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/639597 | title = Techniques of Reading in Classical Antiquity | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | year = 1997 | pages = 56–73, esp. 70–71 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.56}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = MF | last = Burnyeat | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/639598 | title = Postscript on silent reading | journal = Classical Quarterly | volume = 47 | year = 1997 | pages = 74–76 | doi=10.1093/cq/47.1.74}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 2012 film ''[[Restless Heart: The Confessions of Saint Augustine]]'', Bishop Ambrose is portrayed by Italian actor [[Andrea Giordana]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Latin'''\n* ''Hexameron, De paradiso, De Cain, De Noe, De Abraham, De Isaac, De bono mortis''&nbsp;– ed.
