Elected a fellow of New College in 1969, he later taught at Princeton University, and returned to New College, Oxford, in 1996 to take up the Wardenship. He was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1986.\n\nA political theorist and historian of political thought, Ryan is a recognised authority on development of modern [[liberalism]], and especially the work of [[John Stuart Mill]], having contributed directly to the ‘Reversionary’ school, which led to a re-examination of Mill's work from the 1970s. His academic work also takes in broader themes in [[political theory]], including the [[philosophy of social science]], the nature of [[property]], the history of political thought, and [[liberalism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nRyan has held positions at the Universities of Oxford, [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[University of Keele|Keele]] and [[Princeton University]] and [[University of Virginia School of Law]]. He was also a Visiting Professor of Political Science at The University of Texas at Austin, Australian National University, The New School and many others.\n\nRyan is a regular contributor to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', and ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', and continues to write on political theory and the history of political thought.<ref>E.g.
