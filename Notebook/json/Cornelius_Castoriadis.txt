Also strongly influenced by Castoriadis and ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' were the British group and journal ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'' and [[Maurice Brinton]].\n\n=== Early philosophical research ===\nIn the late 1940s, he started attending philosophical and sociological courses at the Faculty of Letters at the [[University of Paris]] (''[[:fr:|faculté des lettres de Paris]]''), where among his teachers were [[Gaston Bachelard]],<ref name=\"entretien p. 4\">[http://agorainternational.org/enccaiint.pdf Cornelius Castoriadis/Agora International Interview Cerisy Colloquium (1990)], p. 4.</ref><ref name=\"Dosse 43–4\">Dosse 2014, pp. 43–4.</ref><ref>Tasis 2007, pp. 67–8.</ref> the [[Epistemology|epistemologist]] [[:fr:René Poirier|René Poirier]], the historian of philosophy [[Henri Bréhier]] (not to be confused with [[Émile Bréhier]]), [[Henri Gouhier]], [[Jean Wahl]], [[Gustave Guillaume]], [[:fr:Albert Bayet|Albert Bayet]], and [[Georges Davy]].<ref name=\"Dosse 43–4\"/> He submitted a proposal for a [[doctoral dissertation]] on [[mathematical logic]] to Poirier, but he eventually abandoned the project.<ref name=\"Dosse 44\">Dosse 2014, p. 44.</ref><ref name=\"entretien p. 4\"/> The working title of his thesis was ''Introduction à la logique axiomatique'' (''Introduction to [[Axiomatic logic|Axiomatic Logic]]'').<ref name=\"HC\"/><ref name=\"Dosse 44\"/>\n\n=== Career as economist and distancing from Marxism ===\nAt the same time (starting in November 1948), he worked as an economist at the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) until 1970, which was also the year when he obtained French [[citizenship]]. Consequently, his writings prior to that date were published pseudonymously, as \"'''Pierre Chaulieu''',\" \"'''Paul Cardan''',\" \"'''Jean-Marc Coudray'''\" etc.\n\nIn his 1949 essay \"The Relations of Production in Russia\", Castoriadis developed a critique of the supposed socialist character of the government of the [[Soviet Union]]. The central claim of the Stalinist regime at the time was that the mode of production in Russia was socialist, but the mode of distribution was not yet a socialist one since the socialist edification in the country had not yet been completed. However, according to Castoriadis' analysis, since the mode of distribution of the social product is inseparable from the mode of production,<ref>\"''[L]e mode de répartition du produit social est inséparable du mode de production''.\" (P. Chaulieu, \"''Les rapports de production en Russie''\", ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'' n° 2 (May 1949) reproduced in ''La Société bureaucratique - Volumes 1-2'', Christian Bourgois Éditeur, 1990, p. 164.)</ref> the claim that one can have control over distribution while not having control over production is meaningless.<ref>\"''L'Idée que l'on puisse dominer la répartition sans dominer la production est de l'enfantillage.''\" (''La Société bureaucratique - Volumes 1-2'', p. 166.)</ref>\n\nCastoriadis was particularly influential in the turn of the intellectual left during the 1950s against the Soviet Union, because he argued that the Soviet Union was not a [[Communist state|communist]] but rather a [[State capitalism|bureaucratic capitalist state]], which contrasted with Western powers mostly by virtue of its centralized power apparatus.<ref>Peter Osborne (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7zyESK4VH4EC&dq= ''A Critical Sense: Interviews with Intellectuals''], Routledge, 2013, p. 17.</ref> His work in the OECD substantially helped his analyses.\n\nIn the latter years of ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', Castoriadis came to reject the [[Marxian economics|Marxist theories of economics]] and of [[Historical materialism|history]], especially in an essay on ''Modern Capitalism and Revolution'' (first published in ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', 1960–61; first English translation in 1963 by ''Solidarity'').\n\n=== Psychoanalyst<!--'Magma (philosophy)' and 'Magma (ontology)' redirect here--> ===\nWhen Jacques Lacan's disputes with the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]] led to a split and the formation of the [[École Freudienne de Paris]] (EFP) in 1964, Castoriadis became a member (as a non-practitioner).<ref>{{cite book | last=Roudinesco| first=Élisabeth | authorlink=Élisabeth Roudinesco | title=Jacques Lacan & Co | publisher=University of Chicago Press | page=433}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 Castoriadis married [[Piera Aulagnier]], a French psychoanalyst who had undergone psychoanalytic treatment under [[Jacques Lacan]] from 1955 until 1961.<ref name=\"Aulagnier\">[http://www.psychoanalytikerinnen.de/france_biographies.html#Aulagnier \"Piera Aulagnier ''née'' Spairani\" entry at Psychoanalytikerinnen.de]</ref>\n\nIn 1969 Castoriadis and Aulagnier split from the EFP to join the [[:fr:Organisation psychanalytique de langue française|Organisation psychanalytique de langue française]] (O.P.L.F.), the so-called \"Quatrième Groupe\",<ref name=\"Tasis216\">Tasis 2007, p. 216.</ref> a psychoanalytic group that claims to follow principles and methods that have opened up a third way between [[Lacanianism]] and the standards of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]].<ref>Sophie de Mijolla-Mellor (2005).

Otherness emerges in part from the activity of the psyche itself. Creating external social institutions that give stable form to what Castoriadis terms the ([[Ontology|ontological]]) \"'''magma'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--><ref>From the contemporary geological term [[magma]], \"blend of molten or semi-molten rock\", from the [[Ancient Greek]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dma%2Fgma μάγμα], \"thick unguent\" (Suzi Adams, ed., 2014, ch. 6).</ref><ref>\"A magma is that from which one can extract (or in which one can construct) an indefinite number of [[Set theory|ensemblist]] organizations but which can never be reconstituted (ideally) by a (finite or infinite) ensemblist composition of these organizations.\" (''IIS'', p. 343.)</ref><ref>Klooger, Jeff. \"The Guise of Nothing: Castoriadis on Indeterminacy, and its Misrecognition in Heidegger and Sartre,\" ''Critical Horizons'' '''14'''(1), 2013, p. 7: \"'Magma' is the name Castoriadis gives to the mode of being which he sees as underlying all others, and which is characterized by an indeterminacy in which particular determinations come to be, but without congealing into inalterable forms, and without diminishing the potential for the emergence of new and different determinations.\"</ref> of social significations\"<ref>''IIS'', p. 359.</ref> allows the psyche to create stable figures for the self, and to ignore the constant emergence of mental [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminacy]] and [[alterity]].\n\nFor Castoriadis, self-examination, as in the ancient Greek tradition, could draw upon the resources of modern psychoanalysis. Autonomous individuals—the essence of an autonomous society—must continuously examine themselves and engage in critical reflection. He writes:\n<blockquote> ...psychoanalysis can and should make a basic contribution to a politics of autonomy. For, each person's self-understanding is a necessary condition for autonomy. One cannot have an autonomous society that would fail to turn back upon itself, that would not interrogate itself about its motives, its reasons for acting, its deep-seated [''profondes''] tendencies. Considered in concrete terms, however, society doesn't exist outside the individuals making it up. The self-reflective activity of an autonomous society depends essentially upon the self-reflective activity of the humans who form that society.<ref>''FT'' A: \"Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads\" (essay based on a speech given in [[Abrantes]] in November 1996), p. 151. The quote appears in a slightly different translation in ''FT'' B (''Figures of the Thinkable'', trans. by Helen Arnold, Stanford University Press, 2007), pp. 89–90.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCastoriadis was not calling for every individual to undergo psychoanalysis, per se. Rather, by reforming education and political systems, individuals would be increasingly capable of critical self- and social reflexion. He offers: \"if psychoanalytic practice has a political meaning, it is solely to the extent that it tries, as far as it possibly can, to render the individual autonomous, that is to say, lucid concerning her desire and concerning reality, and responsible for her acts: holding herself accountable for what she does.\"<ref>''FT'' A: \"First Institution of Society and Second-Order Institutions\" (essay based on a lecture presented on December 15, 1985 in Paris), p. 163.</ref>\n\n=== Sovietologist ===\nIn his 1980 ''Facing the War'' text, he took the view that Russia had become the primary world military power. To sustain this, in the context of the visible economic inferiority of the Soviet Union in the civilian sector, he proposed that the society may no longer be dominated by the party-state bureaucracy but by a \"[[stratocracy]]\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |date=February 1980  |title=Facing the War |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=46 |pages=48}}</ref>—a separate and dominant military sector with expansionist designs on the world. He further argued that this meant there was no internal class dynamic which could lead to social revolution within Russian society and that change could only occur through foreign intervention.\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn 1980, he joined the faculty of the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]] (EHESS) as ''[[:fr:Directeur d'études|Directeur d'études]]'' (Director of Studies).<ref>''PSW 2'', p. 363.</ref> He had been elected ''[[:fr:Directeur de recherche|Directeur de recherche]]'' (Director of Research) in EHESS at the end of 1979<ref name=\"Schrift 112\">Schrift 2006, p. 112.</ref> after submitting his previously published material in conjunction with a defense of his intellectual project of connecting the disciplines of history, sociology and economy through the concept of the social imaginary<ref>Dosse 2014, pp. 305–11.</ref><ref>He had proposed in his application form the creation of a Chair in ''Recherches sur les régimes sociaux contemporains'', \"Research on contemporary social systems\" (Dosse 2014, p. 308), which he eventually occupied.</ref> (see [[Cornelius Castoriadis#Thought|below]]). His teaching career at the EHESS lasted sixteen years.<ref>''OPS'', p. xxi.</ref>\n\nIn 1980, he was also awarded his [[State doctorate]] from the University of Nanterre; the final title of his thesis under Ricœur (see [[Cornelius Castoriadis#Philosopher of history and ontologist|above]]) was ''L'Élément imaginaire de l'histoire''<ref name=\"Schrift 112\"/> (''The Imaginary Element in History'').\n\nIn 1984, Castoriadis and Aulagnier divorced.<ref name=\"Aulagnier\"/>\n\nIn 1989, he was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] in Social Sciences by [[Panteion University]] and in 1993 another one in [[Pedagogy|Education Sciences]] by the [[Democritus University of Thrace]].<ref>Dosse 2014, pp. 350–1.</ref>\n\nIn 1992, he joined the [[libertarian socialist]] journal ''[[Society and Nature]]'' (established by [[Takis Fotopoulos]]) as a writer; the magazine also featured such writers as [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Noam Chomsky]].<ref>[[Chris Atton]], ''Alternative Literature: A Practical Guide for Librarians'', Gower, p. 41.</ref>\n\nHe died on December 26, 1997 from complications following [[heart surgery]].

Change emerges through ''the [[imaginary (sociology)#Castoriadis|social imaginary]]'' without strict determinations, but in order to be socially recognized it must be instituted as [[revolution]]. Any knowledge of society and [[social change]] can exist only by referring to (or by positing) ''social imaginary [[Verstehen|significations]]''. Thus, Castoriadis developed a conceptual framework where the sociological and philosophical category of the social imaginary has a central place and he offered an interpretation of [[modernity]] centered on the principal categories of ''[[social institution]]s'' and social imaginary significations;<ref name=\"IIS 160\"/> in his analysis, these categories are the product of the human faculties of the ''radical [[imagination]]'' and the social imaginary, the latter faculty being the collective dimension of the former.<ref>Marcela Tova, [http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/815/81500904.pdf \"The imaginary term in readings about modernity: Taylor and Castoriadis conceptions\"], ''Revista de Estudios Sociales'' 9, June 2001, pp. 32–39.</ref> (According to Castoriadis, the sociological and philosophical category of ''the radical [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#The Imaginary and French culture|imaginary]]'' can be manifested only through the individual radical imagination and the social imaginary.)<ref>''IIS'', p. 373.</ref><ref>Chiara Bottici, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Au0YBQAAQBAJ&dq= ''Imaginal Politics: Images Beyond Imagination and the Imaginary''], Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 50.</ref><ref>[[:fr:Nicolas Poirier|Nicolas Poirier]], [http://www.cairn.info/revue-du-mauss-2003-1-page-383.htm \"Cornelius Castoriadis.

Further, some of his terminology changed throughout the later part of his career, with the terms gaining greater consistency but breaking from their traditional meaning (thus creating neologisms). When reading Castoriadis, it is helpful to understand what he means by the terms he uses, since he does not redefine the terms in every piece where he employs them.\n\n=== Autonomy and heteronomy ===\n{{Libertarian socialism|People}}\nThe concept of \"[[autonomy]]\" appears to be a key theme in his early postwar writings and he continued to elaborate on its meaning, applications and limits until his death, gaining him the title of \"Philosopher of ''Autonomy''\". The word itself is [[Greek language|Greek]], where ''auto-'' means 'for/by itself' and ''[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]'' means 'law,' defining the condition of creating one's own laws, whether as an individual or as a whole society. Castoriadis noticed that while all societies construct their own unique laws and institutions, members of ''autonomous societies'' are fully aware of this fact and explicitly self-institute.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Castoriadis |first=Cornelius |authorlink= |author2=Anti-Mythes |date=January 1974 |title=An Interview with C. Castoriadis |journal=[[Telos (journal)|Telos]] |issue=23 |page=152}}</ref> In contrast, members of ''heteronomous societies'' (''hetero''- 'other') delegate this process to extra-social authorities and attribute their [[imaginary (Sociology)|imaginaries]] to gods or ancestors or, in modern ideologies, to historical necessity.<ref>\"Alienation appears first of all as the alienation of a society to its institutions, as the ''autonomization'' of institutions in relation to society.\" (''IIS'', p. 115.)</ref>\n\nCastoriadis emphasized the need of societies to legitimize their laws or explain, in other words, why their laws are good and just as they claim them to be. Most traditional societies did that through religion, believing that their laws were given by a super-natural ancestor or god and therefore must be true. Modern capitalist societies legitimize their system ([[capitalism]]) through '[[reason]]', claiming it makes 'logical sense'.<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1999). « ''La rationalité du capitalisme'' » in ''Figures du Pensable'' (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' VI), Paris: Seuil.</ref> Castoriadis observes that nearly all such efforts are [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] in that they legitimize a system through rules defined by the system itself. So just like the Old Testament and the Koran claim that 'There is only one God, God', capitalism first defines logic as the maximization of utility and minimization of cost, and then bases its own legitimacy on its effectiveness to meet this criterion.\n\nAs he explains in one of his lectures in the Greek village of [[Leonidio]] in 1984,<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1984). ''Η Αρχαία Ελληνική Δημοκρατία και η Σημασία της για μας Σήμερα''. Athens: Ypsilon (Ύψιλον).</ref> many newly founded societies start from an autonomous state which is usually in the form of [[direct democracy]], like the [[Town meeting|town hall meetings]] during the [[American Revolution]] and the local assemblies of the [[Paris Commune]]. What they end up with, however, is a form of governance by which the citizens do not legislate directly but delegate this power to a group of experts who remain in power, largely unchecked by official means, for a number of years. The ancient Greeks on the other hand developed a system of continuous autonomy where the people (''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]'') voted constantly on matters of government and law and where the elected rulers, the ''[[Archon of Athens|archons]]'', were mainly asked to enforce them. In such a system, courts of law were governed by common citizens who were appointed to the degree of judge briefly and army generals were voted in by the people and had to convince them of the correctness of their decisions. Taking some poetic licence to expand this point, he says that in this system, the president of the national treasury could have been a Phoenician slave, since he would only be asked to implement the rulings of the demos.\n\nCastoriadis' writings delve at length into the philosophy and politics of the ancient Greeks who, as a true autonomous society knew that laws are man-made and legitimization tautological. They challenged these laws on a constant basis and yet obeyed them to the same degree (even to the extent of enforcing capital punishment) proving that autonomous societies can indeed exist.\n\n=== The Imaginary ===\nThe term \"the Imaginary\" originates in the writings of the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (see ''[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]]'') and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. To understand it better we might think of its usual context, the \"''imaginary institution of societies''\". By that, Castoriadis means that societies, together with their laws and legalizations, are founded upon a basic conception of the world and man's place in it. Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined [[#Autonomy and heteronomy|above]]). That same imaginary is, interestingly enough, the foundation of its opposing ideology, [[Communism]]. By that measure he observes, first in his main criticism of [[Marxism]], titled the ''Imaginary Institution of Society'',<ref name =\"IIS 23\">''IIS'', p. 23.</ref> as well as speaking in Brussels,<ref>Cornelius Castoriadis (1981) (avec [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] et le Public de Louvain-la-Neuve), ''De l'écologie à l'autonomie'' [''From Ecology to Autonomy''], Édition de Seuil, Paris.</ref> that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same [[industrial revolution]] type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first.<ref name =\"IIS 23\" />\n\nSimilarly, in the issue of ecology he observes that the problems facing our environment are only present within the capitalist imaginary that values the continuous expansion of industries. Trying to solve it by changing or managing these industries better might fail, since it essentially acknowledges this imaginary as real, thus perpetuating the problem.\n\nThus, imaginaries are directly responsible for all aspects of culture. The Greeks had an imaginary by which the world stems from [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and the ancient [[Jews]] an imaginary by which the world stems from the will of a pre-existing entity, God. The former developed therefore a system of immediate democracy where the laws were ever changing according to the people's will while the second a theocratic system according to which man is in an eternal quest to understand and enforce the will of God.\n\nCastoriadis also believed that the complex historical processes through which new imaginaries are born are not directly quantifiable by science. This is because it is through the imaginaries themselves that the categories upon which science is applied are created. In the second part of his ''Imaginary Institution of Society'' he gives the example of [[set theory]], which is at the basis of [[Mathematical logic|formal logic]], which cannot function without having first defined the \"elements\" which are to be assigned to sets.<ref>''IIS'', pp. 223–5.</ref> This initial ''schema of separation''<ref name=\"IIS 224–5\"/> (''schéma de séparation'', σχήμα του χωρισμού) of the world into distinct elements and categories therefore, precedes the application of (formal) logic and, consequently, science.\n\n=== Chaos ===\nThe concept of \"Chaos\" that one encounters frequently in Castoriadis' work.<ref>''IIS'', p. 46.</ref><ref>''FT'' B, p. 80.</ref> According to that, the Greeks developed an imaginary by which the world is a product of Chaos, as narrated by both [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. The word has since been [[Chaos theory|promoted to a scientific term]], but Castoriadis is inclined to believe that although the Greeks ''had'' sometimes expressed Chaos in that way (as a system too complex to be understood), they mainly referred to it as ''nothingness''. He then concludes what made the ancient Greek society different to other societies is exactly that core imaginary, which essentially says that if the world is created out of nothing then man can indeed, in his brief time on earth, model it as he sees fit,<ref>Castoriadis advocated that \"[t]he surging forth [''surgissement''] of signification—of the institution, of society—is creation and self-creation. ... Signification emerges to cover over the Chaos, thus bringing into being a mode of being that posits itself as negation of the Chaos\" (''WIF'', p. 315).</ref> without trying to conform on some pre-existing order like a divine law. He contrasted that sharply to the Biblical imaginary, which sustains all Judaic societies to this day, according to which, in the beginning of the world there was a God, a willing entity and man's position therefore is to understand that Will and act accordingly.\n\n=== The Ancient Greeks and the Modern West ===\nCastoriadis views the political organization of the ancient Greek city states as a model of an autonomous society. He argues that their direct democracy was not based, as many assume, on the existence of slaves and/or the geography of Greece, which forced the creation of small city states, since many other societies had these preconditions but did not create democratic systems. The same goes for colonisation since the neighbouring [[Phoenicia]]ns, who had a similar expansion in the Mediterranean, were monarchical till their end. During this time of colonization, however, around the time of Homer's epic poems, we observe for the first time that the Greeks, instead of transferring their mother city's social system to the newly established colony, instead, for the first time in known history, legislate anew from the ground up. What also made the Greeks special was the fact that, following the above, they kept this system as a perpetual autonomy which led to direct democracy.\n\nThis phenomenon of autonomy is again present in the emergence of the states of northern Italy during the [[Renaissance]],<ref>See ''[[List of republics#Middle Ages and Renaissance|Renaissance republics]]''.</ref> again as a product of small independent merchants.\n\nHe sees a tension in the modern West between, on the one hand, the potentials for autonomy and creativity and the proliferation of \"open societies\" and, on the other hand, the spirit-crushing force of capitalism. These are respectively characterized as the ''creative imaginary'' and the ''capitalist imaginary'':\n<blockquote> I think that we are at a crossing in the roads of history, history in the grand sense. One road already appears clearly laid out, at least in its general orientation. That's the road of the loss of meaning, of the repetition of empty forms, of conformism, apathy, irresponsibility, and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of \"rational mastery,\" pseudorational pseudomastery, of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption, that is to say, for nothing, and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary. ¶ The other road should be opened: it is not at all laid out. It can be opened only through a social and political awakening, a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy, that is to say, of the will to freedom. This would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary.<ref>''FT'' A: \"Imaginary and Imagination at the Crossroads,\" p. 146.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe argues that, in the last two centuries, ideas about autonomy again come to the fore: \"This extraordinary profusion reaches a sort of pinnacle during the two centuries stretching between 1750 and 1950.

His interventions in sociological and political theory have resulted in some of the most well-known writing to emerge from the continent (especially in the figure of [[Jürgen Habermas]], who often can be seen to be writing against Castoriadis).<ref>Elliott 2003, p. 101.</ref> Hans Joas published a number of articles in American journals in order to highlight the importance of Castoriadis' work to a North American sociological audience,<ref>Joas, H. 1989. \"Institutionalization as a Creative Process: The Sociological Importance of Cornelius Castoriadis's Political Philosophy\", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. '''4''': 5 (March), 1184–99.</ref> and [[:cs:Johann Pál Arnason|Johann Pál Arnason]] has been of enduring importance both for his critical engagement with Castoriadis' thought and for his sustained efforts to introduce it to the English speaking public (especially during his editorship of the journal ''Thesis Eleven'').<ref>Arnason, J. P. 1989. \"Culture and Imaginary Significations\", ''Thesis Eleven'' 22, 25–45.</ref> In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's ''Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy'' (Brill), and Suzi Adams's ''Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation'' (Fordham University Press).\n\n== Major publications ==\n;Original French\n* ''Mai 68 : la brèche'' [''The Breach''], [[Fayard]], 1968 (under the pseudonym Jean-Marc Coudray; co-authored with [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Claude Lefort]])\n* ''La Société bureaucratique'' [''Bureaucratic Society''] in two volumes: ''Les Rapports de production en Russie'' and ''La Révolution contre la bureaucratie'', 1973\n* ''L'Expérience du mouvement ouvrier'' [''The Experience of the Labor Movement''] in two volumes: ''Comment lutter'' and ''Prolétariat et organisation'', 1974\n* ''L'Institution imaginaire de la société'' [''The Imaginary Institution of Society''], [[Éditions du Seuil|Seuil]], 1975\n* ''Les Carrefours du labyrinthe'' [''Crossroads in the Labyrinth''], Volume I, 1978 \n* ''Le Contenu du socialisme'' [''On the Content of Socialism''], 1979<!--(translated in: ''PSW'', Vol. 1)-->\n* ''Capitalisme moderne et révolution'' [''Modern Capitalism and Revolution''] in two volumes, 1979\n* ''Devant la guerre'' [''Facing the War''], Volume I, 1981 (a second volume was never published)\n* ''Domaines de l'homme'' [''Domains of Man''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' II), 1986\n* ''La Brèche: vingt ans après'' (''réédition du livre de 1968 complété par de nouveaux textes'') [''The Breach: Twenty Years After''], 1988\n* ''Le Monde morcelé'' [''World in Fragments''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' III), 1990\n* ''La Montée de l'insignifiance'' [''The Rising Tide of Insignificance''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' IV), 1996\n* ''Fait et à faire'' [''Done and To Be Done''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' V), 1997\n\n;Posthumous publications\n* ''Figures du pensable'' [''Figures of the Thinkable''] (''Les carrefours du labyrinthe'' VI), 1999\n* ''Sur ''Le Politique'' de Platon'' [''Commentary on ''The Statesman'' of Plato''], 1999\n* ''Sujet et vérité dans le monde social-historique.
