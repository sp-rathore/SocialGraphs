The term encompasses not only the army but the whole of the movement's activities and overall spirit.  The suffix -''shchina'' can be employed in a slightly derogatory manner, but this is not the intention in this case, given that the movement's adherents – including Makhno himself – frequently used the term to describe themselves.</ref>  Makhno fought all factions which sought to impose any external authority over southern Ukraine, battling in succession the [[Ukrainian National Republic|Ukrainian Nationalists]], the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Imperial German and Austro-German occupation]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate Republic]], the [[Volunteer Army|White Army]], the [[Red Army]], and other smaller forces led by Ukrainian [[ataman|otamans]]. Makhno and his movement repeatedly attempted to reorganize life in the [[Huliaipole]] region along anarchist-communist lines; however, the disruptions of the civil war precluded any long-term social experiments.\n\nAlthough Makhno considered the [[Bolsheviks]] a threat to the development of an anarchist [[Free Territory]] within Ukraine, he twice entered into military alliances with them to defeat the White Army. In the aftermath of the defeat of the White Army in the region in November 1920, the Bolsheviks initiated a military campaign against Makhno, which concluded with his escape across the Romanian border in August 1921. After a series of imprisonments and escapes, Makhno finally settled in Paris with his wife Halyna and daughter Yelena. In exile Makhno wrote three volumes of memoirs.<ref>Nestor Makhno, [1927] ''The Russian Revolution in Ukraine'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2007; [1936] ''Under the Blows of the Counterrevolution'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2009; [1937] ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2011.</ref> Makhno died in exile at the age of 45 from tuberculosis-related causes.

As the [[Central Rada]] of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) proved unable to maintain order, a coup by former [[Tsarist]] general [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] in April 1918 resulted in the establishment of the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]]. Already dissatisfied by the UNR's failure to resolve the question of land ownership, much of the peasantry refused to support a conservative government administered by former imperial officials and supported by the Austro-Hungarian and German occupiers.<ref>Magocsi 1996, p 499.</ref>  Peasant bands under various self-appointed ''[[otaman]]y'' which had been counted on the rolls of the UNR's army now attacked the Germans, later going over to the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directory]] in summer 1918 or to the Bolsheviks in late 1918–19, or home to protect local interests, in many cases changing allegiances, plundering so-called class enemies, and venting age-old resentments.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Magocsi 1996, p 498–9, Subtelny 1988, p 360.</ref> They finally dominated the countryside in mid-1919; the largest portion would follow either Socialist Revolutionary [[Matviy Hryhoriyiv]] or the anarchist flag of Makhno.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn [[Yekaterinoslav]] province the rebellion soon took on anarchist political overtones. Nestor Makhno joined an anarchist group (headed by sailor-deserter [[Fedir Shchus]]) and eventually became its commander. Due in part to the impressive personality and charisma of Makhno, all Ukrainian anarchist detachments and peasant guerrilla bands in the region subsequently became known as ''Makhnovists'' ({{lang-ru|махновцы}}). These eventually came together in the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] (RIAU), also called the [[Black Guards|Black Army]] (because they fought under the [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]]). The RIAU battled against the [[White movement|Whites]] ([[counter-revolution]]aries) forces, Ukrainian nationalists, and various independent paramilitary formations that conducted [[Anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] [[pogrom]]s. The anarchist movement in Ukraine came to be referred to as the ''Black Army'', ''Makhnovism'' or pejoratively ''Makhnovshchina''.\n\nIn areas where they drove out opposing armies, villagers (and workers) sought to abolish [[capitalism]] and the state by organizing themselves into village [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and free councils. The land and factories were expropriated and put under nominal peasant and worker control by means of self-governing committees; however, town mayors and many officials were drawn directly from the ranks of Makhno's military and political leadership. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} \n\n==The Makhnovists and formation of the anarchist Black Army==\n{{Main|Free Territory (Ukraine)}}\n{{Anarchism sidebar |People}}\n{{Libertarian socialism |People}}\n[[Hetman]] [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]], head of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian State]], (considered by most historians{{Who|date=December 2009}} as a [[Puppet state|puppet]] regime) lost the support of the Central Powers (Germany and Austro-Hungary, which had armed his forces and installed him in power) after the collapse of the German western front. Unpopular among most southern Ukrainians, the Hetman saw his best forces evaporate, and was driven out of [[Kiev]] by the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directory]]. In March 1918, Makhno's forces and allied anarchist and guerrilla groups won victories against German, Austrian, and Ukrainian nationalist (the army of [[Symon Petlura]]) forces, and units of the [[White Movement|White Army]], capturing a lot of German and Austro-Hungarian arms. These victories over much larger enemy forces established Makhno's reputation as a military tactician; he became known as ''Batko'' (‘Father’) to his admirers.<ref name=\"RN173\"/>\n\nAt this point, the emphasis on military campaigns that Makhno had adopted in the previous year shifted to political concerns. The first ''Congress of the Confederation of Anarchists Groups''<!-- date and place? -->, under the name of ''[[Nabat]]'' (\"the Alarm Drum\"), issued five main principles: rejection of all political parties, rejection of all forms of dictatorships (including the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], viewed by Makhnovists and many anarchists of the day as a term synonymous with the dictatorship of the Bolshevik communist party), negation of any concept of a central state, rejection of a so-called \"transitional period\" necessitating a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat, and self-management of all workers through free local workers' councils (soviets). While the Bolsheviks argued that their concept of dictatorship of the proletariat meant precisely \"rule by workers' councils,\" the Makhnovist platform opposed the \"temporary\" Bolshevik measure of \"party dictatorship.\"  The ''Nabat'' was by no means a puppet of Mahkno and his supporters, from time to time criticizing the Black Army and its conduct in the war.\n\nIn 1918, after recruiting large numbers of Ukrainian peasants, as well as numbers of Jews, anarchists, ''naletchki'', and recruits arriving from other countries, Makhno formed the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]], otherwise known as the Anarchist Black Army. At its formation, the Black Army consisted of about 15,000 armed troops, including infantry and cavalry (both regular and irregular) brigades; artillery detachments were incorporated into each regiment. From November 1918 to June 1919, using the Black Army to secure its hold on power, the Makhnovists attempted to create an anarchist society in Ukraine, administered at the local level by autonomous peasants' and workers' councils.\n\nNew relationships and values were generated by this new social paradigm, which led Makhnovists to formalize the policy of free communities as the highest form of [[social justice]]. Education was organized on [[Francisco Ferrer]]'s principles, and the economy was based upon free exchange between rural and urban communities, from crop and cattle to manufactured products, according to the science proposed by [[Peter Kropotkin]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nMakhno called the Bolsheviks dictators and opposed the \"Cheka [secret police]... and similar compulsory authoritative and disciplinary institutions\" and called for \"[f]reedom of speech, press, assembly, unions and the like\".<ref name=\"RIAdeclaration\">[http://www.ditext.com/arshinov/appendix.html Declaration Of The Revolutionary Insurgent Army Of The Ukraine (Makhnovist)].

Azarov, ''Konttrazvedka: The Story of the Makhnovist Intelligence Service,'' (Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2008).</ref>\n\nThe Bolsheviks claimed that it would be impossible for a small, agricultural society to organize into an anarchist society so quickly. However, [[Eastern Ukraine]] had a large amount of coal mines, and was one of the most industrialised parts of the [[Russian Empire]].\n\n===Relations between the Makhnovists and Mennonite colonists===\nAs a revolutionary peasant leader Makhno has been called a \"colourful personality\"<ref>Yekelchyk 2007, p 80</ref> and his career \"legendary\".<ref>Subtelny 1988, p 360.</ref>  However, in the view of the German and [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonite]] communities in Ukraine, he was considered as an instigator of military ravages against innocent farmers and an \"inhuman monster whose path is literally drenched with blood.\"<ref>Dietrich Neufeld, ''Russian Dance of Death'', translated by Al Reimer, Winnipeg: [[Hyperion Press]], 1977, pp. 18–19.</ref>  He is consistently referred to as a terrorist or bandit in Mennonite literature. At the age of 11 Makhno began working as an ox drover on the Janzen estate in Silberfeld. Here he began to develop a hatred for the ruling classes. In his memoirs he writes: \"At this time I began to experience anger, envy and even hatred towards the landowner [Janzen] and especially towards his children – those young slackers who often strolled past me sleek and healthy, well-dressed, well-groomed and scented; while I was filthy, dressed in rags, barefoot, and reeked of manure from cleaning the calves' barn.\"<ref>Nestor Makhno, ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', trans. Malcolm Archibald and [[Will Firth]], Edmonton: Black Cat Press, 2011, pp. xvi</ref>  Makhno also worked at the Mennonite owned Kroeger plant in [[Gulyai-Polye]].\n\nThroughout the civil war, Mahkno and his troops raided many German and Mennonite colonies and estates in the [[Katerynoslav Oblast]]. The larger rural landholdings of [[Mennonites]] were prominent targets due to their wealth and proximity to Gulyai-Polye.<ref name=\"HU508–10\">{{cite book\n|author=Paul Robert Magocsi\n|title=A History of Ukraine\n|publisher=University of Toronto Press\n|location=\n|year=1996\n|pages= 508–10\n|isbn=0-8020-7820-6\n|oclc=\n|doi=\n}}</ref>  The Schönfeld colony, located adjacent to the [[Huliaipole]] area, was unique in that it consisted predominantly of Mennonite estate settlements across an expansive area. Mennonite colonies were targeted by Makhno because, as owners of prosperous farms and estates, they were considered ''[[kulak]]s'' – wealthy farmers that exploited the labour of the surrounding, mostly Ukrainian, peasantry. Ukrainians were traditionally hired by wealthy Mennonites as house servants and farmhands.\n\nWhile prohibited by their religion from serving in the [[Tsar's army]], many Mennonites had assisted the Russian war effort by performing national service in non-fighting roles, notably forestry and medical units. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution, as many Makhnovists had families who had suffered under the German-Austro-Hungarian occupation in 1918. Makhno's own brother, Emelian – a disabled war veteran – was murdered and his mother's home burned to the ground by the occupation.<ref>[[Alexandre Skirda]], ''Nestor Makhno-Anarchy's Cossack'', Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp. 55</ref>  The Mennonites themselves, having been stripped of their wealth and property during the revolution, embraced the occupation who promised to reestablish them as landowners. Some Mennonites accompanied punitive detachments against the peasantry, which greatly contributed to the growing bitterness between Mennonites and Ukrainians. In October 1918, [[Austro-Hungarian forces]] and \"German colonists\" burned down the pro-Makhnovist village of Bolshe-Mikholaivka and murdered many of its inhabitants. Makhno responded with a sustained campaign of retribution against German/Mennonite colonies and estates. At the same time Makhno voiced his opposition to the indiscriminate slaughter of the colonists and established \"ground rules\" for occupying the colonies.<ref>Nestor Makhno, ''The Ukrainian Revolution'', trans. Malcolm Archibald and Will Firth, Edmonton: Black Cat Press, pp. 107–136</ref>  Throughout 1918 a total of 96 Mennonites were killed in the Schönfeld-Brasol area.<ref name=\"old.mbconf.ca\">Peter Letkemann, \"Mennonite Victims of Revolution, Anarchy, Civil War, Disease and Famine, 1917–1923\" http://old.mbconf.ca/old/historian/98-06/feature-2.html</ref>  By the winter 1918–1919 most residents of the Schönfeld colony had fled to the relative safety of the Molotschna colony.\n\nWhile under German occupation, the Mennonites had been encouraged to form self-defence (''[[Selbstschutz]]'') units. Mennonite youth were trained and armed under the supervision of German officers. Breaking with nearly four centuries of [[pacifism]], tacit approval of the ''Selbstschutz'' was given by the Mennonite leadership at the Lichtenau Conference [June 30- July 2, 1918].<ref>J. B. Toews, ed., ''The Mennonites in Russia From 1917 to 1930: Selected Documents'' [[Winnipeg]], MB: Christian Press, pp. 395–448</ref>  Intended exclusively for the defence of the colony, with the arrival of General [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]]'s [[White movement|White]] [[Volunteer Army]] the ''Selbstschutz'' was gradually drawn into offensive operations against Makhno. Later in the civil war some Mennonites also formed ethnic battalions within the White Army. The ''Selbstschutz'' was initially successful in protecting their communities against Makhno's partisans but was overwhelmed once the anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army, which had entered Ukraine in February 1919.<ref name=\"nbuv.gov.ua\">Lawrence Klippenstein, [www.nbuv.gov.ua/portal/Soc_Gum/Pni/2007/07lktvao.pdf \"The Selbstschutz: A Mennonite Army in Ukraine, 1918–1919\"],</ref> The Mennonites of the Molotschna colony were under joint Makhnovist-Red occupation until the Whites broke through the southern front in May 1919.\n\nFollowing Makhno's devastating attack on Denikin's rearguard in September–October 1919, the Mennonite colonies found themselves once more under Makhnovist occupation. The year 1919 saw the greatest number of Mennonites killed – some 827 or 67% of all Mennonite civil war deaths. The great majority of these occurred between October and December. During this period major massacres occurred in Eichenfeld (Yazykovo), Blumenort ([[Molotschna]]), Steinfeld and Ebenfeld (Borozenko) and Münsterberg (Zagradovka) while under the administrative control of the Makhnovists. The [[Chortitza]] colony also suffered a great degree of death and robbery.<ref name=\"old.mbconf.ca\"/> Despite ongoing debate and investigation into Makhno's personal culpability for the massacres, there is currently no evidence he was present at or sanctioned these actions. According to the research of Peter Letkemann 3,336 Russian Mennonites, or three percent of their total population, died between 1914 and 1923.<ref name=\"old.mbconf.ca\"/> Ninety-six percent of these deaths occurred in Ukraine.<ref name=\"nbuv.gov.ua\"/>\n\n=== Allegations of antisemitism ===\nLike the [[White army]], the [[Ukrainian National Republic]] and forces loyal to the Bolsheviks, Makhno's forces were accused of conducting [[pogrom]]s against Jews in Ukraine during the civil war, based on the Bolshevik accounts of the war.<ref name=\"HU506-7\">{{cite book\n|author=Paul Robert Magocsi\n|title=A History of Ukraine\n|publisher=University of Toronto Press\n|location=\n|year=1996\n|pages=506–7\n|isbn=0-8020-7820-6\n|oclc=\n|doi=\n}}</ref>  However, these claims have never been proven. Anarchist [[Paul Avrich]] writes, \"Maknno's alleged anti-Semitism...Charges of Jew-baiting and of anti-Jewish pogroms have come from every quarter, left, right, and center. Without exception, however, they are based on hearsay, rumor, or intentional slander, and remain undocumented and unproved.\"<ref name=\"AP122\">{{cite book\n|author=Paul Avrich\n|title=Anarchist portraits\n|publisher=Princeton University Press\n|location=\n|year=1988\n|pages=122\n|isbn=0-691-00609-1\n|oclc=\n|doi=\n}}</ref>  Avrich notes that a considerable number of Jews took part in the Makhnovist anarchist movement. Some, like Vsevolod Mikhailovich Eikhenbaum, also known as \"[[Voline]]\",<ref name=\"Voline, 1947\">Voline, ''The Unknown Revolution, 1917–1921'', (1947)</ref><ref name=\"Arshinov, Peter 1923\">Arshinov, Peter, ''History of the Makhnovist Movement (1918–1921),'' (1923)</ref> and [[Baron Aron]] were intellectuals who served on the Cultural-Educational Commission, wrote his manifestos, and edited his journals, but the great majority fought in the ranks of the Anarchist Black Army, either in special detachments of Jewish artillery and infantry, or else within the regular anarchist army brigades alongside peasants and workers of Ukrainian, Russian, and other ethnic origins. Together they formed a significant part of Makhno's anarchist army.<ref name=\"Voline, 1947\"/><ref name=\"Arshinov, Peter 1923\"/>  Significantly, during the Russian civil war, the ''Merkaz'' or ''Central Committee of the Zionist Organization in Russia'' regularly reported on many armed groups committing ''pogroms'' against Jews in Russia, including the Whites, the Russian Ukrainian 'Green' nationalist [[Nikifor Grigoriev]] (later shot by Black Army troops on Makhno's orders) as well as Red Army forces, but did not accuse Makhno or the anarchist Black Army of directing pogroms or other attacks against Russian Jews.<ref>Tcherikover, M. (quoted by Voline), ''The Unknown Revolution'', New York: Free Life Editions (1975), p. 699: The Russian historian M. Tcherikover, himself a Jew, rejected all accusations that Makhno or forces under his direct command engaged in pogroms.</ref> According to Peter Kenez, “He was a self-educated man, committed to the teachings of Bakunin and Kropotkin, and he could not fairly be described as an anti-Semite. Makhno had Jewish comrades and friends; and like [[Symon Petliura]], he issued a proclamation forbidding pogroms.” Kenez goes on to claim (with no evidence, reason or source) that the anarchist leader could not or did not impose discipline on his soldiers. In the name of ‘class struggle’ his troops with particular enthusiasm robbed Jews of whatever they had.”<ref>''Pogroms: Anti-Jewish Violence in Modern Russian History. New York: Cambridge UP, 2004.</ref> This would be in the spirit of standards of behaviour which Makhno promoted for his troops, which called for war against \"the rich bourgeoisie of all nationalities\" be they Russian, Ukrainian or Jewish, as well as his explicit order not to beat or rob \"peaceful Jews\".<ref>David Footman, \"Civil War in Russia\". p. 275</ref>\n\n=== National issues ===\nWhile the bulk of Makhno's forces consisted of ethnic [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] peasants, he did not consider himself to be a Ukrainian nationalist, but rather an anarchist. His movement did put out a Ukrainian-language version of their newspaper and his wife Halyna Kuzmenko was a nationally-conscious Ukrainian. In emigration, Makhno came to believe that anarchists would only have a future in Ukraine if they Ukrainianized and he stated that he regretted that he was writing his memoirs in Russian and not in Ukrainian.<ref>Frank E. Sysyn, \"Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian Revolution,\" in Taras Hunczak, ed. ''The Ukraine 1917–1921: A Study in Revolution'' (Cambridge, Ma., 1977),pp.271–304</ref> Makhno viewed the revolution as an opportunity for ordinary Russians – particularly rural peasants  – to rid themselves of the overweening power of the central state through self-governing and autonomous peasant committees, protected by a people's army dedicated to anarchist principles of self-rule.\n\n===White and Red Army attacks===\n[[File:Командир Заднепровской дивизии П. Дыбенко и комбриг Н. Махно.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Red Army commander Pavel Dybenko and Nestor Makhno, 1919]]\nBolshevik hostility to Makhno and his anarchist army increased after the defection of 40,000 [[Red Army]] troops in [[Crimea]] to the Black Army in July 1918. The ''Nabat'' confederation was banned and the Third Congress (specifically [[Pavel Dybenko]]) declared the \"Makhnovschina\" (Ukrainian anarchists) outlaws and counter-revolutionaries. In response, the Anarchist Congress publicly questioned, \"[M]ight laws exist as made by few persons so-called revolutionaries, allowing these to declare the outlawing of an entire people which is more revolutionary than them?\" (Archinoff, The Makhnovist Movement). Relying largely on a September 1920 report from V. Ivanov, a Bolshevik delegate to Makhno's camp, Moscow justified its hostility to Makhno and the anarchists by claiming that:\n# Makhno's anarchist army and state had no free elections to the general command staff, with all commanders up to company commander appointed by Makhno and the Anarchist Revolutionary War Council;\n# Makhno had refused to provide food for Soviet railwaymen and telegraph operators (an attempt to capitalize on Makhno's view of railroads as capitalist frivolities);\n# there was a ‘special section’ in the Anarchist Revolutionary Military Council constitution that dealt with disobedience and desertion \"secretly and without mercy” (this objection was made in spite of the fact that ''Special Punitive Brigades'' of the Bolshevist Red Army had already been shooting deserters and members of their families since 1918);\n# that Makhno's forces had raided Red Army convoys for supplies, and had failed to pay for an armored car seized from Briansk;\n# that the ''Nabat'' was responsible for [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|deadly acts of terrorism]] in Russian cities (a reference to attempts on the lives of Bolshevik officials by independent anarchists and other dissident leftist groups unrelated to either Makhno or the ''Nabat'').\nThe Bolshevik press was not only silent on the subject of Moscow's continued refusal to send arms to the Black Army, but also failed to credit the Ukrainian anarchists' continued willingness to ship food supplies to the hungry urban residents of Bolshevik-held cities.\n\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] soon sent [[Lev Kamenev]] to Ukraine, who conducted a cordial interview with Makhno. After Kamenev's departure, Makhno claimed to have intercepted two Bolshevik messages, the first an order to the Red Army to attack the Makhnovists, the second ordering Makhno's assassination. Soon after the Fourth Congress, Trotsky sent an order to arrest every ''Nabat'' congress member. Pursued by White Army forces, Makhno and the Black Army responded by withdrawing further into the interior of Ukraine. In 1919, the Black Army suddenly turned eastwards in a full-scale offensive, surprising General Denikin's White forces and causing them to fall back. Within two weeks, Makhno and the Black Army had recaptured all of the southern Ukraine.\n\n[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|300px|Black Army commanders Simon Karetnik (3rd from the left), Nestor Makhno (center) and Fedor Shchus (1st right), 1919]]\nWhen nearly half<ref>{{Wayback |date=20091027112236 |url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/1346/MAKHNO1.htm |title=The Makhnovist Movement }}</ref> of Makhno's troops were struck by a typhus epidemic, Trotsky resumed hostilities; the [[Cheka]] sent two agents to assassinate Makhno in 1920, but they were captured and, after confessing, were executed. All through February 1920 the [[Free Territory]] – [[Makhnovist]] region – was inundated with Red troops, including the 42nd Rifle Division and the [[Latvian Riflemen|Latvian]] & [[Estonian Red Riflemen|Estonian]] Division – in total at least 20,000 soldiers.<ref>[[V. N. Litvinov]], An Unsolved Mystery – The \"Diary of Makhno's Wife\".</ref> [[Viktor Belash]] noted that even in the worst time for the revolutionary army, namely at the beginning of 1920, \"In the majority of cases rank-and-file [[Red Army]] soldiers were set free\". Of course Belash, as a colleague of Makhno's, was likely to idealize the punishment policies of the Batko. However, the facts bear witness that Makhno really did release \"in all four directions\" captured Red Army soldiers. This is what happened at the beginning of February 1920, when the insurgents disarmed the 10,000-strong Estonian Division in [[Huliaipole]].<ref>[[A.

While Makhno and the anarchists were willing to assist in ejecting Wrangel and White Army troops from southern Ukraine and [[Crimea]], they distrusted the Bolshevist government in Moscow and its motives. However, after the Bolshevik government agreed to a pardon of all anarchist prisoners throughout Russia, a formal treaty of alliance was signed.\n\nBy late 1920, Makhno had halted General Wrangel's White Army advance into Ukraine from the southwest, capturing 4,000 prisoners and stores of munitions, and preventing the White Army from gaining control of the all-important Ukrainian grain harvest. Eventually, after shifting forces from the Polish-Soviet campaign, [[Red Army]] units also participated in the southern campaign that pursued Wrangel and the remainder of his forces down the Crimean peninsula. To the end, Makhno and the anarchists maintained their main political structures, refusing demands to join the Red Army, to hold Bolshevik-supervised elections, or accept Bolshevik-appointed political commissars.<ref>[http://recollectionbooks.com/bleed/Encyclopedia/Makhno/MakhnoFromBleed.htm NESTOR MAKHNO Ukrainian anarchist general, fought both Reds & Whites (tyranny left to right).]</ref> The Red Army temporarily accepted these conditions, but within a few days ceased to provide the Makhnovists with basic supplies, such as cereals and coal.\n\nWhen General Wrangel's White Army forces were decisively defeated in November 1920, the Communists immediately turned on Makhno and the anarchists once again. After refusing a direct order by the Bolshevik government to disband his anarchist army, Makhno intercepted three messages from Lenin to [[Christian Rakovsky]], the head of the Bolshevik Ukrainian Soviet based in Kharkiv. Lenin's orders were to arrest all members of Makhno's organization and to try them as common criminals. On November 26 1920, less than two weeks after assisting Red Army forces to defeat Wrangel, Makhno's headquarters staff and many of his subordinate commanders were arrested at a Red Army planning conference to which they had been invited by Moscow, and executed. Makhno escaped, but was soon forced into retreat as the full weight of the Red Army and the Cheka's ''Special Punitive Brigades'' was brought to bear against not only the Makhnovists, but all anarchists, even their admirers and sympathizers.<ref>Voline, ''The Unknown Revolution'', pp. 693–697: Anyone in Ukraine who professed anarchist sympathies was marked for retribution. Voline recounts the example of M. Bogush, a Russian-born anarchist who had emigrated to America. He returned to Russia in 1921 after being expelled from the United States. Having heard a great deal about Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists, he left Kharkiv to see Makhno's birthplace at [[Huliaipole]]. After only a few hours, he returned to Kharkiv, where he was arrested by the order of the Cheka, and was shot in March 1921.</ref>\n\n== Exile ==\n{{Platformism sidebar |people}}\n[[File:Makhno 1925.jpg|left|thumb|Nestor Makhno circa 1925]]\nIn August 1921, after making raids all across Ukraine and constant battles with Red army forces many times larger and better equipped an exhausted Makhno was finally driven by [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s Ukrainian Red forces into exile with 77 of his men fleeing to [[Romania]], then [[Poland]], [[Danzig]], [[Berlin]] and finally to [[Paris]]. In 1926, he joined other [[Anarchism in France|Russian exiles in Paris]] as part of the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad (Группа Русских Анархистов Заграницей) who produced the monthly journal ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' (Дело Труда, The Cause of Labour). Makhno co-wrote and co-published the ''Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists'' (often referred to as the ''Organizational Platform of the [[Libertarian Communist]]s''), which put forward ideas on how anarchists should organize, based on the experiences of revolutionary Ukraine and the defeat by the Bolsheviks. The document was initially rejected by many anarchists, but today has a wide following. It remains controversial to this day, continuing to inspire some anarchists (notably the [[platformism]] tendency) because of the clarity and functionality of the structures it proposes, while drawing criticism from others (including, at the time of publication, Voline and [[Errico Malatesta|Malatesta]]) who viewed its implications as too rigid and hierarchical.\n\nAt the end of his life Makhno lived in Paris and worked as a [[carpenter]] and stage-hand at the [[Paris Opera]], at film-studios, and at the [[Renault]] factory. He died in Paris on July 6, 1934, from [[tuberculosis]]. He was cremated three days after his death, with five hundred people attending his funeral at the [[cimetière du Père-Lachaise]] in Paris. Makhno's widow and his daughter Yelena, were deported to Germany for forced labor during [[World War II]]. After the end of the war they were arrested by the [[NKVD]]. They were taken to [[Kiev]] for trial in 1946 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor. They lived in [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] after their release in 1953.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Makhnoparis.jpg|right|thumb|The memorial panel on Makhno's crematory vault in Père-Lachaise cemetery in Paris]]\n* [[Michael Moorcock]] – ''[[A Nomad of the Time Streams]]/The Nomad of the Air: volume 3: [[The Steel Tsar]]'' (1981) \nAn [[alternate history]]/[[steampunk]] novel where Makhno, still alive in 1941, is an important supporting character.\n* [[Lyube]] – \"Batko Makhno\" (single), 1989\nThe song was a smash hit, as its lyrics carried a suggestive theme of the times of [[Red Terror]].

He was portrayed by Odessa gangster and part-time actor Vladimir Kucherenko.<ref>{{cite web|title=Двадцать грабителей верхом на лошадях за считанные минуты разоружили охрану.|url=http://rus-history.com/kino.html}}</ref> The film gives an extremely negative portrayal of Makhno and the Makhnovists.\n\nNestor Makhno was in Savur Mogila (the sequel to Red Devils), played by Vladimir Stutyrin in 1926.\n\nNestor Makhno was in the 1943 epic Alexander Parkhomenko, played by famous Soviet actor Boris Chirkov.\n\nNestor Makhno was the main character in the 2006 Russian series Nine Lives of Nestor Makhno, a 12-part series dedicated to his life. \n[[File:Нестор Махно с дочерью, Париж.jpg|left|thumb|Nestor Makhno and his daughter Yelena in Paris]]\n[[File:Makhno in Huliaipole Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Nestor Makhno in the Huliaipole museum]]\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1919, Nestor Makhno married Agafya (aka Halyna) Kuzmenko, a former elementary schoolteacher (1892–1978), who became his aide. They had one daughter, Yelena. Halyna Kuzmenko personally carried out a death sentence of otaman [[Nikifor Grigoriev]], a subordinate commander who committed a series of anti-semitic [[pogrom]]s (according to other accounts, Grigoriev was killed by Chubenko, a member of Makhno's staff or Makhno himself).\n\nTwo of Makhno's brothers were his active supporters and aides before being captured in battle by the German occupation forces and executed by [[firing squad]].\n\nAccording to Paul Avrich, Makhno was a thoroughgoing anarchist and down-to-earth peasant.<ref name=\"AP112\"/> He rejected [[metaphysics|metaphysical systems]] and abstract social theorizing.<ref name=\"AP112\"/>\n\nVoline, one of his biggest supporters who was active for several months in the movement, reports that Makhno and his associates engaged in sexual mistreatment of women: \"Makhno and of many of his intimates – both commanders and others... let themselves indulge in shameful and even odious activities, going as far as orgies in which certain women were forced to participate.\"<ref>[http://www.ditext.com/voline/687.html Voline, The Unknown Revolution, 1917–1921, part II chapter 7]</ref> However, Voline's allegations against Makhno in regards to sexual violations of women has been disputed by some on the grounds that the allegations are unsubstantiated, do not stand up to eyewitness accounts of the punishment meted out to rapists by the Makhnovists, and were originally made by Voline in his book ''The Unknown Revolution'' which was first published in 1947, long after Makhno's death and following a bitter falling-out between Makhno and Voline.<ref>A.
