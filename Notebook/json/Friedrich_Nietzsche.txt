Nietzsche's first philological publications appeared soon after.\n\nIn 1865, Nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating to him the essay \"[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]\" in the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''.\n\nIn 1866, he read [[Friedrich Albert Lange]]'s ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus|History of Materialism]]''. Lange's descriptions of Kant's anti-materialistic philosophy, the rise of European [[Materialism]], Europe's increased concern with science, [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, and the general rebellion against tradition and authority intrigued Nietzsche greatly. The cultural environment encouraged him to expand his horizons beyond philology and continue his study of philosophy,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} although Nietzsche would ultimately argue the impossibility of an evolutionary explanation of the human aesthetic sense.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Pence |first=Charles H. |title=Nietzsche's aesthetic critique of Darwin |journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=165–90 |date=2011 |pmid=22288334 |url=http://www.academia.edu/759427/Nietzsches_Aesthetic_Critique_of_Darwin}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867, Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg. He was regarded as one of the finest riders among his fellow recruits, and his officers predicted that he would soon reach the rank of captain.

His inaugural lecture at the university was \"[[s:Homer and Classical Philology|Homer and Classical Philology]]\". Nietzsche also met [[Franz Overbeck]], a professor of [[theology]] who remained his friend throughout his life. [[Afrikan Spir]], a little-known Russian philosopher responsible for the 1873 ''Thought and Reality'', and Nietzsche's colleague the famed historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], whose lectures Nietzsche frequently attended, began to exercise significant influence on him during this time.<ref>Green, M.S. ''Nietzsche and the Transcendental Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2002.{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\nNietzsche had already met Richard Wagner in Leipzig in 1868 and later Wagner's wife, [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. Nietzsche admired both greatly and, during his time at Basel, he frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]. The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle and enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]. In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of \"The Genesis of the Tragic Idea\" as a birthday gift. In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''. However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work, in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach. In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety. In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense. Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche-1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nietzsche in c.&nbsp;1872.]]\nIn 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''. Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: \"David Strauss: the Confessor and the Writer\", \"On the Use and Abuse of History for Life\", \"Schopenhauer as Educator\" and \"Richard Wagner in Bayreuth\". These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''. The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner. During this time, in the circle of the Wagners, Nietzsche met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von Bülow]], and also began a friendship with [[Paul Rée]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings. However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him. He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of \"German culture\", which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms, as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public. All this contributed to Nietzsche's subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner.\n\nWith the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorisms]] ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''<ref>Safranski, Rüdiger (trans. Shelley Frisch). ''Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography'', p. 161. W. W. Norton & Company, 2003.\n\n\"This work had long been consigned to oblivion, but it had a lasting impact on Nietzsche. Section 18 of ''Human, All Too Human'' cited Spir, not by name, but by presenting a 'proposition by an outstanding logician' (2,38; HH I §18).\"</ref> and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. (Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, [[migraine]] headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical.)\n\n===Independent philosopher (1879–88)===\n{{anchor|independent philosopher|philosopher}}\nLiving off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities. He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St. Moritz]] in Switzerland. He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]. In 1881, when [[French occupation of Tunisia|France occupied Tunisia]], he planned to travel to [[Tunis]] to view Europe from the outside but later abandoned that idea, probably for health reasons.<ref>{{Citation |first=Stephan |last=Güntzel |url=http://www.hypernietzsche.org/navigate.php?sigle=sgunzel-4 |title=Nietzsche's Geophilosophy |page=85 |journal=Journal of Nietzsche Studies |volume=25 |publisher=The [[Pennsylvania State University Press]] |place=University Park (Penn State) |date=2003-10-15 |language=English, German}}; republished on HyperNietzsche.</ref> Nietzsche occasionally returned to Naumburg to visit his family, and, especially during this time, he and [[Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche|his sister]] had repeated periods of conflict and reconciliation.\n\nWhile in [[Genoa]], Nietzsche's failing eyesight prompted him to explore the use of [[typewriter]]s as a means of continuing to write. He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Nietzsche's Hansen Writing Ball|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device. In the end, a past student of his, Heinrich Köselitz or [[Heinrich Köselitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche. In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on. On at least one occasion on February 23, 1880, the usually broke Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul Rée.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him. In responding most enthusiastically to ''Zarathustra'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as \"superfluous\" people were in fact quite necessary. He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=415}}\n\nTo the end of his life, Gast and Overbeck remained consistently faithful friends. Malwida von Meysenbug remained like a motherly patron even outside the Wagner circle. Soon Nietzsche made contact with the music-critic [[Carl Fuchs]]. Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period. Beginning with ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' in 1878, Nietzsche published one book or major section of a book each year until 1888, his last year of writing; that year, he completed five.\n\n[[File:Nietzsche paul-ree lou-von-salome188.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lou Andreas-Salomé|Lou Salomé]], [[Paul Rée]] and Nietzsche, 1882.]]\nIn 1882, Nietzsche published the first part of ''[[The Gay Science]]''. That year he also met [[Lou Andreas Salomé]],<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.f-nietzsche.de/lou_e.htm |contribution=Nietzsche and Lou Andreas-Salomé |title=F Nietzsche |place=DE}}</ref> through Malwida von Meysenbug and Paul Rée. Nietzsche and Salomé spent the summer together in [[Tautenburg]] in [[Thuringia]], often with Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth as a chaperone. Nietzsche, however, regarded Salomé less as an equal partner than as a gifted student. Salomé reports that he asked her to marry him on three separate occasions and that she refused, though the reliability of her reports of events has come into question.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Nietzsche's relationship with Rée and Salomé broke up in the winter of 1882–83, partially because of intrigues conducted by Elisabeth. The trio had had plans to establish an educational commune in an abandoned monastery, but the idea was abandoned. Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salomé, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo, where he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days.\n\n[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|Nietzsche, 1882. Photo by Gustav Adolf Schultze]]\nBy 1882 Nietzsche was taking huge doses of opium but was still having trouble sleeping.{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=389}} In 1883, while staying in Nice, he was writing out his own prescriptions for the sedative [[chloral hydrate]], signing them \"Dr. Nietzsche\".{{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=453}}\n\nAfter severing his philosophical ties with [[Schopenhauer]] (who was long dead and never met Nietzsche) and his social ties with Wagner, Nietzsche had few remaining friends. Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness. Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it. His books remained largely unsold. In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]].\n\nIn 1883 he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university. The subsequent \"feelings of revenge and resentment\" embittered him: \"And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils.\"<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – August 1883 2|Letter to Peter Gast]]. August 1883.</ref>\n\nIn 1886 Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. Nietzsche saw his own writings as \"completely buried and unexhumeable in this anti-Semitic dump\" of Schmeitzner—associating the publisher with a movement that should be \"utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/corresp.htm#schmei |title=Correspondences |publisher=Thenietzschechannel.com |date=2000-02-01 |accessdate=2013-11-27}}</ref> He then printed ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' at his own expense. He also acquired the publication rights for his earlier works and over the next year issued second editions of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'', ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', and ''[[The Gay Science]]'' with new prefaces placing the body of his work in a more coherent perspective. Thereafter, he saw his work as completed for a time and hoped that soon a readership would develop. In fact, interest in Nietzsche's thought did increase at this time, if rather slowly and hardly perceptibly to him. During these years Nietzsche met [[Meta von Salis]], [[Carl Spitteler]], and [[Gottfried Keller]].\n\nIn 1886, his sister Elisabeth also married the [[antisemitism|antisemite]] [[Bernhard Förster]] and travelled to Paraguay to found [[Nueva Germania]], a \"Germanic\" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=online |contribution=Förster-Nietzsche, Elisabeth |url=http://www.search.eb.com.librarypx.lclark.edu/eb/article-9034925 |date=October 10, 2008}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2015}} Through correspondence, Nietzsche's relationship with Elisabeth continued through cycles of conflict and reconciliation, but they met again only after his collapse. He continued to have frequent and painful attacks of illness, which made prolonged work impossible.\n\nIn 1887 Nietzsche wrote the polemic ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]''. During the same year, he encountered the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], to whom he felt an immediate kinship.<ref>Nietzsche, Friedrich. [[s:Selected Letters of Friedrich Nietzsche#Nietzsche To Peter Gast – March, 1887|Letter to Peter Gast]]. March 1887.</ref> He also exchanged letters with [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Georg Brandes]]. Brandes, who had started to teach the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] in the 1870s, wrote to Nietzsche asking him to [[Kierkegaard and Nietzsche comparisons#Relation to Søren Kierkegaard|read Kierkegaard]], to which Nietzsche replied that he would come to Copenhagen and read Kierkegaard with him. However, before fulfilling this promise, he slipped too far into illness. In the beginning of 1888, Brandes delivered in Copenhagen one of the first lectures on Nietzsche's philosophy.\n\nAlthough Nietzsche had previously announced at the end of ''On The Genealogy of Morals'' a new work with the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]: Attempt at a [[transvaluation of all values|Revaluation of All Values]]'', he eventually seems to have abandoned this idea and instead used some of the draft passages to compose ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' and ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'' in 1888.<ref>{{Citation |first=Mazzino |last=Montinari |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |year=1974}} translated as {{Citation |language=German |year=1991 |title=Friedrich Nietzsche. Eine Einführung |place=Berlin-New York |publisher=De Gruyter}}; and {{Citation |language=French |title=Friedrich Nietzsche |publisher=[[PUF]] |year=2001}}</ref>\n\nHis health seemed to improve, and he spent the summer in high spirits. In the fall of 1888, his writings and letters began to reveal a higher estimation of his own status and \"fate\". He overestimated the increasing response to his writings, however, especially to the recent polemic, \"[[The Case of Wagner]]\". On his 44th birthday, after completing ''Twilight of the Idols'' and ''The Antichrist'', he decided to write the autobiography ''[[Ecce Homo (Nietzsche)|Ecce Homo]]''. In its preface—which suggests Nietzsche was well aware of the interpretive difficulties his work would generate—he declares, \"Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for someone else\".{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Preface, section 1}} In December, Nietzsche began a correspondence with [[August Strindberg]] and thought that, short of an international breakthrough, he would attempt to buy back his older writings from the publisher and have them translated into other European languages. Moreover, he planned the publication of the compilation ''[[Nietzsche Contra Wagner]]'' and of the poems that made up his collection ''Dionysian [[Dithyramb]]s''.\n\n===Psychological illness and death (1889–1900)===\n{{anchor|mental breakdown and death|breakdown|death}}\n[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche drawn by Hans Olde.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing by [[Hans Olde]] from the photographic series, ''The Ill Nietzsche'', late-1899.]]\n\nOn 3 January 1889, Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse. Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of [[Turin, Italy|Turin]]. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms up around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed to the ground.{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=67}}<ref>Anacleto Verrecchia, \"Nietzsche's Breakdown in Turin,\" in ''Nietzsche in Italy'', ed. Thomas Harrison (Stanford University: ANMA Libri, 1988) 105-12</ref>\n\nIn the following few days, Nietzsche sent short writings—known as the ''Wahnzettel'' (\"Madness Letters\")—to a number of friends including [[Cosima Wagner]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]]. Most of them were signed \"[[Dionysos]]\", though some were also signed \"der Gekreuzigte\" meaning \"the crucified one\". To his former colleague Burckhardt, Nietzsche wrote: \"I have had [[Caiaphas]] put in [[fetters]]. Also, last year I was crucified by the German doctors in a very drawn-out manner. Wilhelm, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], and all anti-Semites abolished.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Gerald |url=http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/ger/nilettersg.htm |publisher=The Nietzsche Channel |title=Nietzsches Briefe.

To the left is the rear façade of the [[Palazzo Carignano]].]]\nOn 6 January 1889, Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day, Overbeck received a similar letter and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck travelled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in [[Jena]] under the direction of [[Otto Binswanger]]. In January 1889, they proceeded with the planned release of ''Twilight of the Idols'', by that time already printed and bound. From November 1889 to February 1890, the art historian [[Julius Langbehn]] attempted to cure Nietzsche, claiming that the methods of the medical doctors were ineffective in treating Nietzsche's condition. Langbehn assumed progressively greater control of Nietzsche until his secretiveness discredited him. In March 1890, Franziska removed Nietzsche from the clinic and, in May 1890, brought him to her home in Naumburg. During this process Overbeck and Gast contemplated what to do with Nietzsche's unpublished works. In February, they ordered a fifty-copy private edition of ''Nietzsche contra Wagner'', but the publisher [[C. G. Naumann]] secretly printed one hundred. Overbeck and Gast decided to withhold publishing ''The Antichrist'' and ''Ecce Homo'' because of their more radical content. Nietzsche's reception and recognition enjoyed their first surge.{{Chronology citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 1893, Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from [[Nueva Germania]] in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She read and studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of them and their publication. Overbeck eventually suffered dismissal and Gast finally co-operated. After the death of Franziska in 1897, Nietzsche lived in [[Weimar]], where Elisabeth cared for him and allowed visitors, including [[Rudolf Steiner]] (who in 1895 had written one of the first books praising Nietzsche),<ref>{{Citation |first=Rudolf |last=Steiner |title=Friedrich Nietzsche, ein Kämpfer gegen seine Zeit |place=Weimar |year=1895}}</ref>{{Rp |needed=yes|date=April 2012}} to meet her uncommunicative brother.

While the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin|Hölderlin]] spoke of them before, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled \"On Music and Words\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_various/on_music_and_words_and_rhetoric.htm |title=On Music and words}}</ref> In it he asserted the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauerian]] judgment that music is a primary expression of the essence of everything. Secondarily derivative are [[Lyric poetry|lyrical poetry]] and [[drama]], which represent mere [[Phenomenon|phenomenal]] appearances of objects. In this way, [[tragedy]] is born from [[music]].\n\nNietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[Silenus#The wisdom of Silenus|wisdom of Silenus]]. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in ''The Birth of Tragedy'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian \"''Kunsttrieben''\" (\"artistic impulses\") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.historyguide.org/europe/dio_apollo.html |title=Nietzsche, Dionysus and Apollo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&pg=PA69&dq=Jim+Morrison+Apollonian+and+Dionysian |title=Ideas About Art}}</ref> Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the [[satyr]]. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of [[individuation|individuality]] and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.bachelorandmaster.com/creationofknowledge/apollonianism-dyonysianisism.html |title=The Apollonianism and Dionysiansism by Friedrich Nietzsche}}</ref> Both of these principles are meant to represent [[Cognition|cognitive]] states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.primordialtraditions.net/prime/Library/DionysusinNietzscheandGreekMyth.aspx |title=Dionysus in Nietzsche and Greek Myth}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions is apparent, in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make order (in the Apollonian sense) of his unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled in the end. Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all. Hamlet falls under this category – he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://issuu.com/mcc1289/docs/hamlet-and-nietzsche |title=Procrastination in Shakespeare's Hamlet}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://geoffklock.blogspot.com/2006/11/nietzsche-on-hamlet-commonplace-book.html |title=Nietzsche on Hamlet (Commonplace Book)}}</ref> For the audience of such drama, this tragedy allows them to sense an underlying essence, what Nietzsche called the ''Primordial Unity'', which revives Dionysian nature. He describes this primordial unity as the increase of strength, experience of fullness and plenitude bestowed by [[wikt:frenzy#Noun|frenzy]]. Frenzy acts as an intoxication, and is crucial for the [[Physiology|physiological]] condition that enables making of any art.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=The role of art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}</ref> Stimulated by this state, person's artistic will is enhanced:\n\n<blockquote>\"In this state one enriches everything out of one's own fullness: whatever one sees, whatever wills is seen swelled, [[wikt:taut#Adjective|taut]], strong, overloaded with strength. A man in this state transforms things until they mirror his power—until they are reflections of his perfection. This having to transform into perfection is—art.\"</blockquote>\n\nNietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its \"''Untergang''\" (literally \"going under\" or \"downward-way,\" meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc.). Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian. [[Socrates]] emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of [[myth]] and suffering to human knowledge. [[Plato]] continued with this path in his dialogues and modern world eventually inherited reason at the expense of artistic impulses that could be found only in the Apollonian and Dionysus dichotomy. This leads to his conclusion that European culture from the time of Socrates had always been only Apollonian and thus [[decadence|decadent]] and unhealthy.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.carnaval.com/prophecy/ |title=Dionysus versus Apollo}}</ref> He notes that whenever Apollonian culture dominates, the Dionysian lacks the structure to make a coherent art, and when Dionysian dominates, the Apollonian lacks the necessary passion.

He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass. The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche. \"A thousand goals have there been so far,\" says Zarathustra, \"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \"On The Thousand And One Goals\". The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical and cultural endeavor, as well as their political understanding. Weber for example, relies on Nietzsche's perspectivism by maintaining that objectivity is still possible—but only after a particular perspective, value, or end has been established.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.criticism.com/md/weber1.html |title=Max Weber's View of Objectivity in Social Science |first=Hoenisch |last=Steve}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S1518-44712006000200006&script=sci_arttext |title=Culture and perspectivism in Nietzsche's and Weber's view}}</ref>\n\nAmong his critique of traditional philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Plato]] in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', Nietzsche attacked ''[[thing in itself]]'' and ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' (''I think, therefore I am'') as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs based on naive acceptance of previous notions and [[fallacy|fallacies]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.monomorphic.org/wordpress/objective-and-subjective-reality-perspectivism/ |title=Objective and subjective reality; perspectivism}}</ref> Philosopher [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] puts Nietzsche in a high place in the history of philosophy.

For Nietzsche, a fundamental shift took place during human history from thinking in terms of ''good and bad'' toward ''good and evil''.\n\nThe initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations. Aristocratic values of good and bad coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower castes such as slaves. Nietzsche presents this \"master morality\" as the original system of morality—perhaps best associated with Homeric Greece. To be \"good\" was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc. To be \"bad\" was to be like the slaves the aristocracy ruled over: poor, weak, sick, pathetic—an object of pity or disgust rather than hatred.\n\n''Slave morality'' comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as \"meekness.\" The \"good man\" of master morality is precisely the \"evil man\" of slave morality, while the \"bad man\" is recast as the \"good man.\"\n\nNietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are ''[[motley]]''). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own \"inner law.\" A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: \"Become what you are.\"\n\nA long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality. However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvKRUSdUsnkC&pg=PA213&dq=Master+slave+morality |title=From Shakespeare to existentialism}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'', Nietzsche begins his \"Campaign against Morality\".{{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=187}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=M I}} He calls himself an \"immoralist\" and harshly criticizes the prominent moral philosophies of his day: [[Christianity]], [[Kantianism]], and [[utilitarianism]]. Nietzsche's concept \"[[God is dead]]\" applies to the doctrines of Christendom, though not to all other faiths: he claimed that [[Buddhism]] is a successful religion that he compliments for fostering critical thought.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} Still, Nietzsche saw his philosophy as a counter-movement to nihilism through appreciation of [[art]]:\n\n{{quote|text=Art as the single superior counterforce against all will to negation of life, art as the anti-Christian, anti-Buddhist, anti-Nihilist par excellence.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://jorbon.tripod.com/niet01.html |title=Art in Nietzsche's philosophy}}</ref>}}\n\nNietzsche claimed that the Christian faith as practised was not a proper representation of Jesus' teachings, as it forced people merely to believe in the way of Jesus but not to act as Jesus did, in particular his example of refusing to judge people, something that Christians had constantly done the opposite of.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=26}} He condemned institutionalized Christianity for emphasizing a morality of [[pity]] (''Mitleid''), which assumes an inherent illness in society:{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=27}}\n{{quote|text=Christianity is called the religion of ''pity''.

Walter Kaufmann, in ''The Portable Nietzsche'', 1977, pp. 572–3.</ref>}}\n\nIn ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' Nietzsche called the establishment of moral systems based on a dichotomy of [[good and evil]] a \"calamitous error\",{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888d |loc=Why I Am a Destiny, §3}} and wished to initiate a [[transvaluation of all values|re-evaluation]] of the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of the Judeo-Christian world.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |pp=4, 8, 18, 29, 37, 40, 51, 57, 59}} He indicates his desire to bring about a new, more naturalistic source of value in the vital impulses of life itself.\n\nWhile Nietzsche attacked the principles of [[Judaism]], he was not antisemitic: in his work ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]'', he explicitly condemns antisemitism, and points out that his attack on Judaism was not an attack on contemporary Jewish people but specifically an attack upon the ancient Jewish priesthood whom he claims [[antisemitic Christians]] paradoxically based their views upon.{{Sfn |Sedgwick |2009 |p=69}} An Israeli historian who performed a statistical analysis of everything Nietzsche wrote about Jews claims that cross references and context make clear that almost all (85%) negative comments are actually attacks on Christian doctrine or, sarcastically, on Richard Wagner.<ref>Zev Golan, \"Nietzsche: Anti- or Philo-Semite?

On the basis of it, most commentators<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA, USA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=0-8371-7404-X}}</ref> regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity. Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the Abrahamic God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years. The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose. Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]. In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism—the despair of meaninglessness. As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, \"If [[God]] as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself.\"{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}\n\nOne such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls ''passive nihilism'', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer's doctrine—which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western Buddhism#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]]—advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering. Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a \"will to nothingness\", whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world. This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:<ref>This \"will to nothingness\" is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life. See F. Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7</ref>\n\n{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist. According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos—an inconsistency on the part of the nihilists.|Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power'', section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}\n\nNietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has \"become conscious\" in him.<ref>F. Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]</ref> Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that \"I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!\"<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol. 13.</ref> According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement ''God is dead''.\n\n===Will to power===\n{{Main article|Will to power}}\nA basic element in Nietzsche's philosophical outlook is the ''[[will to power]]'' (''der Wille zur Macht''), which he maintained provides a basis for understanding human behavior—more so than competing explanations, such as the ones based on pressure for adaptation or survival.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, §14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world.\n\nIn presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,<ref>[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p. 121</ref> and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=§2}}\n\nRelated to his theory of the will to power, is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter—that, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power. At the core of his theory is a rejection of ''[[atomism]]''—the idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms). Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruđer Bošković]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces.<ref>Nietzsche comments in many notes about matter being a hypothesis drawn from the metaphysics of substance: G. Whitlock, \"Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story\", ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996, p. 207.</ref>{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as \"the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation\" revealing the will to power as \"the principle of the synthesis of forces.\"{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will. Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, §22}} Other scholars disagree that Nietzsche considered the material world to be a form of the will to power. Nietzsche thoroughly criticized metaphysics, and by including the will to power in the material world, he would simply be setting up a new metaphysics. Other than aphorism 36 in Beyond Good and Evil, where he raised a question regarding will to power as being in the material world, it was only in his notes (unpublished by himself), where he wrote about a metaphysical will to power. Nietzsche directed his landlord to burn those notes in 1888 when he left Sils Maria for the last time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/nie/summary/v031/31.1leddy.html |title=Project MUSE – Nietzsche's Mirror: The World as Will to Power (review) |doi=10.1353/nie.2006.0006 |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=2014-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===Eternal return===\n{{Main article|Eternal return}}\n\n''Eternal return'' (also known as ''eternal recurrence'') is a hypothetical concept that posits that the universe has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form for an infinite number of times across infinite time or space. It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies. Nietzsche first invokes the idea of eternal return in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter \"Of the Vision and the Riddle\" in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', among other places.{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176–80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially \"horrifying and paralyzing,\" and says that its burden is the \"heaviest weight\" imaginable (\"''das schwerste Gewicht''\").<ref>{{Citation |last=Kundera |first=Milan |title=The Unbearable Lightness of Being |year=1999 |page=5}}</ref> The wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life, a reaction to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s praise of denying the will‐to‐live. To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', \"love of fate\".<ref name=dudl>{{Cite book |last=Dudley |first=Will |title=Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom |year=2002 |page=201 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4dLeWFK6qp0C&pg=PA201}}</ref> As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: \"The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' \"<ref>See Heidegger ''Nietzsche.

Finally, \"(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion.\" Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology. Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153).

Zarathustra's gift of the overman is given to a mankind not aware of the problem to which the overman is the solution.\"{{Sfn |Lampert |1986 |p=18}} Zarathustra presents the overman as the creator of new values, and he appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. The overman does not follow morality of common people since it favors mediocrity but instead rises above the notion of [[good and evil]] and above the ''[[Herd behavior|herd]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://philosophy.lander.edu/ethics/notes-nietzsche.html |title=Philosophy 302: Ethics Nietzsche, \"Slave and Master Morality\"}}</ref> In this way Zarathustra proclaims his ultimate goal as the journey towards the state of overman. He wants a kind of spiritual evolution of self-awareness and overcoming of traditional views on morality and justice that stem from the [[superstition]] beliefs still deeply rooted or related to the notion of God and Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thus-spoke-zarathustra/study-guide/major-themes/ |title=Thus Spoke Zarathustra themes}}</ref>\n\nWhile interpretations of Nietzsche's overman vary wildly, here is one of his quotations from ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' (Prologue, §§3–4):\n\n{{quote|text=I teach you the overman. Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?... All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment. And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment. You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape... The overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth... Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman—a rope over an abyss ... what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.}}\n\nZarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being [[democracy]]), an alternative goal humanity might set for itself. The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm. This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://www.nietzschespirit.com/files/The_Most_Despicable_Man_is_Coming...the_Last_Man.html |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger}}</ref>\n\nSome have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made.\n\n===Critique of mass culture===\nFriedrich Nietzsche held a pessimistic view on modern society and culture. His views stand against the concept of popular culture. He believed the press and mass culture led to conformity and brought about mediocrity. Nietzsche saw a lack of progress, leading to the decline of the human species. According to Nietzsche, individuals needed to overcome this form of mass culture. He believed some people were able to become superior individuals through the use of will power. By rising above mass culture, society would produce higher, brighter and healthier human beings.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |title=Nietzsche's Critique of Mass Culture |journal=International Studies in Philosophy |year=1999 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=77–89 |doi=10.5840/intstudphil199931353 |url=http://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=intstudphil&id=intstudphil_1999_0031_0003_0077_0089&onlyautologin=true}}</ref>\n\n==Reading and influence==\n[[File:Nietzsche Archives in Weimar.jpg|thumb|The residence of Nietzsche's last three years, along with archive in [[Weimar]], Germany, which holds many of Nietzsche's papers.]]\n{{Main article|Library of Friedrich Nietzsche}}\nA trained philologist, Nietzsche had a thorough knowledge of [[Greek philosophy]].

However, Nietzsche referred to Kant as a \"moral fanatic\", Plato as \"boring\", Mill as a \"blockhead\", and of Spinoza he said: \"How much of personal timidity and vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray?\".{{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693–97}}\n\nNietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors. While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a \"lost link\" in the development of his thought. \"In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche.\"{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of \"flux\" and incessant change. His symbolism of the world as \"child play\" marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37–9}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all.{{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}\n\nIn his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer. Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was \"an emendation of that of Schopenhauer. The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong.
