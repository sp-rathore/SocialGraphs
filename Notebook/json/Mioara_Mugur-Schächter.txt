Her PhD thesis - of which the whole content had been elaborated beforehand in Bucharest and sent to [[Louis de Broglie]] - contains the first and very elaborated invalidation of von Neumann's famous proof asserting the impossibility of hidden parameters compatible with the quantum mechanical formalism. This work was published in a volume prefaced by [[Louis de Broglie]] and published in the collection \"Les grands problèmes des sciences\", Gauthiers Villars, Paris, 1964.Since that time, a professor of theoretical physics in France\n\n== Works ==\n:•\tThe mentioned invalidation has been incorporated to a Ph.D. thesis directed by Louis de Broglie and published by Gauthier Villars in 1964 (two years before Bell’s invalidation), in a small book prefaced by Louis de Broglie, titled ''Étude du caractère complet de la théorie quantique''.\n:•\tShe has invalidated the proof of Wigner’s theorem on the impossibility of a joint probability of position and momentum compatible with the formalism of quantum mechanics (The quantum mechanical one-system formalism, joint probabilities and locality, in Quantum Mechanics a half Century Later, J. L. Lopes and M. Paty, eds., Reidel, pp. 107-146, 1977 ; Study of Wigner’s Theorem on Joint Probabilities, Found. Phys., Vol. 9, pp. 389-404, 1979).\n:•\tShe has constructed an opacity functional of a statistic, with respect to the acting probability law.  This functional constitutes a mathematical unification between the theory of probabilities and Shannon’s theory of communication of information (Le concept nouveau de fonctionnelle d’opacité d’une statistique. Etude des relations entre la loi des grands nombres, l’entropie informationnelle et l’entropie statistique, Anns. de l’Inst. H.

Hadjissavas), Kybernetes, pp.189-193, Vol. 11(3), 1982).\n:•\tShe has explicated the specific structure of the quantum mechanical probabilities and of the logic of the quantum mechanical events (of which she contested a lattice structure) (Toward a Factually induced Spacetime Quantum Logic, Found. of  Phys., Vol. 22, No. 7, pp. 963-994, 1992; Quantum Probabilities, Komogorov probabilities, and Informational Probabilities, Int. J. of Theor. Phys., Vol. 33, No.1, pp. 53-90, 1994).\n:•\tSince 1982 she has never stopped developing a Method of Relativized Conceptualization Objectivity and Descriptional Relativities, Foundations of Science 7, pp. 73-180, 2002 (;<ref>[http://www.mugur-schachter.net/docsupload/publications/publications_doc5.pdf Objectivity and Descriptional Relativities, Foundations of Science 7, pp. 73-180, 2002]</ref> Quantum Mechanics versus a Method of Relativized Conceptualization, in Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, Cognition and Action, Proposals for a Formalized Epistemology, M.

According to the editor of \"Automates intelligents\" Jean-Paul Baquiast, this work embodies «a revolution in the way of representing the processes by which we acquire knowledge, and consequently, in the way of representing  “reality” (or the “object-entities-of knowledge”)».\n\nAccording to the terms of Mugur-Schächter, this method is \"a new discipline: a representation of the process of conceptualization rooted directly into the a-conceptual physical reality – far beneath languages – and the character of which is resolutely methodological and formalizing. The whole qualitative essence of the descriptions of microstates, wherefrom nowadays microphysics draws its remarkable powers, is incorporated in this method. Inside the framework of this method, the processes of conceptualization are represented by qualitative constructive algorithms, which exclude a priori any vagueness and illusory problems\".\n\nThe method of Relativized Conceptualization (as it is best exposed in ''Sur le tissage des connaissance'') leads to a unification between the MRC-(genetic and relativized) logic and the MRC concept of (genetic relativized) probabilities.\n\nThe method furthermore leads to an algorithm for constructing a relativized concept of a factual probability law (Mathematical Structures in Computer Science /June 2014 - Volume 24, Special Issue 03, Developments of the Concepts of Randomness, Statistic and Probability, Mioara Mugur-Schächter invited editor, Preface, article ''On the Concept of Probability'', organizer of a common final debate). \nThe general method of relativized conceptualization also elucidates where and how meaning is involved inside Shannon’s theory of communication of information ( <ref>Sur le tissage des connaissances chapter 6</ref>). And it allows yields a definition of relativized mathematical measures of complexity that preserve the involved semantic contents ( chapter 8).\n\nThe infra-quantum mechanics  [[arXiv:0903.4976v3]] (in French) offers a strictly qualitative description of microstates constructed quite independently of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics,  under – exclusively – the constraints imposed by: '''(a)''' the cognitive situation in which is placed a human being who wants to create knowledge concerning non-perceivable “microstates”, and '''(b)''' the general requirements of the human ways of conceptualizing. Those who know the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics can clearly discern the general features of the quantum mechanical algorithms inside the qualitative descriptional structure obtained in the above-mentioned way. But they will also discern features that are occulted by these algorithms, even though they are endowed with major semantic importance. \nThe epistemological/operational/methodological discipline called infra-quantum mechanics offers from now on ''a reference structure'' for a face-à-face with the quantum mechanical formalism, that is elaborated outside this formalism and permits to dissolve in one single block, in a mutually coherent way, -----all the problems of “interpretation” raised by the formalism since nearly 80 years. \n\nThe work titled \"Principles of a 2nd Quantum Mechanics ([[arXiv:1310.1728]] still in French only) effectively realizes the above-mentioned face-à-face.
