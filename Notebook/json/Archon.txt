As civic and religious leaders, Archons were responsible for organizing theatrical performances during festivals through playwrights and [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons).  It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem ἀρχ-, meaning \"to rule,\" derived from the same root as ''[[monarch]]. ''\n\n== Ancient Greece ==\n{{main|Eponymous archon}}\nIn [[ancient Greece]] the chief [[magistrate]] in various Greek city states was called ''[[Eponymous archon|Archon]]''.  The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging from \"club leader\" to \"master of the tables\" at ''[[syssitia]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nIn [[Athens]] a republican system of nine concurrent Archons evolved, led by three respective remits over the civic, military, and religious affairs of the state: the three office holders being known as the ''Eponymos archon'' (''Ἐπώνυμος ἄρχων''; the \"name\" ruler, who gave his name to the year in which he held office), the ''[[Polemarch]]'' (\"war ruler\"), and the ''Archon [[Basileus]]'' (\"king ruler\").<ref>Michael Rostovtseff, ''Greece'', passim.</ref> The six others were the ''Thesmothétai'', Judicial Officers.  Originally these offices were filled from the wealthier classes by elections every ten years. During this period the eponymous Archon was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for some civic religious arrangements, and for the supervision of some major trials in the law courts. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archōn Epōnymos. (Many ancient [[calendar]] systems did not number their years consecutively.)\n\nAfter 487 BC, the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by new class of generals known as ''[[strategoi|stratēgoí]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The ten ''stratēgoí'' (one per [[Phyle|tribe]]) were elected, and the office of Polemarch was rotated among them on a daily basis. The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties, and the titular headship over the ''strategoi''.  The archons were assisted by \"junior\" archons, called ''Thesmothétai'' (Θεσμοθέται \"Institutors\"). After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time. (See [[Archons of Athens]].)\n\nUnder the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays.  Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus.  The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the ''protagonist''), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the ''archon eponymos''. The archon eponymos remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\n==Byzantine Empire==\n[[Byzantine]] historians usually described foreign rulers as ''archontes''.<ref>Aksum: an African civilisation of late antiquity By Stuart C. Munro-Hay  Page 145 ISBN 0-7486-0209-7</ref> The rulers of the [[Bulgars]] themselves, along with their [[kanasubigi|own titles]], often bear the title ''archon placed by God'' in inscriptions in Greek.\n\nInside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'': [[Dalmatia]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. ''Archontes'' were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited areas (''[[sclaviniae]]'') under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, ''archontes'' are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an '''''archontia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχοντία}}).<ref name=\"ODB\">{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=160}}</ref> The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the [[mint (facility)|mint]] ({{lang|grc|ἄρχων τῆς χαραγῆς}}), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.<ref>{{citation | editor-first = Alexander | editor-last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | pages=160–161}}</ref>\n\nThe title of '''''megas archon''''' (\"grand archon\") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as \"grand prince\". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the [[Palaiologan period]], but did not have any specific functions.<ref>{{citation | first = Mark C. | last = Bartusis | title = The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204-1453 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8122-1620-2 | page=382}}</ref>\n\n==Patriarchate of Constantinople==\nFrom time to time, [[laity]] of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]] in communion with the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] have been granted the title of ''[[Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate|Archon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate]]'' to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]. This ''Archon'' status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary.\n\nAn Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] (at large).\n\nIt is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with [[human rights]] and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.\n\nAs it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Archon (gnosticism)]]\n*[[Arhat]]\n*[[Count]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (AKA ''Liddell and Scott''), ISBN 0-19-864226-1\n* ''The [[Oxford Companion to Classical Literature]]'', ISBN 0-19-866121-5.\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n[[Category:Positions of subnational authority]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek titles]]\n[[Category:Ancient Greek government]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of the Byzantine Empire]]", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Archon"}}}}
