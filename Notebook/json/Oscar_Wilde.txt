After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his [[epigrams]], his novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'', his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death.\n\nWilde's parents were successful [[Anglo-Irish]] Dublin intellectuals. Their son became fluent in French and German early in life. At university, Wilde read [[Literae Humaniores#Greats|Greats]]; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Dublin]], then at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Oxford]]. He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of [[aestheticism]], led by two of his tutors, [[Walter Pater]] and [[John Ruskin]]. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles.\n\nAs a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\", and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversation, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day.\n\nAt the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into his only novel, ''The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' (1891) in French in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to the absolute prohibition of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian London.\n\nAt the height of his fame and success, while his masterpiece, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), was still on stage in London, Wilde had [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|the Marquess of Queensberry]] prosecuted for [[Defamation|libel]]. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]. The charge carried a penalty of up to two years in prison. The trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]] with men. After two more trials he was convicted and imprisoned for two years' [[hard labour]].\n\nIn 1897, in prison, he wrote ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', which was published in 1905, a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. Upon his release he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life. He died destitute in Paris at the age of 46.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Wilde Family home on Merrion Square.jpg|thumb|Wilde Family home in Merrion Square|left]]\nOscar Wilde was born at 21 [[Westland Row]], Dublin (now home of the [[Oscar Wilde Centre]], Trinity College), the second of three children born to Sir [[William Wilde]] and [[Jane Wilde]], two years behind [[Willie Wilde|William (\"Willie\")]].

According to Fox's own testimony written by him years later in ''Donahoe's Magazine'' in 1905, Jane Wilde would visit his chapel in Glencree, Co Wicklow for Mass and would take her sons with her.  She then asked Father Fox to baptise her sons.<ref>Davis Coakley. The Importance of Being Irish. 1994. pp 113-14.</ref> \nFox described it in this way:\n\n<blockquote>\"I am not sure if she ever became a Catholic herself but it was not long before she asked me to instruct two of her children, one of them being the future erratic genius, Oscar Wilde. After a few weeks I baptized these two children, Lady Wilde herself being present on the occasion.\" </blockquote>\nIn addition to his children with his wife, Sir William Wilde was the father of three children born out of wedlock before his marriage: Henry Wilson, born in 1838, and Emily and Mary Wilde, born in 1847 and 1849, respectively, of different maternity to Henry. Sir William acknowledged paternity of his illegitimate children and provided for their education, but they were reared by his relatives rather than with his wife and legitimate children.<ref>Ellmann (1988:13)</ref>\n\nIn 1855, the family moved to No. 1 [[Merrion Square]], where Wilde's sister, Isola, was born in 1857. The Wildes' new home was larger and, with both his parents' sociality and success, it soon became a \"unique medical and cultural milieu\". Guests at their [[salon (gathering)|salon]] included [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Charles Lever]], [[George Petrie (artist)|George Petrie]], [[Isaac Butt]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[Samuel Ferguson]].<ref name=\"Coakley53\"/>\n\nUntil he was nine, Oscar Wilde was educated at home, where a French {{linktext|bonne}} and a German [[governess]] taught him their languages.<ref>Richard Ellmann: Oscar Wilde p 18</ref> He then attended [[Portora Royal School]] in [[Enniskillen]], County Fermanagh.<ref>Ellmann (1988:20)</ref> Until his early twenties, Wilde summered at the villa, Moytura House, his father built in [[Cong, County Mayo]].<ref>Sandulescu (1994:55–56)</ref> There the young Wilde and his brother Willie played with [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]].\n\nIsola died aged nine of meningitis.

Trinity, one of the leading classical schools, placed him with scholars such as [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell|R. Y. Tyrell]], [[Arthur Palmer (scholar)|Arthur Palmer]], [[Edward Dowden]] and his tutor, [[John Pentland Mahaffy|J. P. Mahaffy]] who inspired his interest in [[Greek literature]]. As a student Wilde worked with Mahaffy on the latter's book ''Social Life in Greece''.<ref>Sandulescu (1997:59)</ref> Wilde, despite later reservations, called Mahaffy \"my first and best teacher\" and \"the scholar who showed me how to love Greek things\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:26)</ref> For his part, Mahaffy boasted of having created Wilde; later, he named him \"the only blot on my tutorship\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:27)</ref>\n\nThe [[University Philosophical Society]] also provided an education, discussing intellectual and artistic subjects such as [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] weekly. Wilde quickly became an established member&nbsp;– the members' suggestion book for 1874 contains two pages of banter (sportingly) mocking Wilde's emergent aestheticism. He presented a paper entitled \"Aesthetic Morality\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:29)</ref> At Trinity, Wilde established himself as an outstanding student: he came first in his class in his first year, won a scholarship by competitive examination in his second, and then, in his finals, won the Berkeley Gold Medal, the University's highest academic award in Greek.<ref>Coakley (1994:154)</ref> He was encouraged to compete for a [[demyship]] to [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]&nbsp;– which he won easily, having already studied Greek for over nine years.\n\n===Magdalen College, Oxford===\nAt Magdalen, he read [[Greats]] from 1874 to 1878, and from there he applied to join the [[Oxford Union]], but failed to be elected.<ref>See pages 183–5 of Thomas Toughill's \"The Ripper Code\" (The History Press, 2008) which mention Toughill's research in the archives of the Oxford Union.

In 1877, Wilde was left speechless after an audience with [[Pope Pius IX|Pope Pius&nbsp;IX]] in Rome.<ref>Ellmann (1988:70)</ref> He eagerly read [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]]'s books, and became more serious in 1878, when he met the Reverend Sebastian Bowden, a priest in the [[Brompton Oratory]] who had received some high-profile converts. Neither his father, who threatened to cut off his funds, nor Mahaffy thought much of the plan; but mostly Wilde, the supreme individualist, balked at the last minute from pledging himself to any formal creed. On the appointed day of his baptism, Father Bowden received a bunch of altar lilies instead. Wilde retained a lifelong interest in Catholic theology and liturgy.<ref>Sandelsecu (1994:375–376)</ref>\n\nWhile at Magdalen College, Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the [[Aesthetic movement|aesthetic]] and [[decadent movement]]s. He wore his hair long, openly scorned \"manly\" sports though he occasionally boxed,<ref name=\"Ellmann 1988:39\"/> and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other ''objets d'art'', once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly, \"I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china.\"<ref name='Ellmann43'>Ellmann (1988:43–44)</ref> The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness.<ref name='Ellmann43'/> Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose.<ref>Breen (1977, 2000) pp22–23</ref> Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics.<ref>Ellmann (1988:44)</ref> By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth, and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being [[Rustication (academia)|rusticated]] for one term, when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof. Mahaffy.<ref>Ellmann (1988:78)</ref>\n\nWilde did not meet Walter Pater until his third year, but had been enthralled by his ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'', published during Wilde's final year in Trinity.<ref>Ellmann (1988:46)</ref> Pater argued that man's sensibility to beauty should be refined above all else, and that each moment should be felt to its fullest extent. Years later, in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'', Wilde called Pater's ''Studies...'' \"that book that has had such a strange influence over my life\".<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:735)</ref> He learned tracts of the book by heart, and carried it with him on travels in later years. Pater gave Wilde his sense of almost flippant devotion to art, though it was [[John Ruskin]] who gave him a purpose for it.<ref name=\"Ellmann95\">Ellmann (1988:95)</ref> Ruskin despaired at the self-validating aestheticism of Pater, arguing that the importance of art lies in its potential for the betterment of society. Ruskin admired beauty, but believed it must be allied with, and applied to, moral good. When Wilde eagerly attended Ruskin's lecture series ''The Aesthetic and Mathematic Schools of Art in Florence'', he learned about aesthetics as simply the non-mathematical elements of painting. Despite being given to neither early rising nor manual labour, Wilde volunteered for Ruskin's project to convert a swampy country lane into a smart road neatly edged with flowers.<ref name=\"Ellmann95\"/>\n\nWilde won the 1878 [[Newdigate Prize]] for his poem \"[[s:Ravenna|Ravenna]]\", which reflected on his visit there the year before, and he duly read it at [[Encaenia]].<ref>Ellmann (1988:93)</ref> In November 1878, he graduated with a [[First class honours|double first]] in his B.A. of Classical Moderations and [[Literae Humaniores]] (Greats).

He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive.<ref>Ellmann (1988:247–248)</ref> Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] was [[Parnell Commission|falsely accused of inciting murder]] Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the ''[[Daily Chronicle]]''.<ref name='Ellmann273'/>\n\nHis flair, having previously only been put into socialising, suited journalism and did not go unnoticed. With his youth nearly over, and a family to support, in mid-1887 Wilde became the editor of ''The Lady's World'' magazine, his name prominently appearing on the cover.<ref>Mason (1914:219)</ref> He promptly renamed it ''[[The Woman's World]]'' and raised its tone, adding serious articles on parenting, culture, and politics, keeping discussions of fashion and arts. Two pieces of fiction were usually included, one to be read to children, the other for the ladies themselves. Wilde worked hard to solicit good contributions from his wide artistic acquaintance, including those of Lady Wilde and his wife Constance, while his own \"Literary and Other Notes\" were themselves popular and amusing.<ref>Ellmann (1988:276)</ref>\n\nThe initial vigour and excitement he brought to the job began to fade as administration, commuting and office life became tedious.<ref>Clayworth (1997:91)</ref> At the same time as Wilde's interest flagged, the publishers became concerned anew about circulation: sales, at the relatively high price of one shilling, remained low.<ref>Clayworth (1997:95)</ref> Increasingly sending instructions to the magazine by letter, he began a new period of creative work and his own column appeared less regularly.<ref name=\"Mason202\">Mason (1914:202)</ref><ref>Letter to Arthur Fish; Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:404)</ref> In October 1889, Wilde had finally found his voice in prose and, at the end of the second volume, Wilde left ''The Woman's World''.<ref>Letter to Wemyss Reid, Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:413)</ref> The magazine outlasted him by one volume.<ref name=\"Mason202\" />\n\nIf Wilde's period at the helm of the magazine was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it played a pivotal role in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame.

In January 1889, ''The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue'' appeared in ''[[The Nineteenth Century]]'', and ''Pen, Pencil and Poison'', a satirical biography of [[Thomas Griffiths Wainewright]], in the ''[[Fortnightly Review]]'', edited by Wilde's friend [[Frank Harris]].<ref>Mason (1914:71)</ref> Two of Wilde's four writings on aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, ''bons mots'' and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.<ref>Raby (1997:98)</ref>\n\nWilde was concerned about the effect of moralising on art, he believed in art's redemptive, developmental powers: \"Art is individualism, and individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. There lies its immense value. For what it seeks is to disturb monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine.\"<ref name=soulofman>Wilde, O. ''The Complete Works of Oscar Wilde'', Collins.</ref> In his only political text, ''The Soul of Man Under Socialism'', he argued political conditions should establish this primacy, and concluded that the government most amenable to artists was no government at all. Wilde envisions a society where mechanisation has freed human effort from the burden of necessity, effort which can instead be expended on artistic creation. [[George Orwell]] summarised, \"In effect, the world will be populated by artists, each striving after perfection in the way that seems best to him.\"<ref>Orwell, George [http://www.geocities.jp/mickindex/orwell/orwell_ROW_en.html Review: The Soul of Man under Socialism by Oscar Wilde] ''[[The Observer]]'' 8 May 1948.

''Intentions'' packaged revisions of four essays: ''The Decay of Lying'', ''Pen, Pencil and Poison'', ''The Truth of Masks'' (first published 1885), and ''The Critic as Artist'' in two parts.<ref>Mason (1914:355-7)</ref> For Pearson the biographer, the essays and dialogues exhibit every aspect of Wilde's genius and character: wit, romancer, talker, lecturer, humanist and scholar and concludes that \"no other productions of his have as varied an appeal\".<ref>Pearson, H.

When Gray, who has a \"face like ivory and rose leaves\", sees his finished portrait, he breaks down. Distraught that his beauty will fade while the portrait stays beautiful, he inadvertently makes a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] in which only the painted image grows old while he stays beautiful and young. For Wilde, the purpose of art would be to guide life as if beauty alone were its object. As Gray's portrait allows him to escape the corporeal ravages of his hedonism, Wilde sought to juxtapose the beauty he saw in art with daily life.<ref name=\"Mendelshon\"/>\n\nReviewers immediately criticised the novel's decadence and homosexual allusions; ''[[The Daily Chronicle]]'' for example, called it \"unclean\", \"poisonous\", and \"heavy with the mephitic odours of moral and spiritual putrefaction\".<ref>Ross (2011:1')</ref> Wilde vigorously responded, writing to the editor of the ''Scots Observer'', in which he clarified his stance on ethics and aesthetics in art – \"If a work of art is rich and vital and complete, those who have artistic instincts will see its beauty and those to whom ethics appeal more strongly will see its moral lesson.\"<ref>Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:441)</ref><ref>See also: Holland/Hart-Davis (2000: 433,435,438,441,446)</ref> He nevertheless revised it extensively for book publication in 1891: six new chapters were added, some overtly decadent passages and homo-eroticism excised, and a preface was included consisting of twenty two epigrams, such as \"Books are well written, or badly written.

Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the ''salons littéraires'', including the famous ''mardis'' of [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], a renowned [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] poet of the time.<ref>Ellmann (1988:316)</ref> Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, ''[[Vera; or, The Nihilists]]'' and ''[[The Duchess of Padua]]'', had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of [[Salome]] filled his mind.<ref>Ellmann (1988:322)</ref> One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, ''[[Salome (play)|Salomé]]'', written rapidly and in French.<ref>Ellmann (1988:323)</ref>\n\nA tragedy, it tells the story of Salome, the stepdaughter of the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] [[Herod Antipas]], who, to her stepfather's dismay but [[Herodias|mother]]'s delight, requests the head of Jokanaan ([[John the Baptist]]) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the Dance of the Seven Veils.

''Lady Windermere's Fan'' was first performed on 20 February 1892 at St James's Theatre, packed with the cream of society. On the surface a witty comedy, there is subtle subversion underneath: \"it concludes with collusive concealment rather than collective disclosure\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:344)</ref> The audience, like Lady Windermere, are forced to soften harsh social codes in favour of a more nuanced view. The play was enormously popular, touring the country for months, but largely trashed by conservative critics.<ref>Ellmann (1988:347)</ref>\nIt was followed by ''A Woman of No Importance'' in 1893, another Victorian comedy, revolving around the spectre of illegitimate births, mistaken identities and late revelations.<ref>Ellmann (1980:360)</ref> Wilde was commissioned to write two more plays and ''An Ideal Husband'', written in 1894,<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilde | first = Oscar | title = An ideal husband.

Both are well dressed in suits.|<div class=\"center\">Wilde and [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] in 1893</div>]]\nIn mid-1891 [[Lionel Johnson]] introduced Wilde to [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], an undergraduate at Oxford at the time. Known to his family and friends as \"Bosie\", he was a handsome and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to £100 a week from his plays (his salary at ''The Woman's World'' had been £6), indulged Douglas's every whim: material, artistic or sexual.\n\nDouglas soon dragged Wilde into the Victorian underground of gay prostitution and Wilde was introduced to a series of young working-class male prostitutes from 1892 onwards by Alfred Taylor. These infrequent rendezvous usually took the same form: Wilde would meet the boy, offer him gifts, dine him privately and then take him to a hotel room. Unlike Wilde's idealised, pederastic relations with Ross, [[John Gray (poet)|John Gray]], and Douglas, all of whom remained part of his aesthetic circle, these consorts were uneducated and knew nothing of literature. Soon his public and private lives had become sharply divided; in ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'' he wrote to Douglas that \"It was like feasting with panthers; the danger was half the excitement... I did not know that when they were to strike at me it was to be at another's piping and at another's pay.\"<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000)</ref>\n\nDouglas and some Oxford friends founded a journal, ''The Chameleon'', to which Wilde \"sent a page of paradoxes originally destined for the ''Saturday Review''\".<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:702)</ref> \"[[s:Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young|Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young]]\" was to come under attack six months later at Wilde's trial, where he was forced to defend the magazine to which he had sent his work.<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:703)</ref> In any case, it became unique: ''The Chameleon'' was not published again.\n\nLord Alfred's father, the [[John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry|Marquess of Queensberry]], was known for his outspoken atheism, brutish manner and creation of the modern rules of boxing.<ref group=\"Notes\" name='d'>Queensberry's oldest son, [[Francis Douglas, Viscount Drumlanrig]], possibly had an intimate association with [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]], the Prime Minister to whom he was private secretary, which ended with Drumlanrig's death in an unexplained shooting accident. In any case the Marquess of Queensberry came to believe his sons had been corrupted by older homosexuals or, as he phrased it in a letter in the aftermath of Drumlanrig's death: \"Montgomerys, The Snob Queers like Rosebery and certainly Christian Hypocrite like Gladstone and the whole lot of you\". Ellmann (1988:402)</ref> Queensberry, who feuded regularly with his son, confronted Wilde and Lord Alfred about the nature of their relationship several times, but Wilde was able to mollify him. In June 1894, he called on Wilde at 16 Tite Street, without an appointment, and clarified his stance:\n\"I do not say that you are it, but you look it, and pose at it, which is just as bad. And if I catch you and my son again in any public restaurant I will thrash you\" to which Wilde responded: \"I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:421)</ref> His account in ''De Profundis'' was less triumphant: \"It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out\".<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:699–700)</ref><ref name=\"Ellmann396\">Ellmann (1988:396)</ref> Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had \"shown him the white feather\", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way.<ref name=\"Ellmann396\"/> Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.\n\n===''The Importance of Being Earnest''===\n{{Main article| The Importance of Being Earnest}}\n\nWilde's final play again returns to the theme of switched identities: the play's two protagonists engage in \"bunburying\" (the maintenance of alternative personas in the town and country) which allows them to escape Victorian social mores.<ref name='Mendelshon'>Mendelshon, Daniel; ''The Two Oscar Wildes'', [[New York Review of Books]], Volume 49, Number 15 · 10 October 2002</ref> ''Earnest'' is even lighter in tone than Wilde's earlier comedies. While their characters often rise to serious themes in moments of crisis, ''Earnest'' lacks the by-now stock Wildean characters: there is no \"woman with a past\", the principals are neither villainous nor cunning, simply idle cultivés, and the idealistic young women are not that innocent. Mostly set in drawing rooms and almost completely lacking in action or violence, ''Earnest'' lacks the self-conscious decadence found in ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' and ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''.<ref>Jackson, R. \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in Raby, P. (Ed.) (1997:166-7)</ref>\n\nThe play, now considered Wilde's [[chef d'oeuvre|masterpiece]], was rapidly written in Wilde's artistic maturity in late 1894.<ref>Ellmann (1988:398)</ref> It was first performed on 14 February 1895, at [[St James's Theatre]] in London, Wilde's second collaboration with [[George Alexander (actor)|George Alexander]], the actor-manager.

(Ed.) (1997:161)</ref> During rehearsal Alexander requested that Wilde shorten the play from four acts to three, which the author did. Premieres at St James's seemed like \"brilliant parties\", and the opening of ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' was no exception. [[Allan Aynesworth]] (who played Algy) recalled to [[Hesketh Pearson]], \"In my fifty-three years of acting, I never remember a greater triumph than [that] first night.\"<ref>Pearson (1946:257)</ref> ''Earnest's'' immediate reception as Wilde's best work to date finally crystallised his fame into a solid artistic reputation.<ref name='wheatcroft'>[[Geoffrey Wheatcroft|Wheatcroft, G.]] [http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/2003/05/wheatcroft.htm \"Not Green, Not Red, Not Pink\"] ''The Atlantic Monthly'', May 2003.</ref> ''The Importance of Being Earnest'' remains his most popular play.<ref>Jackson, R. \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" in Raby, P.

[[Merlin Holland]] concludes that \"what Queensberry almost certainly wrote was \"posing {{Sic|som|domite}}\", (Holland (2004:300))</ref> Wilde, encouraged by Douglas and against the advice of his friends, initiated a [[private prosecution]] against Queensberry for [[libel]], since the note amounted to a public accusation that Wilde had committed the crime of [[sodomy]].\n\nQueensberry was arrested on a charge of [[criminal libel]], a charge carrying a possible sentence of up to two years in prison ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/6-7/96/section/IV/enacted Libel Act of 1843]). Under the [[Libel Act 1843|Act]], Queensberry could avoid conviction for libel only by demonstrating that his accusation was in fact true, and furthermore that there was some \"public benefit\" to having made the accusation openly. Queensberry's lawyers thus hired private detectives to find evidence of Wilde's homosexual liaisons to prove the fact of the accusation. They decided on a strategy of portraying Wilde as a depraved older man who habitually enticed naive youths into a life of vicious homosexuality to demonstrate that there was some public interest in making the accusation openly, ostensibly to warn off other youths who might otherwise have become entrapped by Wilde.\n\nWilde's friends had advised him against the prosecution at a ''Saturday Review'' meeting at the [[Café Royal]] on 24 March 1895; [[Frank Harris]] warned him that \"they are going to prove sodomy against you\" and advised him to flee to France.{{sfn|Belford|2000|p=251}} Wilde and [[Lord Alfred Douglas|Douglas]] walked out in a huff, Wilde saying \"it is at such moments as these that one sees who are one's true friends\". The scene was witnessed by [[George Bernard Shaw]] who recalled it to [[Arthur Ransome]] a day or so before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 literary book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with [[Robbie Ross]] and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in [[De Profundis (letter)|''De Profundis'']]. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play ''[[The Dark Lady of the Sonnets]]''.<ref>''The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome'' pp 151–152 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) ISBN 0-224-01245-2</ref><ref>''The Life of Arthur Ransome'' by [[Hugh Brogan]] p85 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) ISBN 0-224-02010-2</ref>\n\nThe libel trial became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas began to appear in the press. A team of private detectives had directed Queensberry's lawyers, led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Edward Carson]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], to the world of the Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they too were accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.<ref>Ellmann (1988:415)</ref>\n[[File:Wildehouse.JPG|left|thumb|upright|alt=A semi-detached red-brick Georgian house, with a small blue plague on the wall.|No. 34 [[Tite Street]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], the Wilde family home from 1884 to his arrest in 1895.

The extent of the evidence massed against Wilde forced him to declare meekly, \"I am the prosecutor in this case\".<ref>Ellmann (1988:418)</ref> Wilde's lawyer, Sir [[Edward George Clarke]], opened the case by pre-emptively asking Wilde about two suggestive letters Wilde had written to Douglas, which the defence had in its possession. He characterised the first as a \"prose sonnet\" and admitted that the \"poetical language\" might seem strange to the court but claimed its intent was innocent. Wilde stated that the letters had been obtained by blackmailers who had attempted to extort money from him, but he had refused, suggesting they should take the £60 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|60|1895|r=-2}}}} today) offered, \"unusual for a prose piece of that length\". He claimed to regard the letters as works of art rather than something of which to be ashamed.<ref>Foldy (1997:3)</ref>\n\nCarson, a fellow Dubliner who had attended [[Trinity College, Dublin]] at the same time as Wilde, cross-examined Wilde on how he perceived the moral content of his works. Wilde replied with characteristic wit and flippancy, claiming that works of art are not capable of being moral or immoral but only well or poorly made, and that only \"brutes and illiterates,\" whose views on art \"are incalculably stupid\", would make such judgements about art. Carson, a leading barrister, diverged from the normal practice of asking [[closed question]]s. Carson pressed Wilde on each topic from every angle, squeezing out nuances of meaning from Wilde's answers, removing them from their aesthetic context and portraying Wilde as evasive and decadent. While Wilde won the most laughs from the court, Carson scored the most legal points.<ref>Foldy (1997:8)</ref> To undermine Wilde's credibility, and to justify Queensberry's description of Wilde as a \"posing...somdomite\", Carson drew from the witness an admission of his capacity for \"posing\", by demonstrating that he had lied about his age on oath. Playing on this, he returned to the topic throughout his cross-examination.<ref>{{cite book | last = Marjoribanks | first = Edward|authorlink=Edward Marjoribanks (Conservative politician) | title = Carson the Advocate | year = 1932 | publisher = Macmillan|location=London|page=213|oclc=679460|quote=Carson had again and again used the word \"pose\" with ironic emphasis.}}</ref>\n\nCarson then moved to the factual evidence and questioned Wilde about his acquaintances with younger, lower-class men. Wilde admitted being on a first-name basis and lavishing gifts upon them, but insisted that nothing untoward had occurred and that the men were merely good friends of his. Carson repeatedly pointed out the unusual nature of these relationships and insinuated that the men were prostitutes. Wilde replied that he did not believe in social barriers, and simply enjoyed the society of young men. Then Carson asked Wilde directly whether he had ever kissed a certain servant boy, Wilde responded, \"Oh, dear no. He was a particularly plain boy&nbsp;– unfortunately ugly&nbsp;– I pitied him for it.\"<ref name='Foldy17'>Foldy (1997:17)</ref> Carson pressed him on the answer, repeatedly asking why the boy's ugliness was relevant. Wilde hesitated, then for the first time became flustered: \"You sting me and insult me and try to unnerve me; and at times one says things flippantly when one ought to speak more seriously.\"<ref name='Foldy17'/>\n\nIn his opening speech for the defence, Carson announced that he had located several male prostitutes who were to testify that they had had sex with Wilde. On the advice of his lawyers, Wilde dropped the prosecution. Queensberry was found not guilty, as the court declared that his accusation that Wilde was \"posing as a Somdomite\" {{Sic}} was justified, \"true in substance and in fact.\"<ref>Foldy 1997:19</ref> Under the [[Libel Act 1843]], Queensberry's acquittal rendered Wilde legally liable for the considerable expenses Queensberry had incurred in his defence, which left Wilde bankrupt.\n\n===''Regina v. Wilde''===\nAfter Wilde left the court, a warrant for his arrest was applied for on charges of [[sodomy]] and [[Gross indecency between men|gross indecency]]. [[Robbie Ross]] found Wilde at the [[Cadogan Hotel]], [[Knightsbridge]], with [[Reginald Turner (writer)|Reginald Turner]]; both men advised Wilde to go at once to [[Dover]] and try to get a boat to France; his mother advised him to stay and fight. Wilde, lapsing into inaction, could only say, \"The train has gone. It's too late.\"<ref>Ellmann (1988:455)</ref> Wilde was arrested for \"gross indecency\" under Section 11 of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]], a term meaning homosexual acts not amounting to [[buggery]] (an offence under a separate statute).<ref>See [[Offences against the Person Act 1861#Unnatural offences|Offences Against the Person Act 1861, ss 61, 62]]</ref><ref>Hyde (1948:5)</ref> At Wilde's instruction, Ross and Wilde's butler forced their way into the bedroom and library of 16 Tite Street, packing some personal effects, manuscripts, and letters.<ref>Ellmann (1988:429)</ref> Wilde was then imprisoned on remand at [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway]] where he received daily visits from Douglas.\n[[File:oscarwildetrial.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt: A cartoon drawing of Wilde in a crowded courtroom|<div class=\"center\">Wilde in the dock, from ''[[The Illustrated Police News]]'', 4 May 1895</div>]]\n\nEvents moved quickly and his prosecution opened on 26 April 1895. Wilde pleaded [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]]. He had already begged Douglas to leave London for Paris, but Douglas complained bitterly, even wanting to give evidence; he was pressed to go and soon fled to the Hotel du Monde. Fearing persecution, [[Robbie Ross|Ross]] and many others also left the United Kingdom during this time. Under cross examination Wilde was at first hesitant, then spoke eloquently:\n\n{{quote|\n'''Charles Gill''' (prosecuting): What is \"[[the love that dare not speak its name]]\"?\n\n'''Wilde:''' \"The love that dare not speak its name\" in this century is such a great affection of an elder for a younger man as there was between David and Jonathan, such as Plato made the very basis of his philosophy, and such as you find in the sonnets of Michelangelo and Shakespeare. It is that deep spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect. It dictates and pervades great works of art, like those of Shakespeare and Michelangelo, and those two letters of mine, such as they are. It is in this century misunderstood, so much misunderstood that it may be described as \"the love that dare not speak its name,\" and on that account of it I am placed where I am now. It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it. It is intellectual, and it repeatedly exists between an older and a younger man, when the older man has intellect, and the younger man has all the joy, hope and glamour of life before him. That it should be so, the world does not understand. The world mocks at it, and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/wilde/sentence.html Transcript of Wilde's trial, published online by University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School]; See also Ellmann (1988:435)</ref>}}\n\nThis response was counter-productive in a legal sense as it only served to reinforce the charges of homosexual behaviour.\nThe trial ended with the jury unable to reach a verdict.

Prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, and, when out of their cells, were required to wear a cap with a thick veil so they would not be recognised by other prisoners.\n\nA few months later he was moved to [[HM Prison Wandsworth|Wandsworth Prison]] in London. Inmates there also followed the regimen of \"hard labour, hard fare and a hard bed\", which wore harshly on Wilde's delicate health.<ref>Ellmann (1988:474)</ref> In November he collapsed during chapel from illness and hunger.

The transfer itself was the lowest point of his incarceration, as a crowd jeered and spat at him on the railway platform.<ref name=\"Ellmann465\"/> He spent the remainder of his sentence there, addressed and identified only by \"C33\" – the occupant of the third cell on the third floor of C ward.\n[[File:Oscar Wilde Prison Cell Reading 2016.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Wilde's cell in Reading Gaol as it appears today]]\nAbout five months after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, [[Charles Thomas Wooldridge]], a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge was sentenced to death and returned to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 – the first hanging at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge's hanging, Wilde later wrote ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]''.\n\nWilde was not, at first, even allowed paper and pen but Haldane eventually succeeded in allowing access to books and writing materials.<ref>Ellmann (1988:475)</ref> Wilde requested, among others: the Bible in French; Italian and German grammars; some Ancient Greek texts, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]]'s new French novel about Christian redemption ''[[En route (novel)|En Route]]'', and essays by [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]] and Walter Pater.<ref>Ellmann (1988:477–478)</ref>\n\nBetween January and March 1897 Wilde wrote a 50,000-word letter to Douglas. He was not allowed to send it, but was permitted to take it with him upon release.<ref>Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:683)</ref> In reflective mode, Wilde coldly examines his career to date, how he had been a colourful agent provocateur in Victorian society, his art, like his paradoxes, seeking to subvert as well as sparkle. His own estimation of himself was: one who \"stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age\".<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:737–738)</ref> It was from these heights that his life with Douglas began, and Wilde examines that particularly closely, repudiating him for what Wilde finally sees as his arrogance and vanity: he had not forgotten Douglas's remark, when he was ill, \"When you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting.\"<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:700)</ref> Wilde blamed himself, though, for the ethical degradation of character that he allowed Douglas to bring about in him and took responsibility for his own fall, \"I am here for having tried to put your father in prison.\"<ref name ='wheatcroft'/> The first half concludes with Wilde forgiving Douglas, for his own sake as much as Douglas's. The second half of the letter traces Wilde's spiritual journey of redemption and fulfilment through his prison reading. He realised that his ordeal had filled his soul with the fruit of experience, however bitter it tasted at the time.\n<blockquote> ...I wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world... And so, indeed, I went out, and so I lived. My only mistake was that I confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sun-lit side of the garden, and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom.<ref>''De Profundis'', Holland/Hart-Davis, (2000:739)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWilde was released from prison on 18 May 1897 and sailed immediately for France. He would never return to Britain or to Ireland.\n\nOn his release, he gave the manuscript to Ross, who may or may not have carried out Wilde's instructions to send a copy to Douglas (who later denied having received it). ''[[De Profundis (letter)|De Profundis]]'' was partially published in 1905; its complete and correct publication first occurred in 1962 in ''[[The Letters of Oscar Wilde]]''.<ref group='Notes' name='f'>Ross published a version of the letter expurgated of all references to Douglas in 1905 with the title ''De Profundis'', expanding it slightly for an edition of Wilde's collected works in 1908, and then donated it to the [[British Museum]] on the understanding that it would not be made public until 1960. In 1949, Wilde's son [[Vyvyan Holland]] published it again, including parts formerly omitted, but relying on a faulty typescript bequeathed to him by Ross. Ross's typescript had contained several hundred errors, including typist's mistakes, Ross's 'improvements' and other inexplicable omissions.

See also: [http://www.oscarwildefanclub.com Oscar Wilde Fan Club Website]</ref>\n\nWilde spent mid-1897 with [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]] in the seaside village of [[Berneval-le-Grand]] in northern France, where he wrote ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol'', narrating the execution of [[Charles Thomas Wooldridge]], who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity; it moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners as a whole.<ref>Page in Sandulescu (1994:308)</ref> No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them, but rather the poem highlights the brutalisation of the punishment that all convicts share.

This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and families of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near [[Naples]] for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.<ref>Hyde (1948:308)</ref>\n\nWilde's final address was at the dingy Hôtel d'Alsace (now known as [[L'Hôtel]]), on rue des Beaux-Arts in [[Saint-Germain-des-Prés]], [[Paris]]. \"This poverty really breaks one's heart: it is so ''sale'' [filthy], so utterly depressing, so hopeless. Pray do what you can\" he wrote to his publisher.<ref>Letter to Leonard Smithers, Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:1092)</ref> He corrected and published ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', the proofs of which, according to Ellmann, show a man \"very much in command of himself and of the play\", but he refused to write anything else: \"I can write, but have lost the joy of writing\".<ref name='Ellmann527'>Ellmann (1988:527)</ref>\n\nHe wandered the boulevards alone, and spent what little money he had on alcohol.<ref>Ellmann (1988:528)</ref> A series of embarrassing encounters with English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit.

Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me as best he could while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|Extreme Unction]] to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the [[Holy Viaticum]]; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that I was about to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the [[Last rites|Last Sacraments]]... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the [[Act of Contrition|Acts of Contrition]], Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.<ref>Holland/Hart-Davis (2000:1223)</ref><ref group='Notes' name='g'>Robert Ross, in his letter to [[More Adey]] (dated 14 December 1900), described a similar scene: \"(Wilde) was conscious that people were in the room, and raised his hand when I asked him whether he understood.

Different opinions are given as to the cause of the meningitis: Richard Ellmann claimed it was [[syphilis|syphilitic]];<ref>Ellmann (1988:92)</ref> however, [[Merlin Holland]], Wilde's grandson, thought this to be a misconception, noting that Wilde's meningitis followed a surgical intervention, perhaps a [[mastoidectomy]]; Wilde's physicians, Dr Paul Cleiss and A'Court Tucker, reported that the condition stemmed from an old [[suppuration]] of the right ear (from the prison injury, see above) treated for several years (''une ancienne suppuration de l'oreille droite d'ailleurs en traitement depuis plusieurs années'') and made no allusion to syphilis.<ref>Ellmann (1988:582)</ref>\n\n===Burial===\n[[File:Tomb of Oscar Wilde, Père Lachaise cemetery, Paris, France.jpg|thumb|alt=A large rectangular granite tomb.

The earliest were memoirs by those who knew him: often they are personal or impressionistic accounts which can be good character sketches, but are sometimes factually unreliable.<ref>Raby (1997:6,10)</ref> [[Frank Harris]], his friend and editor, wrote a biography, ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Confessions'' (1916); though prone to exaggeration and sometimes factually inaccurate, it offers a good literary portrait of Wilde.<ref>Raby (1997:9)</ref> [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] wrote two books about his relationship with Wilde. ''Oscar Wilde and Myself'' (1914), largely ghost-written by [[T.W.H. Crosland]], vindictively reacted to Douglas's discovery that ''De Profundis'' was addressed to him and defensively tried to distance him from Wilde's scandalous reputation. Both authors later regretted their work.<ref>Raby (1997:8)</ref> Later, in ''Oscar Wilde: A Summing Up'' (1939) and his ''Autobiography'' he was more sympathetic to Wilde. Of Wilde's other close friends, [[Robert Sherard]], [[Robbie Ross|Robert Ross]], his literary executor; and [[Charles Ricketts]] variously published biographies, reminiscences or correspondence. The first more or less objective biography of Wilde came about when [[Hesketh Pearson]] wrote ''Oscar Wilde: His Life and Wit'' (1946).<ref>Raby (1997:5)</ref> In 1954 [[Vyvyan Holland]] published his memoir ''Son of Oscar Wilde'', which recounts the difficulties Wilde's wife and children faced after his imprisonment.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820321-1,00.html | title = Great Britain: A Life of Concealment |work=Time |date=27 September 1954 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> It was revised and updated by [[Merlin Holland]] in 1989.\n\n''Oscar Wilde, a critical study'' by [[Arthur Ransome]] was published in 1912. The book only briefly mentioned Wilde's life, but subsequently Ransome (and The Times Book Club) were sued for libel by [[Lord Alfred Douglas]]. The trial in April 1913 was in a way a re-run of the trial(s) of Oscar Wilde. The trial resulted from Douglas's rivalry with [[Robbie Ross]] for Wilde (and his need of money). Douglas lost; [[De Profundis (letter)|''De Profundis'']] which was read in part at the trial disproved his claims (Ross had shown Ransome the full text of it).<ref>''The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome'' pp 146–154 (1976, Jonathan Cape, London) ISBN 0-224-01245-2</ref><ref>''The Life of Arthur Ransome'' by [[Hugh Brogan]] pp 77–90 (1984, Jonathan Cape, London) ISBN 0-224-02010-2</ref><ref>''The Last Englishman'' by Roland Chambers pp 61–69 (2009, Faber and Faber, London) ISBN 978-0-571-22261-2</ref>\n\nWilde's life was still waiting for independent, true scholarship when [[Richard Ellmann]] began researching his 1987 biography ''Oscar Wilde'', for which he posthumously won a National (USA) Book Critics Circle Award in 1988<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/ | publisher = National Book Critics Circle | title = All Past National Book Critics Circle Award Winners and Finalists |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> and a [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Biography-or-Autobiography | title = Autobiography or Biography | publisher = The Pulitzer Prizes |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> The book was the basis for the 1997 film ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]'', directed by [[Brian Gilbert (director)|Brian Gilbert]] and starring [[Stephen Fry]] as the title character.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980612/REVIEWS/806120305/1023 | title = Wilde |date=12 June 1998 |authorlink=Roger Ebert | last = Ebert | first = Roger |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nNeil McKenna's 2003 biography, ''The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde,'' offers an exploration of Wilde's sexuality.
