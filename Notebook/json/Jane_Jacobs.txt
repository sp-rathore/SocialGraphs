Her influential book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' (1961) argued that [[urban renewal]] did not respect the needs of most city-dwellers. The book also introduced [[sociological]] concepts such as \"eyes on the street\" and \"[[social capital]]\".<ref name=\"DMartin\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/books/25cnd-jacobs.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 |title=Jane Jacobs, Urban Activist, Is Dead at 89 |author=Douglas Martin|date=April 26, 2006|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Death and Life of Great American Cities |last=Jacobs |first=Jane |page=138 |quote=\"If self-government in the place is to work, underlying any float of population must be a continuity of people who have forged neighborhood networks.

She was instrumental in the eventual cancellation of the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]], which would have passed directly through [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] and [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]], and was arrested in 1968 for inciting a crowd at a public hearing on the project. After moving to Toronto in 1968, she joined the opposition to the [[Spadina Expressway]] and the associated [[Cancelled expressways in Toronto|network of expressways in Toronto]] planned and under construction.\n\nAs a mother and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of [[urban planning]], Jacobs endured scorn from established figures. She did not have a [[college degree]] or any formal training in urban planning, and was criticized for lacking such credentials and being imprecise. She was also accused of inattention to racial inequality, and her concept of \"unslumming\" has been compared with [[gentrification]].\n\n==Early years ==\nJacobs was born '''Jane Butzner''' in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], the daughter of John Decker Butzner, a doctor, and Bess Robison Butzner, a former teacher and nurse. They were a Protestant family in a heavily Roman Catholic town.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 9.</ref> Her brother, [[John Decker Butzner, Jr.]], served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. After graduating from [[Scranton School District (Pennsylvania)|Scranton High School]], she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the women's page editor at the ''[[Scranton Tribune]]''.\n\n===New York City===\nIn 1935, during the [[Great Depression]], she moved to New York City with her sister Betty.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 15–16.</ref> Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]], which did not conform to the city's [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|grid structure]]. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 20–21.</ref><ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 3–5.</ref>\n\nDuring her first several years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs, working mainly as a [[stenographer]] and [[freelance writer]], often writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \"… gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\" Her first job was for a trade magazine, first as a secretary, then as an editor. She sold articles to the ''Sunday Herald Tribune'', ''Cue'' magazine, and ''Vogue''.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 22–23.</ref>\n\nShe studied at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]] for two years, taking courses in geology, [[zoology]], law, [[political science]], and economics.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 23–24.</ref> About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:\n\n<blockquote>For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ideas that Matter: The Worlds of Jane Jacobs|editor=Allen, Max (ed)|publisher=Ginger Press|date=1997-10-01\n|isbn=0-921773-44-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nAfter attending Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, Butzner found a job at ''Iron Age'' magazine. A 1943 article on economic decline in Scranton was well-publicized and led the [[Murray Corporation]] to locate a warplane factory there. Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the [[War Production Board]] to support more operations in Scranton.<ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 10.</ref> Experiencing discrimination at ''Iron Age'', she also advocated for [[equal pay for women]] and for workers' right to unionize.<ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 11.</ref>\n\n===''Amerika''===\nShe became a feature writer for the [[Office of War Information]], and then a reporter for ''[[Amerika (magazine)|Amerika]]'', a publication of the U.S. State Department.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/708496/_The_Unknown_Jane_Jacobs_Reconsidering_Jane_Jacobs_Planners_Press_2011_|title=\"The Unknown Jane Jacobs,\" Reconsidering Jane Jacobs (Planners Press, 2011)|author=Peter Laurence|publisher=}}</ref> While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for [[Grumman]]. Butzner and Jacobs married in 1944. Together they had two sons, James and Ned, and a daughter, Burgin. They bought a three-story building at 555 [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson St]]. Jane continued to write for ''Amerika'' after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 25–27.</ref>\n\nThe Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing [[suburbs]] as \"parasitic\", choosing instead to remain in Greenwich Village.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 29–30. \"The suburbs did not appeal to the Jacobs family. 'Suburbs are perfectly valid places to want to live, but they are inherently parasitic, economically and socially, too, because they live off the answers found in cities,' Jacobs would tell a reporter for ''Madmoiselle'' magazine in October 1962.\"</ref> They renovated their new house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.<ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 14.</ref>\n\nWorking for the State Department during [[McCarthyism]], Jacobs received a questionnaire regarding her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the [[Federal Workers Union]] because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of [[Saul Alinsky]]; therefore she was under suspicion.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 30–31.</ref><ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), p. 16.</ref> On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered a now-famous response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the [[United States Department of State]]. In her foreword to her answer, she said:\n\n<blockquote>The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe …<ref name=\"Allen, p. 170\">Allen, pg. 170</ref></blockquote>\n\n===''Architectural Forum''===\nJacobs left ''Amerika'' in 1952 when it announced that it would relocate to Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/708475/_The_Death_and_Life_of_Urban_Design_Jane_Jacobs_the_Rockefeller_Foundation_and_the_New_Research_in_Urbanism_1955-1965_Journal_of_Urban_Design_2006|title=\"The Death and Life of Urban Design: Jane Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New Research in Urbanism, 1955-1965,\" Journal of Urban Design, 2006|author=Peter Laurence|publisher=}}</ref> She found a well-paying job at ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', published by [[Henry Luce]] of [[Time Inc.]]<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 33.</ref> After early success on the job, Jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and \"[[urban blight]]\".<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 34.</ref> In 1954, she was assigned to cover a development in Philadelphia designed by [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Bacon]]. Although her editors expected a positive story, Jacobs criticized Bacon's project, reacting against the apparent lack of care shown for the poor [[African American]]s who were directly affected. When Bacon showed Jacobs examples of undeveloped and developed blocks, she was upset to find that \"development\" seemed to end active community life on the street.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 39–40.\"'...I said, \"Where are the people?\" [Bacon] didn't answer.

All the hyped new projects that planners and architects were building in the cities, she told them, bore no relation to what people actually needed.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Jacobs met William Kirk, an Episcopal minister who worked in [[East Harlem]]. Kirk came to the ''Architectural Forum'' offices to describe the impact that \"revitalization\" had on East Harlem, and he introduced Jacobs to the neighborhood.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 43–49.</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Jacobs delivered a lecture at Harvard University, standing in for [[Douglas Haskell]] of ''Architectural Forum''.<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/> She addressed leading architects, urban planners, and intellectuals (including [[Lewis Mumford]]), speaking on the topic of East Harlem. She urged this audience to \"respect – in the deepest sense – strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order.\" Contrary to her expectations, the talk was received with enthusiasm, but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners, real estate owners, and developers.<ref name=\"Flint, 2009 pp. 24\">Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 24–26.</ref><ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 57–59.</ref> ''Architectural Forum'' printed the speech that year, along with photos of East Harlem.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 60.</ref>\n\n===Rockefeller Foundation and ''Death and Life of Great American Cities''===\nAfter reading the text of her Harvard speech, [[William H. Whyte]] invited Jacobs to write a piece for ''Fortune'' magazine.

Lynch]]'s ''Image of the City''.<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/> In May 1958, Gilpatric invited Jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals.<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/> Later that year, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded a grant to Jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the US. (From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the foundation's Humanities Division sponsored an \"Urban Design Studies\" research program, of which Jacobs was the best known grantee.)<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/> Gilpatric encouraged Jacobs to \"explor[e] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life, including cultural and humane value.\"<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/> Affiliating with [[The New School]] (then called The New School for Social Research), she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts. In 1961, Random House published the product of her research: ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]''.\n\n''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' remains one of the most influential books in the history of American city planning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gratz|first1=Roberta Brandes|title=The Genius of Jane Jacobs|journal=The Nation|date=July 4, 1026|volume=303|issue=1|pages=16-17|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/the-genius-of-jane-jacobs-who-changed-the-way-we-think-about-cities/|accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref> It introduces terms like \"[[social capital]]\", \"mixed primary uses\", and \"eyes on the street\", which became popular in urban design, sociology, and other fields.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 76.</ref> Jacobs painted a devastating picture of the entire profession of city planning, labeling it a [[pseudoscience]]. This led to angry responses from various rich and powerful men. Jacobs was criticized as a \"militant dame\" and a \"housewife\": an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 83–90.</ref> Her book was also criticized from the left for leaving out race and accepting [[gentrification]].<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 135–36.</ref>\n\nIn 1962 she gave up her position at ''Architectural Forum'' to become a full-time author and mother.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 119.</ref> In addition to her local politics, she was a notable [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|opponent of the Vietnam War]], and [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|marched on the Pentagon]] in October 1967.<ref name=\"Alexiou, 2006 p. 149\">Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 149.</ref> She criticized the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as a disaster for Manhattan's waterfront.<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), p. 78.</ref>\n\n===Struggle for Greenwich Village===\n[[File:Washington Square Park 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jacobs fought to prevent [[Washington Square Park]], pictured, from being demolished for a highway]]\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, her own home neighborhood of Greenwich Village was being transformed by developers, the expansion of [[New York University]] (NYU), and by the [[urban renewal]] plans of [[Robert Moses]]. Moses—who had already forced through the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]] and other roadways against neighborhood opposition—envisioned a freeway, referred to as the [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] or \"LOMEX\", directly through [[Washington Square Park]]. His plan, funded as \"slum clearance\" by Title I of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises. The plan forced 132 families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses—the result was [[Washington Square Village]].<ref>Alexiou, ''Jane Jacobs'' (2006), pp. 50–52.</ref>\n\nJacobs chaired the [[Joint Committee to Stop the Lower Manhattan Expressway]] (a.k.a. Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square to Traffic, and other names), which recruited such members as [[Margaret Mead]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Charles Abrams]], and [[William H. Whyte]].<ref name=\"Flint, 2009 pp. 24\"/> Papers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' were sympathetic to Moses, while the newly created ''[[Village Voice]]'' covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway.<ref>Flint, ''Wrestling with Moses'' (2009), pp. 83–84.</ref> The Committee succeeded in blocking the project.

A frequent theme of her work was to ask whether we are building cities for people or for cars. She was arrested twice during demonstrations.<ref name=\"Allen, p. 170\"/> She also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the [[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]] neighborhood, a [[housing project]] regarded as a major success.

Jacobs was an advocate of a [[Proposal for the Province of Toronto|Province of Toronto]] to separate the city proper from Ontario. Jacobs said, \"Cities, to thrive in the 21st century, must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} <!-- Note: the 16 March 2010 article \"Should Toronto go it alone?\" in the Toronto Star is not an acceptable source, as the author may have obtained the quotation from this WP article -->\n\nShe was selected to be an officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on [[urban development]]. The Community and Urban Sociology section of the American Sociological Association awarded her its Outstanding Lifetime Contribution award in 2002. In 1997, the City of Toronto sponsored a conference titled \"Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter\", which led to a book by the same name. At the end of the conference, the ''Jane Jacobs Prize'' was created. It includes an annual stipend of $5,000 for three years to be given to \"celebrate Toronto's original, unsung heroes – by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city’s vitality\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ideasthatmatter.com/people/jj-prize.html|title=The Jane Jacobs Prize|publisher=Ideas that Matter|accessdate=2006-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jane Jacobs and SBB.jpg|thumb|left|Jacobs with [[Ecotrust]] foreman Spencer Beebe in [[Portland, Oregon]], 2004]]\nJacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates.

She backed an ecologist, [[Tooker Gomberg]], who lost Toronto's 2000 mayoralty race, and was an adviser to [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller's]] successful mayoral campaign in 2003, at a time when he was seen as a [[wikt:longshot|longshot]].

You were the one who stood up to the federal bulldozers and the urban renewal people and said they were destroying the lifeblood of these cities. Is that what it will be?\n\n'''Jacobs''': No. If I were to be remembered as a really important thinker of the century, the most important thing I've contributed is my discussion of what makes economic expansion happen. This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.\n\nExpansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.\n\nI've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote ''The Economy of Cities'', I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.\n\n'''''Reason''''': It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.\n\n'''Jacobs''': That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in ''The Nature of Economies''. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export. It continues being used in a community, just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place.|author=Jane Jacobs|source=\"City Views: Urban studies legend Jane Jacobs on gentrification, the New Urbanism, and her legacy\", ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', June 2001, Interviewer: Bill Steigerwald}}\n\nWhile Jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory, it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive impact.

Jacobs's and Newman's work would go on to impact American housing policy through the [[HOPE VI]] Program, an effort by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by Jacobs, and to replace them with low-rise, [[mixed-income housing]].\n\nThrough her life, she fought to alter the way in which city development was approached. By arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems, she advocated ideas such as \"mixed use\" development and bottom-up planning.

For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as \"guarantors of social diversity\" (Klemek, 2011:76). That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs’ planning ideas.<ref>Ouroussoff, N (2006) ‘Outgrowing Jane Jacobs and Her New York’, April 30, 2006, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/weekinreview/30jacobs.html The New York Times]</ref> But her concepts have also been criticised more broadly. For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as \"universal\",<ref name=\"Lang, G 2009\"/> they were criticized as inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas.\n\nEconomist [[Tyler Cowen]] has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development.<ref name=W/>\n\n==Works==\nJane Jacobs spent her life studying cities. Her books include:\n\n===''The Death and Life of Great American Cities''===\n{{main|The Death and Life of Great American Cities}}\n''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities. Widely read by both planning professionals and the general public, the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces. Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as an example of a vibrant urban community.\n\n[[Robert Caro]] has cited it as the strongest influence on ''[[The Power Broker]]'', his [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography of Robert Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. Caro reportedly cut a chapter about Jacobs due to his book's length.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oder|first1=Norman|title=The Missing Jane Jacobs Chapter in The Power Broker|url=http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/missing-jane-jacobs-chapter-in-power.html|website=atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that ''Death and Life'' offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.\n\n===''The Economy of Cities''===\nThe thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban [[import replacement]]. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to locally produce goods that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.\n\nIn an interview with Bill Steigerwald in ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of [[import replacement]]. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]] advanced earlier by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]]. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/06/01/city-views|title=City Views|work=Reason.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the second part of the book Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] and in recent times by another historical materialist [[Charles Keith Maisels]]<ref>Maisels, Charles Keith, 1990, The Emergence of Civilisation: From Hunting and Gathering to Agriculture, Cities, and the State in the Near East. Routledge, New York.</ref><ref>Soja, Edward W. 2000, Postmetropolis, Putting Cities First, Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell pg.24</ref> These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists like Maisels or [[Henri Lefebvre]] defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as [[Synoecism]]—as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community,<ref>Soja, Edward W. 2000, Postmetropolis, Putting Cities First, Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell pg. 25</ref> whereas, as one can see from ''The Economy of Cities'' or from ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'', Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or \"a large human settlement\" indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.<ref>{{cite web|website=bradshawfoundation.com|title=Discovery of Earliest Homo Sapien Skulls backs 'Out of Africa' Theory|first=Clive|last=Cookson|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/herto_skulls.php}}</ref>\n\n===''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty''===\n\n''The Question of Separatism'' incorporated and expanded Jacobs’ presentation of the 1979 [[Massey Lectures]], entitled ''Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association''. It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously unpublished 2005 interview with [[Robin Philpot]] on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist [[Richard Gwyn]] advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking canadians readers thought she did not understood how canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the [[Quebec referendum, 1980|1980 referendum]] was just defeated by a vote of 60%). ''The Question of Separatism'' was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in the ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. <ref>{{cite book |last1=Philpot |first1=Robin |last2= |first2=|page=X |date=|chapter=Preface to the 2011 edition |title=Jane Jacobs, The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty|trans-title= |url= |language= |location= |publisher=Baraka Books |isbn= |year=2011|subscription= |quote= }}</ref> \n\nJacobs' book advances the view that [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec's eventual independence]] is best for [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], the rest of [[Canada]], and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway's secession from Sweden]] and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the [[Quiet Revolution]] are examined, along with Canada’s historical reliance on [[natural resources]] and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own [[economic development]]. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its [[skis]] and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian [[tariff]]s designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of [[René Lévesque]], [[Claude Ryan]], and then [[Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Pierre Trudeau]] are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent [[Currency|currencies]] are essential to the success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward [[regional]]-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which perceived [[nature]] as a force for \"standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability.\" Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, \"diversity itself is of the essence of excellence.\" The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.\n\n===''Cities and the Wealth of Nations''===\n''[[Cities and the Wealth of Nations]]'' attempts to do for economics what ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in [[macroeconomics]]. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state, rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book ''[[The Economy of Cities]]'', while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.\n\n===''Systems of Survival''===\n{{main|Systems of Survival}}\n\n''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' moves outside of the city, studying the [[moral]] underpinnings of [[labour (economics)|work]]. As with her other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a [[Plato|Platonic dialogue]]. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book) took newspaper clippings of moral judgements related to work, collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behaviour that were mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns \"Moral Syndrome A\", or commercial moral syndrome, and \"Moral Syndrome B\", or guardian moral syndrome. She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners, scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed, and do not fluctuate over time.\n\nIt is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that are not included in her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes.\n\nJane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the [[Mafia]] and communism, and what happens when [[New York City Subway|New York subway]] Police are paid bonuses here – reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis.\n\n===''The Nature of Economies''===\n''The Nature of Economies'', a dialog between friends concerning the premise: \"human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect\" (p. ''ix''), argues that the same principles underlie both [[ecosystem]]s and [[economic system|economies]]: \"development and co-development through differentiations and their combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-maintenance through self-refueling\" (p.&nbsp;82).\n\nJacobs' characters discuss the four methods by which \"dynamically stable systems\" may evade collapse: \"bifurcations; [[positive feedback|positive-feedback loops]]; [[negative feedback|negative-feedback controls]]; and emergency adaptations\" (p.&nbsp;86). Their conversations also cover the \"double nature of fitness for survival\" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed, p.&nbsp;119), and unpredictability including the [[butterfly effect]] characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and [[self-organization]] where \"a system can be making itself up as it goes along\" (p.&nbsp;137).\n\nThrough the dialogue, Jacobs' characters explore and examine the similarities between the functioning of ecosystems and economies. Topics include environmental and economic development, growth and expansion, and how economies and environments keep themselves alive through \"self-refueling.\" Jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems.\n\nThe book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples, which help keep the book \"down to earth\" and comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds.\n\nOne particularly interesting insight is the creation of \"something from nothing\" – an economy from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight, but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of \"new species of work\".\n\n===''Dark Age Ahead''===\n{{main|Dark Age Ahead}}\n\nPublished in 2004 by Random House, in ''Dark Age Ahead'' Jacobs argued that \"North American\" civilization showed signs of spiral of decline comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her thesis focused on \"five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm,\" which can be summarized as the nuclear family (but also community), education, science, representational government and taxes, and corporate and professional accountability. As the title suggests, her outlook was far more pessimistic than in her previous books. However, in the conclusion she wrote that, \"At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture? Arguably, either could turn out to be true.\" As suggested by the title, Jacobs was not optimistic about the future when writing this book.<ref>Peter L. Laurence (2005) \"Dark Age Ahead?
