After a year-long trip from England to Sri Lanka and back, she became a research fellow at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], as a member of a team in the department created by [[Jay Forrester]], the inventor of [[system dynamics]] as well as the principle of magnetic data storage for computers.  She taught at [[Dartmouth College]] for 29 years, beginning in 1972.<ref name = \"meadows2008\">Meadows, Donella H. 2008. ''Thinking in systems : a primer''.

Paine Science Education Award in 1990. Posthumously, she received the [[John H. Chafee]] Excellence in Environmental Affairs Award for 2001, presented by the [[Conservation Law Foundation]].\n\nMeadows wrote a weekly column called \"The Global Citizen,\"<ref name = \"meadows2008\" /> commenting on world events from a systems point of view. Many of these columns were compiled and published as a book.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yE5PzCacXoC&dq=global+citizen&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=7nP7JSAhIS&sig=EutjsehkGNfPYVkpJzzLTGvwapk&hl=en&ei=cPxNSp_eCYXk7AOu4KyKBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3 The Global Citizen Donella H.

The book reported a study of long-term global trends in population, economics, and the environment. The book made headlines around the world and began a debate about the limits of [[Earth]]'s capacity to support human economic expansion−a debate that continues to this day.<ref>\"To Grow or not to Grow\", Newsweek, March 13, 1972, pages 102-103</ref>\n\n===The Balaton Group===\nIn 1982, Donella Meadows and  [[Dennis Meadows]] created an international \"network of networks\" for leading researchers on resource use, environmental conservation, systems modeling, and sustainability. Since its foundation, the members have met at [[Lake Balaton]], in [[Hungary]], every autumn. While the formal name for the network was the International Network of Resource Information Centres (INRIC), it became more popularly known as the [[Balaton Group]] <ref>{{Cite web|title=Balaton Group History |url=http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205175146/http://www.balatongroup.org/FAQ.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 }}</ref> based on the location of its meetings.\n\n=== Sustainability Institute and Related Organizations ===\nDonella Meadows was the founder of the Sustainability Institute, which combined research in global systems with practical demonstrations of [[sustainable development|sustainable]] living, including the development of a [[cohousing]] (or [[ecovillage]]) and organic farm at [[Cobb Hill]] in [[Hartland, Vermont]], in the United States.  In 2011, the Sustainability Institute, originally located adjacent to Cobb Hill, was renamed the Donella Meadows Institute and moved its offices to Norwich, Vermont. Additional organizations that sprang from the Sustainability Institute include [http://www.sustainablefood.org/ Sustainable Food Lab], [https://www.climateinteractive.org/ Climate Interactive] and [http://www.sustainabilityleadersnetwork.org/ Sustainability Leaders Network].\n\n=== State of the Village report ===\nIn 1990, Donella Meadows published the State of the Village report under the title, \"Who lives in the 'Global Village'?\"<ref>[http://www.empowermentresources.com/info2/theglobalvillage.html Meadows, Donnella. (1990, May 31). \"Who lives in the 'Global Village'?\" ''The Global Citizen'']</ref> which likened the world to a village of 1,000 people. Since then, \"If the world were a village of 100 people\"−derived from her work but further reducing the numbers to those of a village of 100 people−has been published by others in English, Spanish, and Japanese.\n\n=== Twelve leverage points ===\n{{Main article|Twelve leverage points}}\nMeadows published ''Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System'',  one of her best-known essays, in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |title=Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-10-25 |website=The Sustainability Institute |publisher= |last=Meadows |first=Donella |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008160618/http://www.sustainabilityinstitute.org/pubs/Leverage_Points.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 }}</ref>  It describes what types of interventions in a system (of any kind) are most effective, and which are least effective.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Systems science}}\n* [[Amory Lovins]]\n* [[Cobb Hill]]\n* [[Dennis Meadows]]\n* [[System dynamics]]\n* [[DYNAMO (programming language)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Donella H.
