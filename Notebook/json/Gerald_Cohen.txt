Born into a communist family in [[Montreal]], Cohen was educated at [[McGill University]], Canada (BA, philosophy and political science) and the [[University of Oxford]] (BPhil, philosophy) where he studied under [[Isaiah Berlin]] and [[Gilbert Ryle]].\n\nCohen was assistant lecturer (1963–1964), lecturer (1964–1979) then reader (1979–1984) in the Department of Philosophy at [[University College London]], before being appointed to the Chichele chair at Oxford in 1985.  Several of his students, such as [[Alan Carter (philosopher)|Alan Carter]], [[Cécile Fabre]], [[Will Kymlicka]], [[John McMurtry]], David Leopold, [[Michael Otsuka]], [[Seana Shiffrin]], [[Jonathan Wolff (philosopher)|Jonathan Wolff]] and [[Michael E. Rosen]] have gone on to be important moral and political philosophers in their own right.\n\nKnown as a proponent of [[Analytical Marxism]] and a founding member of the [[September Group]], Cohen's 1978 work ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' defends an interpretation of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] [[historical materialism]] often referred to as '[[technological determinism]]' by its critics.<ref name=\"Singer\">{{cite book |author=Singer, Peter |title=Marx: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |page=105 |isbn=0-19-285405-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> In ''Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality'', Cohen offers an extensive moral argument in favour of socialism, contrasting his views with those of [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]], by articulating an extensive critique of the [[Lockean]] principle of [[self-ownership]] as well as the use of that principle to defend [[Right-libertarianism|right]] &ndash; as well as [[Left-libertarianism|left]] &ndash; [[libertarianism]]. In ''If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?'' (which covers the topic of his [[Gifford Lectures]]) Cohen addresses the question of what [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] political principles imply for the personal behaviour of those who subscribe to them.\n\n==Works==\n*''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' (1978, 2000)\n*''[[History, Labour, and Freedom]]'' (1988)\n*{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Self-Ownership, Freedom, and Equality|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-5214-7174-9|oclc=612482692}} \n*''If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?''
