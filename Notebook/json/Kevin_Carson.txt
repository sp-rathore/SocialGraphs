He was the center's first paid staff member.<ref name=c4ss /> Additionally, he holds the center's [[Karl Hess]] Chair in [[Social Theory]].<ref name=ecol />\n \nSince January 2009, Carson has produced several studies and commentaries for the center.<ref name=carson3 />\n\n==Philosophy and Ideas==\n{{Libertarianism sidebar}}\n{{Anarchism sidebar}}\n\n===State===\nCarson agrees with individualist anarchist [[Benjamin Tucker]] regarding the \"big four\" monopolies (land, money, tariffs, and patents). However, he goes further arguing that the [[Sovereign state|state]] has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational [[centralization]], in the form of transportation and communication [[subsidy|subsidies]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===Free markets vs. capitalism===\n{{See also|Anarchism and capitalism|Free-market anarchism}}\nUnlike some other market anarchists, Carson defines [[capitalism]] in historical terms, emphasizing the history of state intervention in market economies. He has said \"[i]t is state intervention that distinguishes capitalism from the free market.\"<ref name=studies /> He does not define capitalism in the idealized sense but says that when he talks about \"capitalism\" he is referring to what he calls \"[[actually existing capitalism]].\" He believes that \"laissez-faire capitalism, historically speaking, is an oxymoron\" but has no quarrel with anarcho-capitalists who use the term and distinguish it from \"actually existing capitalism.\"\n\nIn response to claims that he misuses the term \"capitalism\", Carson has said he deliberately resurrected what he has claimed to be an old definition of the term in order to \"make a point.\" He has claimed that \"the term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did\nnot refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf.\"<ref>Carson, Kevin A. [https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_7.pdf Carson's Rejoinders]. Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 97-136, p. 116, 117</ref> Carson holds that “[[Capitalism]], arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the [[Middle Ages]], was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier [[Feudalism|feudal]] conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable.”<ref name=Richman>[[Sheldon Richman|Richman, Sheldon]], [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/libertarian-left/ Libertarian Left], ''[[The American Conservative]]'' (March 2011)</ref> Carson argues that in a truly [[laissez-faire]] system, the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible.\n\nCarson has argued the centralization of wealth into a [[class hierarchy]] is due to state intervention to protect the [[ruling class]], by using a money monopoly, granting [[patent]]s and [[subsidies]] to corporations, imposing discriminatory [[taxation]], and intervening militarily to gain access to international markets. Carson’s thesis is that under an authentic [[free market economy]], the separation of labour from ownership and the subordination of labor to capital would be impossible, bringing a more egalitarian society in which most people could easily choose self-employment over wage labor.<ref>[http://mutualist.org/id4.html The Iron Fist Behind The Invisible Hand]</ref>\n\nCarson has written sympathetically about several [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], arguing that they use the word \"capitalism\" in a different sense than he does and that they represent a legitimate strain of anarchism. He says \"most people who call themselves individualist anarchists today are followers of [[Murray Rothbard]]'s [[Austrian economics]], and have abandoned the labor theory of value.\" With the release of his book, ''Studies in Mutualist Political Economy'', Carson aimed to revive interest in \"[[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].\" In his book he attempts to synthesize [[Austrian economics]] with the [[labor theory of value]], or \"Austrianize\" it, by incorporating both subjectivism and [[time preference]].<ref>Long, Roderick. \"Editorial to Symposium Issue on Studies in Mutualist Political Economy\". '[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 3–4</ref>\n\n===\"Vulgar libertarianism\"===\nCarson coined the [[pejorative]] term \"vulgar libertarianism\" to describe the use of free market rhetoric in defense of [[corporate capitalism]] and [[economic inequality]]. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase \"vulgar political economy,\" which [[Karl Marx]] described as an economic order that \"deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life].\"<ref>Marx, ''Theories of Surplus Value, III,'' p. 501.</ref>\n\nCarson writes that\n{{blockquote|Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term \"free market\" in an equivocal sense: they seem to have trouble remembering, from one moment to the next, whether they’re defending actually existing capitalism or free market principles. So we get the standard boilerplate article in ''The Freeman'' arguing that the rich can’t get rich at the expense of the poor, because \"that’s not how the free market works\"—implicitly assuming that this is a free market. When prodded, they’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich. But as soon as they think they can get away with it, they go right back to defending the wealth of existing corporations on the basis of \"free market principles.\"<ref>Carson, Kevin. ''[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html Studies in Mutualist Political Economy], p. 142</ref>}}\n\nMuch of Carson's writing is dedicated to critiquing other writers whom he perceives as vulgar libertarians. A sporadically recurring feature on his blog is called \"Vulgar Libertarian Watch.\"\n\n===Intellectual property and agriculture===\nCarson has been highly critical of [[intellectual property]].<ref name=carson1 /> In 2014, he wrote a piece for ''[[CounterPunch]]'' drawing attention to the fact that the [[Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture]] was investigating the Pennsylvania Seed Library for 'Agri-terrorism'. The department was considering whether the library's [[seed saving]] practices violate the [[Heirloom plant#US state law|Seed Act 2004]].<ref name=ecol /> (In 2016 the department decided that seed libraries and non-commercial seed exchanges are not subject to the requirements of the Seed Act.<ref>{{citation |url=https://pasafarming.org/news/seed-libraries-in-pennsylvania-allowed-to-engage-in-free-seed-exchange |title=Seed Libraries in Pennsylvania Allowed to Engage in Free Seed Exchange |date=March 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref>)\n\n==Criticisms==\nEconomist and anarcho-capitalist [[Walter Block]] has characterized Carson as a [[Marxism|Marxist]], for his embrace of [[Labor theory of value|labor value]] [[exploitation theory]], and argued that Carson's philosophy is full of errors, mostly due to his acceptance of the labor theory of value. Block has commented that \"for someone in this day and age to even take this doctrine seriously, let alone actually try to defend it, is equivalent to making a similarly widely and properly rejected position vis à vis the [[Flat Earth|flat earth]], or the [[phlogiston theory]]. It is, in a word, medieval.\"<ref>Block, Walter. [https://mises.org/library/kevin-carson-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde Kevin Carson as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde], ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006), pp. 35-36</ref> Carson alleges that Block misrepresents many of his views and probably did not actually read his book.\n\n[[Auburn University]] professor and Center for a Stateless Society Senior Fellow [[Roderick T. Long]] has criticized Carson's claim that full private property rights do not stem from the concept of self-ownership, and presents an argument that if one accepts self-ownership, as Carson does, then non-[[Lockean proviso]] [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] rights must be accepted. However, Long has accepted the concept of public property as valid and written that communities may acquire land \"by collectively homesteading,\" which could \"[provide] a basis for No-Proviso Lockeans to recognize as legitimate the property arrangements of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]], [[Georgism|Georgist]], and Proviso-Lockean communities.\"<ref>Long, Roderick.

''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 87–95</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Deric Shannon wrote that while he agreed with Carson's criticism of the state violence used to enforce capitalism, he felt that Carson's solution - to eliminate the state - would not bring about a society free of all forms of oppression.<ref name=accumulation />{{rp|277–287}}\n\n==Publications==\nCarson has published several books and produced articles for a range of publications including ''The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty'', ''CounterPunch'', ''[[Land&Liberty]]'', ''Just Things'' and ''[[The Ecologist]]''.<ref name=ecol /><ref name=carson13 /> His writings have also appeared on the web at ''The Art of the Possible'', ''P2P Foundation blog'' and ''[[AntiWar.Com]]''.
