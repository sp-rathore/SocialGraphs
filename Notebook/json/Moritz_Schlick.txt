He studied [[physics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Lausanne]], and, ultimately, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] under [[Max Planck]]. In 1904, he completed his dissertation essay, \"Über die Reflexion des Lichts in einer inhomogenen Schicht\" (\"On the Reflection of Light in a Non-Homogeneous Medium\"). After a year as Privatdozent at Göttingen, he turned to the study of Philosophy in Zurich. In 1907, he married Blanche Hardy<ref>[http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/Schlick-Projekt/biographie.html Biography] at [[Vienna University]]</ref> In 1908, he published ''Lebensweisheit'' (\"The Wisdom of Life\"), a slim volume about [[eudaemonism]], the theory that happiness is the highest ethical pursuit. His habilitation essay, \"Das Wesen der Wahrheit nach der modernen Logik\" (\"The Nature of Truth According to Modern [[Logic]]\"), was published in 1910. Several essays about [[aesthetics]] followed, whereupon Schlick turned his attention to problems of [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of science]], and more general questions about [[science]]. In this last category, Schlick distinguished himself by publishing a paper in 1915 about [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]], a topic only ten years old. He also published ''Raum und Zeit in der gegenwärtigen Physik'' (\"Space and Time in Contemporary Physics\"), which extended his earlier results by  applying Poincaré's geometric conventionalism to explain Einstein's adoption of a non-Euclidean geometry in the [[General Theory of Relativity]].\n\n==The Vienna Circle and Wittgenstein==\nAfter early appointments at Rostock and Kiel, in 1922 Schlick assumed the chair of Naturphilosophie at the [[University of Vienna]] which had previously been held by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[Ernst Mach]].  Schlick displayed an unusual success in organizing talented individuals in the philosophical and scientific spheres. When Schlick arrived in Vienna, he was invited to lead a group of scientists and philosophers who met regularly (on Thursday evenings in the Chemistry Building) to discuss philosophical topics in the sciences. Early members included the mathematician [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and, within a few years, they were joined by [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Friedrich Waismann]] and others. They initially called themselves the [[Ernst Mach]] Association, but forever after they have been known as the [[Vienna Circle]]. In the years 1925-1926, the Thursday night group discussed recent work in the foundations of mathematics by [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Wittgenstein's book, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', was a work that advanced, among other things, a logical theory of [[symbol]]ism and a \"picture\" or \"model\" theory of language. Schlick and his group were impressed by the work, devoting considerable time to its study and, even when it was no longer the principal focus of their discussion, it was mentioned in discussion. Eventually Wittgenstein agreed to meet with Schlick and other Circle members to discuss the ''Tractatus'' and other ideas but he later found it necessary to restrict the visitors to sympathetic interlocutors. Through Schlick's influence, Wittgenstein was encouraged to consider a return to philosophy after some ten years away from the field. Schlick and Waismann's discussions with Wittgenstein continued until the latter felt that germinal ideas had been used without permission in an essay by Carnap, a charge of dubious merit. But he continued discussions in letters to Schlick after he no longer met with other Circle members.\n\n==''General Theory of Knowledge'' and later works==\nSchlick had worked on his ''Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre'' (''[[General Theory of Knowledge]]'') between 1918 and 1925, and, though later developments in his philosophy were to make various contentions of his epistemology untenable, the ''General Theory'' is perhaps his greatest work in its acute reasoning against synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge. This critique of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge argues that the only truths which are self-evident to reason are statements which are true as a matter of definition, such as the statements of formal logic and mathematics. The truth of all other statements must be evaluated with reference to [[empirical evidence]]. If a statement is proposed which is not a matter of definition, and not capable of being confirmed or falsified by evidence, that statement is \"metaphysical\", which is synonymous with \"meaningless\", or \"nonsense\". This is the principle upon which members of the Vienna Circle were most clearly in agreement — with each other, as well as with Wittgenstein.\n\n==''Problems of Ethics''==\nBetween 1926  and 1930, Schlick labored to finish ''Fragen der Ethik'' (''Problems of Ethics'''), in which he surprised some of his fellow Circlists by including [[ethics]] as a viable branch of philosophy. In his 1932-33 contribution to ''Erkenntnis'', \"Positivism and Realism\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/PositivismAndRealism/SchlickMoritz-PositivismAndRealism_djvu.txt |title='&#39;Erkenntnis'&#39; vol. 3, 1932/33. English: translated by David Rynin |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref> Schlick offered one of the most illuminating definitions of [[positivism]] as every view \"which denies the possibility of metaphysics\" (Schlick [1932-1933], p.&nbsp;260). Accordingly he defined metaphysics as the doctrine of “true being”, “thing in itself” or “transcendental being”, a doctrine which obviously \"presupposes that a non-true, lesser or apparent being stands opposed to it\"  (Ibid). Therefore in this work he bases the positivism on a kind of epistemology which holds that the only true beings are givens or constituents of experience. Also during this time, the Vienna Circle published ''The Scientific View of the World: The Vienna Circle'' as a homage to Schlick. Its strong anti-metaphysical stance crystallized the viewpoint of the group.\n\n===Comment on Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus''===\n[[Carnap]], in his book ''Logical Syntax of Language'', included a comment by Schlick on Wittgenstein 's ''Tractatus''.\n\n{{ quotation | Schlick ( [Wende] p.8 ) interprets [[Wittgenstein]]'s position as follows: philosophy \"is that activity by which the meaning of propositions is established or discovered\" ; it is a question of \"what the propositions actually mean. The content, soul, and spirit of science naturally consist in what is ultimately meant by its sentences; the philosophical activity of rendering significant is thus the alpha and omega of all scientific knowledge\". | Carnap, p.284 | ''Logical Syntax of Language '' }}\n\n==Schlick's murder==\nWith the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Germany and the [[Austrofascism]] in Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for America and the United Kingdom. Schlick, however, stayed on at the University of Vienna. When visited by [[Herbert Feigl]] in 1935, he expressed dismay at events in Germany. On June 22, 1936, Schlick was ascending the steps of the University for a class when he was confronted by a former student, [[Johann Nelböck]], who killed Schlick with a pistol. The court declared Nelböck to be fully [[compos mentis]], he confessed to the act, was detained without any resistance, but was unrepentant. The delinquent used the judicial proceedings as a chance to present himself and his ideology in the public. He claimed that Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had \"interfered with his moral restraint\". In another version of the events, the murderer covered up all political causes and claimed that he was motivated by jealousy over his failed attachment to the female student Sylvia Borowicka, leading to a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival and persecutor. Nelböck was tried and sentenced, but the event became a distorted ''cause célèbre'' around which crystallized the growing nationalist and anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. (The fact that Schlick was not Jewish did not seem to matter to propagandists capitalizing on the crime.) After the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany]] in 1938 the assassin was released on license after serving two years of a 10-year sentence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stadler|first=Friedrich|title=Documentation: The Murder of Moritz Schlick, in: Friedrich Stadler (ed.).
