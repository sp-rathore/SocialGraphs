Born in [[Berlin]], Germany into a non-observant [[Jew]]ish family, the son of a prosperous banker, he converted to Christianity in his late teens, and thereafter the interpretation and reinterpretation of Christianity was a consistent theme in his writings. He met and married Margrit Hüssy in 1914. In 1925, the couple legally combined their names.<ref>In Germany, their family name became \"Rosenstock-Hüssy.\" In the United States, it was adapted to English spelling as \"Rosenstock-Huessy.\" Published references in this article use the latter spelling.</ref> They had a son, Hans, in 1921.\n\nRosenstock-Huessy served as an officer in the German army during [[World War I]]. His experience caused him to reexamine the foundations of liberal Western culture. He then pursued an academic career in Germany as a specialist in medieval law, which was disrupted by the rise of [[Nazism]]. In 1933, after [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany, he emigrated to the United States where he began a new academic career, initially at [[Harvard University]] and then at [[Dartmouth College]], where he taught from 1935 to 1957.\n\nAlthough never part of the mainstream of intellectual discussion during his lifetime, his work drew the attention of [[W. H. Auden]], [[Harold J. Berman|Harold Berman]], [[Martin E. Marty|Martin Marty]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Page Smith]], and others. Rosenstock-Huessy may be best known as the close friend of and correspondent with [[Franz Rosenzweig]]. Their exchange of letters is considered by scholars of religion and theology to be indispensable in the study of the modern encounter of [[Jew]]s with [[Christianity]]. In his work, Rosenstock-Huessy discussed speech and language as the dominant shaper of human character and abilities in every social context. He is viewed as belonging to a group of thinkers who revived post-[[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] religious thought.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cristaudo|2008|p= }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nRosenstock-Huessy was born Eugen Friedrich Moritz Rosenstock in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] on July 6, 1888, to Theodor and Paula Rosenstock. His father, a scholarly man, was a banker and a member of the [[Berliner Börse|Berlin Stock Exchange]]. He was the only son among seven surviving children.\n\n[[File:Uni-Heidelberg Aula.jpg|thumb|right|188px|'''Old Assembly Hall''', University of Heidelberg]]\nDespite his parents' [[Jew]]ish heritage, his family \"celebrated some Christian holidays, in keeping with other German families at the time.\"<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\">{{Harvnb|Argo Books, Inc.|1999|p= }}</ref>  He joined the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant Church]] at age 17 and was christened at age 18. He remained a devout proponent of Christianity throughout the rest of his life.\n\nAfter graduating from a secondary school ([[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]) with very high academic standards and an emphasis on classical languages and literature, Rosenstock-Huessy pursued law studies at the universities of [[University of Zurich|Zurich]], [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. In 1909 the University of Heidelberg granted him a doctorate in law. In 1912 he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'', a preliminary qualification to becoming a professor, at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he taught constitutional law and the history of law until 1914.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1990|p= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1914 Rosenstock-Huessy visited [[Florence]], [[Italy]] to conduct historical research. There he met Margrit Hüssy, a Swiss art history major. They married later that year. [[World War I]] broke out shortly thereafter.\n\n==World War I==\nAt the onset of [[World War I]], the German Army drafted Rosenstock-Huessy and stationed him at [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], including 18 months at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], until the war's end. \"During this period he organized courses for the troops, replacing the limited instruction in patriotism with broader topics. In 1916, he and his friend, the Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, also on active duty, exchanged letters on Judaism and Christianity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  That correspondence has become well known as a dialog between proponents of the two related religions. Rosenstock-Huessy's work, ''Judaism Despite Christianity'',  contains much of this correspondence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|Rosenzweig|1969|p= }}</ref>\n\n==Interwar period==\nAfter World War I, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in labor issues, focusing on improving education as a means to improve the societal standard of living. He returned to academia and started publishing his first noted works.\n\n===Labor education===\nRosenstock-Huessy did not return to his teaching post at the University of Leipzig. Instead, he obtained a position with [[Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft]], the German car manufacturer, in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. In 1919, he founded and became the editor until 1921 of the first factory newspaper in Germany, the Daimler ''Werkzeitung'' (Work Newspaper).<ref>{{Harvnb|Daimler-Benz AG|1991|p= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, Rosenstock founded ''Die Akademie der Arbeit'' (the Academy of Labor) in Frankfurt am Main. \"This institution offered courses and seminars for blue-collar workers, but he resigned in 1923 over differences with the trade union representatives. Nevertheless, he did not give up his involvement with adult education and his efforts to give industrial workers a voice of their own in society.\" He co-founded the Patmos Verlag publishing house, which published works on \"new religious, philosophical, and social perspectives.\"<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\n===Return to academia===\n[[File:UniwersytetWroclawski-Odra.jpg|thumb|200px|The main building of the [[University of Wrocław]] (Breslau), seen from the Pomeranian Bridge (''Most Pomorski'') spanning the [[Oder River]].]]\nIn 1923, Rosenstock-Huessy received a second doctorate in philosophy from the University of Heidelberg. He then lectured at the [[Technical University of Darmstadt]] in the faculty of social science and social history until he was offered a job at the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] as a full professor of German legal history, a position he held from 1923 until January 30, 1933.\n\nDuring this period, Rosenstock-Huessy became active in many other ways at the University of Breslau. He helped organize voluntary work service camps—''Löwenberger Arbeitslager'' ([[Lwówek Śląski|Löwenberg]] Work Camp)—for students, young farmers, and young workers to address the living and labor conditions at coal mines in [[Wałbrzych|Waldenburg]], [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1926, [[Joseph Wittig]], a reform-minded Roman Catholic priest, was excommunicated and thus lost his right to teach church history at the University of Breslau.  Rosenstock-Huessy stood by his friend, Wittig, in this affair. In 1927 and 1928, they co-authored ''Das Alter der Kirche'' (''The Age of the Church''), which contained two volumes of essays on the history of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig's excommunication.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1925, he co-founded a journal, ''Die Kreatur'' (''The Creature''), which was edited by Wittig, [[Martin Buber]], and [[Viktor von Weizsäcker]], men of widely different perspectives,  and which lasted until 1930. According to his recent publishers, \"Among the contributors [of ''Die Kreatur''] were [[Nicholas Berdyaev]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Ernst Simon]], [[Hugo Bergmann]], Edgar Dacque, [[Hans Ehrenberg]], [[Rudolf Ehrenberg]], Marie Luise Enckendorff, Hermann Herrigel, Rudolf Hallo, Edith Klatt, [[Fritz Klatt]], Ernst Michel, Wilhelm Michel, Werner Picht, Florens Christian Rang, Heinrich Sachs, and Margarette Susman. Each of these [people] had, between 1910 and 1932, in one way or another, offered an alternative to the idealism, positivism, and historicism that dominated German universities.\"<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\nSoon after January 30, 1933, when the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] (Nazis) assumed power in Germany, Rosenstock-Huessy resigned from the University of Breslau and departed Germany that year. By the end of 1933, he received an appointment as Lecturer in German Art and Culture at [[Harvard University]] with the help of a professor of government there.<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\n===Publications 1914&ndash;1933===\nRosenstock-Huessy published his medieval study ''Königshaus und Stämme in Deutschland zwischen 911 und 1250'' (''The Royal House and the Tribes in Germany between 911 and 1250'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1914|p= }}</ref> in 1914, which he had written in Leipzig and was the source of recognition for his second doctorate. In 1920, Rosenstock-Huessy published ''Die Hochzeit des Krieges und der Revolution'' (''The Marriage of War and Revolution''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1920|p= }}</ref> \"a collection of current events essays that were replete with visionary thinking and practical warnings of conflicts to come.\"<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>   In 1921, Rosenstock-Huessy published ''Angewandte Seelenkunde'' (''Practical Knowledge of the Soul'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|1921|p= }}<br /> Alternative translation: ''Practical Knowledge of the Soul''</ref> wherein he developed a new method for the social sciences based on language, the spoken word, and his \"grammatical approach.\" He later called this approach \"metanomics.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>   Together with Josef Wittig, a [[Roman Catholic]], he published ''Das Alter der Kirche'' (''The Age of the Church'') <ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock|Wittig|1928|p= }}</ref> in 1927-28. That work contained two volumes of essays on the life of the Church and a third volume devoted to documents leading up to Wittig's excommunication.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n\"While he was still teaching at Breslau, Rosenstock wrote and published the first of his major works: ''Die Europäischen Revolutionen: Volkscharaktere und Staatenbildung'' (''The European [[Revolution]]s and the Character of Nations; 1931'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1931|p= }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1951|p= }}</ref> This book showed how 1,000 years of European history had been created from five different European national revolutions that collectively came to an end in World War I.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Dartmouth College==\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-06-23 Dartmouth Hall 02.JPG|thumb|right|Dartmouth Hall at Dartmouth College<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/cdbldg.html#dartmouthhall1|accessdate=2007-07-16|title=Dartmouth Hall|work=Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College}}</ref>]]Rosenstock-Huessy encountered strong opposition at Harvard University to the presentation of his ideas in social history and other topics, all of which were based on his Christian faith. Reportedly, Rosenstock-Huessy frequently mentioned God in class. He also often attacked non-religious academic thinking, a teaching tradition assumed by the Harvard faculty to be a prerequisite for high scholarship. Profound differences of opinion ensued and led, in 1935, to his accepting an appointment as professor of social philosophy at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]]. He made his home in nearby [[Norwich, Vermont]]. He taught at Dartmouth until his retirement in 1957.<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\nAt Harvard, he had made friends there who helped him in his publishing efforts. His first major writing task was to develop an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions, and he soon published ''Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man'' <ref name=\"Rosenstock-Huessy 1938\">{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1938|p= }}</ref> in 1938. George Allen Morgan, a former Harvard student under Alfred North Whitehead and himself the author of the classic ''What Nietzsche Means'', subsequently assisted Rosenstock-Huessy in the preparation of ''The Christian Future or the Modern Mind Outrun'' <ref name=\"Rosenstock-Huessy 1938\"/> in 1946. Further, Whitehead had strongly supported Rosenstock-Huessy in his disagreements with members of the Harvard faculty.<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\n===Renewed labor education===\nIn 1940 he presented a request to [[President of the United States|US President]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and was granted approval to organize a youth training program for the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC). [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and journalist [[Dorothy Thompson]] were champions of the proposal. He then founded [[Camp William James]] in [[Tunbridge, Vermont|Tunbridge]], [[Vermont]] as a prototype for a national peacetime volunteer labor service. \"Involving mainly students from Dartmouth, Radcliffe, and Harvard, its purpose was to train young leaders to expand the 7-year-old CCC from a program for unemployed youth into a work service program that would accept volunteers from all walks of life.\"<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/> The entrance of the United States into [[World War II]] in 1941 ended this and all other CCC programs because men were needed in the armed services and women became a greater part of the workforce. This concept anticipated the [[Peace Corps]] by more than two decades.\n\n===Publications 1933&ndash;1973===\n[[File:Multiformity.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover for ''Multiformity of Man''<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1936| p= }}.</ref>]]\n[[File:Out of Revolution.JPG|thumb|right|Book cover for ''[[Out of Revolution]]''<ref name=\"Rosenstock-Huessy 1938\"/>]]\n[[File:Origin of Speech.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover for ''The Origin of Speech''<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosenstock-Huessy|1981| p= }}.</ref>]]\nRosenstock-Huessy published ''Out of Revolution: Autobiography of Western Man''<ref name=\"Rosenstock-Huessy 1938\"/> in 1938, an English-language revision of his earlier book on revolutions.

In 1960, [[Freya von Moltke]] became Rosenstock-Huessy's companion. She was the widow of [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke|Helmuth James von Moltke]], who had opposed National Socialism and was executed by the Nazis.<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/>\n\nAfter World War II and continuing through his retirement from Dartmouth, Rosenstock-Huessy was a frequent guest professor at many universities in Germany and the United States. He remained active in lecturing and writing until his final years. His output comprises more than 500 essays, articles, and monographs, as well as 40 books. He was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in 1958 at the [[University of Münster]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McDuffee|2004|p= }}</ref> Rosenstock-Huessy died on February 24, 1973.<ref name=\"Argo Books, Inc. 1999 p\"/> He and his wife are buried at the Hillside Cemetery in Norwich, Vermont.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last = Huessy\n | first = Raymond\n | title = ERH Sites in the Area\n | url = http://erhsites.blogspot.com\n | accessdate = 2013-07-22}}\n</ref>\n\n==Quotations==\n{{Move to Wikiquote}}\n''\"The French Revolution first introduced into Europe the notion of the tissue-paper frontier.
