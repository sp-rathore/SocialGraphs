He has made notable contributions to the field of [[logic]], especially [[non-classical logic]].  One of his most notable achievements is proving the [[decidability (logic)|undecidability]] of the [[relevance logic]] '''R'''. He also published numerous papers in major [[theoretical computer science]] venues, mostly on [[mathematical logic]] topics of [[logic in computer science|relevance to computer science]].\n\nA native of [[Scotland]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whockey.com/work/dcs/dcs/people/faculty/urquhart.html|title=\"Alasdair Urquhart was born in Scotland in 1945\"|publisher=Department of Computer Science - University of Toronto|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref> Urquhart received his [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in Philosophy from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1967, and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1973 under the supervision of [[Alan Ross Anderson]] and [[Nuel Belnap]].\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* \"The Undecidability of Entailment and Relevant Implication.\"  ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'' 49(4): 1059-1073 (1984).\n* with [[Stephen A.
