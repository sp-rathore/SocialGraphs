He was a [[polymath]] who turned down a career in the [[Indian Civil Service]]. His [[simple living]] and intellectual acumen inspired many [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|expatriate Indians]] living in Canada and the USA to fight against [[British Empire|British Imperialism]] during the [[First World War]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nHe was born as a [[Dalit]]. At an early age he was influenced by [[Arya Samaj]]. He was associated with [[Shyam Krishnavarma]], [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] and [[Bhikaji Cama]]. He also drew inspiration from [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. He was, according to Emily Brown as quoted by Juergensmeyer, \"in sequence an [[atheist]], a revolutionary, a Buddhist, and a pacifist\".\n[[File:TIS.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lala Har Dayal]]'s ever favorite paper ''The Indian Sociologist'' (August 1909 issue)]]He studied at the Cambridge Mission School and received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Sanskrit]] from [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi, India]] and his [[master's degree]] also in [[Sanskrit]] from [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]]. In 1905, he received two scholarships of [[Oxford University]] for his higher studies in [[Sanskrit]]: ([[Boden Scholarship]], 1907 and  Casberd Exhibitioner, and award from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], where he was studying.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making of Britain|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/lala-har-dayal|publisher=Open University|accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> In a letter to ''[[The Indian Sociologist]]'', published in 1907, he started to explore [[anarchism|anarchist]] ideas, arguing that \"our object is not to reform government, but to reform it's{{sic|?}} away, leaving, if necessary only nominal traces of it's{{sic|?}} existence.\" The letter led to him being put under surveillance by the police. Later that year, saying \"To Hell with the [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]]\", he gave up the prestigious Oxford scholarships and returned to India in 1908 to live a life of austerity. But in India too, he started writing harsh articles in the leading news papers, When the British Government decided to impose a ban upon his writing Lala Lajpat Rai advised him to leave and go abroad. It was during this period that he came into the friendship of the anarchist [[Guy Aldred]], who was put on trial for printing ''The Indian Sociologist''.\n[[File:Paris Bande Mataram 17 August 1909.jpg|thumb|200px|August 1909 issue of the [[Vande Mataram]] published from [[Paris]]]]He moved to [[Paris]] in 1909 and became editor of the ''[[Bande Mataram (Paris publication)|Vande Mataram]]''. But he was not very happy in [[Paris]], so he left the Paris and moved to [[Algeria]]. There too, he was unhappy and wondering whether to go- either to [[Cuba]] or [[Japan]]. After all he went to [[Martinique]], where he started living a life of austerity. An Arya Samaj Missionary, [[Bhai Parmanand]] went there to look for him, and found him lonely and isolated. The two discussed founding a new religion modelled on Buddhism. Har Dayal was living an [[ascetic]] life eating only boiled grain and potatoes, sleeping on the floor and meditating in a secluded place. Guy Aldred later related that this religion's motto was to be [[Atheism]], [[Cosmopolitanism]] and [[Normative ethics|moral law]]. Emily Brown and Erik Erikson have described this as a crisis of \"ego-identity\" for him. Parmanand says that Har Dayal agreed to go to the [[United States]] to propagate the ancient culture of the [[Aryan Race]].\n[[File:Hardayal from \"Young India; an interpretation and a history of the nationalist movement from within\" (1916) (14781991012).jpg|thumb|Young Har Dayal]]\nHardayal went straight from [[Boston]] to [[California]], where he wrote an [[idyll]]ic account of life in the [[United States]]. He then moved on to [[Honolulu]] in [[Hawaii]] where he spent some time meditating on [[Waikiki Beach]]. During his stay he made friends with Japanese [[Buddhists]]. He also started studying the works of [[Karl Marx]]. Whilst here he wrote ''Some Phases of Contemporary Thought in India'' subsequently published in ''[[Modern Review (Calcutta)|Modern Review]]''. Parmanand persuaded him by letter to return to California.\n\n=== Anarchist activism in America ===\n[[File:Guru Govind Singh Sahib educational scholarships brochure.jpg|left|thumb|Brochure of the ''Guru Govind Singh Sahib Educational Scholarship'']]\n{{Anarchism sidebar}}\nHe moved to the [[United States]] in 1911, where he became involved in [[industrial unionism]].  He had also served as secretary of the [[San Francisco]] branch of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] alongside [[Fritz Wolffheim]], (later a [[National Bolshevik]] after he had left IWW and joined the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]]).  In a statement outlining the principles of the ''Fraternity of the Red Flag'' he said they proposed \"the establishment of Communism, and the abolition of private property in land and capital through industrial organisation and the [[general strike]], ultimate abolition of the coercive organisation of government\".  A little over a year later, this group was given {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of land and a house in [[Oakland]], where he founded the ''[[Bakunin]] Institute of California'', which he described as \"the first [[monastery]] of anarchism\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | authorlink=Paul Avrich| title = Anarchist Portraits | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | location = Princeton | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-691-00609-1 |page=30}}</ref> The organisation aligned itself with the ''[[Regeneración]]'' movement founded by the exiled [[Mexico|Mexicans]] [[Ricardo Flores Magon|Ricardo]] and [[Enrique Flores Magón]].  He had a designated post of a lecturer in Indian philosophy and Sanskrit at Leland  [[Stanford University]]. However, he was forced to resign because of embarrassment about his activities in the [[anarchist]] movement.\n\nHe had developed contacts with [[Indian American]] farmers in [[Stockton, California]]. Having developed an Indian [[Nationalist]] perspective, he encouraged young Indians to gain a [[scientific]] and [[sociological]] education.  With the personal help of Teja Singh, [[Tarak Nath Das]] and [[Arthur Pope]] and funding from Jwala Singh, a rich farmer from Stockton, he set up ''Guru Govind Singh Sahib Educational Scholarship'' for Indian students. With Shyamji Krishna Verma's ''India House'' in London, he established his house as a home for these students. Amongst the six students who responded to the offer were Nand Singh Sehra, Darisi Chenchiah and [[Gobind Behari Lal]], his wife's cousin.  They lived together in a rented apartment close to the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\n=== Assassination attempt on Viceroy of India ===\n{{stack|[[File:India House today.jpg|thumb|right|[[India House]] where [[Lala Har Dayal]] stayed]]}}\nAt the time, he was still a vigorous anarchist propagandist and had very little to do with the nationalist Nalanda Club, composed of Indian students.  However [[Basanta Kumar Biswas]]'s attempt on the life of the Indian Viceroy, [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge]], on 23 December 1912 had a major impact upon him.  He visited the Nalanda Club Hostel to tell them this news at dinner. He delivered a rousing lecture, which ended with the following couplet of the Urdu poet Mir Taqi 'Mir' of Delhi (India):\n\n::\"Pagari apani sambhaliyega 'Mir' !\n::Aur basti nahin, ye [[Delhi|Dilli]] hai !!\"\n\n::\"Take care of your [[turban]] Mr Mir ! (Note: Here Mir is Quoted for Britishers.)\n::This is not just any town, this is Delhi, [[India]] Okay !!'\n\nThe hostel then became a party with dancing and the singing of ''Vande Mataram''. Hardayal excitedly told his anarchist friends of what one of his men had done in India.\n\nHe quickly brought out a pamphlet called the ''Yugantar Circular'' in which he eulogised about the bombing:\n\n{{quote|HAIL ! HAIL ! HAIL !<br> BOMB OF 23 DECEMBER 1912<br> HARBINGER OF HOPE AND COURAGE<br> DEAR REAWAKENER OF SLUMBERING SOULS<br> CONCENTRATED MORAL DYNAMITE<br>THE ESPERANTO OF REVOLUTION<br>“Who can describe the moral power of the bomb? It is concentrated moral dynamite. When the strong and cunning in the pride of their power parade their glory before their helpless victims, when the rich and naughty set themselves on a pedestal and ask their slaves to fall down before them and worship them, when the wicked ones on the Earth seem exalted to the sky and nothing appears to withstand their might, then in that dark hour, for the glory of humanity comes the bomb, which lays the tyrant in the dust. It tells all the cowering slaves that he who sits enthroned as God, is a mere man like them. Then, in that hour of shame, a bomb preaches the eternal truth of human equality and sends proud superiors and Viceroys from the palace and the howdah to the grave and the hospital. Then, in that tense moment, when human nature is ashamed of itself, the bomb declares the vanity of power and pomp and redeems us from our own baseness.\n\nHOW GREAT WE FEEL WHEN SOMEONE DOES THE HEROIC DEED? WE SHARE IN HIS MORAL POWER. WE REJOICE IN HIS ASSERTION OF HUMAN EQUALITY AND DIGNITY.\"|''Lala Hardayal'' (Yugantar Circular:1913)}}\n\nIn April 1914, he was arrested by the United States government for spreading [[anarchist]] literature and fled to [[Berlin, Germany]]. He subsequently lived for a decade in [[Sweden]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] degree in 1930 from the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] at the [[University of London]]. In 1932, he got his book ''Hints For Self Culture'' published and embarked on a lecture circuit covering [[Europe]], India, and the United States.\n\nHe died in Philadelphia on March 4, 1939. In the evening of his death he delivered a lecture as usual where he had said \"I am in peace with all\". But a very close friend of Lala Hardayal and the founder member of ''Bharat Mata Society'' (established in 1907), [[Lala Hanumant Sahai]] did not accept the death as natural, he suspected it as poisoning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol-2)|last=Dr.'Krant'|first=M.L.Verma|year=2006|publisher=Praveen Prakashan|location=New Delhi-110002 (India)|page=452|isbn=81-7783-120-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, the India Department of Posts issued a commemorative stamp in his honour, within the series of \"India's Struggle for Freedom\".\n\n==Literature of Lala Har Dayal==\nSome of his books with available references are listed hereunder:<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Swadhinta Sangram Ke Krantikari Sahitya Ka Itihas'' (Vol-2)|last=Dr.'Krant'|first=M.L.Verma|year=2006|publisher=Praveen Prakashan|location=New Delhi (India)|page=453 to 458|isbn=81-7783-120-8}}</ref>\n\n# '''[http://www.hindustanbooks.com/books/our_educational_problem/OurEducationalProblem.html Our Educational Problem]''': Collection of Lalaji's articles published in 'Punjabi'(published from Lahore) published as a book in 1922 with introduction from [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]\n# '''Thoughts on Education''': Lalaji had written so many articles in 'Punjabi'( published from Lahore) and 'Modern Review' (published from Calcutta).

It reflects the individuality of every religion in a rational way of thinking. This book was also published by Jaico Publishing House India from Bombay.\n# '''Bodhisatva Doctrines''': Lala Lajpat Rai, who was a mentor of Har Dayal, had suggested him to write an authentic book based on the principles of Gautam Buddha. In 1927 when Har Dayal was not given permission by British Government to return to India, he decided to remain in London. He wrote this book and presented it to the University as a thesis. The book was approved for Ph.D. and a Doctorate was awarded to him in 1932. It was published from London in the year 1932. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers of India published this book in 1970 with a title 'The Bodhisatva Doctrines in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature.'\n\n===The Bodhisatva Doctrines in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature===\n\nThis 392 page work of Lala Hardayal consists of 7 chapters which deal with the Bodhisattva doctrine as expounded in the principal Buddhist Sanskrit Literature.\n\n*In Chapter I the nature of the Bodhisattva doctrine is described, with particular emphasis upon the distinct characteristics of arhat, Bodhisattva and sravaka.\n*Chapter II recounts the different factors which contributed to the rise and growth of the Boddhisattva doctrine including the influences of Persian religio-cult, Greek art and Christian ethics.\n*In Chapter III the production of the thought of Enlightenment for the welfare and liberation of all creatures is expounded.\n*Chapters IV describes thirty-seven practices and principles conducive to the attainment of Enlightenment.\n*In Chapter V ten perfections that lead to welfare, rebirth, serenity, spiritual cultivation, and supreme knowledge are explained.\n*Chapter VI defines different stages of spiritual progress in the aspirant`s long journey to the goal of final emancipation.\n*The last Chapter VII relates the events of the Gautama Buddha`s past lives as Bodhisattva.\n\nThis  book contains comprehensive notes and references besides a general index appended at the end.

Surely from such a person alone could one ask: \"Good Master, what shall I do to inhirit eternal life?\" Let us drink deep at this spring and wax glad and strong and brave in every nerve and fibre of our being. He was one of the race of those who wrote the New Era in blood. His course was laborious, truthful, simple, independent, noble; and all these in an eminent degree. His experience of the inward and the outward battle was not inconsiderable and it was not confined to his early manhood, but was spread over his whole life. Lala Har Dayal had the [[Janak]] and [[Dadhichi]] touch and his life demonstrated that he had what it takes.''|'''Prof. Dharmavira'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=''Thoughts On Education'' by L.
