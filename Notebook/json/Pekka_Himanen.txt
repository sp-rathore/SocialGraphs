He studied [[philosophy]] (and [[computer science]] as a minor) at the [[University of Helsinki]]. In 1994, with his thesis on the [[philosophy of religion]], ''The challenge of [[Bertrand Russell]]'', he received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the same university, thus becoming the youngest Ph.D. in Finland.\n\nHe has done research work in [[Finland]] ([[University of Helsinki]]), the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] ([[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]) and has done field work in [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]. At UC Berkeley, Himanen directed the Berkeley Center for the Information Society, a research group under Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. The Center was active from September 2002 until 2005 [http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/BCIS/].\n\nHimanen has also been a counselor to the president of Finland, Finnish government (including the Ministry of Education) and Finnish parliament, in the field of [[information society]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nHe has been a Visiting Professor at the [[Oxford Internet Institute]] (based at [[Oxford University]]) from September 2005 to July 2006.\n\nIn his book '''''[[HimEros]]''''' written as a [[dialogue]], [[Socrates]]’ wife [[Xanthippe]] relates to the [[Helsinki]]an what happened to Socrates in [[Hades]], how Socrates decided to escape from Hades and go to study philosophy at the [[University of Helsinki]], and how he was arrested, sentenced to death and executed as a result of a three-day conversation with the philosophers of the University. Xanthippe also transmits Socrates’ dialogue with the university teachers of philosophy Cyborg ([[Stephen Hawking]]), Pope ([[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]]), Unabomber ([[Theodore Kaczynski]]) and Madonna ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] Ciccone).\n\nIn '''''[[The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age]]''''', Himanen is trying to understand the core of [[informationalism]], the post-[[industrialism|industrialist]] [[paradigm]], extending the ideas of [[Manuel Castells]]' ''Information Age''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As an alternative to the [[Capitalism|industrial-capitalist]] [[protestant work ethic]] he proposes a  [[hacker ethic]] as something like a cyber [[communitarianism]]. The structure of the information society is a web, which in contemporary business world  manifests itself, for instance, in dynamic [[outsourcing]] and even cooperation with one's competitors. The \"knots\" of such a web get activated according to the needs and opportunities.\n\nAccording to Himanen, the three main features of hacker ethic are:\n* enthusiastic, passionate attitude to the work that is enjoyed\n* [[creativity]], wish to realise oneself and one's ability, often in teams that are formed spontaneously (project orientation)\n* wish to share one's skills with a community having common goals, along with the need to acquire recognition from one's \"tribe\"; one is motivated by inner zeal rather than external awards: the fruits of one's work are donated to everybody for their advances and further developments\n\nAccording to Himanen, the social hackerism begins from such things as [[vegetarianism]], whereas the opposite of it is represented by [[Microsoft]] and the licensing of [[computer program]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Himanen thinks that in the information society we need a radical lack of prejudice, such as he has met in philosophy lessons to children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}  A critical challenge of the [[Internet]] era is the ability to meet the other human being.\n\n==Global Dignity==\n\nIn 2006, he established [[Global Dignity]] with [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway]] and [[John Hope Bryant]]. Global Dignity is an independent, non-political organization that promotes the universal right of every human being to lead a dignified life.\n\n==Criticism and negative publicity==\n\nTwo Finnish journalists, Anu Silfverberg and Johanna Vehkoo, published a critical investigation of Himanen's research funding from public sources, the outcomes of his research, as well as his use of the title of \"professor\" without holding a professorship.<ref>[http://longplay.fi/himasen_etiikka/ Silfverberg Anu ja Johanna Vehkoo.
