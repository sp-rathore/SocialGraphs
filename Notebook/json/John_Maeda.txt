Cooper was a director of MIT's Visible Language Workshop. After completing his bachelor's and master's degrees at MIT, Maeda studied in Japan at [[Tsukuba University]]'s Institute of Art and Design to complete his Ph.D. in design.\n\nAs an artist, Maeda’s early work redefined the use of electronic media as a tool for expression by combining computer programming with traditional artistic technique, laying the groundwork for the interactive motion graphics that are taken for granted on the web today. He has exhibited in one-man shows in London, New York and Paris. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Cartier Foundation in Paris.\n\nAt RISD, Maeda led the movement to transform [[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) to [[STEAM fields|STEAM]] by adding Art. He states:<blockquote>I believe art and design are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century like science and technology did in the last century<ref name=\"Congressional STEAM Event\">{{cite web |\n  | url        = https://bonamici.house.gov/press-release/reps-bonamici-and-schock-announce-bipartisan-congressional-steam-caucus\n  | title      = Reps.
