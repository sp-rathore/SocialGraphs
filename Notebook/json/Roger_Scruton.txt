Nicholas Wroe wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Scruton was in the [[Latin Quarter in Paris]] at the time, watching students overturning cars to erect barricades, and tearing up cobblestones to throw at the police. \"I suddenly realized I was on the other side. What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous [[Marxist]] [[gobbledegook]]. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilization against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.\"<ref name=Wroe/>\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |align=left|width=44% |quote=&nbsp;Activist campaigns, which tend to be conducted in the name of the people as a whole, neither consult the people nor show much interest in noticing them—a point that was noticeable to Burke, in considering the insolence of the French revolutionaries. Such campaigns are affairs of elites who are seeking to triumph over real or imaginary adversaries, and who make an impact on politics because they share, in their hearts,  the old socialist view that things must be changed from the top downwards, and that the people themselves are not to be trusted now, but only later, when the revolutionary vanguard has completed its task.<ref>How to Think Seriously about the Planet: The Case for an Environmental Conservatism, p. 102</ref>\n|source=Scruton, writing in 2012}}\n\n''The Meaning of Conservatism'' (1980)—which he called \"a somewhat [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers\"<ref name=Scruton2005p51/>—was the book that he said blighted his academic career. He wrote in ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that he found several of [[Edmund Burke]]'s arguments in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during a crisis such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature. He further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the [[rule of law]], in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is \"the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality.'\" Real freedom, Scruton argued, does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', pp. 40–41.</ref> He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the social contract, including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote—to throw away customs and institutions—is to \"place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them.\"<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', p. 43.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |align=right|width=44% |quote=Armed with his Rousseauist doctrines of popular sovereignty, or his Marxist ideas of power and ideology, the revolutionary can de-legitimize any existing institution and find quite imperceivable the distinction between law aimed at justice and law aimed at power.<ref>Roger Scruton (1989), ''Man's Second Disobedience: A Vindication of Burke'', in Ceri Crossley and Ian Small (eds), ''The French Revolution and British Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 187–222.</ref>|source=Scruton, writing in 1989}}\n\nScruton argued that beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important: \"our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.\" A prejudice in favour of modesty in women and [[chivalry]] in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, though these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded.<ref>''Gentle Regrets'', p. 42.</ref>\n\nIn ''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), he marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', pp. 3, 19.</ref> He opposed elevating the \"nation\" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. He argued that \"conservatism and conservation\" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the [[social capital]] embodied in laws, customs, and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests; people impatient for reform—for example in the areas of [[euthanasia]] or [[abortion]]—are reluctant to accept what may be \"glaringly obvious to others—that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions.\"<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', pp. 15, 34, 69.</ref>\n\nHe defined [[post-modernism]] as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and therefore conflicts between views are nothing more than contests of power, and argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: \"The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true.\"<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'', pp. 106, 115, 117.</ref>\n\nScruton has also been critical of the contemporary feminist movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/jun/05/roger-scruton-interview|title=Roger Scruton: A pessimist's guide to life|author=Aida Edemariam|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Religion and totalitarianism===\nScruton contends, following [[Immanuel Kant]], that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for [[self-reflection]].<ref>Dooley, Mark. ''Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Continuum, 2009, pp. 12, 42.</ref> He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world. He writes that writers and artists such as [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Edward Hopper]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]] \"devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness.\" Scruton argues that because these thinkers directed their art at the few, it has never appealed to the many. He defines totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions—such as the law, property, and religion—that create authorities. Scruton writes, \"To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures.\" He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), pp. 142–143, 146–147, 150–153.</ref>\n\nScruton suggests that the importance of [[Newspeak]] in totalitarian societies is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with [[Alain Besançon]] that the totalitarian society envisaged by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions—conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief—that the conservative project acquires its sense.<ref>''Arguments for Conservatism'' (2006), pp. 162–163, 182, 194.</ref>\n\nScruton considers that religion plays a basic function in \"endarkening\" human minds. \"Endarkenment\" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers to be necessary in order to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviours.<ref>Ireland, P.

Scruton argues that the major feature of perversion is \"sexual release that avoids or abolishes the ''other''\", which he sees as [[narcissistic]] and [[solipsistic]].<ref name=Dollimore260>[[Dollimore, Jonathan]]. ''Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault''. Oxford University Press, 1991, pp. 260–261.</ref> He wrote in an essay, \"Sexual morality and the liberal consensus\" (1989), that [[homosexuality]] is a perversion for that reason because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own.<ref>Scruton, Roger. ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach''. Carcanet Press Limited, 1990, p. 268.</ref> Scruton's argument was that positive attitudes to homosexuality in society are socially deleterious because homosexuals have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. This basic antisocial impulse that Scruton argued was the consequence of homosexuality meant that he considered society to be justified in continuing to \"instil in our children feelings of revulsion\" towards homosexuality.<ref>Stafford, J. M. (1991). The two minds of Roger Scruton.
