The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], an independent school in the [[market town]] of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] in Britain, but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.<ref name=metamagical>{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&pg=PA484  484]|first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 |oclc=230812136}}</ref>\n\nTuring's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]].

If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}</ref> Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}</ref>\n\n===Christopher Morcom===\nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's \"first love\".

He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:<blockquote>I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]],<ref>Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2</ref> but this seems unlikely. Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: <blockquote>Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===University and work on computability===\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]], whence he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]],<ref>See Section 3 of John Aldrich, \"England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years\", Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique</ref> despite the fact that the committee had failed to identify that it had already been proven in 1922 by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88,94}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Turing published his paper \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ''Entscheidungsproblem''\" (1936).<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}</ref> In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\n\n[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]\nAlthough Turing's proof was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof<ref>{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}</ref> using his [[lambda calculus]], Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}</ref> It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.</ref> To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].\n\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}</ref> In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton;<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Turing | first1 = A.

The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.\n\nJack Good opined:\n\n{{quote|Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds, to the untrained ear, rather absurd; namely that, from a contradiction, you can deduce ''everything.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes|title=Heroes of World War II (TV Series 2004– )|work=IMDb}}</ref>}}\n[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|left|A complete and working replica of a [[bombe]] at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park]]\nThe bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10<sup>19</sup> states, or 10<sup>22</sup> states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),<ref>Professor Jack Good in \"The Men Who Cracked Enigma\", 2003: with his caveat: \"if my memory is correct\".</ref> the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electrically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer, they had had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named.

He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. At the time, there was acute public anxiety about homosexual entrapment of spies by Soviet agents,<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=269}}</ref> because of the recent exposure of the first two members of the [[Cambridge Five]], [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]], as [[KGB]] [[double agent]]s.

He had died the previous day. A [[post-mortem]] examination established that the cause of death was [[cyanide poisoning]]. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=488}}</ref> it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12 June 1954.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}</ref> Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative death theories===\nPhilosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold [[electroplating]] spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]].  Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.<ref name = \"Copeland\">{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.
