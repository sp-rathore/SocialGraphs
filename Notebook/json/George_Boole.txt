Contrary to widespread belief, Boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of Aristotle's logic. Rather he intended to systematise it, to provide it with a foundation, and to extend its range of applicability.<ref>[[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], Aristotle's Prior Analytics and Boole's Laws of Thought, History and Philosophy of Logic, vol.  24 (2003), pp. 261–288.</ref> Boole's initial involvement in logic was prompted by a current debate on [[quantification (logic)|quantification]], between [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] who supported the theory of \"quantification of the predicate\", and Boole's supporter [[Augustus De Morgan]] who advanced a version of [[De Morgan duality]], as it is now called.

The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the [[universe of discourse]]. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.<ref>George Boole. 1854/2003.

But this general concept was not available to him: he did not have the segregation standard in [[abstract algebra]] of postulated (axiomatic) properties of operations, and deduced properties.<ref name=KY>[[Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov]], [[Adolf Pavlovich Yushkevich]], ''Mathematics of the 19th Century: mathematical logic, algebra, number theory, probability theory'' (2001), pp. 15 (note 15)–16; [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3u5hJCkobYC&pg=PA15 Google Books].</ref> His work was a beginning to the [[algebra of sets]], again not a concept available to Boole as a familiar model. His pioneering efforts encountered specific difficulties, and the treatment of addition was an obvious difficulty in the early days.\n\nBoole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word 'and' and addition by the word 'or'. But in Boole's original system, + was a [[partial operation]]: in the language of [[set theory]] it would correspond only to [[disjoint union]] of subsets. Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as [[exclusive or]], or in set theory terms [[symmetric difference]]; this step means that addition is always defined.<ref name=Marc/><ref>{{cite SEP |url-id=algebra-logic-tradition |title=The Algebra of Logic Tradition |last=Burris |first=Stanley}}</ref>\n\nIn fact there is the other possibility, that + should be read as [[disjunction]],<ref name=KY/> This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer. Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both [[Boolean ring]]s and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure). Boole and [[William Stanley Jevons|Jevons]] struggled over just this issue in 1863, in the form of the correct evaluation of ''x'' + ''x''. Jevons argued for the result ''x'', which is correct for + as disjunction. Boole kept the result as something undefined. He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation ''x'' + ''x'' = 0 as implying ''x'' = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra.<ref name=SED/>\n\n===Probability theory===\nThe second part of the ''Laws of Thought'' contained a corresponding attempt to discover a general method in probabilities. Here the goal was algorithmic: from the given probabilities of any system of events, to determine the consequent probability of any other event logically connected with those events.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boole |first=George |title=An Investigation of the Laws of Thought |publisher=Walton & Maberly |year=1854 |location=London |pages=265–275 |url=https://archive.org/stream/investigationofl00boolrich#page/264/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[Boolean algebra]] is named after him, as is the crater [[Boole (crater)|Boole]] on the Moon. The keyword ''Bool'' represents a [[Boolean datatype]] in many programming languages, though [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]], among others, both use the full name ''Boolean''.<ref>P. J. Brown, ''Pascal from Basic'', Addison-Wesley, 1982.

A road called ''Boole Heights'' in Bracknell, Berkshire is named after him.\n\n===19th-century development===\nBoole's work was extended and refined by a number of writers, beginning with [[William Stanley Jevons]]. [[Augustus De Morgan]] had worked on the [[logic of relations]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] integrated his work with Boole's during the 1870s.<ref name=GGB>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], [[Gérard Bornet]], ''George Boole: Selected manuscripts on logic and its philosophy'' (1997), p. xlvi; [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR46 Google Books].</ref> Other significant figures were [[Platon Sergeevich Poretskii]], and [[William Ernest Johnson]]. The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a [[propositional calculus]] is credited to [[Hugh MacColl]] (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson.<ref name=GGB/> Surveys of these developments were published by [[Ernst Schröder]], [[Louis Couturat]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis]].\n\n===20th-century development===\n[[File:Hasse2Free.png|thumb|In modern notation, the [[free Boolean algebra]] on basic propositions ''p'' and ''q'' arranged in a [[Hasse diagram]]. The Boolean combinations make up 16 different propositions, and the lines show which are logically related.]]\n\nIn 1921 the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] published a book on probability theory, ''A Treatise of Probability''. Keynes believed that Boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis.<ref>Chapter XVI, p. 167, section 6 of ''A treatise on probability'', volume 4: \"The central error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two inconsistent definitions of 'independence' (2) He first wins the reader's acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition: \"Two events are said to be independent when the probability of either of them is unaffected by our ''expectation'' of the occurrence or failure of the other.\" (3) But a moment later he interprets the term in quite a different sense; for, according to Boole's second definition, we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either that they ''must'' concur or that they ''cannot'' concur. That is to say, they are independent unless we know for certain that there is, in fact, an invariable connection between them. \"The simple events, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', will be said to be ''conditioned'' when they are not free to occur in every possible combination; in other words, when some compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring. ... Simple unconditioned events are by definition independent.\" (1) In fact as long as ''xz'' is ''possible'', ''x'' and ''z'' are independent. This is plainly inconsistent with Boole's first definition, with which he makes no attempt to reconcile it. The consequences of his employing the term independence in a double sense are far-reaching. For he uses a method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which it is applied are independent in the first sense, and assumes that it is valid if they are independent in second sense. While his theorems are true if all propositions or events involved are independent in the first sense, they are not true, as he supposes them to be, if the events are independent only in the second sense.\"</ref> In his book ''The Last Challenge Problem'', David Miller provides a general method in accord with Boole's system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by Keynes and others. Theodore Hailperin showed much earlier that Boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems <ref name=Miller>[http://zeteticgleanings.com/boole.html http://zeteticgleanings.com/boole.html]</ref>\n\nBoole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses. [[Claude Shannon]] attended a philosophy class at the [[University of Michigan]] which introduced him to Boole's studies. Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant. In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical [[relay]]s then used in telephone routing switches. He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems. Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic [[digital computer]]s. [[Victor Shestakov]] at Moscow State University (1907–1987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than [[Claude Shannon]] in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians [[Sofya Yanovskaya]], Gaaze-Rapoport, [[Roland Dobrushin]], Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky, though they presented their academic theses in the same year, 1938.{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian). Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the [[Information Age]].<ref>\"That dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master's theses of the 20th century.

Combining his interests in mathematics and theology, he compared the Christian trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost with the three dimensions of space, and was attracted to the Hebrew conception of God as an absolute unity. Boole considered converting to [[Judaism]] but in the end was said to have chosen [[Unitarianism]]. Boole came to speak against a what he saw as \"prideful\" scepticism, and instead, favoured the belief in a \"Supreme Intelligent Cause\",<ref>Boole, George. Studies in Logic and Probability. 2002. Courier Dover Publications. p. 201-202</ref> He  also declared \"I firmly believe, for the accomplishment of a purpose of the [[Divinity|Divine]] Mind.\"<ref>Boole, George.

It was a flash of psychological insight into the conditions under which a mind most readily accumulates knowledge [...] For a few years he supposed himself to be convinced of the truth of \"the Bible\" as a whole, and even intended to take orders as a clergyman of the English Church. But by the help of a learned [[Jews|Jew]] in Lincoln he found out the true nature of the discovery which had dawned on him. This was that man's mind works by means of some mechanism which \"functions normally towards [[Monism]].\"<ref name=MaryBoole>Boole, Mary Everest ''Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century'', Boole, Mary Everest ''Collected Works'' eds. E. M. Cobham and E. S. Dummer, London, Daniel 1931 pp.947–967</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Ch. 13 of ''Laws of Thought'' Boole used examples of propositions from [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Samuel Clarke]]. The work contains some remarks on the relationship of logic to religion, but they are slight and cryptic.<ref>Grattan-Guinness and Bornet, p. 16; [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzg7UFsIVJIC&pg=PR16 Google Books].</ref> Boole was apparently disconcerted at the book's reception just as a mathematical toolset:\n<blockquote>George afterwards learned, to his great joy, that the same conception of the basis of Logic was held by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibnitz]], the contemporary of Newton. De Morgan, of course, understood the formula in its true sense; he was Boole's collaborator all along. Herbert Spencer, Jowett, and [[Robert Leslie Ellis]] understood, I feel sure; and a few others, but nearly all the logicians and mathematicians ignored [953] the statement that the book was meant to throw light on the nature of the human mind; and treated the formula entirely as a wonderful new method of reducing to logical order masses of evidence about external fact.<ref name=MaryBoole/></blockquote>\n\nMary Boole claimed that there was profound influence {{mdash}} via her uncle [[George Everest]] {{mdash}} of [[India]]n thought on George Boole, as well as on [[Augustus De Morgan]] and [[Charles Babbage]]:\n<blockquote>Think what must have been the effect of the intense Hinduizing of three such men as Babbage, De Morgan, and George Boole on the mathematical atmosphere of 1830–65.
