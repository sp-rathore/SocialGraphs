His father and mother ran a neighborhood candy store for a brief time, barely getting by. For many years his father was in the waiters' union and worked as a waiter for weddings and bar mitzvahs.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBoth parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending ten cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of [[Charles Dickens]]' collected works.<ref>[http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barzinn.htm Howard Zinn – One Step Ahead of the Landlord]</ref> As a young man, Zinn made the acquaintance of several young Communists from his Brooklyn neighborhood. They invited him to a political rally being held in [[Times Square]]. Despite it being a peaceful rally, mounted police charged the marchers. Zinn was hit and knocked unconscious. This would have a profound effect on his political and social outlook.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe also studied creative writing at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by principal and poet Elias Lieberman.<ref>[http://www.educationupdate.ccc/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html Appel, Jacob M.

Concerns about low wages and hazardous working conditions compelled Zinn and several other apprentices formed the Apprentice Association. At the time, apprentices were excluded from trade unions and thus had little in the way of bargaining power, the Apprentice Association was their answer.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The head organizers of the association, which included Zinn himself, would meet once a week outside of work to discuss strategy and read books that at the time were considered radical. Zinn was the Activities Director for the group. His time in this group would tremendously influence his political views and created for him an appreciation for unions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://howardzinn.org/howard-zinn-describes-work-in-the-navy-yards/|title=Howard Zinn Describes Work in the Navy Yards {{!}} HowardZinn.org|website=HowardZinn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-03}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nEager to fight [[fascism]], Zinn joined the U.S. [[Army Air Force]] during World War II and was assigned as a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the [[490th Bombardment Group]],<ref>''The Politics of History'' 2nd ed. by Howard Zinn (University of Illinois Press, 1990) pp. 258–274) ISBN 978-0-252-01673-8.</ref> bombing targets in [[Berlin]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Hungary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/v/Ehc3V1g5pm0&rel=1&border=0 |title=Film clip of Zinn |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> As bombardier, Zinn dropped [[napalm]] bombs in April 1945 on [[Royan#Destruction of Royan|Royan]], a seaside resort in southwestern France.<ref>{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |title=Declarations of Independence |year=1990 |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-06-092108-8}}</ref> The [[anti-war]] stance Zinn developed later was informed, in part, by his experiences.\n\nOn a post-doctoral research mission nine years later, Zinn visited the resort near [[Bordeaux]] where he interviewed residents, reviewed municipal documents, and read wartime newspaper clippings at the local library. In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, ''The Politics of History''. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than a thousand French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described \"in all accounts\" he found as ''\"une tragique erreur\"'' that leveled a small but ancient city and \"its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe.\" In ''The Politics of History'', Zinn described how the bombing was ordered—three weeks before the war in Europe ended—by military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the [[Eighth Air Force]] attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] in what was then [[Czechoslovakia]]. The official history stated that the famous [[Škoda Works|Skoda]] works in Pilsen \"received 500 well-placed tons,\" and that \"because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons.\"\n\nZinn wrote: <blockquote>I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'Skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)—not five.<ref>''The Politics of History'' p. 260.</ref></blockquote>\n\nZinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |publisher=Progressive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of cities such as [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]], Royan, [[Bombing of Tokyo|Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the [[War in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the war in [[Iraq]] and the civilian casualties during bombings in [[Afghanistan]] during the current war there. In his pamphlet, ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence''<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080725072904 |url=http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html |title=Zinn ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence'' by Howard Zinn }}.</ref> written in 1995, he laid out the case against targeting civilians with aerial bombing.\n\nSix years later, he wrote: <blockquote>Recall that in the midst of the [[Gulf War]], the U.S. military bombed an [[Amiriyah shelter massacre|air raid shelter]], killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombing—and no one has bombed more than this nation—is a history of endless atrocities, all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and 'collateral damage'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zinn |first=Howard |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 |title=\"A Just Cause, Not a Just War\" '&#39;The Progressive'&#39; December 2001 |publisher=Commondreams.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Education===\nAfter World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951.

His classes in [[civil liberties]] were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A professor of [[political science]], he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 64.\n\n\"He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior,\" said Caryl Rivers, [[journalism]] professor at Boston University. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60R5D020100128 Activist, historian Howard Zinn dies at 87] by Ros Krasny at [[Reuters]] January 28, 2010.

Biographer [[Martin Duberman]] noted that when he was asked directly if he was a Marxist, Zinn replied, \"Yes, I'm something of a Marxist.\" He especially was influenced by the liberating vision of the young Marx in overcoming alienation, and disliked Marx's later dogmatism. In later life he moved more toward [[anarchism]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Duberman|title=Howard Zinn: A Life on the Left|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqmA95DdNkC&pg=PA199|year=2012|publisher=New Press|page=199}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote a history textbook, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history. The textbook depicts the struggles of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against [[slavery]], unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against [[patriarchy]], and African-Americans for [[civil rights]]. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in 1981.<ref>[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba_winners_finalist_50_07.pdf The National Book Awards Winners & Finalists].

The ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' stated in 2006 that the book \"routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year\".<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30donadio.html \"Backlist to the Future\"] by Rachel Donadio, July 30, 2006.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Zinn published ''[[Voices of a People's History of the United States]]'' with Anthony Arnove. ''Voices'' is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in ''A People's History.''\n\nIn 2008, the [[Teaching for Change#Zinn Education Project|Zinn Education Project]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zinnedproject.org|title=Zinn Education Project|work=Zinn Education Project}}</ref> was launched to support educators using ''A People's History of the United States'' as a source for middle and high school history. The Project was started when a former student of Zinn, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations, Rethinking Schools and [[Teaching for Change]] to coordinate the Project. The Project hosts a website that has over 100 free downloadable lesson plans to complement ''A People's History of the United States''.\n\n''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', released in 2010, is a documentary movie based on ''A People's History of the United States'' and inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States.

Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times''. His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, \"are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me.

Defense attorneys asked Zinn to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II through 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, and later reflected on his time before the jury. <blockquote>I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply embarrassing to our government because what was revealed, in the government's own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public. The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people.<ref>Zinn's autobiography{{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}</ref></blockquote> Most of the jurors later said that they voted for acquittal.

Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|burglary of the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist]].\n\nZinn's testimony on the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by [[Erwin Griswold]], who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration, sued ''The New York Times'' in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971 to stop publication.<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/21/opinion/op-blanton21 |title=The lie behind the secrets |author=Blanton, Tom |date=2006-05-21 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2013-07-28}}</ref> Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop ''The New York Times'' from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as \"[[prior restraint]]\" that has been held to be illegal under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The papers were simultaneously published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', effectively nullifying the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted there had been no national security damage resulting from publication.<ref name=\"latimes\" /> In a column in the ''Washington Post'', Griswold wrote: \"It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over-classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another.\"\n\nZinn supported the G.I. antiwar movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film ''[[Unfinished Symphony: Democracy and Dissent]]'', Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 antiwar march by [[Vietnam Veterans against the War]]. The marchers traveled from [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]], \"which retraced [[Paul Revere]]'s ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police.\" The film depicts \"scenes from the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings,<ref>{{cite book |title=Winter Soldier Investigation |year=1971}}</ref> during which former G.I.s testified about \"atrocities\" they either participated in or said they had witnessed committed by U.S. forces in Vietnam.<ref>[http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/unfinished.pdf Cineaste] pp. 91, 96.

In an interview with ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'' he said, <blockquote>We certainly should not be initiating a war, as it's not a clear and present danger to the United States, or in fact, to anyone around it. If it were, then the states around Iraq would be calling for a war on it. The Arab states around Iraq are opposed to the war, and if anyone's in danger from Iraq, they are. At the same time, the U.S. is violating the U.N. charter by initiating a war on Iraq. Bush made a big deal about the number of resolutions Iraq has violated—and it's true, Iraq has not abided by the resolutions of the Security Council. But it's not the first nation to violate Security Council resolutions. Israel has violated Security Council resolutions every year since 1967. Now, however, the U.S. is violating a fundamental principle of the U.N. Charter, which is that nations can't initiate a war—they can only do so after being attacked. And Iraq has not attacked us.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hamm|first=Theodore|title=Howard Zinn in Conversation with Theodore Hamm|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=Autumn 2002|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2002/10/express/howard-zinn-with-theodore-hamm}}</ref></blockquote> He asserted that the U.S. would end Gulf War II when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam.
