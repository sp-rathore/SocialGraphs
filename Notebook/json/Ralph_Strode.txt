He belonged, like [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Bonaventure]], to that \"School of the Middle\" which mediated between [[Philosophical realism|realist]]s and [[nominalist]]s.\n\nBesides his ''Logica'', he wrote ''Consequentiae'', a treatise on the [[syllogism]], and ''Obligationes'' or ''Scholastica militia'', a series of \"formal exercises in scholastic dialectics.\" He had some not unfriendly controversy with his colleague [[John Wyclif]], against whom he defended the possession of wealth by the clergy, and held that in the Church abuses were better than disturbance. He also attacked Wyclif's doctrine of [[predestination]]. His positions are gathered from Wyclif's ''Responsiones ad Rodolphum Strodum'' (MS. 3926, Vienna Imperial Library).\n\n[[Chaucer]] dedicates his poem ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' to the contemporary poet [[John Gower]] and to Strode:\n{{Quotation|\n\"O moral Gower, this book I directe<br>\nTo the, and to the, philosophical Strode,<br>\nTo vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to correcte,<br>\nOf youre benignités and zeles goode.\n|(Book V, 1856-1860)}}\n\nModern English translation: \"O moral Gower, I permit this book to you, and to you, philosophical Strode, to correct, away from your benevolence and zealous goodness.\" It is quite possible that [[Troilus and Criseyde]] was dedicated to \"philosophical\" (in one of the manuscripts: \"logical\"){{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Strode because the philosopher introduced [[Chaucer]] to some of the basic philosophical distinctions between late medieval [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Thus, Chaucer's [[literary nominalism]] in his longest complete poem may well be due to his acquaintance with Strode.<ref>Richard Utz, ''Literarischer Nominalismus im Spätmittelalter'' (Frankfurt: Lang, 1990), esp. pp. 53-58; Rodney Delasanta \"Chaucer and Strode,\" ''Chaucer Review'' 26.2 (1991), 205-218.</ref>\n\nAccording to the 15th-century ''Vetus catalogus'' of fellows of Merton, Strode himself was a \"poeta nobilis.\" [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[John Bale]] confirm this, but none of Strode's poems have survived. However, Professor Gollancz suggested that the ''Phantasma Radulphi'' attributed to Strode in the Vetus Catalogus could be the 14th-century elegiac poem ''The Pearl'', but this has found no support from later scholars and, on the basis of the poem's dialect, seems very unlikely.\n\nFrom 1375 to 1385 this Strode or another of the same name was [[Common Serjeant of London]]; he died in 1387.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Logica'', (unedited apart from ''Consequentie and Obligationes''; the manuscript can be found in Bodl.
