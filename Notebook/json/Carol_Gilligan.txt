Despite being Kohlberg's research assistant, Gilligan argued that [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] were male-oriented, which limited their ability to be generalized to females. Gilligan thus proposed her theory of stages of female moral development based on her idea of moral voices. According to Gilligan, there are two kinds of moral voices: that of the masculine and the feminine. The masculine voice is \"logical and individualistic\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Muuss|first1=R.E.|title=Carol Gilligan's theory of sex differences in the development of moral reasoning during adolescence.|journal=Adolescence|date=1988|volume=23|issue=89|pages=229–43}}</ref> meaning that the emphasis in moral decisions is protecting the rights of people and making sure justice is upheld. The feminine voice places more emphasis on protecting interpersonal relationships and taking care of other people. This voice focuses on the \"care perspective,\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kyte|first1=Richard|title=Moral reasoning as perception: A reading of Carol Gilligan|journal=Hypatia|date=1996|volume=11|issue=3|pages=97–113|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1996.tb01017.x}}</ref> which means focusing on the needs of the individual in order to make an ethical decision. For Gilligan, Kohlberg's stages of moral development were emphasizing the masculine voice, making it difficult to accurately gauge a woman's moral development because of this incongruity in voices. Gilligan argues that androgyny, or integrating the masculine and the feminine, is the best way to realize one's potential as a human. Gilligan's stages of female moral development has been shown in business settings as an explanation to the different ways men and women handle ethical issues in the workplace as well.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Thomas|title=Business, ethics, and Carol Gilligan's \"Two Voices\"|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|date=1992|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–61|doi=10.2307/3857223}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n*1992 ''[[University of Louisville]] [[Grawemeyer Award]] in Education''<ref name=grawemeyer.org>{{cite web|title=1992- Carol Gilligan|url=http://grawemeyer.org/education/previous-winners/1992-carol-gilligan.html}}</ref> \n*1996 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' - one of the 25 most influential Americans\n*1998 ''4th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in the Human Condition''<ref>[http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/carol-gilligan The Heinz Awards, Carol Gilligan profile]</ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | last = Gilligan | first = Carol | title = [[In a Different Voice|In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development]] | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1982  }} ISBN 9780674445444\n* {{cite book | last = Gilligan | first = Carol | title = Mapping the moral domain: a contribution of women's thinking to psychological theory and education | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780674548312 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Gilligan | first1 = Carol | title = Making connections: the relational worlds of adolescent girls at Emma Willard School | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780674540415 |display-authors=etal}}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Gilligan | first1 = Carol | last2 = Brown | first2 = Lyn M. | title = Meeting at the crossroads: women's psychology and girls' development | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780674564640 }}\n* {{cite book | last1 = Gilligan | first1 = Carol | last2 = McLean Taylor | first2 = Jill | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = Amy M. | title = Between voice and silence: women and girls, race and relationships | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780674068797 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Gilligan | first = Carol | title = The birth of pleasure  | publisher = [[Alfred A.
