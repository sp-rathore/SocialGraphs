      <p>The <b>Weyauwega derailment</b> was a <!--del_lnk--> railroad accident that occurred in <!--del_lnk--> Weyauwega, Wisconsin, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">USA</a> in the early morning hours of <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1996. The derailed train was carrying a large quantity of hazardous material, which immediately caught fire. The fire, which involved the train cars themselves and an adjacent <!--del_lnk--> feed mill, burned for more than two weeks after the actual derailment, and resulted in the <!--del_lnk--> emergency evacuation of 2,300 people for 16 days; notably, the entire city of Weyauwega was evacuated, with about 1,700 evacuees alone.<p>

      <p>At approximately 5:49 am, an 81 car <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin Central train traveling from <!--del_lnk--> Stevens Point, Wisconsin to <!--del_lnk--> Neenah, Wisconsin, approached the city of Weyauwega at 48.3 miles per hour, travelling on a downward grade. The first sixteen cars of the train passed a <!--del_lnk--> turnout without incident, after which 37 cars behind them derailed at the location of the switch, at 5:49:32 AM. A subsequent NTSB investigation found the cause of the derailment to be a broken rail within the turnout that was the result of an undetected bolt hole fracture. The derailed cars included 7 <!--del_lnk--> tank cars of <!--del_lnk--> liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), 7 tank cars of <!--del_lnk--> propane and two tank cars of <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium_hydroxide.htm" title="Sodium hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>. The derailment ruptured three of the tank cars and spilled both LPG and propane, which immediately ignited. The conductor of the train cut the train after the first nine cars, and proceeded onward 1.5 miles. He informed local law enforcement of the hazardous material the train was carrying, and was instructed to tell the fire chief.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>When the local fire crew arrived on the scene five minutes after the derailment, fireballs were exploding up to 300 <!--del_lnk--> feet (90 <!--del_lnk--> m) high that were visible for nearly 13 <!--del_lnk--> miles (21 <!--del_lnk--> km). Fire spread to a nearby feed mill and storage building that were both difficult to access by the fire crew because the derailed train was blocking the <!--del_lnk--> grade crossing. High tension power lines were also torn down by the derailment, which caused secondary electrical fires. In total, seven of the tank cars of LPG and propane leaked, and the two sodium hydroxide tank cars leaked their contents. Electricity and <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> service to 25% of the city of Weyauwega was disrupted, and city water services had to be shut off because of a rupture in a <!--del_lnk--> water main.<p>Jim Baehnman, the Assistant Fire Chief (the commanding Fire Chief, Gary Hecker, was on vacation the day that the accident occurred) quickly determined that the accident was beyond the scope of Weyauwega&#39;s fire department. Fire crews from 10 surrounding departments were called in to help with the recovery. At a time between 10 minutes and one hour after the derailment, it became known that propane and LPG were involved in this derailment; this was at the time the train&#39;s conductor was able to get a ride from a local resident to the Weyauwega fire station, where this information was relayed.<p>One hour after the derailment, Wisconsin Central Railroad informed responding firefighters that the tank cars could withstand approximately 90 minutes of fire. Additionally, the head end of the train was rolled back to the accident scene, and pulled away seven cars of the train that were not derailed. At this point, a decision was made by the fire chief to pull firefighters back from the derailment, because of the risk of a <!--del_lnk--> BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion). This evacuation of personnel was two blocks for one hour, then 1 mile, and finally 1.5 miles; the initial evacuation was done so quickly that fire hoses in use were abandoned and froze where they lay.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Baehnman also made the decision to evacuate the entire city of Weyauwega, a decision which displaced approximately 1,700 residents of the city, and 600 additional people in surrounding rural areas. The scope of the resulting fire and leaking of chemicals kept residents evacuated for just over two weeks, and many of the fires that erupted as a result of the derailment burned for most of the 18-day evacuation.<p>The weather may have helped ease the situation for firefighters; the ambient temperature at the time of the derailment was only 10 F and there was still snow on the ground. Both factors may have helped prevent a BLEVE explosion within the first hour of the disaster, while emergency personnel were still on site. Ultimately, one of the cars containing LPG <i>was</i> involved in a BLEVE, causing a large fireball several hours after the accident. On <!--del_lnk--> March 20, officials in charge of the evacuation and disaster recovery declared the town safe for residents to return to their homes.<p><a id="Pets_in_the_evacuation_zone" name="Pets_in_the_evacuation_zone"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pets in the evacuation zone</span></h2>
      <p>Residents who were worried about pets that they left behind started illegally re-entering the 1.5 mile evacuation zone within two days of the derailment to rescue them. Just over half of the population evacuated without their pets. The acting Fire Chief declared that the situation was too dangerous to the public and emergency personnel to mount a pet rescue. Fearing a worse disaster, his decision was overruled by the Governor&#39;s office; the Emergency Operations Centre organized an official pet rescue to take place on <!--del_lnk--> March 8. The <!--del_lnk--> National Guard was activated to help with the recovery efforts; they escorted pet owners back to their residences to rescue their pets, then stayed to help fire crews with the accident recovery.<p><a id="Litigation_and_costs" name="Litigation_and_costs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Litigation and costs</span></h2>
      <p>Nine individuals who were affected by the evacuation filed a class action suit seeking punitive and treble damages against Wisconsin Central on <!--del_lnk--> March 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1996. By the end of the year, thirteen more families and two business joined the suit against the railroad, and another business filed a separate suit for damages in <!--del_lnk--> Waupaca County District Court. Another company filed a separate suit in US District Court for damages. Both of the separate suits were eventually dismissed. In 1998, the railroad estimated the costs from the derailment and class action suit to be valued at <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>28&nbsp;million, of which Wisconsin Central had paid $27.2&nbsp;million by the end of 1998.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyauwega_derailment&quot;</div>
