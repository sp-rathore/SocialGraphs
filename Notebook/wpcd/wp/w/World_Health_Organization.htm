      <p>WHO&#39;s constitution states that its mission &quot;is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health&quot;. Its major task is to combat disease, especially key infectious diseases, and to promote the general health of the peoples of the world. As well as coordinating international efforts to monitor outbreaks of infectious disease such as <!--del_lnk--> SARS, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>, it also has programs to combat such diseases, by developing and distributing vaccines. After years of fighting <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, WHO declared in 1979 that the disease had been eradicated - the first disease in history to be completely eliminated by deliberate human design. WHO is nearing success in developing vaccines against <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and <!--del_lnk--> schistosomiasis and aims to eradicate <!--del_lnk--> polio within the next few years. The organization has already endorsed the world&#39;s first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for <a href="../../wp/z/Zimbabwe.htm" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> from <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, making it an international standard.<!--del_lnk--> <p>WHO also compiles the widely followed <!--del_lnk--> International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The tenth revision of the ICD was released in 1992 and a searchable version is available online on the WHO website, although it is not comprehensive. Later revisions are indexed and available in hardcopy versions. The WHO does not permit simultaneous classification in two separate areas.<p>The constitution of WHO defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not as consisting only of the absence of disease or infirmity or mental retardation.<p>In addition to its work in eradicating disease, WHO also carries out campaigns &mdash; for example, to boost consumption of fruits and <!--del_lnk--> vegetables worldwide, or to discourage <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> consumption &ndash; and conducts research: for instance, into whether or not the <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic field surrounding <!--del_lnk--> cell phones has a negative influence on health. Some of this work can be controversial, such as the April 2003 WHO report which recommended that <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> be no more than 10% of a healthy diet, which led to lobbying by the sugar industry against this recommendation <!--del_lnk--> .<p>In addition to WHO&#39;s stated mission, international treaties assign the Organization a variety of responsibilities. For instance, the <!--del_lnk--> Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and the <!--del_lnk--> Convention on Psychotropic Substances call on WHO to issue binding scientific and medical assessments of psychoactive drugs and recommend how they should be regulated. In this way, WHO acts as a check on the power of the drug policymaking <!--del_lnk--> Commission on Narcotic Drugs.<p><a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h3>

      <p>WHO Member States <!--del_lnk-->  appoint delegations to the <!--del_lnk--> World Health Assembly, WHO&#39;s supreme decision-making body. The Assembly generally meets in May each year, and as well as appointing the Director-General (for five-year terms), supervises the financial policies of the Organization, and reviews and approves the proposed programme budget. The Assembly elects 34 members who are technically qualified in the field of health for three-year terms to an Executive Board. The main functions of the Board are to give effect to the decisions and policies of the Assembly, to advise it and generally to facilitate its work.<p><a id="Membership" name="Membership"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Membership</span></h3>
      <p>WHO has 193 Member States, including all <!--del_lnk--> UN Member States except <a href="../../wp/l/Liechtenstein.htm" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, and 2 non-UN-members, <a href="../../wp/n/Niue.htm" title="Niue">Niue</a> and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>.

      <p>WHO is financed by contributions from member states and from donors. In recent years, WHO&#39;s work has involved more collaboration, currently around 80 such partnerships, with <!--del_lnk--> NGOs and the <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceutical industry, as well as with foundations such as the <!--del_lnk--> Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Foundation. Voluntary contributions to the WHO from national and local governments, foundations and NGOs, other UN organizations, and the private sector (including pharmaceutical companies), now exceed that of assessed contributions (dues) from its 193 member nations. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="People" name="People"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">People</span></h3>
      <p>The day-to-day work of WHO is carried out by its Secretariat, which is staffed by some 8,500 health and other experts and support staff, working at headquarters, in the six regional offices, and in the individual representation offices in 147 countries.

      <p>Quite uncharacteristically for a UN Agency, the six (6) Regional Offices of WHO have a remarkable amount of autonomy. Each Regional Office is headed by a Regional Director (RD), who is elected by the Regional Committee for that Region, for a once-renewable five-year term. The name of the RD-elect is then transmitted to the WHO Executive Board, at the headquarters in Geneva, which proceeds to confirm the appointment. It is rare that an elected Regional Director not be confirmed.<p>The Regional Committee of WHO for each region consists of all the Health Department heads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region. Aside from electing the Regional Director, the Regional Committee is also in charge of setting the guidelines for the implementation of all the Health and other policies adopted by the <!--del_lnk--> World Health Assembly, within their region. The Regional Committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of WHO within the Region.<p>The Regional Director is effectively the head of the WHO for their particular region. The RD manages and/or supervises a staff of health and other experts, at the regional headquarters and in specialized centers. The RD is also the direct supervising authority &mdash; concomitantly with the WHO Director General &mdash; of all the heads of WHO country offices within their region, known as WHO Representatives.<p>The Regional Offices are:<ul>
       <li>Regional Office for Africa (<!--del_lnk--> AFRO)<sup>I</sup>, with headquarters in <!--del_lnk--> Brazzaville, <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Congo. AFRO includes most of Africa, with the exception of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> which belong to EMRO. <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a> is also not counted as it does not have an official government, though it is in the process of getting one.<li>Regional Office for Europe (<!--del_lnk--> EURO), with headquarters in <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.<li>Regional Office for South East Asia (<!--del_lnk--> SEARO), with headquarters in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.

EMRO includes the countries of Africa, and particularly in the <a href="../../wp/m/Maghreb.htm" title="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>, that are not included in AFRO, as well as the countries of the Middle East.<li>Regional Office for Western Pacific (<!--del_lnk--> WPRO), with headquarters in <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.

It is better known as the <!--del_lnk--> Pan American Health Organization, or <!--del_lnk--> PAHO. Since it predates the establishment of WHO, PAHO is by far the most autonomous of the 6 regional offices.</ul>

      <p>The World Health Organization operates 147 country and liaison offices, in all its regions. The presence of a country office is generally motivated by a need, stated by the member country. There will generally be one WHO country office in the capital, occasionally with antenna-offices in the provinces or sub-regions of that country.<p>The country office is headed by a WHO Representative (WR), who is not a national of that country, and who holds ranks, and is due privileges and immunities, similar to those of a <!--del_lnk--> Head of Diplomatic Mission or an <!--del_lnk--> Ambassador. In most countries, the WR (like Representatives of other UN agencies) is de facto treated like an Ambassador.<p>The country office consists of the WR, and several health and other experts, both foreign and local, as well as the necessary support staff.<p>The main functions of WHO country offices include being the primary adviser of that country&#39;s government in matters of health and pharmaceutical policies, play a coordinating role for the action of other International Liaison offices serve largely the same purpose as country offices, but generally on a smaller scale. These are often found in countries that do want WHO presence and cooperation, but do not have the major health system flaws that require the presence of a full-blown country office. Liaison offices are headed by a liaison officer, who is a national from that particular country, without diplomatic immunity.<p><a id="Some_WHO-private_sector_partnerships" name="Some_WHO-private_sector_partnerships"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Some WHO-private sector partnerships</span></h3>
