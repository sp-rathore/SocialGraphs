      <p>The <b>War in Somalia</b> is an ongoing armed conflict involving largely <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somali</a> <!--del_lnk--> Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces versus the <!--del_lnk--> Islamist militant <!--del_lnk--> umbrella group, the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Court Union (ICU), and other affiliated militias for control of the country. The war officially began on <!--del_lnk--> December 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, when the leader of the ICU, <!--del_lnk--> Sheik Hassan Dahir Aweys, declared &quot;Somalia is in a <!--del_lnk--> state of war, and all <!--del_lnk--> Somalis should take part in this struggle against Ethiopia&quot;. On <!--del_lnk--> December 24, Ethiopia stated it would actively combat the ICU.<p>Ethiopia&#39;s prime minister, <!--del_lnk--> Meles Zenawi, said Ethiopia entered hostilities because it faced a direct threat to its own borders. &ldquo;Ethiopian defense forces were forced to enter into war to protect the sovereignty of the nation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not trying to set up a government for Somalia, nor do we have an intention to meddle in Somalia&#39;s internal affairs. We have only been forced by the circumstances.&rdquo;<p>While it is true the ICU made threats to carry the war into Ethiopia, the circumstances referred to were in part due to prior Ethiopian actions. Ethiopia&#39;s involvement in Somalia had begun months before, with the intercession of forces to support the establishment of the transitional government, and to support other regional governments considered more acceptable to Ethiopia.<p>The ICU, which controlled the coastal areas of southern Somalia, engaged in fighting with the forces of the Somali TFG, and the autonomous regional governments of <!--del_lnk--> Puntland and <!--del_lnk--> Galmudug, all of whom were backed by Ethiopian troops. The outbreak of heavy fighting began on <!--del_lnk--> December 20 with the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Baidoa, after the lapse of a one-week deadline the ICU imposed on Ethiopia (on <!--del_lnk--> December 12) to withdraw from the nation. Ethiopia, however, refused to abandon its positions around the TFG interim capital at <!--del_lnk--> Baidoa. On <!--del_lnk--> December 29, after several successful battles, TFG and Ethiopian troops <!--del_lnk--> entered Mogadishu relatively unopposed. Although not announced until later, a small number of U.S. special forces troops accompanied Ethiopian and TFG troops after the collapse and withdrawal of the ICU to give military advice and to track suspected al-Qaida fighters.<p>The two sides had traded war declarations and gun fire on several occasions before. Eastern African countries and international observers fear the Ethiopian offensive may lead to a regional war, involving <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, a long-time enemy of Ethiopia, who Ethiopia claims to be a supporter of the ICU.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The scope of forces involved are difficult to calculate because of many factors, including lack of formal organization or record-keeping, and claims which remained masked by <!--del_lnk--> disinformation. Ethiopia for months leading up to the war maintained it had only a few hundred advisors in the country. Yet independent reports indicated far more troops. According to the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>, &quot;The United Nations estimated that at least 8,000 Ethiopian troops may be in the country while the AP suggests the number closer to 12-15,000, while regional rival Eritrea has deployed some 2,860 troops in support of the Islamic group.&quot; Ethiopia only admitted to 3,511&ndash;4,805 being involved, though the ICU claimed the Ethiopians had 30,000 troops, while Eritrea denies having any troops in Somalia. In addition, the TFG alleged there were up to 8,000 foreign <!--del_lnk--> mujahideen fighting on behalf of the ICU, based on the ICU&#39;s worldwide appeal for Muslim <!--del_lnk--> mujahideen to come fight for their cause. Somali government troops and allied militias estimated roughly 10,000.<p><a id="Background" name="Background"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>

      <p>A broader perspective shows many incidents of Ethiopian-Somali conflict. Boundary disputes over the <!--del_lnk--> Ogaden region date to the 1948 settlement when the land was <!--del_lnk--> granted to Ethiopia. Somali disgruntlement with this decision has led to repeated attempts to invade Ethiopia with the hopes of taking control of the Ogaden to create a <!--del_lnk--> Greater Somalia. This plan would have reunited the Somali people of the Ethiopian-controlled Ogaden with those living in the Republic of Somalia. Without that, ethnic and political tensions have caused cross-border clashes over the years.<ul>

      <p>Conflicts between Ethiopia and Somalia are not limited to the 20th&ndash;21st Centuries. Wars between Somalia, or its precursor Islamic states, and Ethiopia, stretch back to 16th century. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi was a 16th Century Islamic leader popular in Somali culture for his <!--del_lnk--> jihad against the Ethiopians during the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Adal Sultanate.<p>Therefore, painful living history, oral and cultural traditions, long-standing ethnic divisions and sectarian differences lay between the two nations and fuel the conflict.<p><a id="Diplomatic_and_humanitarian_efforts" name="Diplomatic_and_humanitarian_efforts"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Diplomatic and humanitarian efforts</span></h3>

Sheikh <!--del_lnk--> Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, head of the Islamic Courts, told a crowd in <a href="../../wp/m/Mogadishu.htm" title="Mogadishu">Mogadishu</a> that fighting had started in <!--del_lnk--> Dinsor in the south, and called on all Somalis to &quot;stand up and defeat the enemies&quot;. Another official said Ethiopian troops had shelled the town of <!--del_lnk--> Bandiradley.

According to government sources Ethiopia had 20 <!--del_lnk--> T-55 tanks and four attack helicopters in Baidoa.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 23, Ethiopian tanks and further reinforcements arrived in Daynuunay, 30 kilometres east of Baidoa; prompting ICU forces to vow all-out war despite a commitment to a EU-brokered peace. Heavy fighting continued in Lidale and Dinsoor.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 24, Ethiopia admitted its troops were fighting the Islamists, after stating earlier in the week it had only sent several hundred military advisors to Baidoa. Heavy fighting erupted in border areas, with reports of air strikes and shelling, including targets near the ICU-held town of Beledweyne. According to Ethiopian Information Minister Berhan Hailu: &quot;The Ethiopian government has taken self-defensive measures and started counter-attacking the aggressive extremist forces of the Islamic Courts and foreign terrorist groups.&quot;<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 25, Ethiopian and Somali forces captured Beledweyne.

      <p>Military events in 2007 focused on the southern section of Somalia, primarily the <!--del_lnk--> withdrawal of ICU forces from <!--del_lnk--> Kismayo, and their pursuit using Ethiopian air strikes in Afmadow district concurrent to the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Ras Kamboni. During this battle, the U.S. launched an airstrike conducted by an <!--del_lnk--> AC-130 gunship against suspected <!--del_lnk--> Al-Qaeda operatives. A second airstrike was made after the battle later in <!--del_lnk--> January 2007. In addition, there were various <!--del_lnk--> insurgent attacks in Mogadishu and around the country against Ethiopian and government forces, as well as inter-clan militia violence. The government meanwhile called for a <!--del_lnk--> disarmament of the militias, and declared martial law. In the beginning of March, the first <!--del_lnk--> African Union Mission to Somalia begun arriving in Somalia, as the insurgency flared up.<p>By the end of March, the fighting <!--del_lnk--> intensified in Mogadishu and more than a thousand people were killed. <!--del_lnk--> Hawiye clan militaimen allied with the islamists clashed with TFG and Ethiopian troops.<p><a id="Suicide_bombings" name="Suicide_bombings"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Suicide bombings</span></h2>
      <p>In late 2006, two suicide bombings were reported in Baidoa where the government was stationed at the time.<p>In the beginning of April 2007, Al-Jazeera TV aired a Somali man who was speaking in Arabic and reciting <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Koran">Koranic</a> verses.

      <p>Having secured the southern and central area of Somalia in mid January 2007, the Transitional Federal Government is faced with the issue of whether, and how, to unify the entirety of Somalia as it existed in 1991. Since that year, <!--del_lnk--> Somaliland has been operating as a <i>de facto</i> independent nation, though unrecognized internationally. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Transitional Federal Charter, the Somali Republic includes the area of Somaliland in the definition of its <!--del_lnk--> sovereign territory.<p>There are various political forces involved. Ethiopia depends on Somaliland to provide port facilities since the loss of the coast with <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, and generally supports the idea of Somaliland independence, while Eritrea supports Somaliland being reabsorbed into Somalia to make a larger nation to counter Ethiopia&#39;s dominance on the region. As well, eastern Somaliland is disputed with <!--del_lnk--> Puntland because of clan ties..<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 11, Somaliland and Ethiopia held talks regarding further economic ties.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2007, leaders of Somaliland&#39;s three main political parties, the <!--del_lnk--> UDUB, <!--del_lnk--> Kulmiye, and <!--del_lnk--> UCID, held a press conference warning of regional war if Somalia tried to reabsorb Somaliland. On <!--del_lnk--> January 16, tens of thousands protested in <!--del_lnk--> Hargeisa against the prospect of reunification, burning Somalian flags.
