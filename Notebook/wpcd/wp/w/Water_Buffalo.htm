      <p>The <b>Water Buffalo</b> is a very large <!--del_lnk--> ungulate and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> bovine subfamily. The <b>Arni</b> or Wild Buffalo survives in the wild in <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> domestic Buffalo are very widespread in <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. They are <!--del_lnk--> feral in northern <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Wild-living populations also exist in much of <!--del_lnk--> South-east Asia but their origins are uncertain. They may be descendants of wild Water Buffalo, formerly domesticated ferals or a mixture. In Asia, the population of wild Water Buffalo has become sparse, and there is fear that no pure-bred wild water buffalo exists. Adult Water Buffalo range in size from 300 kg to 600 kg for the domestic bred, but true wild water buffaloes can grow larger. Adult females typically weigh around 800 kg, and males up to 1200 kg. The average weight of an adult male is 900 kg, and the average height at the shoulder is about 1.7m. One distinction between wild buffaloes and domesticated version is that the wild species lacks the round belly found in domesticated buffalo. Due to interbreeding with feral and domestic species, weights can vary greatly even in populations which are in in close proximity. Interbreeding with domesticated buffaloes is the major cause of extinction of wild buffaloes. Buffaloes are believed to have originated in <!--del_lnk--> South Asia.<p>The classification of the Water Buffalo is uncertain. Some authorities list a single <!--del_lnk--> species, <i>Bubalus bubalis</i> with three <!--del_lnk--> subspecies, the River Buffalo (<i>B. bubalis bubalis</i>) of South Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> Carabao or Swamp Buffalo (<i>B. bubalis carabanesis</i>) of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and Southeast Asia, and the Arni, or Wild Buffalo, (<i>B. bubalis arnee</i>). Others regard these as closely-related, but separate, species. The Swamp Buffalo is primarily found in the eastern half of Asia and has 48 chromosomes. The River Buffalo is mostly found in western half of Asia, and has 50 chromosomes. Fertile offspring occur between the two. It does not readily hybridise with <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> which have 60 chromosomes.<p><a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">Milk</a> from both of these animals is used by many human populations, and is the traditional raw material for <!--del_lnk--> mozzarella cheese and <!--del_lnk--> curd due to its higher fat content. The chief dairy breed of Buffalo is the <!--del_lnk--> Murrah breed. Buffalo meat, sometimes called &quot;Carabeef&quot;, is often passed off as beef in certain regions and is also a major source of export revenue for India which has the largest population of buffaloes in the world. However, in many Asian regions, buffalo meat is less preferred due to its toughness. Water buffalo hide provides a tough and useful <!--del_lnk--> leather often used for shoes and <!--del_lnk--> motorcycle <!--del_lnk--> helmets.<p>

      <p>Asia is the native home of the water buffalo, with 95% of the world population of water buffalo. Many Asian countries depend on the water buffalo as its primary bovine species. It is valuable for its meat and milk as well as the labour it performs. As of <!--del_lnk--> 1992 the Asian population was estimated at 141 million. The fat content of buffalo milk is the highest amongst farm animals and the butterfat is a major source of <!--del_lnk--> ghee in some Asian countries. Its success in Asia is evident by its extensive range. Both variants occur in Asia. River Buffalo are found in elevations of 2,800 m in Nepal, and Swamp Buffalo are found throughout the lowland tropics. Part of their success is due to their ability to thrive on poor foodstuffs and yet be valuable economically. Moreover they are much better suited to plough the muddy <!--del_lnk--> paddy fields as they are better adapted than common cattle (<i><!--del_lnk--> Bos taurus</i>) to move in swamps.<p>In the wild, very few pockets of buffalo exist. The Indian wild buffalo is found in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Thailand. This buffalo has the largest horns of any living animal. The average spread is about 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but one bull shot in <!--del_lnk--> 1955 had horns measuring 4.24 m (13 ft 11 in) from tip to tip along the outside curve across the forehead. These massive battering rams protect the beast in the wild efficiently enough that even its predator seldom attacks a fully grown male. Tiger is their only predator, which can kill a full-grown male weighing 1000-1200kg, but only an experienced tiger will take them on, often by hamstringing their hind legs first. When faced by a tiger, they form a line facing the predator and charge with noses out and horns laid back. Like its other family members, the <!--del_lnk--> tamaraw and the <!--del_lnk--> anoa, the wild buffalo is a very dangerous animal known to charge without being provoked. Together with its large size, this bad temper makes wild water buffalo the most dangerous bovine on earth to humans. It is generally found in swamplands and grass jungles and moves in herds.<p>Today, the estimated population of wild water buffaloes are about 4000, but, this number takes into account all wild population, including feral herds and hybrid buffaloes. In fact, it is possible that no true wild specimens exist anymore.<p>The water buffalo, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Carabao,&quot; is the national animal of the Philippines.<p><a id="Australia" name="Australia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Australia</span></h2>
      <p>Introduced into the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory early in the 19th century as a beast of burden, it quickly escaped and is now <!--del_lnk--> feral. As a result of its feral status it may be hunted. <!--del_lnk--> Melville Island is a popular hunting location, where a steady population of up to 4,000 individuals exist. Buffaloes are also found in <!--del_lnk--> Arnhem Land and the Top End. Safari outfits run out of <!--del_lnk--> Darwin to Melville Island and other locations in the <!--del_lnk--> Top End often with the use of <!--del_lnk--> bush pilots. The government has unsuccessfully attempted several eradication programs.<p>The buffaloes live mainly in freshwater marshes and <!--del_lnk--> billabongs, and their range can be quite expansive during the <!--del_lnk--> Wet season. They have developed a different appearance from the Indonesian buffaloes from which they descend.<p><a id="Europe_and_Middle_East" name="Europe_and_Middle_East"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Europe and Middle East</span></h2>
      <p>Introduced into North Africa and the Near East by <!--del_lnk--> 600 AD, the water buffalo was brought to Europe with returning <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and herds can be found in <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. As in Asia, buffaloes of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> live on coarse vegetation on the marginal land traditionally available to <!--del_lnk--> peasants. They are an economic asset by serving as a protein source, draft animal, and storage of family or household wealth. In some areas, they also provide occasional recreation at annual racing festivals. These buffalo are mostly River Buffaloes; due to genetic isolation have adopted a distinct appearance. Buffalo milk is used in Italy and elsewhere for the production of <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a>, including <!--del_lnk--> mozzarella.<p><a id="Uses" name="Uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uses</span></h2>
      <p>Buffaloes, apart from its use as <!--del_lnk--> draught and <!--del_lnk--> milch animals, are also used to pull bullock carts in developing world. Their dung is used as a fertilizer and as a fuel when dried. Sometimes, people will also race on buffaloes, though riding them can be very difficult. A few have also found use as pack animals carrying loads even for special forces.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>American <a href="../../wp/b/Bison.htm" title="Bison">bison</a> are often called buffalo; however, this is technically incorrect as they are not true buffalo. The bison group includes both the American bison and the European bison or <!--del_lnk--> wisent. They are a related group of wild <!--del_lnk--> bovines, close to the <a href="../../wp/y/Yak.htm" title="Yak">yak</a> and more distantly related to <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">gaur</a>, <!--del_lnk--> banteng, etc. The buffalo family includes water buffaloes, <!--del_lnk--> tamarau and <!--del_lnk--> anoas in Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> African buffalo (or Cape buffalo) in Africa.<li>Legend has it that the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese philosophical sage <!--del_lnk--> Lao Tzu left China through the Han Gu Pass riding a water buffalo.<li>According to <!--del_lnk--> Hindu mythology, the god of death <!--del_lnk--> Yama, rides on a buffalo.</ul>
