      <p><b>Wessex</b> was one of the seven major <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (the <!--del_lnk--> Heptarchy) that preceded the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England. It was named after the West Saxons and was situated in the south and southwest of England. It existed as a kingdom from the <a href="../../wp/6/6th_century.htm" title="6th century">6th century</a> until the emergence of the English state in the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>, and as an <!--del_lnk--> earldom between <!--del_lnk--> 1016 and <!--del_lnk--> 1066. The earldom was recently revived for <!--del_lnk--> His Royal Highness <!--del_lnk--> The Prince Edward. &quot;Wessex&quot; has not had any official existence since that time, but it has remained a familiar term since <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy revived it for his <!--del_lnk--> West Country novels and poetry. Today some wish to see it restored as a <!--del_lnk--> region of England.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>According to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> (ASC), Wessex was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Cerdic and <!--del_lnk--> Cynric, chieftains of a clan known as &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Gewisse</i>&quot;, although the specific events given by the ASC are considered to be suspect. <!--del_lnk--> Arch&aelig;ological evidence points to an origin in the upper <!--del_lnk--> Thames and <a href="../../wp/c/Cotswolds.htm" title="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a> area, and the ASC origin myth may have been political propaganda designed to justify a later invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> Jutish province in southern <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. The first certain event in Wessex is the <!--del_lnk--> baptism of <!--del_lnk--> Cynegils around the year <!--del_lnk--> 640.<p>Wessex expanded its boundaries and clashed with its neighbours, notably <!--del_lnk--> British <!--del_lnk--> Dumnonia (essentially modern day <!--del_lnk--> Devon and <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall), which it eventually came to dominate, and with <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a>. After <!--del_lnk--> Egbert defeated Mercia in <!--del_lnk--> 825 and the <!--del_lnk--> Northumbrians accepted his overlordship in <!--del_lnk--> 829, Egbert became the <!--del_lnk--> Bretwalda or lord of Britain, he was never referred to as King of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.<p>The integrated system of fortified towns (the &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> burhs&quot;</i>) established under <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, described in both <!--del_lnk--> Asser and the <i>ASC</i>, and documented in a unique <i>hidage</i>, helped to prevent the conquest of southern England by the <!--del_lnk--> Danish invaders in the <!--del_lnk--> 870s. The <i>hidage</i> identifies thirty-three forts, which ensured that no one in Wessex was more than a long day&#39;s ride from a place of safety.<p>Important West Saxon settlements included old Roman settlements such as <!--del_lnk--> Dorchester and <!--del_lnk--> Winchester, which Alfred made the capital in <!--del_lnk--> 871, and newly-founded <i>burhs</i> such as <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford.<p>There is some evidence that kingship in Wessex was not rigidly hereditary. The strongest candidate from the pool of the senior families was elected or forced his control on the lesser kings. The internal feuding produced by this may have delayed the rise of Wessex as a full kingdom, but this is conjecture.<p>After the <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercian</a> conquest of its original territories in <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire and <!--del_lnk--> Oxfordshire, the northern boundary of Wessex was probably the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Southwark, facing London from the south bank of the Thames, was included among the <i>burhs</i>, but <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> fell beyond West Saxon territory. Its heartland was the present-day counties of <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, and <!--del_lnk--> Berkshire.<p><a id="Revival" name="Revival"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Revival</span></h2>
      <p>The English author <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy used a fictionalised south-west as a setting for many of his novels, reviving the term <i>Wessex</i> for southwest England. His Wessex included all the counties mentioned in the previous paragraph apart from Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire, along with <!--del_lnk--> Devon. He gave the counties the following fictionalised names: Berkshire = North Wessex; Devon = Lower Wessex; Dorset = South Wessex; Hampshire = Upper Wessex; Somerset = Outer Wessex; Wiltshire = Mid-Wessex. Neighbouring Cornwall was described as Off-Wessex or <!--del_lnk--> Lyonesse. See <i><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy&#39;s Wessex</i>.<p>There is a movement in modern day south-central England to create a regional cultural and political identity in Wessex. This consists of three distinct but interlinked organisations. The <!--del_lnk--> Wessex Regionalist Party is a registered political party which contests elections. The <!--del_lnk--> Wessex Constitutional Convention is an all-party <!--del_lnk--> pressure group in which those sympathetic to Wessex <!--del_lnk--> devolution who are not members of the Wessex Regionalist Party can also be represented. The <!--del_lnk--> Wessex Society is a cultural society which promotes a cultural identity for Wessex while remaining neutral on questions of political devolution.<p>The boundaries of Wessex were unclear and subject to dispute. The Wessex Constitutional Convention and Wessex Society add Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire to Hardy&#39;s list; and the Wessex Regionalists, who currently use Hardy&#39;s definition of Wessex, are likely to follow suit in the near future.<p>This definition of Wessex has been criticised from a number of quarters. A number of people within Devon, southern Somerset and parts of Dorset see those areas as sharing a Dumnonian Celtic identity with Cornwall, whereas some regard Hardy&#39;s definition as correct on the grounds that the counties north of the Thames, along with Berkshire and north-east Somerset, were part of Mercia for most of the Anglo-Saxon period. There are also a few in Hampshire who argue that southern Hampshire and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> were once a Jutish province in their own right and deserve to be treated differently to the rest of Wessex.<p>The Wessex regionalist movements justify their eight-<!--del_lnk--> shire definition of Wessex in terms both of history and of modern regional geography and point to the impossibility of pleasing everyone as an argument against change at the present time, though they do not rule out the possibility of change in the future if the popular will demands it.<p><a id="The_present_South_West_England_region" name="The_present_South_West_England_region"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The present South West England region</span></h2>
      <p>The government office region of <!--del_lnk--> South West England covers a different area, consisting of Hardy&#39;s Wessex, less <!--del_lnk--> Berkshire, <a href="../../wp/h/Hampshire.htm" title="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, but including <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall and <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire. Wessex groups are currently campaigning for boundary revisions to the <!--del_lnk--> regions in order to more closely match their definitions of Wessex.<p><a id="Modern_uses" name="Modern_uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern uses</span></h2>
