<img src="../../wp/w/Woman_Weaving_Ejigbo.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Social Centre Ejigbo : Gaining independence through family strengthening" class="left" /><p><strong>Learning new skills for a new way of life in Nigeria</strong></p><p>The SOS Social Centre Ejigbo is in an area of Lagos with extreme poverty and high HIV/AIDS rates.  500,000 live here.  Children as young as five walk the streets selling soap and sweets.</p><p>For over three years, the centre has helped vulnerable families in Ejigbo; day care for babies and young children; immunisation programme; health care; HIV/AIDS referrals and counselling skills training and micro-finance to start up family businesses.</p><p>The centre has helped over 2,000 people, including 300 AIDS orphans.  &ldquo;Without our work here, I would see hundreds of children every day selling on the street instead of the usual twenty.  SOS Children gives these families a choice and we give them the opportunity to care for their children.&rdquo; Miss Bidemi Sorungbe, leader of the SOS Family Strenghtening Programme (FSP), Ejigbo, Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Supporting families</strong><br />Margaret JeJe* receives home support through the family strengthening programme and is currently learning to sew.   </p><p>As the main carer for her late brother&rsquo;s children, Margaret continued to work supporting them.  The children started getting ill because they were not eating enough.  Earning only &pound;8 a month, she could not afford to stop working or to send them to school.  Her neighbour looked after them and  organised the children to work on the streets during the day.</p><img src="../../wp/b/Bead_Making_Ejigbo.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Skills for life at Ejigbo, Nigera" class="right" /><p>With the help of the SOS Community Volunteer, Margaret attends the Social Centre and is learning to sew so she can set up a small business. The centre helps her with scholarships for children to attend school. After school the children can go to the day care centre.  </p><p>&ldquo;Before I did not believe I could learn. I did not finish school and I did not like school. Now I am learning and talking to other people who have the same worries as me. I am making friends and learning and now I do not worry about the children, I know they are safe&rdquo; Maragaret JeJe.</p><p>* Name has been changed to protect privacy</p><p>Next Page <a href="../../wp/w/Winter_2006_2007_Newsletter_Future_First.htm">future first</a></p><p>Back to the : <a href="../../wp/w/Winter_2006_2007_Newsletter_Contents.htm">contents page</a></p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria_A.htm">Nigeria</a>.</p>
