<img src="../../wp/l/Lebanon_Children1.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Ongoing support in the middle east" class="left" /><p><strong>Lebanon update</strong></p><p>The end of the war in Lebanon does not mean an end to relief in the country. SOS Children will provide an emergency relief programme for seriously traumatised children through a three-year psychosocial relief programme and support their families by rebuilding family life.</p><p>Lebanon's economy has been set back by years; thousands of people are having to start from the beginning again. Psychotherapy and play therapy should help children to recover from the traumas they have experienced. As part of the immediate emergency relief, the families will be provided with a place to stay, food, clothes and school materials.</p><h3>Ongoing support in the Middle East</h3>
<p>Over 1,100 people, mainly civilians, were killed, around 20,000 houses were destroyed and approximately 300,000 people were left homeless as a result of the attacks on Lebanon in July-August 2006.  Over the next three years, SOS Children will therefore provide care for over 200 children from the middle of the Bekaa Valley, 200 children from the southern districts of Beirut, 150 children in the south and 200 children from the area around the SOS Children's Village Kfarhay in northern Lebanon.</p><h3>Botswana - Gazza visit</h3>
