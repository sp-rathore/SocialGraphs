<h2>Brick by Brick - Tsunami one year on</h2><p><strong>01/01/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/2/20363_children_playing.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="SOS Children Playing" class="left" /><p>Through the generosity of our supporters, we have been able to achieve so much - thank you! </p><p>What have we achieved in a year? From companies supporting us through their staff (Bertlesmann/Sony), through to many of you and your children holding local events. Here are just some of the highlights of what you have helped us achieve  </p><p>In India, we are providing new homes to children who lost their parents by building two new SOS Children's Villages - the first in Pondicherry, a town on the east coast and a second in Port Blair on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Where possible we have reconstructed homes - over 800 homes! At the village of Murtypudukuppam, near Pondicherry, we have been running tailoring and handiwork classes for women and school classes for children, while on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands we are building an SOS Vocational Training Centre to provide the teenagers with the skills needed for the local job market. A new SOS Kindergarten is being built to cope with the demand for nursery education on the island.</p><img src="../../wp/1/19901_Temp_shelters_Kayankerni.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Temporary shelters in Kayankerni" class="right" /><p>The HSBC Education Trust has funded the construction of a new SOS Kindergarten and SOS Vocational Training at Peraliya, Sri Lanka. Our work in the area also includes support for the whole community ranging from tsunami shelters, a family strengthening programme, a day care centre, medical centre, adult training and an SOS Kindergarten. At Kayankerni, start up grants have been given to nearly 300 families to re-establish their livelihoods. Cedric de Silva, Head of Operations in Sri Lanka said &quot;I never thought we could reach this many people so quickly&quot;</p><img src="../../wp/1/19799_Indonesia.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Childre Affected by Tsunami in Indonesia" class="left" /><p>Indonesia will see the biggest support with the development of 3 SOS Children's Villages and 2 SOS Social Centres. Many children are living in tents or in orphanages but since day one SOS Children workers have been talking with the children and playing with them - showing the children they are not alone. </p><p>During the last year, over 23,000 people have been supported in many ways: with start up grants, relief packages, clothing, schools materials, cooking equipment, vegetables, bicycles etc. The aim now is to build them a tangible future brick by brick.</p><h3>Higher Ground</h3>
<p>Finally, SOS Children will benefit from the royalties from the sales of the book Higher Ground, published by Chrysalis. It includes an introduction by Michael Morpurgo, the former Children's Laureate, and cover artwork by award-winning children's artist Michael Foreman. Based on real stories of survival from the countries affected by the tsunami, children's authors have created wonderful stories that capture the children's point of view and how support has had a positive impact on their day to day life. See the http://www.chrysalisbooks.co.uk/highergroundproject/index.htm website for more details. </p><p>Thank you once again to all our supporters&hellip;your support has helped so many and will do for years to come.</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/i/India_A.htm">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia_A.htm">Indonesia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka_A.htm">Sri Lanka</a>.</p>
