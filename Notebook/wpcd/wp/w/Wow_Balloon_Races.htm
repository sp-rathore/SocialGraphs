<h2>World Orphan Week - celebrity balloon races</h2><p><strong>27/09/2006</strong></p>
<p>The Operababes will be helping SOS Children to celebrate its <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Main.htm">World Orphan Week</a> campaign next week when they join in with balloon races at schools around the country. </p><p>SOS Children is holding balloon races at a number of schools next week to help launch World Orphan Week and raise money for some of the world's most vulnerable children.</p><img src="../../wp/a/African_boys_balloons_WOW.jpg" width="384" height="288" alt="Boys in Malawi" class="left" /><p>Friday 6 October will see World Orphan Week Ambassadors The Operababes joining the pupils of Mount Carmel School in Little Ealing, London to support SOS Children, the world&rsquo;s largest orphan charity.</p><p>Pupils at the school will be buying World Orphan Week balloons for a balloon race, with all money going directly to World Orphan Week and helping provide orphaned children around the world with a new family home. The helium-filled balloons will be released into the air by the celebs, with prizes awarded for the balloon that travels the furthest and to the member of public who finds the winning balloon.</p><p>World Orphan Week which runs from 2-8 October aims to get any and everyone joining in to help make a difference to the lives of children in need. </p><p>As well as the balloon race in Ealing, there will also be races taking place during World Orphan Week in Doncaster (October 1st), Manchester and Ascot (2nd), Cambridge (3rd), Newcastle (4th) and Reigate (6th). There'll also be a whole host of other fundraising activities up and down the country throughout the week.</p><h3>See the pictures!</h3>
