      <p><b>Water resources</b> are sources of <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> that are useful or potentially useful to humans. It is important because it is needed for life to exist. Many uses of water include <!--del_lnk--> agricultural, <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a>, <!--del_lnk--> household, <!--del_lnk--> recreational and <!--del_lnk--> environmental activities. Virtually all of these human uses require <a href="../../wp/f/Fresh_water.htm" title="Fresh water">fresh water</a>. Only 2.5% of water on the Earth is fresh water, and over two thirds of this is frozen in <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> polar <!--del_lnk--> ice caps. Water demand already exceeds supply in many parts of the world, and many more areas are expected to experience this imbalance in the near future. The framework for allocating water resources to water users (where such a framework exists) is known as <!--del_lnk--> water rights.<p>

      <p>Throughout history, water resources have occasionally been the source of conflict. Examples include:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Well poisoning<li>Privatization and Water Pricing in India <!--del_lnk--> ,<li>Privatization and Water Pricing <!--del_lnk--> protests in Cochabamba, Bolivia in 2000</ul>
      <p>Nevertheless, some claim that the issue does not get the attention it deserves, in particular with regard to security.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Threats to fresh water</span></h2>
      <p>There are many things that are a threat to the Earths fresh water supply. Here are a few of them.<p><a id="Climate_change" name="Climate_change"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate change</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">Climate change</a> will have significant impacts on water resources around the world because of the close connections between the climate and <!--del_lnk--> hydrologic cycle. Rising temperatures will increase <!--del_lnk--> evaporation and lead to increases in precipitation, though there will be regional variations in rainfall. Overall, the global supply of freshwater will increase. Both <!--del_lnk--> droughts and <!--del_lnk--> floods may become more frequent in different regions at different times, and dramatic changes in snowfall and snowmelt are expected in mountainous areas. Higher temperatures will also affect water quality in ways that are not well understood. Possible impacts include increased <!--del_lnk--> eutrophication. Climate change could also mean an increase in demand for farm irrigation, garden sprinklers, and perhaps even swimming pools.<p><a id="Depletion_of_aquifers" name="Depletion_of_aquifers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Depletion of aquifers</span></h3>
      <p>Since competition for water is growing, underground aquifers are becoming depleted. This is mainly due to irrigation by groundwater. Millions of small pumps are currently taking water out of aquifers to irrigate crops. Irrigation in dry areas such as <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> is supplied by groundwater.<p><a id="Pollution_and_water_protection" name="Pollution_and_water_protection"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pollution and water protection</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Water pollution is one of the many concerns of the world today. World governments have strived to find solutions to eliminate this problem.

      <p>Uses of fresh water can be categorized as consumptive and non-consumptive (sometimes called &quot;renewable&quot;). A use of water is consumptive if that water is not immediately available for another use. Losses to sub-surface seepage and evaporation are considered consumptive, as is water incorporated into a product (such as farm produce). Water that can be <!--del_lnk--> treated and returned as surface water, such as <!--del_lnk--> sewage, is generally considered non-consumptive if that water can be put to additional use.<p><a id="Agricultural" name="Agricultural"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Agricultural</span></h3>

      <p>It is estimated that 70% of world-wide water use is for <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>. In some areas of the world irrigation is necessary to grow any crop at all, in other areas it permits more profitable crops to be grown or enhances crop yield. Various irrigation methods involve different trade-offs between crop yield, water consumption and capital cost of equipment and structures. <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">Irrigation</a> methods such as most furrow and overhead <!--del_lnk--> sprinkler irrigation are usually less expensive but also less efficient, because much of the water evaporates or runs off. More efficient irrigation methods include <!--del_lnk--> drip or trickle irrigation, surge irrigation, and some types of sprinkler systems where the sprinklers are operated near ground level. These types of systems, while more expensive, can minimize runoff and evaporation. Any system that is improperly managed can be wasteful. Another trade-off that is often insufficiently considered is salinization of sub-surface water.<p><!--del_lnk--> Aquaculture is a small but growing agricultural use of water. Freshwater commercial fisheries may also be considered as agricultural uses of water, but have generally been assigned a lower priority than irrigation (see <a href="../../wp/a/Aral_Sea.htm" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Pyramid Lake).<p>As global populations grow, and as demand for food increases in a world with a fixed water supply, there are efforts underway to learn how to produce more food with less water, through improvements in irrigation methods and technologies, agricultural water management, crop types, and water monitoring.<p><a id="Industrial" name="Industrial"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Industrial</span></h3>

      <p>It is estimated that 15% of world-wide water use is industrial. Major industrial users include power plants, which use water for cooling or as a power source (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric plants), <!--del_lnk--> ore and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> refineries, which use water in chemical processes, and manufacturing plants, which use water as a solvent.<p>The portion of industrial water usage that is consumptive varies widely, but as a whole is lower than agricultural use.<br style="clear:both;" />

Basic household water requirements <!--del_lnk-->  have been estimated by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Gleick at around 50 liters per person per day, excluding water for gardens.<p>Most household water is treated and returned to surface water systems, with the exception of water used for landscapes.

      <p>Water has a lot of recreational value.<p>Recreational water use is a very small but growing percentage of total water use. Recreational water use is mostly tied to reservoirs. If a reservoir is kept fuller than it would otherwise be for recreation, then the water retained could be categorized as recreational usage. Release of water from a few reservoirs is also timed to enhance <!--del_lnk--> whitewater boating, which also could be considered a recreational usage. Other examples are anglers, water skiers, nature enthusiasts and swimmers.<p>Recreational usage is non-consumptive. However it may reduce the availability of water for other users at specific times and places. For example, water retained in a reservoir to allow boating in the late summer is not available to farmers during the spring planting season. Water released for whitewater rafting may not be available for hydroelectric generation during the time of peak electrical demand.<br style="clear:both;" />

      <p>Food and water are two basic human needs. As the picture shows, in 2025, water shortages will be more prevalent among poorer countries where resources are limited and population growth is rapid, such as the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Asia. By 2025, large urban and peri-urban areas will require new infrastructure to provide safe water and adequate sanitation. This suggests growing conflicts with agricultural water users, who currently consume the majority of the water used by humans.<p>Generally speaking the more developed countries of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> will not see a serious threat to water supply by the year 2025, not only because of their relative wealth, but more importantly their populations will be better aligned with available water resources.
