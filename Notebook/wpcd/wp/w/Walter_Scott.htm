      <p><b>Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 15 August <!--del_lnk--> 1771 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 21 September <!--del_lnk--> 1832) was a prolific <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> <!--del_lnk--> historical novelist and <!--del_lnk--> poet popular throughout <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> during his time. In some ways Scott was the first author to have a truly international career in his lifetime, with many contemporary readers all over Europe, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>.<p>His novels and (to a lesser extent) his poetry are still read, but he is less popular today than he was at the height of his fame. Nevertheless many of his works remain classics of both <!--del_lnk--> English-language literature and specifically <!--del_lnk--> Scottish literature. Famous titles include <i><!--del_lnk--> Ivanhoe</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Rob Roy</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lady of the Lake</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Waverley</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Heart of Midlothian</i>.<p>

      <p>Born in College Wynd in the <!--del_lnk--> Old Town of <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1771, the son of a <!--del_lnk--> solicitor, the young Walter Scott survived a childhood bout of <!--del_lnk--> polio that would leave him lame in his right leg for the rest of his life. To restore his health he was sent to live for some years in the rural <!--del_lnk--> Borders region at his grandparents&#39; farm at Sandyknowe. Here he learned the speech patterns and many of the tales and legends which characterised much of his work. Also, for his health, he spent a year in <!--del_lnk--> Bath, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.<p>After studying law at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh, he followed in his father&#39;s footsteps and became a lawyer in Edinburgh. As a lawyer&#39;s clerk he made his first visit to the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> directing an eviction. He was admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> Faculty of Advocates in 1792. He had an unsuccessful love suit with Williamina Belsches of Fettercairn, who married Sir <!--del_lnk--> William Forbes.<p><a id="Literary_career_launched" name="Literary_career_launched"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literary career launched</span></h2>
      <p>At the age of 25 he began dabbling in writing, translating works from <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, his first publication being rhymed versions of ballads by <!--del_lnk--> B&uuml;rger in <!--del_lnk--> 1796. He then published a three-volume set of collected Scottish ballads, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>. This was the first sign of his interest in <!--del_lnk--> Scottish history from a literary standpoint.<p>Scott then became an ardent volunteer in the <!--del_lnk--> yeomanry and on one of his &quot;raids&quot; he met at <!--del_lnk--> Gilsland Spa Margaret Charlotte Charpentier (or Charpenter), daughter of Jean Charpentier of <a href="../../wp/l/Lyon.htm" title="Lyon">Lyon</a> in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> whom he married in <!--del_lnk--> 1797. They had five children. In <!--del_lnk--> 1799 he was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Sheriff-Depute of the <!--del_lnk--> County of Selkirk, based in the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh of <!--del_lnk--> Selkirk.<p>In his earlier married days, Scott had a decent living from his earnings at the law, his salary as Sheriff-Depute, his wife&#39;s income, some revenue from his writing, and his share of his father&#39;s rather meagre estate.<p>After Scott had founded a printing press, his poetry, beginning with <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1805, brought him fame. He published a number of other poems over the next ten years, including the popular <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lady of the Lake</i>, printed in <!--del_lnk--> 1810 and set in the <!--del_lnk--> Trossachs. Portions of the German translation of this work were later set to music by <a href="../../wp/f/Franz_Schubert.htm" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>. One of these songs, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ellens dritter Gesang</i>, is popularly labeled as &quot;Schubert&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Ave Maria</i>&quot;.<p>Another work from this time period, <i><!--del_lnk--> Marmion</i>, produced some of his most quoted (and most often mis-attributed) lines. Canto VI. Stanza 17 reads:<dl>
       <dd><i>Yet Clare&#39;s sharp questions must I shun,</i><dd><i>Must separate Constance from the nun</i><dd><i><b>Oh! what a tangled web we weave</b></i><dd><i><b>When first we practice to deceive!</b></i><dd><i>A Palmer too! No wonder why</i><dd><i>I felt rebuked beneath his eye;</i></dl>
      <p>In 1809 his <!--del_lnk--> Tory sympathies led him to become a co-founder of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Quarterly Review</i>, a review journal to which he made several anonymous contributions.<p><a id="The_novels" name="The_novels"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The novels</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>When the press became embroiled in pecuniary difficulties, Scott set out, in <!--del_lnk--> 1814, to write a cash-cow. The result was <i><!--del_lnk--> Waverley</i>, a <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novel</a> which did not name its author. It was a tale of the &quot;Forty-Five&quot; <a href="../../wp/j/Jacobite_rising.htm" title="Jacobite rising">Jacobite rising</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain with its <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> protagonist Edward Waverley, by his Tory upbringing sympathetic to <!--del_lnk--> Jacobitism, becoming enmeshed in events but eventually choosing <!--del_lnk--> Hanoverian respectability. The novel met with considerable success. There followed a succession of novels over the next five years, each with a Scottish historical setting. Mindful of his reputation as a poet, he maintained the anonymous habit he had begun with <i>Waverley</i>, always publishing the novels under the name <b>Author of Waverley</b> or attributed as &quot;Tales of...&quot; with no author. Even when it was clear that there would be no harm in coming out into the open he maintained the fa&ccedil;ade, apparently out of a sense of fun. During this time the nickname <b>The Wizard of the North</b> was popularly applied to the mysterious best-selling writer. His identity as the author of the novels was widely rumoured, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1815 Scott was given the honour of dining with <!--del_lnk--> George, Prince Regent, who wanted to meet &quot;the author of Waverley&quot;.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1819 he broke away from writing about Scotland with <i><!--del_lnk--> Ivanhoe</i>, a historical romance set in 12th-century <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. It too was a runaway success and, as he did with his first novel, he unleashed a slew of books along the same lines. Among other things, the book is noteworthy for having a very sympathetic <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> major character, <!--del_lnk--> Rebecca, considered by many critics to be the book&#39;s real heroine - relevant to the fact that the book was published at a time when the struggle for the <!--del_lnk--> Emancipation of the Jews in England was gathering momentum.<p>As his fame grew during this phase of his career, he was granted the title of <!--del_lnk--> baronet, becoming Sir Walter Scott. At this time he organised the <!--del_lnk--> visit of King George IV to Scotland, and when the King visited Edinburgh in <!--del_lnk--> 1822 the spectacular <!--del_lnk--> pageantry Scott had concocted to portray George as a rather tubby reincarnation of <!--del_lnk--> Bonnie Prince Charlie made <!--del_lnk--> tartans and <!--del_lnk--> kilts fashionable and turned them into symbols of <!--del_lnk--> Scottish national identity.<p>Scott included little in the way of punctuation in his drafts which he left to the printers to supply.<p><a id="Financial_woes" name="Financial_woes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Financial woes</span></h2>
      <p>Beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1825 he went into dire financial straits again, as his company nearly collapsed. That he was the author of his novels became general knowledge at this time as well. Rather than declare <!--del_lnk--> bankruptcy he placed his home, <!--del_lnk--> Abbotsford House, and income into a trust belonging to his creditors, and proceeded to write his way out of debt. He kept up his prodigious output of fiction (as well as producing a non-fiction biography of <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte) until <!--del_lnk--> 1831. By then his health was failing, and he died at Abbotsford in <!--del_lnk--> 1832. Though not in the clear by then, his novels continued to sell, and he made good his debts from beyond the grave. He was buried in <!--del_lnk--> Dryburgh Abbey where nearby, fittingly, a large statue can be found of <!--del_lnk--> William Wallace&mdash;one of Scotland&#39;s most romantic historical figures.<p><a id="His_home.2C_Abbotsford_House" name="His_home.2C_Abbotsford_House"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">His home, <!--del_lnk--> Abbotsford House</span></h2>

      <p>When Sir Walter Scott was a boy he sometimes travelled with his father from <!--del_lnk--> Selkirk to <!--del_lnk--> Melrose, in the <!--del_lnk--> Border Country where some of his novels are set. At a certain spot the old gentleman would stop the carriage and take his son to a stone on the site of the battle of <!--del_lnk--> Melrose (1526). Not far away was a little farm called Cartleyhole, and this he eventually purchased. In due course the farmhouse developed into a wonderful home that has been likened to a fairy palace. Through windows enriched with the insignia of heraldry the sun shone on suits of armour, trophies of the chase, fine furniture, and still finer pictures. Panelling of oak and cedar and carved ceilings relieved by coats of arms in their correct colour added to the beauty of the house. More land was purchased, until Scott owned nearly 1,000 acres (4 km&sup2;), and it is estimated that the building cost him over &pound;25,000. A neighbouring Roman road with a ford used in olden days by the abbots of Melrose suggested the name of Abbotsford.<p><a id="Assessment" name="Assessment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Assessment</span></h2>

      <p>Among the early critics of Scott was <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Twain.htm" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, who blamed Scott&#39;s &quot;romantacization of battle&quot; for the South&#39;s decision to fight the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>. Twain&#39;s ridiculing of <!--del_lnk--> chivalry in <!--del_lnk--> A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s Court is considered as specifically targeting Scott&#39;s books.<p>From being one of the most popular novelists of the 19th century, Scott suffered from a disastrous decline in popularity after the <!--del_lnk--> First World War. The tone was set early on in <!--del_lnk--> E.M. Forster&#39;s classic &quot;Aspects of the Novel&quot; (1927), where Scott was savaged as being a clumsy writer who wrote slapdash, badly plotted novels. Scott also suffered from the rising star of <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>. Considered merely an entertaining &quot;woman&#39;s novelist&quot; in the 19th century, in the 20th Austen began to be seen as perhaps the major English novelist of the first few decades of the 19th century. As Austen&#39;s star rose, Scott&#39;s sank, although, ironically, he had been one of the few male writers of his time to recognize Austen&#39;s genius.<p>Scott&#39;s many flaws (ponderousness, prolixity, lack of humor) were fundamentally out of step with Modernist sensibilities. Nevertheless, Scott was responsible for two major trends that carry on to this day. First, he essentially invented the modern historical novel; an enormous number of imitators (and imitators of imitators) would appear in the 19th century. It is a measure of Scott&#39;s influence that <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>&#39;s central railway station, opened in <!--del_lnk--> 1854 for the <!--del_lnk--> North British Railway, is called the <!--del_lnk--> Waverley Station. Second, his Scottish novels followed on from <!--del_lnk--> James Macpherson&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ossian cycle in rehabilitating the public perception of <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Highlands.htm" title="Scottish Highlands">Highland</a> culture after years in the shadows following southern distrust of hill bandits and the <!--del_lnk--> Jacobite rebellions. As enthusiastic chairman of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Celtic Society of Edinburgh</i> he contributed to the reinvention of Scottish culture. It is worth noting, however, that Scott was a Lowland Scot, and that his re-creations of the Highlands were more than a little fanciful. His organisation of the <!--del_lnk--> visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 was a pivotal event, leading Edinburgh tailors to invent many &quot;clan <!--del_lnk--> tartans&quot; out of whole cloth, so to speak. After being essentially unstudied for many decades, a small revival of interest in Scott&#39;s work began in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s and <!--del_lnk--> 1980s. Ironically, <!--del_lnk--> postmodern tastes (which favoured discontinuous narratives, and the introduction of the &#39;first person&#39; into works of fiction) were more favourable to Scott&#39;s work than Modernist tastes. Despite all the flaws, Scott is now seen as an important innovator, and a key figure in the development of Scottish and world literature.<p>Scott was also responsible, through a series of pseudonymous letters published in the <i>Edinburgh Weekly News</i> in 1826, for retaining the right of Scottish banks to issue their own banknotes, which is reflected to this day by his continued appearance on the front of all notes issued by the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Scotland.<p>Many of his works were illustrated by his friend, <!--del_lnk--> William Allan.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
