The first streetcars in D.C. were drawn by horses, but later <!--del_lnk--> cable cars were used. By the beginning of the 20th Century, the streetcar system was fully electrified. A number of the District&#39;s streetcar lines were extended into Maryland, and a separate system was established for Northern Virginia. Over the years, the various companies were party to numerous mergers and bankruptcies, until all of the streetcars were part of one company, <b>Capitol Transit</b>. Labor strife, the popularity of the automobile and pressure to replace the streetcars with buses led to the demise of streetcars in Washington, D.C. In January of 1962 the last car went on it&#39;s last run. Elements of the system remain as roads, bus barns, Metrobus depots, rail trails and unused abandoned infrastructure.<p>

A one week pass cost $1.25. In 1889 it was extended to Glenwood Cemetery and in 1895 to Soldiers&#39; Home. The Glenwood Cemetery extension was shut down in 1894.

      <p>On October 18, 1888, Congress authorized the Brightwood Railway Company to build a streetcar line on <!--del_lnk--> Georgia Avenue (then known as Seventh Street Extended or Brightwood Avenue) from <!--del_lnk--> Boundary Street to the District line at Silver Spring. Four of the five founders were partners in the Petworth subdivision, including the line&#39;s president, A. A. Thomas.<p>The Metropolitan Railroad Company had run a horse-drawn line on Georgia Avenue to Rock Creek Church Road since about 1873. The Metropolitan was authorized to run the streetcar line all the way to the District boundary, but the area was sparsely developed and the horsedrawn cars offered a long, slow trip to and from the city. Business was slow. So the Brightwood Railway Company bought the Metropolitan&#39;s Georgia Avenue line in 1890 and electrified it. Because all wiring in the city was required to be underground the line used storage battery cars. Maximum fare was 5 cents/passenger or 6 tickets for 25 cents.<p>The Brightwood line was extended to Takoma Park in 1892. In 1895 the <b>Washington, Woodside and Forest Glen Railway and Power Company</b> was organized to carry the Brightwood line into Montgomery County.<div class="thumb tleft">

Because the railroad never reached Great Falls, but instead terminated at Cabin John, it was often referred to as the &quot;Cabin John Trolley&quot;. It was acquired in 1902 by the <b>Washington Railway and Electric Company</b>. The railway was dismantled in the 1960s, but the former roadbed is still discernable in <!--del_lnk--> The Palisades and in <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery County, Maryland.

      <p>In 1900, Congress passed the Reorganization Act. This paved the way for an extensive series of mergers and acquisitions, through which ownership of all streetcars in Washington was divided between two companies: the Washington Railway and Electric Company&#39; and the Capital Traction Company. The Washington Railway and Electric Company had been formed in 1900 for just this purpose. The combined system reached its greatest size in 1915.<p>In 1925, the <!--del_lnk--> North American Company acquired, through stock purchase, a <!--del_lnk--> controlling interest in the Washington Railway and Electric Company and a <!--del_lnk--> minority interest in Capital Traction. At about this time, the system (as in other cities) began to decline in quality and ridership because of competition from the private automobile and buses. At the time, streetcars were viewed by many as old fashioned, impractical and less desirable than buses. With the coming of the <!--del_lnk--> Depression, revenues and maintenance suffered. Unlike today, most transit systems were privately owned and received no government subsidy.<div class="thumb tright">

For the first time, all street railways in the Washington were under the same management.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1937, the first <!--del_lnk--> PCC streetcar entered service in Washington on 14th Street. Over the next two years, Capital Transit would replace all cars with the PCC model.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, <!--del_lnk--> Louis Wolfson purchased from North American 45.61% of the company&#39;s stock for $20 per share. The sale allowed North American to comply with the <!--del_lnk--> Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which prevented North American from owning other businesses along with the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac Electric Power Company. This came about after a decision by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Supreme Court in <!--del_lnk--> <i>North American Company v. Security and Exchange Commission</i> in 1946.<p>On December 14, 1949, the Connecticut Avenue trolley stop and tunnel were built under <!--del_lnk--> Dupont Circle as a step in moving the entire streetcar system underground.

Roy Chalk, a New York financier who owned controlling interest in <!--del_lnk--> Trans Caribbean Airways. He purchased the assets of Capital Transit under the corporate title of <b>DC Transit</b>. Part of the agreement was that he would eliminate the streetcars and <!--del_lnk--> replace them with buses. Streetcar service ended on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1962, and most of the cars were sold to <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sarajevo.htm" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>.<p>Most of DC Transit&#39;s assets were purchased by the <b><!--del_lnk--> Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</b> (WMATA) in 1973.<br style="clear:both;" />

      <p>As was true in many <!--del_lnk--> US cities at the end of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> cable cars briefly ran down D.C. streets. They were run by two existing streetcar companies. In 1890, the <b>Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company</b> converted to cable cars and built the Navy Yard Car Barn for that purpose, but on September 29, 1897, the company&#39;s powerhouse at 14th St. and Pennsylvania Avenue NW burned down. An electric <!--del_lnk--> conduit car system replaced the cable cars the next year. The <b>Columbia Railway Company</b> also operated cable cars before converting to electrical operation. It ran them between <!--del_lnk--> October 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1895 and <!--del_lnk--> 1899.<p><a id="Electric_cars" name="Electric_cars"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Electric cars</span></h3>

      <p>In the downtown area <!--del_lnk--> overhead wires were forbidden on the streets, so standard <!--del_lnk--> trolley cars could not be used. But outside of downtown an underground conduit system was too expensive to build. To meet both needs, an unusual dual system of power supply was utilized.<p>In downtown, the cars acted as <!--del_lnk--> conduit cars. Electrical power was delivered to the cars by way of an underground delivery system. This is similar to a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> third rail&quot; system though it&#39;s technologically different. A conduit slot was located between the two riding rails and the streetcar drew power from this mechanism through a <!--del_lnk--> plow. The plow was an electrical contact which was attached to the underside of the carriage and extended more than one foot beneath the surface of the street through a slot running down the middle of the track. This technology was initially used in Blackpool, but later only in Washington, <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan, and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>In the outer areas and for interurban travel, the streetcars acted as trolley cars. At the outskirts of downtown, the cars would stop at a <b>plow pit</b>, a manned space under the tracks, where the plow could be removed by the pitman. At the same time, the conductor would attach the <!--del_lnk--> trolley pole to the overhead wires and switch to overhead power.
