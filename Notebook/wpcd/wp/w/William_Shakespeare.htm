      <p><b>William Shakespeare</b> (<!--del_lnk--> baptised <!--del_lnk--> April 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1564 &ndash; died <!--del_lnk--> April 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1616) was an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> poet and <!--del_lnk--> playwright widely regarded as the greatest <!--del_lnk--> writer of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, and the world&#39;s preeminent dramatist. He wrote about 38 plays and 154 <!--del_lnk--> sonnets, as well as a variety of other <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poems</a>. Already a popular writer in his own lifetime, Shakespeare&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> reputation became increasingly celebrated after his death and his work adulated by numerous prominent cultural figures through the centuries. In addition, Shakespeare is the most quoted writer in the literature and history of the <!--del_lnk--> English-speaking world. He is often considered to be <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> national poet and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bard of <!--del_lnk--> Avon&quot; (or simply &quot;The Bard&quot;) or the &quot;Swan of Avon&quot;.<p>Shakespeare is believed to have produced most of his work between 1586 and 1612, although the exact dates and <!--del_lnk--> chronology of the plays attributed to him are often uncertain. He is counted among the very few playwrights who have excelled in both <!--del_lnk--> tragedy and <!--del_lnk--> comedy, and his plays combine popular appeal with complex <!--del_lnk--> characterisation, poetic grandeur and philosophical depth.<p>Shakespeare&#39;s works have been translated into every major living language, and his plays are continually performed all around the world. In addition, his many quotations and <!--del_lnk--> neologisms have passed into <!--del_lnk--> everyday usage in English and other languages. Over the years, many people have speculated about Shakespeare&#39;s life, raising questions about his <!--del_lnk--> sexuality, religious affiliation, and the <!--del_lnk--> authorship of his works.<p>

      <p>William Shakespeare (also spelled Shakspere, Shakspear, Shakespere, Shakspere, Shaksper, Shaxper, and Shake-speare, since in <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan times spelling was not fixed and absolute) was born in <a href="../../wp/s/Stratford-upon-Avon.htm" title="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> in April 1564, the son of <!--del_lnk--> John Shakespeare, a successful glover and alderman from <!--del_lnk--> Snitterfield, and of <!--del_lnk--> Mary Arden, a daughter of the <!--del_lnk--> gentry. His birth is assumed to have occurred at the family house on Henley Street. Shakespeare&#39;s christening record dates to <!--del_lnk--> April 26 of that year. Because christenings were performed within a few days of birth, tradition has settled on <!--del_lnk--> April 23 as his birthday. This date provides a convenient symmetry because Shakespeare died on the same day, <!--del_lnk--> April 23 (<!--del_lnk--> May 3 on the <!--del_lnk--> Gregorian calendar), in 1616.<p>Shakespeare is believed to have attended <!--del_lnk--> King Edward VI Grammar School in central Stratford, since as the son of a prominent town official he was entitled to do so for free; however, the records that would confirm this no longer exist.<p>By 1596, Shakespeare had moved to the parish of St. Helen&#39;s, <!--del_lnk--> Bishopsgate, and by 1598 he appeared at the top of a list of actors in <i><!--del_lnk--> Every Man in His Humour</i> written by <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>. Also by 1598, his name began to appear on the title pages of his plays, presumably as a selling point.<p>There is a tradition that Shakespeare, in addition to writing many of the plays his company enacted, and being concerned as part-owner of the company with business and financial details, continued to act in various parts, such as the ghost of Hamlet&#39;s father, Adam in <i><!--del_lnk--> As You Like It</i>, and the Chorus in <i><!--del_lnk--> Henry V</i>.<p>He appears to have moved across the Thames River to Southwark sometime around 1599. By 1604, he had moved again, north of the river, where he lodged just north of St Paul&#39;s Cathedral with a <!--del_lnk--> Huguenot family named Mountjoy. His residence there is worth noting because he helped arrange a marriage between the Mountjoys&#39; daughter and their apprentice Stephen Bellott. Bellott later sued his father-in-law for defaulting on part of the promised dowry, and Shakespeare was called as a witness.<p>Various documents recording legal affairs and commercial transactions show that Shakespeare grew rich enough during his stay in London to buy a property in <!--del_lnk--> Blackfriars, London and own the second-largest house in Stratford, <!--del_lnk--> New Place.<p><a id="Later_years" name="Later_years"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Later years</span></h3>

      <p>Shakespeare&#39;s last two plays were written in 1613, after which he appears to have retired to Stratford. He died on <!--del_lnk--> April 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1616, at the age of 52, on the same date (though not same day for England was still functioning under the <!--del_lnk--> Julian calendar) as Spanish writer and poet <a href="../../wp/m/Miguel_de_Cervantes.htm" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>. He also died on his birthday, if the tradition that he was born on April 23 is correct. He was married to Hathaway until his death and was survived by his two daughters, Susanna and Judith. Susanna married <!--del_lnk--> Dr John Hall, but there are no direct descendants of the poet and playwright alive today.<p>Shakespeare is buried in the <!--del_lnk--> chancel of <!--del_lnk--> Holy Trinity Church in <a href="../../wp/s/Stratford-upon-Avon.htm" title="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a>. He was granted the honour of burial in the chancel not on account of his fame as a playwright but for purchasing a share of the <!--del_lnk--> tithe of the church for &pound;440 (a considerable sum of money at the time). A <!--del_lnk--> monument placed by his family on the wall nearest his grave features a <!--del_lnk--> bust of him posed in the act of writing. Each year on his claimed birthday, a new quill pen is placed in the writing hand of the bust.<p>He is believed to have written the <!--del_lnk--> epitaph on his tombstone:<dl>
       <dd>Good friend, for Jesus&#39; sake forbear,<dd>To dig the dust enclos&egrave;d here.<dd>Blest be the man that spares these stones,<dd>And cursed be he that moves my bones.</dl>

      <p>A number of Shakespeare&#39;s plays are widely regarded as among the greatest in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> and in <!--del_lnk--> Western literature. He wrote <!--del_lnk--> tragedies, histories, <!--del_lnk--> comedies and romances, which have been translated into every major living language, in addition to being continually performed around the world.<p>As was normal in the period, Shakespeare based many of his plays on the work of other playwrights and reworked earlier stories and historical material. For example, <i><!--del_lnk--> Hamlet</i> (c. 1601) is probably a reworking of an older, lost play (the so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> Ur-Hamlet</i>), and <i><!--del_lnk--> King Lear</i> is an adaptation of an earlier play, also called <i>King Lear</i>. For plays on historical subjects, Shakespeare relied heavily on two principal texts. Most of the Roman and Greek plays are based on <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch&#39;s <i>Parallel Lives</i> (from the 1579 English translation by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Thomas North), and the English <!--del_lnk--> history plays are indebted to <!--del_lnk--> Raphael Holinshed&#39;s 1587 <i>Chronicles</i>.<p>Shakespeare&#39;s plays tend to be placed into three main stylistic groups:<ul>
       <li>early comedies and histories (such as <i><!--del_lnk--> A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Henry IV, Part 1</i>)<li>middle period (which includes his most famous tragedies, <i><!--del_lnk--> Othello</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/m/Macbeth.htm" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Hamlet</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> King Lear</i>, as well as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> problem plays&quot; such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Troilus and Cressida</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Measure for Measure</i>)<li><!--del_lnk--> later romances (such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Winter&#39;s Tale</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tempest</i>).</ul>
      <p>The earlier plays range from broad comedy to historical nostalgia, while the middle-period plays tend to be grander in terms of theme, addressing such issues as <!--del_lnk--> betrayal, <!--del_lnk--> murder, <!--del_lnk--> lust, <!--del_lnk--> power, and <!--del_lnk--> ambition. By contrast, his late romances feature redemptive plotlines with ambiguous endings and the use of <!--del_lnk--> magic and other fantastical elements. However, the borders between these genres are never clear.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Some of Shakespeare&#39;s plays first appeared in print as a series of <!--del_lnk--> quartos, but most remained unpublished until 1623 when the posthumous <!--del_lnk--> First Folio was published by two actors who had been in Shakespeare&#39;s company: <!--del_lnk--> John Heminges and <!--del_lnk--> Henry Condell. The traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the logic of the First Folio. It is at this point that stage directions, punctuation and act divisions enter his plays, setting the trend for further future editorial decisions. Modern criticism has also labelled some of his plays &quot;<!--del_lnk--> problem plays&quot; or tragi-comedies, as they elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposefully break generic conventions. The term &quot;romances&quot; has also been preferred for the later comedies.<p>There are many controversies about the <!--del_lnk--> exact chronology of Shakespeare&#39;s plays. In addition, the fact that Shakespeare did not produce an authoritative print version of his plays during his life accounts for part of the <!--del_lnk--> textual problem often noted with his plays, which means that for several of the plays there are different textual versions. As a result, the problem of identifying what Shakespeare actually wrote became a major concern for most modern editions. Textual corruptions also stem from printers&#39; errors, compositors&#39; misreadings, or wrongly scanned lines from the source material. Additionally, in an age before standardised spelling, Shakespeare often wrote a word several times in a different spelling, contributing further to the transcribers&#39; confusions. Modern scholars also believe Shakespeare revised his plays throughout the years, sometimes leading to two existing versions of one play.<p><a id="Sonnets" name="Sonnets"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Sonnets</span></h3>

      <p>Shakespeare&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sonnets are a collection of 154 <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poems</a> that deal with such themes as <a href="../../wp/l/Love.htm" title="Love">love</a>, <!--del_lnk--> beauty, and <!--del_lnk--> mortality. All but two first appeared in the 1609 publication entitled <i>Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets</i>; numbers <!--del_lnk--> 138 (&quot;When my love swears that she is made of truth&quot;) and <!--del_lnk--> 144 (&quot;Two loves have I, of comfort and despair&quot;) had previously been published in a 1599 miscellany entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Passionate Pilgrim</i>. The Sonnets were written over a number of years, probably beginning in the early 1590s.<p>The conditions under which the sonnets were published are unclear. The 1609 text is dedicated to one &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mr. W.H.&quot;, who is described as &quot;the only begetter&quot; of the poems in the dedication. It is unknown if the dedication was written by Shakespeare or Thomas Thorpe, the publisher. It is also unknown who this man was, although there are many theories, including those who believe him to be the <!--del_lnk--> young man featured in the sonnets. In addition, it is not known whether the publication of the sonnets was even authorised by Shakespeare.<p><a id="Other_poems" name="Other_poems"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Other poems</span></h3>
      <p>In addition to his sonnets, Shakespeare also wrote several longer <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poems</a>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Venus and Adonis</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rape of Lucrece</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> A Lover&#39;s Complaint.</i> These poems appear to have been written either in an attempt to win the patronage of a rich benefactor (as was common at the time) or as the result of such patronage. For example, <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i> and <i>Venus and Adonis</i> were both dedicated to Shakespeare&#39;s patron, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton.<p>In addition, Shakespeare wrote the short poem <i><!--del_lnk--> The Phoenix and the Turtle</i>. The anthology <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> was attributed to him upon its first publication in 1599, but in fact only five of its poems are by Shakespeare and the attribution was withdrawn in the second edition.<p><a id="Style" name="Style"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Style</span></h2>

      <p>Shakespeare&#39;s works have been a major influence on subsequent theatre. Not only did Shakespeare create some of the most admired plays in <!--del_lnk--> Western literature, he also transformed English theatre by expanding expectations about what could be accomplished through <!--del_lnk--> characterisation, <!--del_lnk--> plot, <!--del_lnk--> action, <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> genre. His poetic artistry helped raise the status of popular theatre, permitting it to be admired by intellectuals as well as by those seeking pure entertainment.<p>Theatre was changing when Shakespeare first arrived in London in the late 1580s or early 1590s. Previously, the most common forms of popular English theatre were the <!--del_lnk--> Tudor <!--del_lnk--> morality plays. These plays, which blend <!--del_lnk--> piety with <!--del_lnk--> farce and <!--del_lnk--> slapstick, were <!--del_lnk--> allegories in which the characters are <!--del_lnk--> personified moral attributes who validate the virtues of <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">Godly</a> life by prompting the <!--del_lnk--> protagonist to choose such a life over evil. The characters and plot situations are <!--del_lnk--> symbolic rather than realistic. As a child, Shakespeare would likely have been exposed to this type of play (along with <!--del_lnk--> mystery plays and <!--del_lnk--> miracle plays). Meanwhile, at the universities, academic plays were being staged based on <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> <!--del_lnk--> closet dramas. These plays, often performed in <!--del_lnk--> Latin, used a more exact and academically respectable poetic style than the morality plays, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action.<p>By the late 16th century, the popularity of morality and academic plays waned as the <!--del_lnk--> English Renaissance took hold, and playwrights like <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Kyd and <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Marlowe began to revolutionise theatre. Their plays blended the old morality drama with academic theatre to produce a new <!--del_lnk--> secular form. The new drama had the poetic grandeur and philosophical depth of the academic play and the bawdy populism of the moralities. However, it was more ambiguous and complex in its meanings, and less concerned with simple moral allegories. Inspired by this new style, Shakespeare took these changes to a new level, creating plays that not only resonated on an emotional level with audiences but also explored and debated the basic elements of what it means to be human.<p><a id="Reputation" name="Reputation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Reputation</span></h2>

      <p>Shakespeare&#39;s reputation has grown considerably since his own time. During his lifetime and shortly after his death, Shakespeare was well-regarded but not considered the supreme poet of his age. He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets, but he lacked the stature of <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Spenser or <!--del_lnk--> Philip Sidney. After the <!--del_lnk--> Interregnum stage ban of 1642&ndash;1660, the new <!--del_lnk--> Restoration theatre companies had the previous generation of playwrights as the mainstay of their repertory, most of all the phenomenally popular <!--del_lnk--> Beaumont and Fletcher team, but also <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> and Shakespeare. As with other older playwrights, Shakespeare&#39;s plays were mercilessly adapted by later dramatists for the <!--del_lnk--> Restoration stage with little of the reverence that would later develop.<p>Beginning in the late 17th century, Shakespeare began to be considered the supreme English-language playwright (and, to a lesser extent, poet). Initially this reputation focused on Shakespeare as a dramatic poet, to be studied on the printed page rather than in the theatre. By the early 19th century, though, Shakespeare began hitting peaks of fame and popularity. During this time, theatrical productions of Shakespeare provided spectacle and melodrama for the masses and were extremely popular. <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> critics such as <a href="../../wp/s/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.htm" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a> then raised admiration for Shakespeare to adulation or <i><!--del_lnk--> bardolatry</i> (from bard + idolatry), in line with the Romantic reverence for the poet as prophet and genius. In the middle to late 19th century, Shakespeare also became an emblem of English pride and a &quot;rallying-sign&quot;, as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Carlyle wrote in 1841, for the whole <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>.<p>This reverence has provoked a negative reaction. In the 21st century most inhabitants of the <!--del_lnk--> English-speaking world encounter Shakespeare at school at a young age, and there is an association by some students of his work with boredom and incomprehension and of &quot;high art&quot; not easily appreciated by popular culture, an ironic fate considering the social mix of Shakespeare&#39;s audience. At the same time, Shakespeare&#39;s plays remain more frequently staged than the works of any other playwright and are frequently <!--del_lnk--> adapted into film&mdash;including <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood movies specifically marketed to broad teenage audiences, though many simply take credit for his plots rather than his narrative. Famously, Shakespeare&#39;s plays are often transferred to a different environment even when retaining his dialogue.<p>On another level, many modern English words and phrases that are taken for granted <!--del_lnk--> were introduced by Shakespeare.<p><a id="Speculations_about_Shakespeare" name="Speculations_about_Shakespeare"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare&quot;</div>
