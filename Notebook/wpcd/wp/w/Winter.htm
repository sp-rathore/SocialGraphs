      <p>Meteorological winter is the season having the shortest days (which vary greatly according to <!--del_lnk--> latitude) and the lowest temperatures. Nighttime predominates the winter season, and in some regions it has the highest rate of <!--del_lnk--> precipitation as well as prolonged dampness due to permanent snow cover in such areas. Measured <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomically</a>, winter begins on the shortest day of the year, and each day of winter has more sunlight than the previous one.<p>Outside the equatorial areas, winter is cold and (particularly in the Northern Hemisphere) snowy. <!--del_lnk--> Blizzards often develop and cause many transportation delays. A rare meteorological phenomenon encountered during winter is <!--del_lnk--> ice fog, which is composed of <!--del_lnk--> ice crystals suspended in the air and happening only at very low temperatures, below about &minus;30 &deg;C <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Time_period_of_winter" name="Time_period_of_winter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Time period of winter</span></h2>
      <p>Astronomically, it starts with the <!--del_lnk--> winter solstice (around <!--del_lnk--> December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere and <!--del_lnk--> June 21 in the Southern Hemisphere), and ends with the <!--del_lnk--> spring equinox (around <!--del_lnk--> March 21 in the Northern Hemisphere and <!--del_lnk--> September 21 in the Southern Hemisphere). In <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a>, it is by convention counted instead as the whole months of June, July and August in the Southern Hemisphere and December, January and February in the Northern Hemisphere.<p>However, in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, the winter season beginning <!--del_lnk--> November 1 on <!--del_lnk--> All Hallows or <!--del_lnk--> Samhain. Winter ends and spring begins on <!--del_lnk--> Imbolc or <!--del_lnk--> Candlemas, which is February 1 or 2. This system of seasons is based on the length of days exclusively. The three-month period of the shortest days and weakest solar radiation occurs during November, December and January in the Northern Hemisphere (May-July in the Southern).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Chinese astronomy (and other <!--del_lnk--> East Asian <!--del_lnk--> calendars), winter is taken to commence on or around <!--del_lnk--> November 7, with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ji&eacute;q&igrave;</i> known as (&#x7ACB;&#x51AC; <i>l&igrave; d&#x14D;ng</i>, literally &quot;establishment of winter&quot;.)<p>In reality, the three-month period associated with the coldest average temperatures typically begins somewhere in late November or early December in the Northern Hemisphere. If &quot;winter&quot; is defined as the statistically coldest quarter of the year, then the astronomical definition is too late by almost all local climate standards, and the traditional English/Irish definition of November 1 (May 1 in the Southern Hemisphere) is almost always too early to fit this standard. No matter the recogning, winter is the only season that spans two calendar years in the northern hemisphere. (In other words, there are very few temperate climates in which the vernal equinox is on average colder than the winter solstice, and very few temperate climates in which <!--del_lnk--> Samhain is colder than <!--del_lnk--> Imbolc)<p><a id="What_causes_winter" name="What_causes_winter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">What causes winter</span></h2>

      <p>The tilt of the earth&#39;s axis relative to its orbital plane has a dramatic effect on the weather. The popular belief that winter is caused by the Earth being farther from the Sun than in summer is not true. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere, winter occurs when the Earth is its closest to the Sun.<p>The earth is tilted at an angle of 23&deg;27&#39; (23 degrees 27 minutes) to the plane of its orbit, and this causes different latitudes on the Earth to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. It is this variation that primarily brings about the seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere.<p>During winter in either hemisphere, sunlight hits that hemisphere at an oblique angle. In regions experiencing winter, the same amount of <!--del_lnk--> solar radiation is spread out over a larger area (see <!--del_lnk--> Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect is compounded by the larger distance that the light must travel through the atmosphere, allowing the atmosphere to dissipate more of this already limited heat.<p><a id="Ecology" name="Ecology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecology</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Animals" name="Animals"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Animals</span></h3>
      <p>To survive the harshness of winter, many animals have developed different behavioural and morphological adaptations:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Migration is a common effect of winter upon animals, notably <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>. However some birds, the <!--del_lnk--> cardinal for example, do not migrate.<li><!--del_lnk--> Hibernation is a state of reduced <!--del_lnk--> metabolic activity during the winter. These animals &quot;sleep&quot; during winter and only come out as warm weather returns. For example, <!--del_lnk--> gophers, <a href="../../wp/b/Bear.htm" title="Bear">bears</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Frog.htm" title="Frog">frogs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> snakes and <a href="../../wp/b/Bat.htm" title="Bat">bats</a> hibernate.<li>Some animals store food for the winter and live upon it instead of hibernating completely. This is the case of <!--del_lnk--> squirrels, <a href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver">beavers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> skunks, <a href="../../wp/b/Badger.htm" title="Badger">badgers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> raccoons.<li>Resistance is observed when an animal endures winter, but changes in ways such as colour and <!--del_lnk--> musculature. The colour of the <!--del_lnk--> fur or <!--del_lnk--> plumage are changed to white in order to be confused with snow and thus, to retain their <!--del_lnk--> cryptic coloration year round. Examples are the <!--del_lnk--> ptarmigan, the <!--del_lnk--> arctic fox, the <a href="../../wp/w/Weasel.htm" title="Weasel">weasel</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> white-tailed jack rabbit or the <!--del_lnk--> mountain hare.<li>Some fur-coated mammals grow a heavier fur coat during the winter. This improves the heat-retention qualities of the fur. The coat is then shed following the winter season to allow better cooling. The heavier winter coat made this season a favorite for <!--del_lnk--> trappers who sought more profitable skins.<li><a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">Snow</a> also affects the ways animals behave, as many take advantage of the insulating properties of snow by burrowing in it. <!--del_lnk--> Mice and <a href="../../wp/v/Vole.htm" title="Vole">voles</a> typically live under the snow layer.</ul>
      <p><a id="Plants" name="Plants"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Plants</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Annual plants never survive the winter. As for <!--del_lnk--> perennial plants, many small ones profit from the insulating effects of snow by being buried in it. Larger plants, particularly <!--del_lnk--> deciduous trees, usually let their upper part die, but their roots are still protected by the snow layer. Few plants bloom in the winter, though exceptions include the <!--del_lnk--> flowering apricot (which flowers in time for <!--del_lnk--> Chinese New Year).<p><a id="Activities" name="Activities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Activities</span></h2>

      <p>Passing seasons change the habits and moods of people. Around November and December in the northern hemisphere, a gloominess nicknamed &quot;winter blues&quot;, &quot;February blahs&quot;, &quot;Holiday depression&quot;, or doldrums, is informally noted amongst people. The severest cases of this type of <!--del_lnk--> depression is diagnosed as <!--del_lnk--> seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Symptoms include sleeping more, tiredness, depression, and physical aches. Although causes include genetic disposition and stress, the prevailing environmental influence is decreased exposure to <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> due to winter weather patterns and the increased amount of clothing that must be worn to keep warm.<p><a id="The_symbolism_of_winter" name="The_symbolism_of_winter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The symbolism of winter</span></h2>
      <p>Winter is highly <!--del_lnk--> symbolic of many things to many people and has been used to represent various things by artists in all media. Some use winter to suggest death, as in <!--del_lnk--> Robert Frost&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;. Some use it to suggest the absence of hope, as in <a href="../../wp/c/C._S._Lewis.htm" title="C. S. Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Lion%252C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe.htm" title="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>,</i> where it was always winter but never <!--del_lnk--> Christmas. Winter is one concerto in <a href="../../wp/a/Antonio_Vivaldi.htm" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Vivaldi</a>&#39;s &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;; and there are many examples of four paintings, all showing the same scene in different seasons. Ursula K. LeGuin&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is set on a planet named Winter. In <!--del_lnk--> Alex Raymond&#39;s comic strip, <i><!--del_lnk--> Flash Gordon</i>, there is a land called Frigia, where it is always winter. The land of Frigia is also featured in the serial <i><!--del_lnk--> Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe</i>. Other uses of winter in the graphic arts occur in <!--del_lnk--> Winsor McCay&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Little Nemo in Slumberland</i>. There are many films in which a winter setting plays an important role, <i><!--del_lnk--> Fargo</i> being an example. In addition to this, novels such as <i>Ethan Frome</i> also use a winter setting to mirror the bleak, frozen feelings that the characters harbour.<p><a id="Mythological_explanations_of_winter" name="Mythological_explanations_of_winter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mythological explanations of winter</span></h2>
