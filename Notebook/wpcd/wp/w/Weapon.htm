      <p>A <b>weapon</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> tool that is intended or is used to <!--del_lnk--> injure, kill, or <!--del_lnk--> incapacitate, to damage or <!--del_lnk--> destroy, or to otherwise render <!--del_lnk--> resources non-functional or unavailable. Weapons may be used to <!--del_lnk--> attack and <!--del_lnk--> defend, and consequently also to <!--del_lnk--> threaten or <!--del_lnk--> protect. Metaphorically, anything used to damage (even <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychologically</a>) can be referred to as a weapon. A weapon can be as simple as a <!--del_lnk--> club or as complex as an <!--del_lnk--> intercontinental ballistic missile.<p>

      <p>The weapon is any tool or object that is used to increase the destructive range or power of a human. From the earliest traces of mankind up to our modern civilization, weapons have been a facet of human development. Weapons development has accelerated along with other areas of technology in more modern times. In ancient times, from the dawn of humanity through the Classical civilizations of <!--del_lnk--> Greece and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Rome</a>, weapons were primarily extensions of an individual&#39;s strength, essentially making up for the human body&#39;s lack of natural weapons such as claws. These weapons allowed the bearer to be substantially more lethal than a similar human without such a weapon. The Medieval period, including the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, marked a period of distinct advancement in weaponry. Due to some of the unique influences of the period, weapons revolved around two major areas. First was that of knights. These horsemen required new weapons, as well as promoting development of weapons to defeat them. Second was that of castles. The building of castles on a large scale necessitated new weapons to help defend and attack them.<p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> marked the beginning of the implementation of combustion based devices in warfare. The most long-lasting effect of this was the introduction of cannon and firearms to the battlefield, where they are still at the core of modern weaponry. However, many other machines of war were experimented with.<p>From the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution through the beginning of the 20th Century, human-powered weapons were finally excluded from the battlefield for the most part, as they were normally close-range &amp; difficult to use. Sometimes referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Rifles, this period was characterized by the development of firearms for infantry and cannons for support, as well as the beginnings of mechanized weapons such as the machine gun.<p><a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> marked the entry of fully industrialized warfare, and weapons were developed quickly to meet wartime needs. Many new technologies were developed, particularly in the development of military aircraft and vehicles. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> however, perhaps marked the most frantic period of weapons development in the history of humanity. Massive numbers of new designs and concepts were fielded, and all existing technologies were improved between 1939 and 1945. Ultimately, the most powerful of all invented weapons was the <!--del_lnk--> nuclear bomb.<p>After World War II, with the onset of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalized, as participants engaged in a constant race to develop weapons and counter-weapons. This constant state of weapons development continues into the modern era, and remains a constant draw on the resources of most nations.<p><a id="Ancient_weapons" name="Ancient_weapons"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient weapons</span></h3>
      <p>The basic tasks a weapon must perform have not changed since ancient times. All weapons do one or more of the following:<ol>
       <li>Concentrate <!--del_lnk--> pressure: the sharp end of a broken stone or pointed stick will apply more force per unit area, and do more harm, than the blunt end. A material&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> hardness determines its ability to apply or resist pressure.<li>Store <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a>: an object accumulates kinetic energy as a person accelerates it, and releases this energy in a much shorter time frame upon impact, thus magnifying a person&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> power.<li>Project <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a>: a thrown rock or long stick allows a person to affect an adversary from a distance.</ol>
      <p>As shown by the preceding examples, even simple items such as rocks and sticks can often serve these functions better than the human body. The usefulness of such tools made their development of paramount importance for a <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humanity">humanity</a> consisting of small, thinly spread, hunter-gatherer communities. The first known traces of weapons are from the <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone age">stone age</a> with <!--del_lnk--> flint <!--del_lnk--> knives, <a href="../../wp/a/Axe.htm" title="Axe">handaxes</a> and heads for large <!--del_lnk--> darts. There is no evidence for handaxes being thrown, but very good evidence for them having been used to butcher animals. Instead, darts seem to have been a powerful <!--del_lnk--> projectile weapon: anthropologists have thrown reconstructed darts through several <!--del_lnk--> inches of <!--del_lnk--> oak using <!--del_lnk--> atlatls. The broad, leaf-shaped heads penetrate deeply, and easily cut <!--del_lnk--> arteries.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:182px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/22/2252.jpg.htm" title="Bronze age weaponry."><img alt="Bronze age weaponry." height="254" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Bronze_age_weapons_Romania.jpg" src="../../images/22/2252.jpg" width="180" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Some weapons are probably much older than the dart, although little early evidence for them exists. These include the <!--del_lnk--> sling and the <!--del_lnk--> spear. Even though these weapons are quite simple, they were a major military weapon at least until Roman times; a unit of fast-moving <!--del_lnk--> skirmishers could be equipped with them at very little cost. Lack of early evidence is understandable, as slings are prone to decay, and it would be difficult to prove that a particular stone has been used as ammunition. Similarly, there is less incentive to put a stone point onto a spear than a dart. A weighted spear point is a liability rather than an asset, and the greater momentum imparted by stabbing makes sharpness less critical than toughness, so that points of bone, antler, or even fire-hardened wood can make more effective spear points. Once metal became available, its toughness made spears and <!--del_lnk--> pikes the core of most infantry forces.<p>Some of the earliest evidence for <!--del_lnk--> arrows are from ca. 20,000 BC in the <!--del_lnk--> Levant (the so-called &#39;Geometric Kebaran&#39; period), made with several very small sharp pieces of stone embedded in an arrowshaft. Here again, far earlier examples may have been subject to decay: for instance, some cultures make weighted arrow points by cutting a hollow reed diagonally and filling the end segment with clay.<p><!--del_lnk--> Archery and <!--del_lnk--> swords have been crucial for warfare. Archery, because of the large amount of energy that can be easily stored and released using a <!--del_lnk--> bow, and short swords because of their lethality in close combat. Far greater energy can be stored in a <!--del_lnk--> composite bow than a wooden bow of the same weight due to clever mechanical design and choice of materials, but militarily such weapons were mostly limited to use in dry climates. Traditional designs are held together by animal glue (chemically similar to <!--del_lnk--> gelatin); moisture would weaken the glue and damage bows of this design. The <!--del_lnk--> long bow makes up for less exotic materials with its larger size. In another tradeoff, short swords can be optimized for either thrusting or cutting; the former focuses on pressure, the latter on energy. The <i><!--del_lnk--> gladius hispaniensis</i> could slip through openings in armor, and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> doctrine held that a stab wound as shallow as one <!--del_lnk--> inch could be lethal. The hatchet-like <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <!--del_lnk--> kopis, by contrast, seems built to dismember, but its point-heavy balance might make it clumsy against comprehensive armor.<p>The most effective defense to traditional weapons was a <!--del_lnk--> fortress. The doctrines to support fortresses in the age of edged weapons may have greatly influenced medieval and noble history. <!--del_lnk--> Medieval siege weapons were used in countervailing doctrines, but the stave-sling and even the bow often had superior range, making them unsafe to use.<p><a id="Combustion-powered_weapons" name="Combustion-powered_weapons"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Combustion-powered weapons</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/f/Firearm.htm" title="Firearm">Firearms</a> are qualitatively different from earlier weapons because they store energy in a combustible <!--del_lnk--> propellant such as <a href="../../wp/g/Gunpowder.htm" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>, rather than in a weight or spring. This energy is released quite rapidly, and can be restored without much effort by the user, so that even early firearms such as the <!--del_lnk--> arquebus were much more <!--del_lnk--> powerful than human-powered weapons. They became increasingly important and effective during the 16th century to 19th century, with progressive improvements in <!--del_lnk--> ignition <!--del_lnk--> mechanisms followed by revolutionary changes in <!--del_lnk--> ammunition handling and propellant. During the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Civil War various technologies including the <!--del_lnk--> machine gun and <!--del_lnk--> ironclad warship emerged that would be recognizable and useful military weapons today, particularly in lower-technology conflicts. In the 19th century <!--del_lnk--> warship propulsion changed from <!--del_lnk--> sail power to <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuel</a>-powered <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engines</a>.<p>The age of edged weapons ended abruptly just before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> with rifled <!--del_lnk--> artillery, such as <!--del_lnk--> howitzers which are able to destroy any masonry fortress. This single invention caused a revolution in military affairs and doctrines that continues to this day. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> Technology during World War I for a detailed discussion.</i><p>An important feature of <!--del_lnk--> industrial age warfare was <!--del_lnk--> technological escalation - an innovation could, and would, be rapidly matched by copying it, and often with yet another innovation to counter it. The <!--del_lnk--> technological escalation during World War I was profound, producing armed <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tanks</a>.<p>This continued in the period between the end of that war and <!--del_lnk--> the next, with continuous improvements of all weapons by all major powers. Many modern military weapons, particularly ground-based ones, are relatively minor improvements on those of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> military technology during World War II for a detailed discussion.</i><p>
       <br /> The most notable development in weaponry since World War II has been the combination and further development of two weapons first used in it&mdash;<a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> ballistic missile, leading to its ultimate configuration: the <!--del_lnk--> ICBM. The mutual possession of these by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> ensured that either nation could inflict terrible damage on the other; so terrible, in fact, that neither nation was willing to instigate direct, all-out war with the other (a phenomenon known as <!--del_lnk--> Mutually Assured Destruction). The indiscriminate nature of the destruction has made nuclear-tipped missiles essentially useless for the smaller wars fought since. However computer-guided weaponry of all kinds, from <!--del_lnk--> precision-guided munitions (or &quot;smart bombs&quot;) to computer-aimed tank rounds, has greatly increased weaponry&#39;s accuracy.<p><a id="Information_warfare" name="Information_warfare"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Information warfare</span></h3>
      <p>In modern warfare, since all redoubts are traps, maneuver and coordination of forces is decisive, overshadowing particular weapons. The goal of every modern commander is therefore to &quot;operate within the observation-decision-action cycle of the enemy.&quot; In this way, the modern commander can bring overwhelming force to bear on isolated groups of the enemy, and &quot;tactically&quot; overwhelm an enemy.<p>Traditional military maneuvers tried to achieve this coordination with &quot;fronts&quot; made of lines of military assets. These were formerly the only way to prevent harm to friendly forces. Close-order marching and drill (a traditional military skill) was an early method to get relative superiority of coordination. Derivative methods (such as &quot;leapfrogging units to advance a line&quot;) survived into combined arms warfare to coordinate aircraft, artillery, armor and infantry.<p>Computers are changing this. The most extreme example so far (2003) is the use of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> swarm&quot; tactics by the U.S. military in <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. The U.S. had instantaneous, reliably encrypted communications, perfect navigation using <!--del_lnk--> GPS and computer-mediated communications to aim precision weapons.<p>In swarm tactics, small units pass through possible enemy territory. When attacked they attempt to survive by calling down immediate overwhelming showers of precision-guided air-dropped munitions for armor, and <!--del_lnk--> cluster bombs for enemy troops. To consolidate such a region, nearby <!--del_lnk--> artillery begin bombardment, and ground units rush in on safe vectors through the bombardments, avoiding them by computer-mediated navigation aids.<p>Thus in modern warfare, <!--del_lnk--> satellite navigation systems, <!--del_lnk--> digital radios and <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computers</a> give decisive advantages to ordinary military personnel armed with weapons that are otherwise unremarkable.<p><a id="Types_of_weapons" name="Types_of_weapons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of weapons</span></h2>

      <p>There are essentially three facets to classifying weapon types: who uses it, how it works, and what it targets.<p><i>Who uses it</i> essentially determines how it can be employed:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Personal weapons (or <!--del_lnk--> Small Arms) are designed to be used by an individual person.<li><!--del_lnk--> Crew served weapons are larger than personal weapons, requiring more than one <!--del_lnk--> crew member to operate correctly.<li><!--del_lnk--> Fortification weapons are designed to be mounted in a permanent installation, or used primarily within a fortification.<li><!--del_lnk--> Mountain weapons are designed for use by mountain forces or those operating in difficult terrain and harsh climates.<li><!--del_lnk--> Vehicle weapons are designed to be mounted on any type of <!--del_lnk--> military vehicle.<li><!--del_lnk--> Railway weapons are designed to be mounted on railway cars, including armored trains.<li><!--del_lnk--> Aircraft weapons are designed to be carried on and used by some type of <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>, <!--del_lnk--> helicopter, or other aerial vehicle.<li><!--del_lnk--> Naval weapons are designed to be mounted on <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ships</a> and <!--del_lnk--> submarines.<li><!--del_lnk--> Space weapons are designed to be used in or launched from space.</ul>
      <p><i>How it works</i> refers to the construction of the weapon and how it operates:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Antimatter weapons (still theoretical) combine matter and antimatter to cause a powerful explosion. Unfortunately (or fortunately), antimatter is hard to make and harder to store.<li><!--del_lnk--> Archery related weapons operate by using a tensioned string to launch a projectile at some target.<li><!--del_lnk--> Artillery are large firearms capable of launching heavy projectiles (normally explosive) over long distances.<li><!--del_lnk--> Biological weapons spread biological agents, attacking humans (or livestock) by causing disease and infection.<li><!--del_lnk--> Chemical weapons spread chemical agents, attacking humans by poisoning and causing reactions.<li><!--del_lnk--> Energy weapons rely on concentrating forms of energy to attack, such as lasers, electrical shocks, and thermal or sonic attack.<li><!--del_lnk--> Explosive weapons use a physical explosion to create blast concussion or spread shrapnel.<li><!--del_lnk--> Firearms use a chemical charge to launch one or more projectiles down a rifled or smoothbore barrel.<li><!--del_lnk--> Future weapons make use of futuristic high tech weapon systems and advanced materials.<li><!--del_lnk--> Incendiary weapons rely on combustible materials and an ignition mechanism to cause damage by fire.<li><!--del_lnk--> Non-lethal weapons are used to attack and subdue humans, but are designed to minimize the risk of killing the target.<li><!--del_lnk--> Magnetic weapons is one that uses magnetic fields to accelerate and propel projectiles, or to focus charged particle beams.<li><!--del_lnk--> M&ecirc;l&eacute;e weapons operate as physical extensions of the user&#39;s body and directly impact their target.<li><!--del_lnk--> Missiles are rockets which are guided to their target after launch. This is also a general term for <!--del_lnk--> projectile weapons.<li><a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">Nuclear weapons</a> use radioactive materials to create <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> and/or <!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion detonations above a target (&quot;air-burst&quot;) or at ground-level.<li><!--del_lnk--> Primitive weapons make no use of technological or industrial elements, instead being purely constructed of easily obtainable natural materials.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ranged weapons cause a <!--del_lnk--> projectile to leave the user and (ideally) strike a target afterwards.<li><!--del_lnk--> Rockets use chemical propellant to accelerate a projectile (usually with an explosive warhead) towards a target and are typically unguided once fired.<li><!--del_lnk--> Suicide weapons are typically explosive in nature and exploit the willingness of their operator to not survive the attack to reach their target.</ul>
      <p><i>What it targets</i> refers to what type of target the weapon is designed to attack:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-aircraft weapons target enemy aircraft, helicopters, missiles and any other aerial vehicles in flight.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-fortification weapons are designed to target enemy installations, including bunkers and fortifications. The American <!--del_lnk--> bunker buster bomb is designed to travel almost 10 metres underground before detonating, toppling underground installations.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-personnel weapons are designed to attack people, either individually or in numbers.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-radiation weapons target enemy sources of electronic radiation, particularly radar emitters.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-ship weapons target enemy ships and vessels on water.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-submarine weapons target enemy submarines and other underwater targets.<li><!--del_lnk--> Anti-tank weapons are primarily used to defeat armored targets, but may be targeted against other less well armored targets.<li><!--del_lnk--> Area denial weapons are designed to target territory, making it unsafe or unsuitable for enemy use or travel.<li><!--del_lnk--> Hunting weapons are designed particularly for use against animals for hunting purposes.<li><!--del_lnk--> Infantry support weapons are designed to attack various threats to infantry units, supporting the infantry&#39;s operations, including <!--del_lnk--> heavy machine guns, <!--del_lnk--> mortars and pinpoint <!--del_lnk--> airstrikes ordered by the <!--del_lnk--> infantry, often to strike heavily defended positions, such as enemy camps or extensively powerful machine-gun nests.</ul>
