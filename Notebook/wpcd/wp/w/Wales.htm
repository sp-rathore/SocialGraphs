Wales has never been a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign state with precisely the same borders as now. However, in the eleventh century <!--del_lnk--> Gruffudd ap Llywelyn gained control of a territory with much the same boundaries as modern Wales and, from about 1057 till Gruffudd&#39;s death in 1063, all Wales could be said to have one King, his sovereignty recognised by England. This has never been repeated in the nation&#39;s history and, by the time of the Anglo-Norman conquest of West Wales in <!--del_lnk--> 1282, Wales had reverted to being a collection of independent kingdoms. Nevertheless, tradition has it that in 1404 <!--del_lnk--> Owain Glynd&#x175;r was crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland., and he certainly held parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including <!--del_lnk--> Machynlleth.<p><a href="../../wp/w/Welsh_law.htm" title="Welsh law">Welsh law</a> was not replaced in all cases by <!--del_lnk--> English law until the <a href="../../wp/l/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%25E2%2580%25931542.htm" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542">Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542</a>.

      <p>The English name for Wales <!--del_lnk--> originates from the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic word <i><!--del_lnk--> Walha</i>, meaning &quot;stranger&quot; or &quot;foreigner&quot;, probably derived from the name <!--del_lnk--> Volcae. As the Celts of Gaul were Romanized, the word changed its meaning to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Romanic people&quot;, as is still apparent in the name of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Walloons</i> of Belgium, <!--del_lnk--> Wallachia in Romania, as well as the &quot;-wall&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall. The Welsh themselves called themselves <i>Cymry</i>, &quot;compatriots&quot;, and named their country <i>Cymru</i>, which is thought to have meant &quot;Land of the Compatriots&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Old Welsh; this has reference to their awareness that they were the original countrymen of Wales, and indeed Britain by virtue of their ancestors the <i>Brythoniaid</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Brythons), and also in order to distinguish themselves from the foreign invaders of Britain, the <i>Saeson</i> (English). There is also a mediaeval legend found in the <!--del_lnk--> Historia Regum Britanniae of <i>Sieffre o Fynwy</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth) that derives it from the name <!--del_lnk--> Camber, son of <!--del_lnk--> Brutus and, according to the legend, the eponymous King of Cymru (<!--del_lnk--> Cambria in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>); this however was largely the fruit of Geoffrey&#39;s vivid imagination. <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland and <!--del_lnk--> Cumbria in the north of England derive their names from the same Old Welsh word.<p><i>See also</i>: <!--del_lnk--> History of the term Vlach<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Humans first inhabited what is now Wales at the end of the last <!--del_lnk--> Ice Age. The first documented history was during the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> occupation of Britain. At that time the area of modern Wales was divided into many tribes, of which the <!--del_lnk--> Silures in the south-east and the <!--del_lnk--> Ordovices in the central and north-west areas were the largest and most powerful. The Romans established a string of forts across what is now southern Wales, as far west as <!--del_lnk--> Carmarthen (<i>Caerfyrddin</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Latin: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Maridunum</i></span>), and mined gold at <!--del_lnk--> Dolaucothi in Carmarthenshire. There is evidence that they progressed even farther west. They also built the legionary fortress at <!--del_lnk--> Caerleon (<!--del_lnk--> Latin: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Isca Silurum</i></span>), whose magnificent <!--del_lnk--> amphitheatre is the best preserved in Britain. The Romans were also busy in northern Wales, and the mediaeval Welsh tale <i>Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig</i> claims that <!--del_lnk--> Magnus Maximus (<i>Macsen Wledig</i>), one of the last western Roman emperors, married Elen or Helen, the daughter of a Welsh chieftain from <!--del_lnk--> Segontium, present-day <!--del_lnk--> Caernarfon. It was in the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">4th century</a> during the Roman occupation that <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> was introduced to Wales.<p>After the collapse of <!--del_lnk--> the Roman Empire in Britain in 410, the native <!--del_lnk--> Romano-Britons became divided into numerous petty kingdoms. Although the low-lying kingdoms of the south and east of Britain were soon overrun, attempts by the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon tribes to invade the upland kingdoms in the western parts of Britain failed due to the fierce resistance of their people and the mountainous terrain. This tenacious survival by the Romano-Britons and their descendants in the western kingdoms was to become the foundation of what we now know as Wales. However, their ability to fight back on equal terms and perhaps liberate those parts of the country from which they had been driven was gradually sapped by the loss of the rich lowlands and cities of the south and east.<dl>
       <dd><i>Some, therefore, of the miserable remnant, being taken in the mountains, were murdered in great numbers; others, constrained by famine, came and yielded themselves to be slaves for ever to their foes, running the risk of being instantly slain, which truly was the greatest favour that could be offered them: some others passed beyond the seas with loud lamentations instead of the voice of exhortation.</i> - <!--del_lnk--> Gildas Sapiens, c.540</dl>
      <p>By the eighth century the eastern borders with the Anglo Saxons had broadly been set. An Anglo-Saxon king, <!--del_lnk--> Offa of Mercia, is credited with having constructed a great earth wall, or dyke, along the border with his kingdom, to mark off a large part of the Welsh speaking <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Powys which he had just conquered. Parts of <!--del_lnk--> Offa&#39;s Dyke (<i>Clawdd Offa</i>) can still be seen today and <i>croesi Clawdd Offa</i> (&quot;crossing Offa&#39;s Dyke&quot;) is still a common expression in Wales for visiting England.<p><a id="Medieval" name="Medieval"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval</span></h3>
      <p>The southern and eastern lands lost to English settlement became known in Welsh as <i>Lloegyr</i> (Modern Welsh <i>Lloegr</i>), which may have referred to the kingdom of Mercia originally, and which came to refer to England as a whole. The barbarian tribes who now dominated these lands were invariably called <i>Saeson</i>, meaning &quot;Saxons&quot;. The Anglo-Saxons, in turn, labelled the Romano-British as <!--del_lnk--> Walha, meaning &#39;foreigner&#39; or &#39;stranger&#39;. The Welsh continued to call themselves <i>Brythoniaid</i> (Brythons or Britons) well into <!--del_lnk--> the Middle Ages, though the first use of <i>Cymru</i> and <i>y Cymry</i> is found as early as 633 in the <!--del_lnk--> Gododdin of <!--del_lnk--> Aneirin. In <!--del_lnk--> Armes Prydain, written in about 930, the words <i>Cymry</i> and <i>Cymro</i> are used as often as 15 times. It was not until about the 12th century however, that <i>Cymry</i> began to overtake <i>Brythoniaid</i> in their writings.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> Norman conquest of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> in 1066, the independence of the Welsh kingdoms was gradually eroded, in spite of the efforts of Welsh princes such as <!--del_lnk--> Owain Gwynedd and <!--del_lnk--> Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (<i>Llywelyn Fawr</i>; Llywelyn the Great). <!--del_lnk--> William the Conquerer sought to subdue the Welsh by the establishment of Anglo-Norman lordships on the <!--del_lnk--> borders of Wales, and these <!--del_lnk--> Marcher Lords retained considerable independence until the reign of Henry VIII. In 1282, with the death in battle of <!--del_lnk--> Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Wales&#39;s last independent leader, Welsh territory west of the Marches came under the rule of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">Edward I of England</a>. To help maintain his power, he constructed a series of great stone <!--del_lnk--> castles. <!--del_lnk--> Beaumaris, <!--del_lnk--> Caernarfon, and <!--del_lnk--> Conwy were built to overshadow the Welsh royal home and headquarters <!--del_lnk--> Aber Garth Celyn, Gwynedd. The next few centuries were often tumultuous, with a series of minor revolts culminating in the rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> Owain Glynd&#x175;r. <a id="Annexation" name="Annexation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Annexation</span></h3>
      <p>Wales was legally annexed by the <a href="../../wp/l/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%25E2%2580%25931542.htm" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542">Laws in Wales Act 1535</a>, in the reign of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> of England, who was himself partly of Welsh ancestry. The <!--del_lnk--> Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and <!--del_lnk--> Berwick, a town located on the Anglo-Scottish border) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise.<p>In the early 19th century parts of Wales became heavily industrialised. In the north slate quarrying became the major employer. Ironworks were set up in the valleys running south from the <!--del_lnk--> Brecon Beacons particularly around the <!--del_lnk--> new town of <!--del_lnk--> Merthyr Tydfil, with iron production later spreading westwards to the hinterlands of <!--del_lnk--> Neath and <!--del_lnk--> Swansea where <!--del_lnk--> anthracite coal was already being mined. From the 1840s coal mining spread to the <!--del_lnk--> Aberdare and <!--del_lnk--> Rhondda valleys. This led to a rapid increase in the population of these areas. In 1801 just over 587,000 people lived in Wales; by 1901, this had increased to over 2,012,000. The most significant rises in population occurred in industrial counties - Denbigh, Flint, Monmouth and Glamorgan. The century witnessed a transition from a society that was predominantly rural (around 80% lived outside urban settlements in 1800) to a largely urbanised, industrial society (in 1911, only 20% lived in non-urban areas).<p><a id="Nationalist_revival" name="Nationalist_revival"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nationalist revival</span></h3>
      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>, Wales saw a revival in its national status. An independence movement was led by <!--del_lnk--> Plaid Cymru, seeking greater autonomy from the rest of the UK. In 1955, the term <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales became common for describing the area to which English law applied, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> was proclaimed as capital. In 1962 the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Language Society (<i>Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg</i>) was formed in response to fears that the language might soon die out. Nationalism grew, particularly following the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in 1965, drowning the village of <!--del_lnk--> Capel Celyn to create a reservoir supplying water to <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. In 1966 the Carmarthen Parliamentary seat was won by Plaid Cymru at a by-election, their first Parliamentary seat. A terror campaign was waged for a short period by the <!--del_lnk--> Free Wales Army and <!--del_lnk--> Mudiad Amddiffyn Cymru (MAC - Welsh Defence Movement). In the years leading up to the investiture of <!--del_lnk--> Prince Charles as <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales in 1969, these groups were responsible for a number of bomb blasts destroying water pipes and tax and other offices. In 1967, the <!--del_lnk--> Wales and Berwick Act 1746 was repealed for Wales, and a legal definition of Wales, and of the boundary with England was stated.<p>A referendum on the creation of an assembly for Wales in 1979 (see <!--del_lnk--> Wales referendum, 1979) led to a large majority for the &quot;no&quot; vote. However, in 1997 a referendum on the issue was secured, although by a very narrow majority. The <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly for Wales (<i>Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru</i>) was set up in 1999 (as a consequence of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Wales Act 1998) and possesses the power to determine how the central government budget for Wales is spent and administered.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>The head of state in Wales, a constituent part of the United Kingdom, is the <!--del_lnk--> British monarch, currently <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> (since 1952). Executive power is derived by the Queen, and exercised by the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Westminster, with some powers devolved to the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly for Wales in <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. The United Kingdom Parliament retains responsibility for passing <!--del_lnk--> primary legislation in Wales. The National Assembly has regulatory authority over laws passed that are applicable to Wales, and has limited power to vary these by <!--del_lnk--> secondary legislation The National Assembly is not a sovereign authority, and the UK Parliament could, in theory, overrule or even abolish it at any time. However, its powers are set to increase as the Government of Wales Act 2006 will allow it to speed up the passage of &#39;Assembly Measures&#39;.<p>The National Assembly was first established in 1998 under the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Wales Act. There are 60 members of the Assembly, known as &quot;Assembly Members (AM)&quot;. Forty of the AMs are elected under the <!--del_lnk--> First Past the Post system, with the other 20 elected via the <!--del_lnk--> Additional Member System via regional lists in 5 different regions. The largest party elects the <!--del_lnk--> First Minister of Wales, who acts as the head of government. The <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Assembly Government is the <!--del_lnk--> executive arm, and the Assembly has delegated most of its powers to the Assembly Government. The new Assembly Building designed by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Rogers was opened by <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Queen Elizabeth II">The Queen</a> on St. David&#39;s Day (March 1st) 2006.<p>The current First Minister of Wales is <!--del_lnk--> Rhodri Morgan (since 2000), of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Labour party who form a minority government. The largest opposition party is <!--del_lnk--> Plaid Cymru (&quot;Party of Wales&quot;), who favour Welsh independence in Europe. Other parties include the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party, the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Democrats (who formed part of a coalition government with Labour in the first Assembly), and <!--del_lnk--> Forward Wales. Current political debate in Wales is about whether the National Assembly should be given more powers, such as the power to pass primary legislation, as the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament can in Scotland.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>, Wales is represented by 40 <!--del_lnk--> MPs (out of a total of 646) in <!--del_lnk--> the Welsh constituencies. A <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State for Wales sits in the UK cabinet and is responsible for representing matters that pertain to Wales. The <!--del_lnk--> Wales Office is a department of the United Kingdom government, responsible for Wales. The current Secretary of State for Wales is <!--del_lnk--> Peter Hain.<p><a id="Law" name="Law"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law</span></h2>
      <p>Wales shares the same legal system as England, within the legal distinction of <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales. England &quot;legally&quot; annexed Wales under the <a href="../../wp/l/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%25E2%2580%25931542.htm" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542">Laws in Wales Act 1535</a>, in the reign of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a>. Prior to that <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Law had survived <i>de facto</i> after the conquest up to the fifteenth century in areas remote from direct English control. The <!--del_lnk--> Wales and Berwick Act 1746 provided that all laws that applied to England would automatically apply to Wales (and Berwick, a town located on the Anglo-Scottish border) unless the law explicitly stated otherwise. This act, with regard to Wales, was repealed in 1967.<p>As such, <!--del_lnk--> English law is the law of Wales. English law is regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> common law system, with no major <!--del_lnk--> codification of the law, and legal <!--del_lnk--> precedents are binding as opposed to persuasive. The <!--del_lnk--> court system is headed by the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> which is the highest court of appeal in the land for criminal and civil cases (although this is due to be replaced by a <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court of the United Kingdom). The Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales is the highest <!--del_lnk--> court of first instance as well as an <!--del_lnk--> appellate court. The three divisions are the <!--del_lnk--> Court of Appeal; the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Justice and the <!--del_lnk--> Crown Court. Minor cases are heard by the <!--del_lnk--> Magistrates&#39; Courts or the <!--del_lnk--> County Court.<p>However with the large degree of autonomy caused by the creation of the Welsh Assembly, there is a degree of independence in terms of law-making. Following the Government of Wales Act 2006, which transferred some primary legislation powers to the National Assembly for Wales (although the final authority on such legislation must be passed by the Westminster Parliament), the ancient and historic Wales and Chester court circuit was disbanded and a separate Welsh court circuit was created to allow for any &#39;Welsh laws&#39; passed by the National Assembly.<p>

It is about 274 km (170 miles) <!--del_lnk--> north-<!--del_lnk--> south and 97 km (60 miles) <!--del_lnk--> east-<!--del_lnk--> west. Wales borders by England to the east and by sea in the other three directions: the Welsh Channel to the south, St George&#39;s Channel to the west, and the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a> to the north. Together, Wales has over 1,200km (750 miles) of coastline. There are several <!--del_lnk--> islands off the Welsh mainland, the largest being <!--del_lnk--> Ynys M&ocirc;n (Anglesey) in the north west.<p>The main population and industrial areas are in <!--del_lnk--> South Wales, consisting of the cities of <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> (<i>Caerdydd</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Swansea (<i>Abertawe</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Newport (<i>Casnewydd</i>) and surrounding areas.<p>Much of Wales&#39;s beautiful and diverse landscape is <!--del_lnk--> mountainous, particularly in the north and central regions. The mountains were shaped during the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Devensian glaciation. The highest mountains in Wales are in <a href="../../wp/s/Snowdonia.htm" title="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a> (<i>Eryri</i>), and include <!--del_lnk--> Snowdon (<i>Yr Wyddfa</i>), which, at 1085 m (3,560 ft) is the highest peak in Wales. The 14 (or possibly 15) Welsh mountains over 3,000 feet (914&nbsp;m) high are known collectively as the <b>Welsh 3,000s</b>.

      <p>Along with its Celtic cousins in <!--del_lnk--> Devon and <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall in the <!--del_lnk--> West Country, the South Wales/West Wales coastline has more miles of <!--del_lnk--> Heritage Coast than anywhere else. The coastline of the <!--del_lnk--> Vale of Glamorgan, <!--del_lnk--> Gower Peninsula, <!--del_lnk--> Pembrokeshire and <!--del_lnk--> Ceredigion is particularly wild and impressive. Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay all have clean blue water, white-sand beaches and impressive marine life.<p>The modern border between Wales and England is highly arbitrary; it was largely defined in the 16th century, based on mediaeval feudal boundaries. It has apparently never been confirmed by referendum or reviewed by any Boundary Commission. The boundary line (which very roughly follows <!--del_lnk--> Offa&#39;s Dyke up to 40 miles (64&nbsp;km) of the northern coast) separates <!--del_lnk--> Knighton from its railway station, virtually cuts off <!--del_lnk--> Church Stoke from the rest of Wales, and slices straight through the village of <!--del_lnk--> Llanymynech (where a pub actually straddles the line).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Seven Wonders of Wales is a traditional list of seven geographic and cultural <!--del_lnk--> landmarks in Wales: Snowdon (the highest mountain), the Gresford bells (the peal of <!--del_lnk--> bells in the mediaeval church of All Saints at <!--del_lnk--> Gresford), the <!--del_lnk--> Llangollen bridge (built in 1347 over the <!--del_lnk--> River Dee, <i>Afon Dyfrdwy</i>), <!--del_lnk--> St Winefride&#39;s Well (a <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage site at <!--del_lnk--> Holywell, <i>Treffynnon</i>) in <!--del_lnk--> Flintshire) the Wrexham (<i>Wrecsam</i>) steeple (16th century tower of St. Giles Church in <!--del_lnk--> Wrexham), the Overton yew trees (ancient <!--del_lnk--> yew trees in the churchyard of St Mary&#39;s at <!--del_lnk--> Overton-on-Dee) and <!--del_lnk--> Pistyll Rhaeadr (Wales&#39;s tallest <!--del_lnk--> waterfall, at 240 ft or 75 m).

The new St David&#39;s 2 project in the city centre, the Sports Village construction in <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Bay along with the creation of a new stadium for <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff City FC will boost employment by nearly 10,000 according to early projections and will prove a massive boost to the regional economy.<p>The St David&#39;s 2 project will include the expansion of the city centre to include a new 6 story city centre library, a new multi-storey car park for the Marriot hotel, 9 new large stores which will include Wales&#39; first John Lewis and many other small stores.<p>The Cardiff Bay &#39;Sports Village&#39; will be the base for a new casino, Snow Dome, retail park and the ice rink for the <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Devils ice-hockey team.<p>Many other cities are also conducting major projects of regeneration, such as the <!--del_lnk--> SA1 Waterfront project in <!--del_lnk--> Swansea and in <!--del_lnk--> Newport a major regeneration project will vastly improve transport throughout the city, the building of a new retail centre and 6000 homes.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The population of Wales in the 2001 census was 2,903,085, which has risen to 2,958,876 according to 2005 estimates. This would make Wales the 132nd largest <!--del_lnk--> country by population if it were a sovereign state.<p>According to the 2001 census, 96% of the population was <!--del_lnk--> White <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of <!--del_lnk--> Asian origin).<!--del_lnk-->  Most non-white groups were concentrated in <a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Newport and <!--del_lnk--> Swansea.<p>In the 2001 Labour Force Survey, 72% of adults in Wales considered their national identity as wholly Welsh and another 7% considered themselves to be partly Welsh (Welsh and British were the most common combination). <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 2001 a quarter of the Welsh population were born outside Wales, mainly in England; about 3% were born outside the UK. The proportion of people who were born in Wales differs across the country, with the highest percentages in the <!--del_lnk--> South Wales Valleys, and the lowest in Mid Wales and parts of the north-east. In both <!--del_lnk--> Blaenau Gwent and <!--del_lnk--> Merthyr Tydfil 92% were Welsh-born, compared to only 51% in <!--del_lnk--> Flintshire and 56% in <!--del_lnk--> Powys.<!--del_lnk-->  One of the reasons for this is that the locations of the most convenient hospitals are over the border in England. In the case of <!--del_lnk--> Flintshire, <!--del_lnk--> The Countess of Chester Hospital is only 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) from <!--del_lnk--> Mold, the prime town of the county. The Welsh option would be <!--del_lnk--> Bodelwyddan Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Denbighshire which would be a 25 mile (40&nbsp;km) trip.<p><b>Main cities/towns and their populations (2005 estimates)</b><p><a href="../../wp/c/Cardiff.htm" title="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> - 320,524<p><!--del_lnk--> Swansea - 270,463<p><!--del_lnk--> Newport - 145,769<p><!--del_lnk--> Merthyr Tydfil - 54,700<p><!--del_lnk--> Barry - 50,661<p><!--del_lnk--> Port Talbot - 49,654<p><!--del_lnk--> Cwmbran - 47,254<p><!--del_lnk--> Wrexham - 44,723<p>

      <p>The official languages in Wales are <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Welsh. English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the <i>de facto</i> main language (see <!--del_lnk--> Welsh English). However, Wales is officially <!--del_lnk--> bilingual, with 20.5% of the population able to speak Welsh and a larger proportion having some knowledge of the Welsh language according to the 2001 census, although few (if any) residents of Wales other than small children are monolingual in Welsh these days. The <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Language Act 1993 and the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the Welsh and English languages should be treated on a basis of equality. Public bodies are required to prepare and implement a Welsh Language Scheme. Thus the Welsh Assembly, local councils, police forces, fire services and the health sector use Welsh as an official language, issuing official literature and publicity in Welsh versions (e.g. letters to parents from schools, library information, and council information). All road signs in Wales should be in English and Welsh, including both versions of place names where names or versions exist in both languages e.g. Caerdydd and &quot;Cardiff&quot;.<p>During the 20th Century a number of small communities of speakers of languages other than English or Welsh, such as <!--del_lnk--> Bengali or <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese, have established themselves in Wales as a result of immigration. This phenomenon is almost exclusive to urban Wales. The Italian Government funds the teaching of <!--del_lnk--> Italian to Welsh residents of Italian ancestry. These other languages however have no official status, although public services may produce information leaflets in minority ethnic languages where there is a specific need, as happens elsewhere in the United Kingdom.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>
      <p>The largest religion in Wales is <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, with 72% of the population describing themselves as Christian in the 2001 census. The <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian Church of Wales is the largest denomination and was born out of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Methodist revival in the eighteenth century and seceded from the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in 1811. The <!--del_lnk--> Church in Wales is the next largest denomination, and forms part of the <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Communion.htm" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. It too was part of the Church of England, and was disestablished by the British Government under the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Church Act 1914 (the act did not take effect until 1920). The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> makes up the next largest denomination at 3% of the population. Non-Christian religions are small in Wales, making up approximately 1.5% of the population. 18% of people declare no religion.<p>The patron saint of Wales is <!--del_lnk--> Saint David, with <!--del_lnk--> St David&#39;s Day celebrated annually on <!--del_lnk--> March 1.<p>Islam is the largest non-Christian religion in Wales, with over 30,000 reported in the 2001 census, there are also many Hindus and Sikhs mainly in South Wales&#39; cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>About 80% of the land surface of Wales is given over to agricultural use. Very little of this is <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">arable land</a>, though&ndash;the vast majority consists of permanent grass or rough grazing for herd animals. Although both <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">beef</a> and <!--del_lnk--> dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well-known for its <!--del_lnk--> sheep farming, and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.<p>Some traditional dishes include <!--del_lnk--> laverbread (made from <!--del_lnk--> seaweed), <!--del_lnk--> bara brith (fruit bread), <!--del_lnk--> cawl cennin (leek stew), <!--del_lnk--> Welsh cakes, <!--del_lnk--> Welsh rarebit (cheese on toast), and Welsh <!--del_lnk--> lamb. <!--del_lnk--> Cockles are sometimes served with breakfast. <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 2005 the Welsh National Culinary Teams returned from the Culinary World Cup in Luxembourg with eight gold, 15 silver and seven bronze medals; plus an overall top 7 place in the world.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>

      <p>The principal Welsh festival of music and poetry is the <i><!--del_lnk--> National Eisteddfod</i>. This takes place annually in a different town or city. The <i>Llangollen <!--del_lnk--> International Eisteddfod</i> echos the National Eisteddfod but provides an opportunity for the singers and musicians of the world to perform.<p>Wales is often referred to as &quot;the land of song&quot;, being particularly famous for <!--del_lnk--> harpists, <!--del_lnk--> male voice choirs, and solo artists including Sir <!--del_lnk--> Geraint Evans, Dame Gwynneth Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Dame Anne Evans, <!--del_lnk--> Ivor Novello, Madam <!--del_lnk--> Adelina Patti, <!--del_lnk--> John Cale, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Jones, <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte Church, <!--del_lnk--> Bonnie Tyler, <!--del_lnk--> Bryn Terfel, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Hopkin, <!--del_lnk--> Katherine Jenkins, <!--del_lnk--> Shirley Bassey and <!--del_lnk--> Aled Jones.<p>The popular <!--del_lnk--> New Wave/<!--del_lnk--> synthpop group <!--del_lnk--> Scritti Politti was a vehicle for singer/songwriter and <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff native <!--del_lnk--> Green Gartside.<p><!--del_lnk--> Indie bands like <!--del_lnk--> Catatonia, <!--del_lnk--> Stereophonics, The <!--del_lnk--> Manic Street Preachers, <!--del_lnk--> Feeder, <!--del_lnk--> Super Furry Animals, and <!--del_lnk--> Gorkys Zygotic Mynci, in the 1990s, and later <!--del_lnk--> Goldie Lookin&#39; Chain, <!--del_lnk--> McLusky, <!--del_lnk--> Lostprophets, <!--del_lnk--> Funeral for a Friend, <!--del_lnk--> The Automatic and <!--del_lnk--> Bullet for my Valentine were preceded by <!--del_lnk--> Man in the 1970s. Many of these popular singers and musicians have yet to pass the test of longevity.<p>There are also numerous smaller bands that are yet to enter the mainstream.<p>The Welsh traditional and <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a> scene, long overshadowed by its <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> cousins, is in resurgence with performers and bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Crasdant, <!--del_lnk--> Carreg Lafar, Fernhill, <!--del_lnk--> Si&acirc;n James, <!--del_lnk--> Robin Huw Bowen, <!--del_lnk--> Llio Rhydderch, <!--del_lnk--> KilBride and <!--del_lnk--> The Hennessys.<p>The &#39;S&icirc;n Roc Gymraeg&#39; (Welsh language Rock Scene) in Wales is thriving, with acts ranging from rock to hip-hop which routinely attracts immense crowds and audiences. The Welsh-language Rock Scene presently is stated as &#39;the best yet,&#39; with more bands, and more audiences than the &#39;Sin Roc Gymraeg&#39; has ever seen in its existence. Dolgellau, in the heart of Snowdonia has held the annual Sesiwn Fawr (mighty session) festival since 1992. From humble beginnings the festival has grown to be Wales&#39; largest Welsh-Language Music Festivals.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> BBC National Orchestra of Wales performs in Wales and internationally.

Welsh teams also play in the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic League (rugby union) alongside teams from Ireland and Scotland, the <!--del_lnk--> EDF Energy Cup and the European <!--del_lnk--> Heineken Cup.<p>Wales has its own <!--del_lnk--> football league since 1992, but for historical reasons, the 3 major Welsh clubs play in the <!--del_lnk--> English Football League and another three minor clubs in its feeder leagues. The <!--del_lnk--> Welsh national team like Scotland plays independently for international competition.<p><!--del_lnk--> Rugby league is now developing in Wales. Since 2003, there has been a national league and in 2006, semi-professional league comes back to the principality with the advent of the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Crusaders.<p>The Isle of <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey/Ynys M&ocirc;n is a member island of the <!--del_lnk--> International Island Games Association. The next Island Games will be held in 2007 on Rhodes (Greece). In the 2005 Games, held on the Shetland Islands, the Isle of Anglesey/Ynys M&ocirc;n came 11th on the medal table with 4 gold, 2 silver and 2 bronze medals.<p>Wales has produced some great world class <!--del_lnk--> snooker players such as <!--del_lnk--> Terry Griffiths <!--del_lnk--> Mark Williams and <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Stevens and amateur participation in the sport is very high. The rugged terrain of the country also gives plenty of opportunities for rally driving and Wales currently hosts the finale of the <!--del_lnk--> World Rally Championship. <!--del_lnk--> Glamorgan compete in county cricket competitions and the <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Devils were once a strong force in British <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>. There is also some success in boxing. <!--del_lnk--> Joe Calzaghe the half-Welsh, half-Italian boxer is current World Super-Middleweight Champion and Swansea born <!--del_lnk--> Enzo Maccarinelli the current <!--del_lnk--> WBO, <!--del_lnk--> WBC and <!--del_lnk--> WBU World Cruiserweight Champion. Wales has also produced a number of athletes who have made a mark on the world stage, including the 110m hurdler Colin Jackson who is a former world record holder and the winner of numerous Olympic, World and European medals.<p>Wales are the current World Golf Champions.<p>Although it isn&#39;t very well known, Wales have had two drivers compete in the <a href="../../wp/f/Formula_One.htm" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> championship, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Rees being the first at the <!--del_lnk--> 1967 British Grand Prix, finishing in ninth position, four laps behind the winner, <!--del_lnk--> Jim Clark. <!--del_lnk--> Tom Pryce was the most notable of the two drivers, as he finished on the podium twice and for the <!--del_lnk--> 1975 British Grand Prix, qualified in <!--del_lnk--> pole position. Pryce&#39;s career was cut short after he collided with volunteer marshal, <!--del_lnk--> Jansen Van Vuuren, killing both instantly. As well as Formula One, Wales have had some notability in the <!--del_lnk--> World Rally Championship, producing two championship winning Co-Drivers, those being Nicky Grist, who helped <!--del_lnk--> Colin McRae to victory in 1996 and <!--del_lnk--> Phil Mills who helped <!--del_lnk--> Petter Solberg win the 2003 title.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">National symbols</span></h2>

       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Flag of Wales (Y Ddraig Goch) incorporates the <!--del_lnk--> red <!--del_lnk--> dragon of Prince Cadwalader along with the <!--del_lnk--> Tudor colours of green and white. It was used by Henry VII at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Bosworth in 1485 after which it was carried in state to St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral. The red dragon was then included in the Tudor royal arms to signify their Welsh descent. It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. Since the British <a href="../../wp/u/Union_Flag.htm" title="Union Flag">Union Flag</a> does not have any Welsh representation, the Flag of Wales has become very popular.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Dragon, part of the national flag design, is also a popular Welsh symbol. The oldest recorded use of the dragon to symbolise Wales is from the <!--del_lnk--> Historia Brittonum, written around 820, but it is popularly supposed to have been the battle standard of <a href="../../wp/k/King_Arthur.htm" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> and other ancient Celtic leaders. This myth is likely to have originated from <!--del_lnk--> Merlin&#39;s vision of a Red (Wales) and White (England) dragon battling, with the Red dragon being victorious. Following the annexation of Wales by England, the dragon was used as a supporter in the English monarch&#39;s coat of arms.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> leek is also a national emblem of Wales. According to legend, <!--del_lnk--> Saint David ordered his Welsh soldiers to identify themselves by wearing the vegetable on their helmets in an ancient battle against the Saxons that took place in a leek field.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> daffodil is the <!--del_lnk--> national flower of Wales, and is worn on <!--del_lnk--> St David&#39;s Day each <!--del_lnk--> March 1.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Flag of Saint David is sometimes used as an alternative to the national flag, and is flown on <!--del_lnk--> St David&#39;s Day.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales is used by <!--del_lnk--> Charles, Prince of Wales in his personal standard.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales&#39;s feathers, the heraldic badge of the <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales is sometimes adapted by Welsh bodies for use in Wales. The symbolism is explained on the article for <!--del_lnk--> Edward, the Black Prince, who was the first Prince of Wales to bear the emblem; see also <!--del_lnk--> John, king of Bohemia. The <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Rugby Union uses such a design for its own badge.</ul>
