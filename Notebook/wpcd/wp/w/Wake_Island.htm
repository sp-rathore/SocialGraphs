      <p><b>Wake Island</b> (also known as <b>Wake Atoll</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> coral atoll having a <!--del_lnk--> coastline of 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;kilometers) in the North <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, located about two-thirds of the way from <!--del_lnk--> Honolulu (2,300&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> statute miles or 3,700&nbsp;km west) to <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a> (1,510&nbsp;miles or 2,430&nbsp;km east). It is an <!--del_lnk--> unorganized, <!--del_lnk--> unincorporated territory of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, part of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Minor Outlying Islands, administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Office of Insular Affairs, <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of the Interior. Wake is located to the west of the <!--del_lnk--> International Date Line and is one day ahead of the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">50 states</a>. Access to the island is restricted, and all current activities on the island are managed by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Air Force, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army, and Chugach McKinley, Inc., a civilian base operations and maintenance services company.<p>Although Wake is officially called an <!--del_lnk--> island in the singular form, it is actually an atoll comprising three islands (Wake, Wilkes, and Peale) surrounding a central <!--del_lnk--> lagoon. Referring to the atoll as an island is the result of a pre-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> desire by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy to distinguish Wake from other atolls, most of which were <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> territory. The largest island (Wake Island) is the centre of activity on the atoll and features a 9,800&nbsp;foot (3,000&nbsp;m) runway.<p>

      <p>Some scant <!--del_lnk--> indigenous Marshallese <!--del_lnk--> oral tradition suggests that prior to European <!--del_lnk--> exploration, nearby <a href="../../wp/m/Marshall_Islands.htm" title="Marshall Islands">Marshall Islanders</a> traveled to what is now Wake Island, which the travelers called <i>Enen-kio</i> after a small orange <!--del_lnk--> shrub-<a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flower</a> said to have been found on the atoll. In ancient Marshallese <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rituals surrounding the <!--del_lnk--> tatooing of <!--del_lnk--> tribal chiefs, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Iroijlaplap,</i> were done using certain fresh human bones, which required a <!--del_lnk--> human sacrifice. A man could save himself from being sacrificed if he obtained a wing bone from a certain very large <!--del_lnk--> seabird said to have existed on <i>Enen-kio</i>. Small groups would therefore brave traveling to the atoll in hope of obtaining and returning with this bone, thus saving the life of the potential human sacrifice.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Based upon this oral tradition<!--del_lnk-->  along with concepts of first-usage lands rights claims commonly held in <!--del_lnk--> Micronesian <!--del_lnk--> cultures as <!--del_lnk--> legitimate for settling <!--del_lnk--> indigenous land disputes<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> , a small <!--del_lnk--> separatist group of Marshall Island descendents who call themselves the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of EnenKio lay claim to Wake Island. The Marshall Islands and U.S. governments, who also have competing claims over the island, vigorously deny the claim.<!--del_lnk-->  No evidence suggests there was ever a permanent <!--del_lnk--> settlement of Marshall Islanders on Wake Island.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="European_discovery_and_exploration" name="European_discovery_and_exploration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">European discovery and exploration</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1568, <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;lvaro de Menda&ntilde;a de Neyra, a Spanish explorer with two ships, <i>Los Reyes</i> and <i>Todos Santos</i>, discovered &quot;a low barren island, judged to be eight <!--del_lnk--> leagues in circumference,&quot; to which he gave the name of &quot;San Francisco.&quot; The island was eventually named for Captain <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Wake, master of the <!--del_lnk--> British trading <!--del_lnk--> schooner, <i>Prince William Henry</i>, who visited in 1796.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1840, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Exploring Expedition commanded by <!--del_lnk--> Commodore <!--del_lnk--> Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy, landed on and surveyed Wake. Wilkes described the atoll as &quot;a low coral one, of triangular form and eight feet above the surface. It has a large lagoon in the centre, which was well filled with <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> of a variety of <!--del_lnk--> species among these were some fine <!--del_lnk--> mullet.&quot; He also noted that Wake had no fresh water and that it was covered with <!--del_lnk--> shrubs, &quot;the most abundant of which was the <i>tournefortia</i>.&quot; The expedition&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> naturalist, <!--del_lnk--> Titian Peale, collected many new <!--del_lnk--> specimens, including an <!--del_lnk--> egg from a <!--del_lnk--> short-tailed albatross and various <!--del_lnk--> marine life specimens.<p><a id="Wreck_of_the_Libelle" name="Wreck_of_the_Libelle"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Wreck of the <i>Libelle</i></span></h3>
      <p>Wake Island first received international attention with the <!--del_lnk--> wreck of the <i>Libelle</i>. On the night of <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1866, the <!--del_lnk--> barque <i>Libelle</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Bremen, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, struck the eastern <!--del_lnk--> reef of Wake Island during a <!--del_lnk--> gale. The ship was under the command of Captain Tobias and en route from <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco to <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>. Among its passengers were <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> singer Anna Bishop, her husband Martin Schultz (a <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a> diamond merchant), and three other members of an English <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a> troupe.<p>After 21 days, the 30 stranded passengers and crew set sail in a <!--del_lnk--> longboat and a <!--del_lnk--> gig for the Spanish island of <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a>. The longboat, containing the opera troupe, Mr. Schultz and other passengers, arrived on Guam <!--del_lnk--> April 8. The gig, commanded by the <i>Libelle&rsquo;s</i> captain, was lost at sea. While stranded on Wake Island, Captain Tobias had buried valuable cargo including 1,000 flasks (34,500&nbsp;kg) of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, coins and precious stones worth approximately <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>150,000, and at least five ships conducted <!--del_lnk--> salvage operations in their recovery. The plight of the <i>Libelle</i>, its passengers and cargo was reported by many newspapers.<p><a id="American_possession" name="American_possession"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">American possession</span></h3>
      <p>Wake Island was annexed by the United States on <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1899. In 1935, <!--del_lnk--> Pan American Airways constructed a small village, nicknamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> PAAville&quot;, to service flights on its U.S.-<a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> route. The village was the first human settlement on the island and relied upon the U.S. mainland for its food and water supplies; it remained in operation up to the day of the first Japanese air raid.<p><a id="Military_buildup" name="Military_buildup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Military buildup</span></h3>
      <p>In January 1941, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy constructed a military base on the atoll. On <!--del_lnk--> August 19, the first permanent military garrison, elements of the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Marine Defense Battalion, totaling 449 officers and men, were stationed on the island, commanded by <!--del_lnk--> Commander <!--del_lnk--> Winfield Scott Cunningham. Others on the island were 68 U.S. Naval personnel and about 1,221 civilian workers.<p>They were armed with six used 5 inch (127&nbsp;mm) <!--del_lnk--> cannons, removed from a <!--del_lnk--> scrapped <!--del_lnk--> cruiser; twelve 3 inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) M3 <!--del_lnk--> anti-aircraft guns (with only a single working anti-aircraft <!--del_lnk--> sight among them); eighteen <!--del_lnk--> Browning M2 heavy machine guns; and thirty heavy, medium, and light, water or air-cooled <!--del_lnk--> machine guns in various conditions but all operational.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, the same day as the <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbour</a> (Wake being on the opposite side of the International Date Line), sixteen <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> medium bombers flown from bases on the Marshall Islands attacked Wake Island, destroying eight of the twelve <!--del_lnk--> F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft belonging to Marine Corps fighter squadron <!--del_lnk--> VMF-211 on the ground. All of the Marine garrison&#39;s defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid, which primarily targeted the naval aircraft.<p>The garrison&mdash;supplemented by civilian volunteers&mdash;repelled several Japanese landing attempts. After the initial Japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses, the American commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything; the commander was reported (erroneously) as having quipped &quot;Send us more Japs!&quot;<p>Despite this defiant spirit, the garrison was eventually overwhelmed by the determined and numerically superior Japanese invasion force. American casualties were fifty-two military personnel killed, along with approximately seventy civilians. Japanese losses exceeded 700 killed, with some estimates ranging as high as 900; in addition, the Japanese lost four destroyers and twenty aircraft.<p>In the aftermath of the battle, some of the captured civilian laborers were pressed into service by the Japanese and tasked with improving the island&#39;s defenses. After a successful American air raid on <!--del_lnk--> October 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1943, the Japanese garrison commander Rear Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Shigematsu Sakaibara ordered the execution of the ninety-eight prisoners on the pretext that they were <!--del_lnk--> spies. One prisoner escaped the mass execution, but was later personally beheaded by Sakaibara. After the war, Sakaibaira was tried for war crimes, found guilty, and executed; his subordinate was sentenced to life in prison.<p>Captain <!--del_lnk--> Henry T. Elrod, one of the pilots from VMF-211, was awarded the United States <a href="../../wp/m/Medal_of_Honor.htm" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honour</a> posthumously for shooting down two Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Zero fighters, and many of his comrades were also highly decorated for their roles in the fighting. The <!--del_lnk--> Wake Island Device was created for American veterans of the battle.<p><a id="Japanese_occupation_and_surrender" name="Japanese_occupation_and_surrender"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Japanese occupation and surrender</span></h4>

Truman</a>, meeting to discuss strategy for the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War hostilities that had broken out four months earlier.<p>Since 1974, the island&#39;s airstrip has been used by the U.S. military and some commercial cargo planes, as well as for emergency landings. There are over 700 landings a year on the island. There are also two offshore anchorages for large ships. On <!--del_lnk--> September 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1985, the World War II-related resources on Peale, Wilkes, and Wake Islands were designated a <!--del_lnk--> National Historic Landmark (and thereby also listed on the <!--del_lnk--> National Register of Historic Places).<p>The United States military personnel have left, and there are no indigenous inhabitants. Wake, with an undelineated maritime boundary with them, is claimed by the Marshall Islands, and some civilian personnel (&quot;contractor inhabitants&quot;) remain. <!--del_lnk--> As of August 2006, an estimated 200 contractor personnel were present. The island remains a strategic location in the North Pacific Ocean and serves as an emergency landing location for transpacific flights. Some World War II facilities and wreckage remain on the islands.<p>Subsequently the island was used for strategic defense and operations during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.
