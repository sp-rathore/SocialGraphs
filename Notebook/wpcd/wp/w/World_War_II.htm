The United Kingdom and France responded by <!--del_lnk--> declaring war on Germany on <!--del_lnk--> September 3, initiating a widespread naval war. Germany rapidly overwhelmed Poland, then Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in 1940, and Yugoslavia and Greece in 1941. Italian, and later German, troops attacked <!--del_lnk--> British forces in <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>.

Despite enormous gains, the invasion bogged down outside of Moscow in late 1941. The Soviets later encircled and captured the German Sixth Army at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Stalingrad.htm" title="Battle of Stalingrad">Battle of Stalingrad</a> (1942-43), decisively defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Axis during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kursk, and broke the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Leningrad.

      <p>Japan invaded China on <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1937 (see <!--del_lnk--> Second Sino-Japanese war) with plans to expand to most of East and South-East Asia. On <!--del_lnk--> December 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 Japan launched surprise attacks against several countries, including the major <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy base at <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbour</a>, thereby drawing the United States into the war.<p>After six months of sweeping successes, the Japanese were checked at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Coral Sea and decisively defeated in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, in which they lost four aircraft carriers. Japanese expansion was finally stopped and the Allies went on the offensive at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Milne Bay and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guadalcanal, both in the Southwest Pacific. <!--del_lnk--> The Allies then conducted a drive across the <!--del_lnk--> Central Pacific, and were victorious in a series of great <!--del_lnk--> naval battles such as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Philippine Sea and the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> in 1944, and invasions of key islands such as <!--del_lnk--> Iwo Jima and <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa in 1945. In the meantime, American submarines gradually cut off the supply of oil and other raw materials to Japan.<p>In the last year of the war Allied air forces conducted a strategic firebombing campaign against the Japanese homeland. On <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, and on <!--del_lnk--> August 9 another was dropped on <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki.

      <p>About 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population, died in the war, though <!--del_lnk--> estimates vary greatly (refer to the Casualties section).

      <p>The immediate <b>Causes of World War II</b> are generally held to be the German <!--del_lnk--> invasion of Poland, and the Japanese attacks on <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Dutch colonies. In each of these cases, the attacks were the result of a decision made by authoritarian ruling elites in Germany and Japan. World War II started after these aggressive actions were met with an official <!--del_lnk--> declaration of war, armed resistance or both.<p>The Nazi Party came to power in Germany by democratic means, although after acquiring power they eliminated most vestiges of Germany&#39;s democratic system. The reasons for their popularity included their renouncement of the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> (particularly Article 231, known as the &quot;Guilt Clause&quot;), which had placed many restrictions on Germany since the end of the World War I, staunch <!--del_lnk--> anti-communism, the <!--del_lnk--> Dolchstosslegende and promises of stability and economic reconstruction. They also appealed to a sense of Germanic identity, superiority and entitlement, which would play an important role in starting the war, as they demanded the integration of lands they considered to be rightfully belonging to Germany. Hitler was also portrayed by himself, his party, and his book <i>Mein Kampf</i> as an almost otherworldly savior for the German people.<p>Imperial <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in the 1930s was largely ruled by a militarist clique of Army and Navy leaders, devoted to Japan becoming a world colonial power. Japan invaded <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria in 1931 and <!--del_lnk--> China in 1937 to bolster its meager stock of natural resources and extend its colonial control over a wider area. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> reacted by making loans to <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">China</a>, providing <!--del_lnk--> covert military assistance, pilots and fighter aircraft to <!--del_lnk--> Kuomintang China and instituting increasingly broad embargoes of raw materials and oil against Japan. These embargoes would potentially have eventually forced Japan to give up its newly conquered possessions in China or find new sources of oil and other materials to run their economy. Japan was faced with the choice of withdrawing from China, negotiating some compromise, developing new sources of supply, buying what they needed some where else, or going to war to conquer the territories that contained oil, bauxite and other resources in the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East Indies, Malay and the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Believing the French, Dutch and British governments more than occupied with the war in Europe, the Soviets reeling from German attacks and that the United States could not be organized for war for years and would seek a compromise before waging full scale war, they chose the latter, and went ahead with plans for the <!--del_lnk--> Greater East Asia War in the Pacific.<!--del_lnk--> <p>The direct cause of the United States&#39; entry into the war with Japan was the attack on <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941. Germany declared war on the United States on December 12, 1941.<p><a id="Chronology" name="Chronology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Chronology</span></h2>

      <p><b>German policy aims and ideologies</b><br /> The chief stated aim of the German policy at the time was the reacquisition of German territories taken by the Treaty of Versailles, and the addition of <!--del_lnk--> ethnic German regions of former <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary to form a <!--del_lnk--> Greater Germany.<p>Hitler&#39;s real agenda was clearly the takeover of neighboring countries. In fact, when he annexed Czechoslovakia in the previous year, without any conflict due to England&#39;s intervention, he complained that he had been deprived of the triumphal war which he sought. <!--del_lnk--> The invasion of Poland was one step in an overall campaign of re-militarization, and preparation of the <!--del_lnk--> German people for renewed warfare.  This was indicated by official philosophy as laid out in numerous speeches and Nazi Party statements.<p>However, German foreign policy professed concern for the rights of ethnic Germans living in portions of Poland and Czechoslovakia which had been taken from Germany and Austria respectively. During his negotiations with Chamberlain, Hitler mentioned their plight as one of his key reasons for asserting claims to portions of these countries.<p>During one session with <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">UK Prime Minister</a> <!--del_lnk--> Neville Chamberlain, Hitler&#39;s aides brought him multiple reports alleging atrocities against ethnic Germans in nearby countries, which Hitler invoked in support of Germany&#39;s claims to its former territory.<p>When Hitler annexed parts of Czechoslovakia and Poland, he was welcomed enthusiastically by these ethnic Germans. When the war ended, many of these communities were forcibly compelled to return to Germany proper.<p>Another of the main reasons that German society moved towards war was due to the perceived inequities of the <!--del_lnk--> Versailles Treaty. (More than anything else, this treaty, coupled with the worldwide <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression of the 1930s, enabled the Nazis to originally ride a wave of mass public discontent to power, and to set in place their fascist forms of dictatorship and re-militarization.) The Nazis claimed that only they could free Germany from international subjugation. Hitler remilitarized the <!--del_lnk--> Rhineland and the Ruhr, and overturned several territorial dispositions which were enacted by the treaty.<p>In the hands of the Nazis, this issue was used to rationalize brutal persecution of entire ethnic minorities and <!--del_lnk--> political groups. This effort against previous international settlements enabled a convergence of their political programs, war aims, and racist ideologies.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><b>Appeasement and pre-war alliances</b><br /> The British and French governments followed a policy of <!--del_lnk--> appeasement in order to avoid a new European war. This was partially due to doubts about the willingness of their populations to fight another war so soon after the huge death tolls of the first World War. This policy culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Agreement in 1938, in which the seemingly inevitable outbreak of the war was averted when the United Kingdom and France agreed to Germany&#39;s annexation and immediate occupation of the <!--del_lnk--> German-speaking regions of <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain declared that the agreement represented &quot;peace in our time&quot;. In March 1939, Germany invaded the rest of <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia, effectively killing appeasement. Less than a year after the Munich agreement, the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany.<p>The failure of the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Agreement showed that deals made with Hitler at the negotiating table could not be trusted and that his aspirations for power and dominance in Europe went beyond anything that England and France would tolerate. Poland and France pledged on <!--del_lnk--> May 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, to provide each other with military assistance in the event either was attacked. The British had already offered support to Poland in March. On <!--del_lnk--> August 23, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed the <!--del_lnk--> Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The Pact included a secret protocol that would divide <!--del_lnk--> Central Europe into German and Soviet areas of interest, including a provision to partition Poland. Each country agreed to allow the other a free hand in its area of influence, including <!--del_lnk--> military occupation. The deal provided for sales of oil and food from the Soviets to Germany, thus reducing the danger of a UK blockade such as the one that had nearly starved Germany in World War I. Hitler was then ready to go to war with Poland and, if necessary, with the United Kingdom and France. He claimed there were German grievances relating to the issues of the <!--del_lnk--> Free City of Danzig and the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Corridor, but he planned to conquer all Polish territory and incorporate it into the <!--del_lnk--> German Reich. The signing of a new alliance between the United Kingdom and Poland on <!--del_lnk--> August 25 did not significantly alter his plans.<p><b>German and Soviet invasion of Poland</b><br />

The most damaging effect of the U-boats was in sinking transatlantic merchant shipping.<p>After 1943, Germany had no serious chance of victory at sea.

The <!--del_lnk--> German General Staff had underestimated the size of the Soviet army and its ability to draft new troops.

      <p>In the summer of 1941, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands began an oil embargo against Japan, threatening its ability to fight a major war at sea or in the air. However, Japanese forces continued to advance into China. Japan planned an attack on <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Harbour to cripple the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Pacific Fleet, then seize <!--del_lnk--> oil fields in the Dutch <!--del_lnk--> East Indies. On <!--del_lnk--> December 7, a <!--del_lnk--> Japanese carrier fleet launched an unexpected air attack on Pearl Harbour, <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii. The raid destroyed most of the American aircraft on the island and knocked the main American <!--del_lnk--> battle fleet out of action (six battleships sank, but four of them along with two other badly damaged battleships eventually returned to service). However, the four American aircraft carriers that had been the intended main target of the Japanese attack were off at sea. At Pearl Harbour, the main dock, supply, and repair facilities were quickly repaired. Furthermore, the base&#39;s fuel storage facilities, whose destruction could have crippled the Pacific fleet, were untouched.<p>The attack united American public opinion to demand vengeance against Japan. The following day, <!--del_lnk--> December 8, the <!--del_lnk--> United States declared war on Japan. On the same day, Japan invaded <!--del_lnk--> Malaya, and China officially declared war against Japan. Disaster struck the British on the 10th, as they lost two major battleships, <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Prince of Wales</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Repulse</i>. Both ships had been attacked by 85 Japanese bombers and torpedo planes based in <a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh_City.htm" title="Saigon">Saigon</a>, and 840 UK sailors perished. <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Churchill</a> was to say of the event, &quot;In all of the war I have never received a more direct shock.&quot;<p>Germany declared war on the United States on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, even though it was not obliged to do so under the <!--del_lnk--> Tripartite Pact. Hitler hoped that Japan would support Germany by attacking the Soviet Union. Japan did not oblige because it had signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 23, the Germans reached the <!--del_lnk--> Volga north of Stalingrad. German bombing virtually destroyed the wooden buildings of the city which flanked the central strip, containing large modern factories. By <!--del_lnk--> September 23 the main factory complex was surrounded and the German artillery was within range of the quays on the river, across which the Soviets evacuated wounded and brought in reinforcements. Ferocious <!--del_lnk--> street fighting, hand-to-hand conflict of the most savage kind, now ensued at Stalingrad. Exhaustion and deprivation gradually sapped men&#39;s strength. Hitler, who had become obsessed with the battle of Stalingrad, refused to countenance a withdrawal. Von Paulus, in desperation, launched yet another attack early in November by which time the Germans had managed to capture 90% of the city. The Soviets, however, had been building up massive forces on the flanks of Stalingrad which were by this time severely undermanned as the bulk of the German forces had been concentrated in capturing the city. They launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation Uranus on <!--del_lnk--> November 19, with twin attacks that met at the city of Kalach four days later and trapped the Sixth Army in Stalingrad.<p>The Germans requested permission to attempt a break-out, which was refused by Hitler, who ordered <!--del_lnk--> Sixth Army to remain in Stalingrad where he promised they would be supplied by air until rescued. About the same time, the Soviets launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation Mars in a salient near the vicinity of Moscow. Its objective was to tie down <!--del_lnk--> Army Group Centre and to prevent it from reinforcing <!--del_lnk--> Army Group South at Stalingrad.<p>In December, <!--del_lnk--> Von Manstein hastily put together a German relief force of units composed from Army Group South to relieve the trapped Sixth Army. Unable to get reinforcements from Army Group Centre, the relief force only managed to get within 50 kilometers (30 mi) before they were turned back by the Soviets. By the end of the year, Sixth Army was in desperate condition, as the <i>Luftwaffe</i> was able to supply only about a sixth of the supplies needed.<p>Shortly before surrendering to the Red Army on <!--del_lnk--> February 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1943, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich von Paulus was promoted to Fieldmarshall. This was a message from Hitler, because no German Fieldmarshall had ever surrendered his troops or been taken alive. Only 91,000 German prisoners were taken, including 22 generals of which only 5,000 men ever returned to Germany after the war. <i>This was to be the greatest, and most costly battle in terms of human life, in world history</i>. Around 2 million men were killed or wounded on both sides, including civilians, with <!--del_lnk--> Axis casualties estimated to be approximately 850,000.<dl>

      <p>The rains of spring inhibited campaigning in the Soviet Union, but both sides used the interval to build up for the inevitable battle that would come in the summer. The start date for the offensive had been moved repeatedly as delays in preparation had forced the Germans to postpone the attack. By <!--del_lnk--> July 4, the Wehrmacht after assembling their greatest concentration of firepower during the whole of World War II, launched their offensive against the Soviet Union at the <!--del_lnk--> Kursk salient. Their intentions were known by the Soviets, who hastened to defend the salient with an enormous system of earthwork defenses. The Germans attacked from both the north and south of the salient and hoped to meet in the middle, cutting off the salient and trapping 60 Soviet divisions. The German offensive in the Northern sector was ground down as little progress was made through the Soviet defenses but in the Southern Sector there was a danger of a German breakthrough. The Soviets then brought up their reserves, and the ensuing <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kursk became the <i>largest tank battle of the war</i>, near the city of <!--del_lnk--> Prokhorovka. The Germans lacking any sizable reserves had exhausted their armored forces and could not stop the Soviet counteroffensive that threw them back across their starting positions.<p><b>Soviet fall and winter offensives</b><br />

U.S. Marines next defeated the Japanese in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Eniwetok.<p>The U.S. strategic objective was to gain airbases within bombing range of the new <!--del_lnk--> B-29s on the <!--del_lnk--> Mariana Islands, especially <!--del_lnk--> Saipan, <!--del_lnk--> Tinian and <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a>. On <!--del_lnk--> June 11, the U.S. Naval fleet bombarded Saipan, defended by 32,000 Japanese troops; 77,000 Marines landed starting the 15th, and the island was secure by July 9. The Japanese committed much of their declining naval strength in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Philippine Sea, but suffered severe losses in both ships and aircraft. After the battle, the Japanese aircraft carrier force was no longer militarily effective. With the capture of Saipan, Japan was finally within range of B-29 bombers.<p>Guam was invaded on <!--del_lnk--> July 21 and taken on <!--del_lnk--> August 10, but the Japanese fought fanatically. Mopping-up operations continued long after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guam was officially over. The island of <!--del_lnk--> Tinian was invaded on <!--del_lnk--> July 24 and was conquered on <!--del_lnk--> August 1. This operation saw the first use of <!--del_lnk--> napalm in the war.<p>General MacArthur&#39;s troops liberated the Philippines, landing on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Leyte on <!--del_lnk--> October 20. The Japanese had prepared a rigorous defense and used the last of their naval forces in a failed attempt to destroy the invasion force in the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, <!--del_lnk--> October 23 through <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, the <!--del_lnk--> largest naval battle in history. This was the first battle that employed Japanese <!--del_lnk--> kamikaze attacks. The Japanese battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Musashi</i>, one of the two largest battleships ever built, was sunk by 19 American torpedoes and 17 bombs.<p>Throughout 1944, U.S. submarines and aircraft attacked Japanese merchant shipping and deprived Japan&#39;s industry of the raw materials it had gone to war to obtain. The main target was oil, and Japan ran almost dry by late 1944. In 1944, submarines sank over two million tons of cargo, while the Japanese were only able to replace less than one million tons.<p><b>Sino-Japanese War</b><br />

In June 1944, the Japanese deployed 360,000 troops and invaded Changsha for the fourth time. This campaign involved more Japanese troops than any other in the Sino-Japanese war, and after 47 days of bitter fighting, the city was taken. By November, the Japanese had also taken the cities of Guilin and Liuzhou, which had served as U.S. airbases for bombing raids on Japan.

The Axis military lost about 8.5 million, including 5.5 million from Germany, 2.0 million from Japan, 300,000 from Italy, 300,000 from Romania, 300,000 from Hungary, and 200,000 from Yugoslavia.<p>About 49 million deaths were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, <!--del_lnk--> genocide (in particular, <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>), massacres, and <!--del_lnk--> aerial bombing. One estimate is that 12 million civilians died in the camps, 1.5 million by bombs, 7 million in Europe from other causes, and 7.5 million in China from other causes. Allied civilian deaths totaled about 38 million, including the Soviet Union (12.5 million), China (7 million), Poland (5.5 million), and Yugoslavia (0.8 million). There were about 4-5 million civilian deaths on the Axis side, including Germany (2 million), Japan (0.6 Million), Italy (500,000), and Romania (500,000). The Holocaust refers to the organized state-sponsored murder of 6 million Jews, 220,000 <!--del_lnk--> Roma people, and other ethnic minorities and political opponents carried out by the Nazis during the war.<p><b>Genocide</b><dl>

      </dl>
      <p>The <i>Holocaust</i> was the organized murder of an estimated twelve million people, including communists, trade unionists, homosexuals and at least six million Jews. Originally, the Nazis used killing squads known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Einsatzgruppen</i> to conduct massive open-air killings, shooting as many as 33,000 people in a single massacre, as in the case of <!--del_lnk--> Babi Yar. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the <!--del_lnk--> Final Solution, or <i>Endl&ouml;sung</i>, the genocide of all Jews in Europe, and to increase the pace of the Holocaust. <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">The Nazis</a> built six <!--del_lnk--> extermination camps specifically to kill Jews. Millions of Jews who had been confined to massively overcrowded <!--del_lnk--> ghettos were transported to these <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Death-camps&quot;, in which they were either killed on arrival or put to work until the Nazis could find no more use for them, at which point they were disposed of through shootings or mass poisoning in <!--del_lnk--> gas chambers.<p><b>Chemical and bacteriological weapons</b><p>Despite the <!--del_lnk--> international treaties and a resolution adopted by the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> on 14 May 1938 condemning the use of toxic gas by <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese Army frequently used <!--del_lnk--> chemical weapons. Because of fears of retaliation, however, those weapons were never used against Occidentals but only against other Orientals judged &quot;inferior&quot; by the imperial propaganda. According to historians Yoshiaki Yoshimi and Seiya Matsuno, the authorization for the use of chemical weapons was given by specific orders (<i>rinsanmei</i>) issued by <a href="../../wp/h/Hirohito.htm" title="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> himself. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Wuhan, from August to October 1938.<p>The bacteriological weapons were experimented on human beings by many units incorporated in the Japanese army, such as the infamous <!--del_lnk--> Unit 731, integrated by <!--del_lnk--> Imperial decree in the <!--del_lnk--> Kwantung army in 1936. Those weapons were mainly used in China and, according to some Japanese veterans, against Mongolians and Russian soldiers in 1939 during the <!--del_lnk--> Nomonhan incident.<p><b>Slave labor</b><p>According to a joint study of historians featuring Zhifen Ju, Mark Peattie, Toru Kubo, and Mitsuyochi Himeta, more than 10 million Chinese were mobilized by the Japanese army and enslaved by the <!--del_lnk--> K&ocirc;a-in for <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave labor</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Manchukuoand north <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>.&lt;;ref&gt;Zhifen Ju, &quot;<i>Japan&#39;s atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war</i>&quot;, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitsuyoshi Himeta, at least 2.7 million died during the <!--del_lnk--> Sank&#x14D; Sakusen operation implemented in <!--del_lnk--> Heipei and <!--del_lnk--> Shantung by General <!--del_lnk--> Yasuji Okamura.<p><b>Concentration camps, labour camps, and internment</b><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Home front&quot; is the name given to the activities of the civilians of the nations at war. All the main countries reorganized their homefronts to produce munitions and soldiers, with 40-60% of GDP being devoted to the war effort. Women were drafted in the Soviet Union and Britain. Shortages were everywhere, and severe food shortages caused malnutrition and even starvation, such as in the Netherlands and in Leningrad. New workers were recruited, especially housewives, the unemployed, students, and retired people. Skilled jobs were re-engineered and simplified (&quot;de-skilling&quot;) so that unskilled workers could handle them. Every major nation imposed censorship on the media as well as a propaganda program designed to boost the war effort and stifle negative rumors. Every major country imposed a system of rationing and price controls. Black markets flourished in areas controlled by Germany. Germany brought in millions of prisoners of war, slave laborers, and forced workers to staff its munitions factories. Many were killed in the bombing raids, the rest became refugees as the war ended.<p><a id="Technologies" name="Technologies"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Technologies</span></h2>

      <p>Weapons and technology improved rapidly during World War II and played a crucial role in determining the outcome of the war. Many major technologies were used for the first time, including <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> proximity fuzes, <a href="../../wp/j/Jet_engine.htm" title="Jet engine">jet engines</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ballistic missiles, and data-processing analog devices (primitive computers). Every year, the <!--del_lnk--> piston engines were improved. Enormous advances were made in <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a>, <!--del_lnk--> submarine, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tank</a> designs, such that models coming into use at the beginning of the war were long obsolete by its end. One entirely new kind of ship was the amphibious landing craft.<p><a id="Industrial_production" name="Industrial_production"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Industrial production</span></h3>
      <p>Industrial production played a role in the Allied victory. The Allies more effectively mobilized their economies and drew from a larger economic base. The peak year of munitions production was 1944, with the Allies out-producing the Axis by a ratio of 3 to 1. (Germany produced 19% and Japan 7% of the world&#39;s munitions; the U.S. produced 47%, Britain and Canada 14%, and the Soviets 11%).<p>The Allies used low-cost <!--del_lnk--> mass production techniques, using standardized models. Japan and Germany continued to rely on expensive hand-crafted methods. Japan thus produced hundreds of airplane designs and did not reach mass-production efficiency; the new models were only slightly better than the original 1940 planes, while the Allies rapidly advanced in technology. Germany thus spent heavily on high-tech weaponry, including the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket, advanced submarines, jet engines, and heavy tanks that proved strategically of minor value. &quot;The Allies did not depend on simple numbers for victory but on the quality of their technology and the fighting effectiveness of their forces... In both Germany and Japan less emphasis was placed upon the non-combat areas of war: procurement, logistics, military services,&quot; concludes historian Richard Overy.<p>Delivery of weapons to the battlefront was a matter of logistics. The Allies again did a much better job in moving munitions from factories to the front lines. A large fraction of the German tanks after June 1944 never reached the battlefield, and those that did often ran short of fuel. Japan in particular was notably inefficient in its logistics system.<p><a id="Medicine" name="Medicine"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Medicine</span></h3>
      <p>Many new medical and surgical techniques were employed as well as new drugs like <!--del_lnk--> sulfa and <!--del_lnk--> penicillin, not to mention serious advances in <!--del_lnk--> biological warfare and nerve gases. The Japanese control of the quinine supply forced the Australians to invent new anti-malarial drugs. The saline bath was invented to treat burns. More prompt application of sulfa drugs saved countless lives. New <!--del_lnk--> local anesthetics were introduced making possible surgery close to the front lines. The Americans discovered that only 20% of wounds were cause by machine-gun or rifle bullets (compared to 35% in World War I). Most came from <!--del_lnk--> high explosive shells and fragments, which besides the direct wound caused shock from their blast effects. Most deaths came from shock and blood loss, which were countered by a major innovation, <!--del_lnk--> blood transfusions.<p>The massive <!--del_lnk--> research and development demands of the war accelerated the growth of the scientific communities in Allied states, while German and Japanese laboratories were disbanded; many German engineers and scientists continued their <!--del_lnk--> weapons research after the war in the United States and the Soviet Union.<p>
