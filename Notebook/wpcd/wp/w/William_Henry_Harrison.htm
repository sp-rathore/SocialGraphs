      <p><b>William Henry Harrison</b> (<!--del_lnk--> February 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1773 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> April 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1841) was an <!--del_lnk--> American military leader, <!--del_lnk--> politician, and the ninth <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. He served as the first <!--del_lnk--> Governor of the <!--del_lnk--> Indiana Territory and later as a <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Ohio. Harrison first gained national fame as a <!--del_lnk--> war hero, defeating <!--del_lnk--> American Indians at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 and earning the <!--del_lnk--> nickname &quot;Tippecanoe&quot; (or &quot;Old Tippecanoe&quot;). As a <!--del_lnk--> general in the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812, his most notable contribution was a victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Thames, which brought the war in his region to a successful conclusion.<p>When Harrison took office in 1841 at the age of 68, he was the oldest man to be elected President; a record that stood for 140 years, until <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was elected in <!--del_lnk--> 1980 at the age of 69. Harrison died thirty days into his term &mdash; the briefest presidency in the history of the office. He was also the first U.S. president to die while in office. His death threw the country into a potential constituional crisis.<p>

      <p>Harrison was born into a prominent <!--del_lnk--> political family at the <!--del_lnk--> Berkeley Plantation in <!--del_lnk--> Charles City County <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, the youngest of the seven children of <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Harrison V and Elizabeth Basset. His father was a Virginia planter who served as a delegate to the <!--del_lnk--> Continental Congress (1774&ndash;1777), signed the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.htm" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> (1776), and was <!--del_lnk--> Governor of Virginia (1781-1784). William Henry Harrison&#39;s brother, <!--del_lnk--> Carter Bassett Harrison, later became a member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>, representing Virginia. Harrison&#39;s father-in-law was <!--del_lnk--> Congressman <!--del_lnk--> John Cleves Symmes. His stepmother-in-law was the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey <!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> William Livingston.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Before attending the University of Pennsylvania, Harrison attended <!--del_lnk--> Hampden-Sydney College. He entered school at the age of 14.<!--del_lnk-->  Harrison attended the <!--del_lnk--> University of Pennsylvania with the intention of becoming a physician, but did not receive a degree. His father&#39;s death, in 1791, left Harrison without money for further schooling and so, at the age of 18, he was commissioned as an <!--del_lnk--> ensign in the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army. He was sent to the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territory, where he spent much of his life. Harrison served as <!--del_lnk--> aide-de-camp to <!--del_lnk--> General <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne, from whom he learned how to successfully command an army on the <!--del_lnk--> American frontier. Harrison participated in Wayne&#39;s decisive victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, which brought the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Indian War to a close. Lieutenant Harrison was one of the signers of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Greenville in 1795, which opened much of present-day Ohio to settlement by <!--del_lnk--> white Americans.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Harrison resigned from the Army in 1798 to become Secretary of the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territory, and acted as <!--del_lnk--> governor when Governor <!--del_lnk--> Arthur St. Clair was absent. In 1799, Harrison was elected as the first <!--del_lnk--> delegate representing the Northwest Territory in the <!--del_lnk--> Sixth United States Congress, serving from <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1799, to <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1800. As delegate, he successfully promoted the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Harrison Land Act, which made it easier for people to purchase land for settlement in the Northwest Territory. Harrison resigned from Congress to become governor of the newly formed <!--del_lnk--> Indiana Territory at <!--del_lnk--> Vincennes, a post he held for twelve years, until 1813.<p>A primary responsibility as territorial governor was to obtain title to <!--del_lnk--> Native American lands so that white settlement could expand in the area and the region could attain statehood. Harrison oversaw numerous treaties, purchasing much of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Indiana from Native American leaders. Tensions, always high on the frontier, became much greater after the 1809 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Fort Wayne, in which Harrison secured the purchase of more than 2,500,000 acres (10,000 km&sup2;) of American Indian land. An Indian resistance movement against U.S. expansion had been growing around the <!--del_lnk--> Shawnee brothers <!--del_lnk--> Tecumseh and <!--del_lnk--> Tenskwatawa (&quot;The Prophet&quot;). Tecumseh called upon Harrison to nullify the Treaty of Fort Wayne, warned against any whites moving onto the land, and continued to widen his Indian <!--del_lnk--> confederation (see &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tecumseh&#39;s War&quot;). In 1811, Harrison was authorized to march against the confederacy, winning his famous victory at <!--del_lnk--> Prophetstown next to the <!--del_lnk--> Wabash and <!--del_lnk--> Tippecanoe Rivers. During the War of 1812, Harrison took command of the <!--del_lnk--> Army of the Northwest. He won victories in <!--del_lnk--> Indiana and <!--del_lnk--> Ohio before invading <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and crushing the <!--del_lnk--> British at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Thames, in which Tecumseh was killed. Harrison subsequently resigned from the army because of ongoing disagreements with <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of War <!--del_lnk--> John Armstrong.<p><a id="Post-war_political_career" name="Post-war_political_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war political career</span></h2>
      <p>After the war, Harrison was elected to various political offices, including the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio, serving from <!--del_lnk--> October 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1816, to <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1819. He was defeated as a candidate for <!--del_lnk--> governor of Ohio in 1820 but served in the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State Senate from 1819 to 1821. In 1824, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served until <!--del_lnk--> May 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1828, when he resigned to become Minister to <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> from 1828 to 1829. Harrison was a tall man, and in Congress he was referred to by fellow westerners as a <!--del_lnk--> Buckeye, as were other tall pioneers on the Ohio frontier, as a term of endearment in respect of the Buckeye <a href="../../wp/c/Chestnut.htm" title="Chestnut">chestnut</a> tree.<p>Harrison was the Northern <!--del_lnk--> Whig candidate for President in <!--del_lnk--> 1836, but lost the election to <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Van_Buren.htm" title="Martin Van Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>. He was the candidate again in the <!--del_lnk--> 1840 election, winning a <!--del_lnk--> landslide victory largely because of his heroic military record and a weak U.S. economy.<p>The Democrats attempted to ridicule Harrison by calling him &quot;Granny Harrison, the petticoat general,&quot; because he resigned from the army before the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 ended. When asking voters whether Harrison should be elected, they asked them what his name backwards was, which happens to be &quot;No Sirrah.&quot; Harrison&#39;s vice presidential running-mate was <a href="../../wp/j/John_Tyler.htm" title="John Tyler">John Tyler</a>, and their campaign was marked by exaggeration of both Harrison&#39;s military exploits and of his connections to the common man. (Harrison came from an aristocratic Virginia family, but his supporters promoted him as a humble frontiersman in the style of the popular <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Jackson.htm" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>. A memorable example of these efforts was the <!--del_lnk--> Gold Spoon Oration delivered by a Whig congressman.) Harrison and Tyler&#39;s campaign slogans of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Log Cabins and Hard Cider&quot; and &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler, too&quot; are among the most famous in American politics.<p><a id="Presidency_1841" name="Presidency_1841"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency 1841</span></h2>

      <p>When Harrison arrived in Washington, he focused on showing that he was still the stalwart hero of <!--del_lnk--> Tippecanoe. He took the oath of office on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1841, an extremely cold and windy day. Nevertheless, he faced the weather without his overcoat and delivered the longest <!--del_lnk--> inaugural address in American history. At 8,445 words, it took nearly two hours to read (even after his friend and fellow Whig, <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Webster, had edited it for length). He later caught a <a href="../../wp/c/Common_cold.htm" title="Common cold">cold</a>, which then developed into <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> pleurisy. (According to the prevailing medical misconception of the times, it was believed that his illness was caused by the bad weather, when, in fact, he was likely a victim of the <a href="../../wp/v/Virus.htm" title="Virus">virus</a> that causes the <a href="../../wp/c/Common_cold.htm" title="Common cold">common cold</a>.) He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room, as he was deluged with people seeking his favour in the hope that he would appoint them to the numerous offices the president then had at his disposal.<p>His doctors tried everything to cure him, applying <!--del_lnk--> opium, <!--del_lnk--> castor oil, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia snakeweed, and even actual snakes. But the treatments only made Harrison worse and he went into delirium. He died a month later, at 12:30 a.m., on <!--del_lnk--> April 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1841, of right lower lobe <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> jaundice, and overwhelming <!--del_lnk--> septicemia, becoming the first American president to die in office. His last words were &quot;Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.&quot; Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: only 30 days, 11 hours and 30 minutes.<p>The untimely death of Harrison was a disappointment to <!--del_lnk--> Whigs, who hoped to pass a revenue tariff and enact measures to support <!--del_lnk--> Henry Clay&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> American System. <a href="../../wp/j/John_Tyler.htm" title="John Tyler">John Tyler</a>, Harrison&#39;s successor and a long-time Democrat, abandoned the Whig agenda, leaving himself without a party.<p>Harrison&#39;s son, <!--del_lnk--> John Scott Harrison, was also elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio from 1853 to 1857. Harrison&#39;s grandson, <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Harrison.htm" title="Benjamin Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> of Ohio, became the 23rd president in 1889, making them the only grandparent-grandchild pair of presidents to date. In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison gave his inaugural address in the rain. Understanding his grandfather&#39;s mistakes, he asked his outgoing predecessor (and later his successor), <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, to hold an umbrella above his head, since he delivered the longest inaugural address since his grandfather&#39;s.<p><a id="Administration_and_Cabinet" name="Administration_and_Cabinet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Administration and Cabinet</span></h3>
