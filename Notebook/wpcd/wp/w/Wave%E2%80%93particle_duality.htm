      <p>At the close of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, the case for <!--del_lnk--> atomic theory, that matter was made of particulate objects or <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a>, was well established. Electricity, first thought to be a fluid, was understood to consist of particles called <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a>, as demonstrated by <!--del_lnk--> J.J. Thomson by his research into the work of <!--del_lnk--> Rutherford, who had investigated using <!--del_lnk--> cathode rays that an electrical charge would actually travel across a vacuum from cathode to anode. In brief, it was understood that much of nature was made of particles. At the same time, waves were well understood, together with wave phenomena such as <!--del_lnk--> diffraction and <!--del_lnk--> interference. Light was believed to be a wave, as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Young&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> double-slit experiment and effects such as <!--del_lnk--> Fraunhofer diffraction had clearly demonstrated the wave-like nature of light.<p>But as the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> turned, problems had emerged with this viewpoint. The <!--del_lnk--> photoelectric effect, as analyzed in <!--del_lnk--> 1905 by <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, demonstrated that light also possessed particle-like properties, further confirmed with the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> Compton effect in 1923. Later on, the <!--del_lnk--> diffraction of electrons would be predicted and experimentally confirmed, thus showing that electrons must have wave-like properties in addition to particle properties.<p>This confusion over particle versus wave properties was eventually resolved with the advent and establishment of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> in the first half of the 20th century, which ultimately explained <b>wave-particle duality</b>. It provided a single unified theoretical framework for understanding that all matter may have characteristics associated with particles and waves. Quantum mechanics holds that every particle in nature, be it a <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photon</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electron</a> or <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atom</a>, is described by a solution to a <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a>, most typically, the <!--del_lnk--> Schroedinger equation. The solutions to this equation are known as <!--del_lnk--> wave functions, as they are inherently wave-like in their form. They can <!--del_lnk--> diffract and <!--del_lnk--> interfere, leading to the wave-like phenomena that are observed. Yet also, the wave functions are interpreted as describing the <!--del_lnk--> probability of finding a particle at a given point in space. Thus, if one is looking for a particle, one will find one, with a <!--del_lnk--> probability density given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function.<p>One does not observe the wave-like quality of everyday objects because the associated <!--del_lnk--> wavelengths of people-sized objects are exceedingly small.<p><a id="Huygens_and_Newton.3B_earliest_theories_of_light" name="Huygens_and_Newton.3B_earliest_theories_of_light"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Huygens and Newton; earliest theories of light</span></h2>
      <p>The earliest comprehensive theory of <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> was advanced by <!--del_lnk--> Christiaan Huygens, who proposed a <!--del_lnk--> wave theory of light, and in particular demonstrated how waves might interfere to form a wave-front, propagating in a straight line. However, the theory had difficulties in other matters, and was soon overshadowed by <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> corpuscular theory of light. That is, Newton proposed that light consisted of small particles, with which he could easily explain the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> reflection. With considerably more difficulty, he could also explain <!--del_lnk--> refraction through a <!--del_lnk--> lens, and the splitting of sunlight into a <a href="../../wp/r/Rainbow.htm" title="Rainbow">rainbow</a> by a <!--del_lnk--> prism.<p>Because of Newton&#39;s immense intellectual stature, his theory went essentially unchallenged for over a century, with Huygens&#39; theories all but forgotten. With the discovery of <!--del_lnk--> diffraction in the early 19th century, the wave theory was revived, and so by the advent of the 20th century, a scientific debate over waves vs. particles had already been thriving for a very long time.<p><a id="Fresnel.2C_Maxwell.2C_and_Young" name="Fresnel.2C_Maxwell.2C_and_Young"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fresnel, Maxwell, and Young</span></h2>
      <p>In the early <!--del_lnk--> 1800s, the <!--del_lnk--> double-slit experiments by <!--del_lnk--> Young and <!--del_lnk--> Fresnel provided <!--del_lnk--> evidence for <!--del_lnk--> Huygens&#39; theories: these experiments showed that when light is sent through a <!--del_lnk--> grid, a characteristic <!--del_lnk--> interference <!--del_lnk--> pattern is <!--del_lnk--> observed, very similar to the pattern resulting from the interference of <!--del_lnk--> water waves; the wavelength of light can be <!--del_lnk--> computed from such patterns. <a href="../../wp/j/James_Clerk_Maxwell.htm" title="James Clerk Maxwell">Maxwell</a>, during the late-<!--del_lnk--> 1800s, explained light as the propagation of <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic wave">electromagnetic waves</a> with the <!--del_lnk--> Maxwell equations. These equations were verified by experiment, and Huygens&#39; view became widely accepted.<p><a id="Einstein_and_photons" name="Einstein_and_photons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Einstein and photons</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1905, <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> provided an explanation of the <!--del_lnk--> photoelectric effect, a hitherto troubling experiment which the wave theory of light seemed incapable of explaining. He did so by postulating the existence of <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a>, <!--del_lnk--> quanta of light energy with particulate <!--del_lnk--> qualities.<p>In the photoelectric effect, it was observed that shining a light on certain metals would lead to an <!--del_lnk--> electric current in a <!--del_lnk--> circuit. Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing them to flow. However, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light caused no current at all. According to wave theory, the strength or <!--del_lnk--> amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.<p>Einstein explained this conundrum by <!--del_lnk--> postulating that the electrons were knocked free of the metal by incident photons, with each photon carrying an amount of <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> <i>E</i> that was related to the <!--del_lnk--> frequency, <i>&nu;</i> of the light by<dl>
       <dd><img alt="E  =  h  \nu\," class="tex" src="../../images/448/44894.png" /></dl>
      <p>where <i>h</i> is <!--del_lnk--> Planck&#39;s constant (6.626 x 10<sup>-34</sup> J seconds). Only photons of a high-enough frequency, (above a certain <i>threshold</i> value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. More intense light above the threshold frequency could release more electrons, but no amount of light below the threshold frequency could release an electron.<p>Einstein was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Physics in <!--del_lnk--> 1921 for his theory of the photoelectric effect.<p><a id="de_Broglie" name="de_Broglie"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">de Broglie</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1924, <!--del_lnk--> Louis-Victor de Broglie formulated the <!--del_lnk--> de Broglie hypothesis, claiming that <i>all</i> matter, not just light, has a wave-like nature; he related <!--del_lnk--> wavelength, <!--del_lnk--> &lambda; (lambda), and <a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a>, <i>p</i>:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\lambda = \frac{h}{p}" class="tex" src="../../images/448/44895.png" /></dl>
      <p>This is a generalization of Einstein&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> equation above since the momentum of a photon is given by <i>p</i> = <i>E</i> / <i>c</i> where <i>c</i> is the speed of light in vacuum, and <i>&lambda;</i> = <i>c</i> / <i>&nu;</i>.<p>de Broglie&#39;s formula was confirmed three years later for <!--del_lnk--> electrons (which have a rest-mass) with the observation of <!--del_lnk--> electron diffraction in two independent experiments. At the <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen, <!--del_lnk--> George Paget Thomson passed a beam of electrons through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns. At <!--del_lnk--> Bell Labs <!--del_lnk--> Clinton Joseph Davisson and <!--del_lnk--> Lester Halbert Germer guided their beam through a crystalline grid.<p>de Broglie was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize for Physics in <!--del_lnk--> 1929 for his hypothesis. Thomson and Davisson shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in <!--del_lnk--> 1937 for their experimental work.<p><a id="Heisenberg" name="Heisenberg"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Heisenberg</span></h2>
      <p>Wave-particle duality is often expressed via the <!--del_lnk--> Heisenberg <!--del_lnk--> uncertainty principle, which states, in its most common form, that:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\Delta x \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}" class="tex" src="../../images/448/44896.png" /></dl>
      <p>where<dl>

      <p>However the relationship holds more generally for <i>any</i> two <!--del_lnk--> conjugate variables, such as time and energy, or angle of rotation and <!--del_lnk--> angular momentum and follows from the <!--del_lnk--> de Broglie hypothesis being applied to classical fields. The uncertainty relation implies that the measurement of one variable results in the disturbance of its conjugate partner, so that the product of their uncertainty is always greater than a certain amount.<p>

      <p>Similar experiments have since been conducted with <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a>. Among the most famous experiments are those of <!--del_lnk--> Estermann and <!--del_lnk--> Otto Stern in <!--del_lnk--> 1929. Authors of similar recent experiments with atoms and molecules claim that these larger particles also act like waves.<p>A dramatic series of experiments emphasizing the action of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> in relation to wave-particle duality were conducted in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970&#39;s using the <!--del_lnk--> neutron interferometer. <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">Neutrons</a>, one of the components of the <!--del_lnk--> atomic nucleus, provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. Neutrons are <!--del_lnk--> fermions, and thus possess an important quality we associate with matter, namely its &quot;rigidness&quot; (due to the fact that they obey the <!--del_lnk--> Pauli Exclusion Principle). In the neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything - even <!--del_lnk--> deflecting light and acting on <!--del_lnk--> photons (the <!--del_lnk--> Pound-Rebka falling photon experiment), the self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1999, the diffraction of C<sub>60</sub> <!--del_lnk--> fullerenes by researchers from the <!--del_lnk--> University of Vienna was reported. Fullerenes are rather large and massive objects, having an atomic mass of about 720. The de Broglie wavelength is 2.5 <!--del_lnk--> picometers, whereas the diameter of the molecule is about 1 <!--del_lnk--> nanometer, <i>i.e.</i> about 400 times larger. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, this is the largest object for which quantum-mechanical wave-like properties have been directly observed in far-field diffraction. The experimenters have assumed the arguments of wave-particle duality and have assumed the validity of de Broglie&#39;s equation in their argument. In 2003 the Vienna group has meanwhile also demonstrated the wave-nature of <!--del_lnk--> tetraphenylporphyrin - a flat biodye with an extension of about 2 nm and a mass of 614 amu. For this demonstration they employed a near-field <!--del_lnk--> Talbot Lau interferometer . In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48, a fluorinated <!--del_lnk--> buckyball with a mass of about 1600 amu, composed of 108 atoms . Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to some aspects of the quantum-classical interface, i.e. to certain decoherence mechanisms .<p>Whether objects heavier than the <!--del_lnk--> Planck mass (about the weight of a large bacterium) have a de Broglie wavelength is theoretically unclear and experimentally unreachable; above the <!--del_lnk--> Planck mass a particle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Compton wavelength would be smaller than the <!--del_lnk--> Planck length and its own <!--del_lnk--> Schwarzchild radius, a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to be replaced by more general ones.<p><a id="Theoretical_sketch_and_remarks_on_philosophical_inquiry" name="Theoretical_sketch_and_remarks_on_philosophical_inquiry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theoretical sketch and remarks on philosophical inquiry</span></h2>

      <p>see also: <!--del_lnk--> Hilbert space, <!--del_lnk--> path integral formulation, <!--del_lnk--> Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics<p>All complex numbers together make up the <!--del_lnk--> ket, which is also called wave function. But the name &quot;wave function&quot; is problematic, as it sounds that they have more to do with waves than with particles. The time evolution of a ket is governed by a partial <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a> generically called the <a href="../../wp/s/Schr%25C3%25B6dinger_equation.htm" title="Schr&ouml;dinger equation">Schr&ouml;dinger equation</a>. The mathematical tools learned for classical physics to solve such an equation can still be applied: <!--del_lnk--> Superposition, <!--del_lnk--> eigenfunctions, <!--del_lnk--> eigenvalues, <!--del_lnk--> FDTD, <!--del_lnk--> perturbation theory. In other words: &quot;it is a particle and a wave at the same time&quot; in reality and in calculations. It has to be admitted that the <!--del_lnk--> coefficients for the differential equations were derived in a rather unsymmetrical way with respect to particles and waves, but it is unclear if this is an historical artifact.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> ket is still <!--del_lnk--> interpreted as the <!--del_lnk--> probability of finding a system in a specific state. Most of the examples allow or even need partial measurements followed by a second time evolution of the ket followed by more measurements and so on, this is where the philosophical inquiry takes place.<p><a id="Applications" name="Applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>
