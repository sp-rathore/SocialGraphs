<h2>WOW - What a week!</h2><p><strong>01/01/2006</strong></p>
<p>Together with other individuals, schools, companies and community groups across the UK, you helped to raise over &pound;200,000! </p><p>Throughout the year, we were incredibly fortunate to have the support of many - for a complete list see our website World Orphan Week. SOS Ambassador Karen Millen kindly agreed to the sale of WOW wristbands in her shops nationwide. This was an enormous boost to WOW's recognition around the country. And of course the WOW wristband has become this year's must-have accessory!! </p><p>The 'Famous Faces on Canvas' event saw the launch of WOW events in April this year. Over 40 unpublished and memorable photographs of celebrities were donated for auction. Celebrities such as Madonna, Lennox Lewis, Damien Hurst and Kate Winslet kindly donated previously unseen prints to the WOW cause, which went under the hammer at Christies Auction House in London.</p><img src="../../wp/p/P1010039_Golf.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Lord Freddie Windsor at WOW SEAT Golf Day" class="left" /><p>The WOW SEAT Golf Day hit the greens of the Buckinghamshire Golf Course in September, with SEAT rally drivers Luke Hines and Jason Plato, SOS Ambassador Lord Freddie Windsor, former athlete Du'aine Ladejo and a host of teams pitting their wits against the John Jacobs-designed course.</p><img src="../../wp/a/Aerial_WOW.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="An view of WOW activites on Parker's Peice Cambridge" class="right" /><p>And then of course there was World Orphan Week itself, which got off to a flying start with two simultaneous balloon launches, held in Wimbledon and in Cambridge - attended by SOS Ambassadors Lord Freddie Windsor and Leee John. The week saw a whole host of activities in schools, companies and communities up and down the country, including dress-down days, sponsored head shaves, Wine On Wednesday tasting sessions, students WOWing their teachers and loads of WOW parties, and not forgetting the WOW Ball where one lucky person won a personal cookery lesson with SOS Ambassador Jean Christophe Novelli. </p><p>The week was rounded off with a sell-out special preview of Emma Thompson's film, Nanny McPhee.</p><img src="../../wp/n/Nanny_Mcphee.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Nanny Mcphee" class="left" /><p>A date for your diary: WOW 2006 - 2-8 October 2006 With you support let's make 2006 even better than 2005!</p><p>Please contact Mary Wolfe on mary@soschildren.org for more details for WOW 2006.</p>
