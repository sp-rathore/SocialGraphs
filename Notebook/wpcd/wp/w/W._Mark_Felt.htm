      <p><b>William Mark Felt Sr.</b> (born <!--del_lnk--> August 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1913) is a retired agent of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, who retired in <!--del_lnk--> 1973 as the Bureau&#39;s number two official. After thirty years of denying his involvement with reporters <!--del_lnk--> Woodward and <!--del_lnk--> Bernstein, Felt revealed himself on <!--del_lnk--> 31 May <!--del_lnk--> 2005, to be the <!--del_lnk--> Watergate scandal <!--del_lnk--> whistleblower called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Deep Throat&quot;.<p>Felt worked in several FBI field offices prior to his promotion to the Bureau&#39;s <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a> headquarters. During the early investigation of the Watergate scandal (1972&ndash;74), Felt was the Bureau&#39;s Associate Director, the second-ranking post in the FBI. While Associate Director, Felt provided <i><!--del_lnk--> Washington Post</i> reporter <!--del_lnk--> Bob Woodward with critical leads on the story that eventually saw the resignation of <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> <!--del_lnk--> Richard M. Nixon in 1974. In 1980, Felt was convicted of violating the civil rights of people thought to be associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Weather Underground by ordering FBI agents to <!--del_lnk--> burgle their homes. He received a fine but was <!--del_lnk--> pardoned by President <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> during his appeal. Felt lives in <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosa, California. In 2006, he published an update of his 1979 <!--del_lnk--> autobiography, <i>The FBI Pyramid</i>.<p>

He went to <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to work in the office of U.S. <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> <!--del_lnk--> James P.

For most of the time he had nothing to do, and when he was assigned a case, it was whether a toilet paper brand called &quot;Red Cross&quot; was misleading consumers into thinking it was endorsed by the <!--del_lnk--> American Red Cross. Felt wrote in his memoir:<dl>
       <dd>My research, which required days of travel and hundreds of interviews, produced two definite conclusions:<dd>1. Most people <i>did</i> use toilet paper.<dd>2.

      <p>FBI Director <!--del_lnk--> J. Edgar Hoover liked to move Bureau agents around so they would have wide experience. Hoover, Felt observed, &quot;wanted every agent to get into any Field office at anytime. Since he had never been transferred and did not have a family, he had no idea of the financial and personal hardship involved.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HooverNoFamily"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>After completing sixteen weeks of training at the <!--del_lnk--> FBI Academy at <!--del_lnk--> Quantico, Virginia and FBI Headquarters in Washington, Felt was first assigned to <!--del_lnk--> Texas, working in the field offices in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a> and <!--del_lnk--> San Antonio, spending three months in each. He then returned to the &quot;Seat of Government&quot;, as Hoover called FBI headquarters, and was assigned to the <!--del_lnk--> Espionage Section of the Domestic Intelligence Division, tracking down spies and saboteurs during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, where he worked on the Major Case Desk. His most notable work there was on the &quot;Peasant&quot; case. <!--del_lnk--> Helmut Goldschmidt, operating under the codename &quot;Peasant&quot;, was a German agent in custody in England. Under Felt&#39;s direction, his German masters were informed &quot;Peasant&quot; had made his way to the United States, and were fed disinformation on Allied plans.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Peasant"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The Espionage Section was abolished in May 1945 after <!--del_lnk--> V-E Day. After the war, he was again in the field, sent first to <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>. After two years of general work, he spent two years as a firearms instructor and was promoted from agent to supervisor.

Felt oversaw these checks.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Espionage"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Hoover appointed Felt the third ranking official in the Bureau in 1951. In 1954, Felt returned briefly to Washington as an inspector&#39;s aide. Two months later, Felt was sent to <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans, Louisiana, as assistant special agent in charge of the field office. When he was transferred to <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> fifteen months later, he held the same rank there.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TransferNewOrleansLosAngeles"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> In 1956, Felt was transferred to <a href="../../wp/s/Salt_Lake_City%252C_Utah.htm" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, and promoted to special agent in charge.

      <p>Hoover died in his sleep and was found on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> May 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1972. Tolson was nominally in charge until the next day when Nixon appointed loyalist <!--del_lnk--> L. Patrick Gray III as acting FBI director. Tolson submitted his resignation, dictated by Felt, and Gray accepted it, the acceptance also being dictated by Felt. Felt took Tolson&#39;s post as Associate Director, the number-two job in the bureau.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TolsonResignation"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Felt served as an honorary pallbearer at Hoover&#39;s funeral.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HooverPallbearer"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Immediately upon his death, Hoover&#39;s secretary for five decades, <a href="../../wp/h/Helen_Gandy.htm" title="Helen Gandy">Helen Gandy</a>, began destroying his files with the approval of Felt and Gray. She turned over twelve boxes of the &quot;Official/Confidential&quot; files to Felt on <!--del_lnk--> May 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information. Felt stored them in his office, and Gray told the press that afternoon that &quot;there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity.&quot; Felt earlier that day had told Gray, &quot;Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn&#39;t have any secret files&quot;, and to prove it had taken Gray to Hoover&#39;s office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray &quot;looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work&quot;, though Gray would later deny he looked at anything.

While noting Gray did work hard, he was critical at how often he was away from FBI Headquarters. Gray lived in <!--del_lnk--> Stonington, Connecticut, and commuted to Washington. He also visited all of the Bureau&#39;s field offices except Honolulu. His frequent absences led to the nickname &quot;Three-Day Gray&quot;. <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_ThreeDayGrayNickname"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> These absences, combined with Gray&#39;s hospitalization and recuperation from <!--del_lnk--> November 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1972 to <!--del_lnk--> January 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1973,<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_GrayHospitalisation"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> meant that Felt was effectively in charge for much of his final year at the Bureau.

      <p>As associate director, Felt saw everything compiled on <!--del_lnk--> Watergate before it went to Gray. The agent in charge, Charles Nuzum, sent his findings to Investigative Division head Robert Gebhardt, who then passed the information on to Felt. From the day of the break-in, <!--del_lnk--> June 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1972, until the FBI investigation was mostly completed in June 1973, Felt was the key control point for FBI information. He had been among the first to learn of the investigation, being informed at 7:00 on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> June 17.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_FeltLearnsAboutWatergate"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <!--del_lnk--> Ronald Kessler, who had spoken to former Bureau agents, reported that throughout the investigation they &quot;were amazed to see material in Woodward and Bernstein&#39;s stories lifted almost verbatim from their reports of interviews a few days or weeks earlier.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_KesslerAmazed"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> <a id="Contact_with_Woodward" name="Contact_with_Woodward"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Contact with Woodward</span></h3>

Moorer, <!--del_lnk--> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, delivering papers to the White House Situation Room. In his book <i>The Secret Man</i>, Woodward described Felt as &quot;a tall man with perfectly combed gray hair . . . distinguished looking&quot; with &quot;a studied air of confidence, even what might be called a command presence&quot;.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HowWoodwardMetFelt"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> They stayed in touch and spoke on the telephone several times. When Woodward started working at the <i>Washington Post</i>, he phoned Felt on several occasions to ask for information for articles in the <i>Post</i>. Felt&#39;s information, taken on a promise that Woodward would never reveal their origin, was a source for a few stories, notably for an article on <!--del_lnk--> May 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1972, about <!--del_lnk--> Arthur H. Bremer, who shot <!--del_lnk--> George C. Wallace. When the Watergate story broke, Woodward called on his friend. Felt advised Woodward on <!--del_lnk--> June 19 that <!--del_lnk--> E. Howard Hunt was involved; the telephone number of his White House office had been listed in the address book of one of the burglars. Initially, Woodward&#39;s source was known at the <i>Post</i> as &quot;My Friend&quot;, but was tagged &quot;Deep Throat&quot; by <i>Post</i> editor <!--del_lnk--> Howard Simons, after <!--del_lnk--> the pornographic movie. Woodward has written that idea for the nickname first came to Simons because Felt had been providing the information on a &quot;deep background&quot; basis. Deep background is a journalistic term meaning information provided to a reporter on the condition that the source be neither identified nor quoted directly.<p>When Felt&#39;s name was revealed, it was noted that &quot;My Friend&quot; has the same initial letters as &quot;Mark Felt&quot;. Woodward has said this was a coincidence, but in looking back at some of his notes, interviews with Felt during the earliest days of the story were marked with &quot;M.F.&quot;<p><a id="Code_for_contacting_Woodward" name="Code_for_contacting_Woodward"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Code for contacting Woodward</span></h3>
      <p>Woodward claimed that when he wanted to meet Deep Throat, he would move a flowerpot with a red flag on the balcony of his apartment, number 617, at the Webster House at 1718 P Street, Northwest, and when Deep Throat wanted a meeting, he would circle the page number on page twenty of Woodward&#39;s copy of <i><!--del_lnk--> The New York Times</i> and draw clock hands to signal the hour.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_DeepThroatSignal"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Adrian Havill questioned these claims in his 1993 biography of Woodward and Bernstein, stating Woodward&#39;s balcony faced an interior courtyard and was not visible from the street, but Woodward responded that it has been bricked in since he lived there. Havill also claimed that copies of <i>The Times</i> were not delivered marked by apartment, but Woodward and a former neighbour disputed this claim.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_HavillOnSignalStory"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Woodward has stated<dl>
       <dd>How [Felt] could have made a daily observation of my balcony is still a mystery to me. At the time, the back of my building was not enclosed so anyone could have driven in the back alley to observe my balcony. In addition, my balcony and the back of the apartment complex faced onto a courtyard or back area that was shared with a number of other apartment or office buildings in the area. My balcony could have been seen from dozens of apartments or offices.</dl>
      <dl>

      <p>In the early 1970s, Felt oversaw a turbulent period in the FBI&#39;s history. The FBI was pursuing radicals in the <!--del_lnk--> Weather Underground who had planted bombs at the <!--del_lnk--> Capitol, <!--del_lnk--> the Pentagon, and the <!--del_lnk--> State Department. Felt, along with <!--del_lnk--> Edward S. Miller, authorized FBI agents to break into homes secretly in 1972 and 1973, without a <!--del_lnk--> search warrant, on nine separate occasions. These kinds of FBI burglaries were known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> black bag jobs&quot;. The break-ins occurred at five addresses in New York and New Jersey, at the homes of relatives and acquaintances of Weather Underground members, and did not lead to the capture of any fugitives. The use of &quot;black bag jobs&quot; by the FBI was declared unconstitutional by the <!--del_lnk--> United States Supreme Court in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Plamondon</i> case, 407 U.S. 297 (1972).<p>After revelation by the <!--del_lnk--> Church Committee of the FBI&#39;s illegal activities, many agents were investigated. Felt in 1976 publicly stated he had ordered break-ins and that individual agents were merely obeying orders and should not be punished for it. Felt also stated Gray also authorized the break-ins, but Gray denied this. Felt said on the CBS television program <i>Face the Nation</i> he would probably be a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for the Bureau&#39;s work.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Scapegoat"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> &quot;I think this is justified and I&#39;d do it again tomorrow&quot;, he said on the program.

       <dd>To not take action against these people and know of a bombing in advance would simply be to stick your fingers in your ears and protect your eardrums when the explosion went off and then start the investigation.</dl>
      <p>The Attorney General in the new Carter administration, <!--del_lnk--> Griffin B. Bell, investigated, and on <!--del_lnk--> April 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1978, a federal grand jury charged Felt, Miller and Gray with conspiracy to violate the constitutional rights of American citizens by searching their homes without warrants, though Gray&#39;s case did not go to trial and was dropped by the government on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1980. Felt told Ronald Kessler:<dl>
       <dd>I was shocked that I was indicted. You would be too, if you did what you thought was in the best interests of the country and someone on technical grounds indicted you.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_FeltIndictmentShock"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span></dl>

Reagan wrote:<dl>
       <dd>Pursuant to the grant of authority in article II, section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, I have granted full and unconditional pardons to W. Mark Felt and Edward S. Miller.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>During their long careers, Mark Felt and Edward Miller served the Federal Bureau of Investigation and our nation with great distinction. To punish them further &mdash; after 3 years of criminal prosecution proceedings &mdash; would not serve the ends of justice.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>Their convictions in the U.S. District Court, on appeal at the time I signed the pardons, grew out of their good-faith belief that their actions were necessary to preserve the security interests of our country. The record demonstrates that they acted not with criminal intent, but in the belief that they had grants of authority reaching to the highest levels of government.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>America was at war in 1972, and Messrs. Felt and Miller followed procedures they believed essential to keep the Director of the FBI, the Attorney General, and the President of the United States advised of the activities of hostile foreign powers and their collaborators in this country. They have never denied their actions, but, in fact, came forward to acknowledge them publicly in order to relieve their subordinate agents from criminal actions.</dl>

Rehnquist, who was a Justice Department official early in the Nixon administration, but was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court by the time of the incident.<p><a id="Deep_Throat_revealed" name="Deep_Throat_revealed"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Deep Throat revealed</span></h2>
      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Vanity Fair</i> magazine revealed Felt was Deep Throat on <!--del_lnk--> May 31, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 when it published an article (eventually appearing in the July issue of the magazine) on its website by <!--del_lnk--> John D. O&#39;Connor, an attorney acting on Felt&#39;s behalf, in which Felt said, &quot;I&#39;m the guy they used to call Deep Throat.&quot; After the <i>Vanity Fair</i> story broke, <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin C. Bradlee, the key editor of the <i>Washington Post</i> during Watergate, confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat. According to the <i>Vanity Fair</i> article, Felt was persuaded to come out by his family, who wanted to capitalize on the book deals and other lucrative opportunities that Felt would inevitably be offered in order, at least in part, to pay off his grandchildren&#39;s education. They also did not want Bob Woodward to get all the attention by revealing Deep Throat&#39;s identity after Felt&#39;s death.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_VanityFair"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Public response varied widely. Felt&#39;s family called him an &quot;American hero&quot;, suggesting that he leaked information for moral or patriotic reasons. <!--del_lnk--> G. Gordon Liddy, who was convicted of burglary in the Watergate scandal, said Felt should have gone to the <!--del_lnk--> grand jury rather than leaking information.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_GGordonLiddy"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Some have contrasted Felt&#39;s media treatment with that of other <!--del_lnk--> whistleblowers.<p>Nixon chief counsel <!--del_lnk--> Charles Colson, who served <!--del_lnk--> prison time for his actions in the Nixon White House, said Felt had violated &quot;his oath to keep this nation&#39;s secrets&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CharlesColston"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>, but a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> editorial argued that this argument was specious, &quot;as if there&#39;s no difference between nuclear strategy and rounding up <!--del_lnk--> hush money to silence your hired burglars.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_LATimesEditorial"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Ralph de Toledano, who co-wrote Felt&#39;s 1979 memoir, said Mark Felt Jr. had approached him in 2004 to buy Toledano&#39;s half of the copyright. Toledano agreed to sell but was never paid and attempted to rescind the deal, threatening legal action. A few days before the <i>Vanity Fair</i> article was released, Toledano finally received a check.<dl>
       <dd>I had been gloriously and illegally deceived, and Deep Throat was, in characteristic style, back in business &mdash; which given his history of betrayal, was par for the course.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Toledano"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span></dl>
      <p>Speculation about Felt&#39;s motives at the time of the scandal has varied widely as well. Some suggested it was revenge for Nixon choosing Gray over Felt to replace Hoover as FBI Director. Others suggest Felt acted out of institutional loyalty to the FBI. Felt may have simply acted out of patriotism.<p><!--del_lnk--> Publishers were interested in signing Felt to a book deal after the revelation. Weeks after the <i><!--del_lnk--> Vanity Fair</i> article was released, PublicAffairs Books, whose <!--del_lnk--> CEO was a <i>Washington Post</i> reporter and editor during the Watergate era, announced that it signed a deal with Felt. The new book was to include material from his 1979 <!--del_lnk--> memoir with an update. The new volume was scheduled for publication in the spring of 2006. Felt sold the movie rights to his story to <!--del_lnk--> Universal Pictures for development by <!--del_lnk--> Tom Hanks&#39;s production company, Playtone. The book and movie deals were valued at US $1 million.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_DealWithHanks"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>In the summer of 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Woodward&#39;s longtime publisher, <!--del_lnk--> Simon and Schuster, issued Woodward&#39;s swiftly written account of his contacts with Felt, <i>The Secret Man: The Story of Watergate&#39;s Deep Throat</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-7432-8715-0). The book received poor reviews and, despite the media attention that surrounded the <i>Vanity Fair</i> story, sold poorly.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Mark_Felt&quot;</div>
