As late as 1871, when <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown ceased to be a separate city, there were multiple jurisdictions within the District. Although there is a municipal government and a mayor, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Congress.htm" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> has the <!--del_lnk--> supreme authority over the city and district, which results in citizens having a different status and less representation in government than residents of the states.<p>The centers of all three branches of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. federal government are in the District as well as the headquarters of most <!--del_lnk--> independent agencies.

Washington is the frequent location of large political <!--del_lnk--> demonstrations and <!--del_lnk--> protests, particularly on the <!--del_lnk--> National Mall.

      <p>The District of Columbia, founded on <!--del_lnk--> July 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1790, is a federal district as specified by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Constitution.htm" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. The U.S. Congress has ultimate authority over the District of Columbia, though it has delegated limited local rule to the municipal government. The land forming the original District came from the states of <!--del_lnk--> Maryland and <!--del_lnk--> Virginia. However, the <!--del_lnk--> area south of the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River (39 square miles or about 100 km&sup2;) was returned, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> retroceded&quot;, to Virginia in 1847 and now is incorporated into <!--del_lnk--> Arlington County and the City of <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria. After 1847, the remaining land that formed the area now known as the District of Columbia was formed exclusively from land that once belonged to Maryland.<p><a id="Planning" name="Planning"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Planning</span></h3>

      <p>A <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_United_States.htm" title="Southern United States">Southern</a> site for the new country&#39;s capital was agreed upon at a dinner between <!--del_lnk--> James Madison and <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_Hamilton.htm" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, hosted by <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. The city was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Charles L&#39;Enfant, a <!--del_lnk--> Major in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Army. The initial plan for the &quot;Federal District&quot; was a diamond, measuring 10&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles (16&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km) on each side, totaling 100&nbsp;square miles (256&nbsp;km&sup2;). The actual site on the Potomac River was chosen by <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">President Washington</a>. Washington may have chosen the site for its natural scenery, believing the Potomac would become a great navigable waterway. The city was officially named &quot;Washington&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> September 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1791. Out of modesty, George Washington never referred to it as such, preferring to call it &quot;the Federal City.&quot; Despite choosing the site and living nearby at <!--del_lnk--> Mount Vernon, he rarely visited the city. The federal district was named the District of Columbia because <!--del_lnk--> Columbia was a poetic name for the United States used at the time.<p>Initially, the District of Columbia included four distinct sections, of which the city of Washington was only one. The others were <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria County, <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown, and the <!--del_lnk--> County of Washington. Georgetown occupied its current boundaries. Alexandria County included parts of the present-day City of Alexandria, as well as the current <!--del_lnk--> Arlington County, Virginia. Washington City occupied much of its current area but ended at present-day <!--del_lnk--> Rock Creek Park on the west and <!--del_lnk--> Florida Avenue and Benning Road on the north. Florida Avenue was then called &quot;Boundary Street.&quot; The remainder of the district was Washington County.<p>In 1791&ndash;92, <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Ellicott and the free African-American <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Banneker surveyed the border of the District with both Maryland and Virginia, placing boundary stones at every mile point; many of these still stand.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> cornerstone of the <!--del_lnk--> White House, the first newly constructed building of the new capital, was laid on <!--del_lnk--> October 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1792. That was the day after the first solemn celebrations of <!--del_lnk--> Columbus Day, marking its 300th anniversary.<p><a name="19th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1814, British forces <!--del_lnk--> burned the capital during the most notable raid of the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 in retaliation for the sacking and burning of York (modern-day <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>) during the winter months, which had left many Canadians homeless. President <!--del_lnk--> James Madison and U.S. forces fled before the British forces arrived and burned public buildings, including the <!--del_lnk--> Capitol and the <!--del_lnk--> Treasury building. The <!--del_lnk--> White House was burned and gutted. The Navy Yard was also burned&mdash;by American sailors. The home of the <!--del_lnk--> Commandant of the Marine Corps, located at the <!--del_lnk--> Marine Barracks, was one of the few government buildings not burned by the raiding British soldiers out of a sign of respect and is now the oldest public building in continuous use in the nation&#39;s capital. Civilians were not directly targeted and, initially, the British had approached the city hoping to secure a truce. However, they were fired upon, triggering frustration and anger among the British, which ultimately led to the sacking of government buildings.<p>During the 1830s the District was home to one of the largest slave trading operations in the country (see <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, Virginia).<p>In 1846, the populace of Alexandria County, who resented the loss of business with the competing port of Georgetown and feared greater impact if slavery were outlawed in the capital, voted in a referendum to ask Congress to <!--del_lnk--> retrocede Alexandria back to the state of Virginia. Congress agreed to do so on <!--del_lnk--> July 9 of that year.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Washington remained a small city&mdash;the 1860 Census put the population at just over 75,000 persons&mdash;until the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> in 1861. The significant expansion of the federal government to administer the war and its legacies such as veterans&#39; pensions led to notable growth in the city&#39;s population. By 1870, the District population had grown to nearly 132,000.<p>In July 1864, <!--del_lnk--> Confederate forces under <!--del_lnk--> Jubal Anderson Early made a brief raid into Washington, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Fort Stevens. The Confederates were repulsed, and Early eventually returned to the <!--del_lnk--> Shenandoah Valley. The <!--del_lnk--> fort is located near present day <!--del_lnk--> Walter Reed Army Medical Centre in northwest Washington. The battle was the only battle where a U.S. president, <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, was present and under enemy fire while in office. <p>In the early 1870s, Washington was given a territorial government, but Governor <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Robey Shepherd&#39;s reputation for extravagance resulted in Congress abolishing his office in favour of direct rule. Congressional governance of the District would continue for a century.<p>In 1878, Congress passed an <!--del_lnk--> Organic Act that made the boundaries of the city of Washington coterminous with those of the District of Columbia. This effectively eliminated Washington County; Georgetown, technically made a part of the city, was allowed to remain nominally separate until 1895 when it was formally combined with Washington.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Washington Monument opened in 1888. Plans were laid to further develop the monumental aspects of the city, with work contributed by such noted figures as <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Law Olmsted and <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Burnham. However, development of the <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln Memorial and other structures on the National Mall did not begin until the early 20th century.<p><a name="20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th century</span></h3>

The population declined in the following decades, mirroring the suburban emigration of many of the nation&#39;s older urban centers following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on <!--del_lnk--> March 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, allowing residents of Washington, D.C. to vote for president and have their votes count in the <!--del_lnk--> Electoral College as long as Washington, D.C. does not have more electoral votes than the least populous state.<p>After the assassination of civil rights activist <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther_King%252C_Jr..htm" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, in Memphis, Tennessee, on <!--del_lnk--> April 4, 1968, riots broke out in some sections of the city. The violence raged for four days, and buildings were burned. At one point, the rioters came within two blocks of the White House. President <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon Johnson ordered over 13,000 federal troops to occupy the city--the largest occupation of an American city since the Civil War. It took years for the city to recover.<p>One of the most important developments in bringing people back downtown was the building of the subway system. The first 4.6&nbsp;miles (7.4&nbsp;km) of the <a href="../../wp/w/Washington_Metro.htm" title="Washington Metro">Washington Metro</a> <!--del_lnk--> subway system opened on <!--del_lnk--> March 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1976.<p>In 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Self-Rule and Governmental Reorganization Act, providing for an elected mayor and city council for the District. As a result, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Washington became the first elected mayor of the District in 1975. <!--del_lnk--> Marion Barry became mayor in 1979, but was arrested for <!--del_lnk--> drug use in an <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="FBI">FBI</a> <!--del_lnk--> sting operation on <!--del_lnk--> January 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1990, and served a six-month jail term. His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Sharon Pratt Kelly, became the first black woman to lead a city of that size and importance in the U.S. Barry, however, defeated her in the 1994 primary and was once again elected mayor for his fourth term, during which time the city nearly became <!--del_lnk--> insolvent and was forced to give up some home rule to a congressionally-appointed financial control board. In 1998, <!--del_lnk--> Anthony A. Williams was elected the city&#39;s mayor and led the city into a fiscal recovery, which made him a popular figure. Williams was reelected in 2002.<p><a name="21st_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">21st century</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball officially relocated the <!--del_lnk--> Montreal Expos to Washington for the 2005 season, despite opposition from <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore Orioles owner <!--del_lnk--> Peter Angelos. The new team was christened the Washington Nationals. Controversy between the city council and MLB threatened to scuttle the agreement until <!--del_lnk--> December 21, when a plan for a <!--del_lnk--> new stadium in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast D.C. was finalized. The Nationals will play at <!--del_lnk--> R.F.K. Stadium until the new stadium is ready on the Anacostia River waterfront in 2008.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The Potomac River as it passes Washington is virtually entirely within the District of Columbia border because of colonial <!--del_lnk--> riparian rights between Maryland and Virginia.<p>The District has three major natural flowing streams: the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River, the <!--del_lnk--> Anacostia River, and <!--del_lnk--> Rock Creek. The Anacostia River and Rock Creek are tributaries of the Potomac River. There are also three man-made <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs: <!--del_lnk--> Dalecarlia Reservoir, which crosses over the northwest border of the District from Maryland; <!--del_lnk--> McMillan Reservoir near <!--del_lnk--> Howard University; and <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown Reservoir upstream of Georgetown.<p>The highest point in the District of Columbia is 410 <!--del_lnk--> feet (125&nbsp;m) above sea level at <!--del_lnk--> Tenleytown. The lowest point is sea level, which occurs along all of the Anacostia shore and all of the Potomac shore except the uppermost portion (the Little Falls - Chain Bridge area). The sea level Tidal Basin rose eleven feet during <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Isabel on <!--del_lnk--> September 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2003.<p>The geographic centre of the District of Columbia is located near 4th Street NW, L Street NW, and New York Avenue NW (not under the Capitol Dome, as is sometimes said.)<p>Geographical features of Washington, D.C. include <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Roosevelt Island, <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Island, the <!--del_lnk--> Three Sisters, and <!--del_lnk--> Hains Point.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Washington has a <!--del_lnk--> humid subtropical climate typical of the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic U.S., with four distinct seasons. Summer tends to be hot and humid with daily high temperatures in July and August averaging in the high 80s&deg; to low 90s&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F (about 30&deg; to 33&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C). The combination of heat and humidity makes thunderstorms very frequent in the summer, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. Spring and fall are mild with high temperatures in April and October averaging in the high 60s&deg; Fahrenheit (about 20 &deg;C). Winter brings cool temperatures and occasional snowfall. Average highs tend to be in the 40s (4 to 8 &deg;C) and lows in the 20s (-6 to -2 &deg;C) from mid December to mid February. While <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a> (or the remnants of them) occasionally track through the area in the late summer and early fall, they have often weakened by the time they reach Washington. Spring is generally the most favorable time of year, with low humidity, mild temperatures and blooming foliage. This period generally lasts from late March until mid May.<p>The average annual snowfall is 15&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches (381&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm) and the average high temperature in January is 43&nbsp;&deg;F (6&nbsp;&deg;C); the average low for January is 27&nbsp;&deg;F (-3&nbsp;&deg;C). The highest recorded temperature was 106&nbsp;&deg;F (41&nbsp;&deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> July 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1930 and <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1918 and the lowest recorded temperature was -15 &deg;F (-26 &deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> February 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1899.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>As of 2002, the federal government accounts for 27% of Washington, D.C.&#39;s jobs. The presence of many major government agencies, including the <!--del_lnk--> Department of Defense, <!--del_lnk--> National Institutes of Health, and the <!--del_lnk--> Food and Drug Administration, has led to business development both in the District itself as well as in the National Capital Region of Maryland and northern Virginia. These businesses include federal <!--del_lnk--> contractors (defense and civilian), numerous nonprofit organizations, law firms and lobbying firms, catering and administrative services companies, and several other industries that are sustained by the economic presence of the federal government. This arrangement makes the Washington economy virtually <!--del_lnk--> recession-proof relative to the rest of the country, because the federal government will still operate no matter the state of the general economy, and it often grows during recessions.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> gross state product of the District in 2004 was <!--del_lnk--> $75.264 billion, ranking it #36 when compared with the fifty states. In 2006, <i>Expansion Magazine</i> ranked DC among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In terms of commercial office space, Washington, D.C. has the 3rd largest downtown in America behind <!--del_lnk--> New York and <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>.<p>Of non-government employers, Washington, D.C.&#39;s major universities and hospitals are among the top employers with <!--del_lnk--> George Washington University, <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown University and <!--del_lnk--> Washington Hospital Centre as the top three. <!--del_lnk--> Howard University and <!--del_lnk--> Fannie Mae round out the top five employers in Washington, D.C. <p>Washington is also a global media centre. Most major news outlets have bureaus in the city and Washington is home to <!--del_lnk--> Black Entertainment Television, <!--del_lnk--> C-SPAN, the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Post Company, and <!--del_lnk--> XM Satellite Radio. Washington&#39;s unique scenery makes it a popular location for film and television production.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and government</span></h2>

      <p>The city is run by an elected mayor (currently <!--del_lnk--> Anthony A. Williams, <!--del_lnk--> Adrian Fenty will take over when inaugurated in January) and a <!--del_lnk--> city council. The city council is composed of 13 members &mdash; a representative elected from each of the eight <!--del_lnk--> wards and five members, including the chairman, elected at large. The council conducts its work through standing committees and special committees established as needed. District schools are administered by a <!--del_lnk--> school board that has both elected and appointed members. There are 37 elected <!--del_lnk--> Advisory Neighbourhood Commissions that provide the most direct access for residents to their local government. The commissions serve as local councils, and their suggestions are required to be given &quot;great weight&quot; by the D.C. Council. However, the U.S. Congress has the ultimate plenary power over the district. It has the right to review and overrule laws created locally and has often done so. The <!--del_lnk--> Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not apply to the District of Columbia.<p>D.C. residents pay federal <!--del_lnk--> taxes, such as <!--del_lnk--> income tax, as well as local taxes. The mayor and council adopt a budget of local money with Congress reserving the right to make any changes. Much of the valuable property in the District is federally owned and hence exempt from local property taxes; at the same time, the city is burdened with the extraordinary expenses related to its role as the capital, such as police overtime and street cleaning for D.C.&#39;s frequent parades and festivals. These factors are often used to explain why the city&#39;s budget is frequently overstretched. However, the federal government also appropriates funds for the city. For instance, according to Public Law 108-7, the federal government provided, among other funds, an estimated 25% of the District&#39;s operating budget in 2003.<p>Historically, the city&#39;s local government has earned somewhat of a reputation for mismanagement and waste, particularly during the mayoralty of <!--del_lnk--> Marion Barry, who was re-elected despite serving jail time for smoking <!--del_lnk--> crack cocaine. A front page story in the <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1997 <i>Washington Post</i> reported that Washington had some of the highest cost, lowest quality services in the region. Prosperity in the late 1990s and early 2000s has lessened public pressure on Mayor Williams, who still faces daunting <!--del_lnk--> urban renewal, public health, and public education challenges.<p><a id="Representation_in_federal_government" name="Representation_in_federal_government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Representation in federal government</span></h3>
      <p>The U.S. Constitution gives Congress direct jurisdiction for Washington, D.C. While Congress has delegated various amounts of this authority to local government, including an elected mayor and city council, Congress still intervenes, from time to time, in local affairs relating to schools, <!--del_lnk--> gun control policy, and other issues.<p>Citizens of the District have no voting representation in Congress. They are represented in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> by a <!--del_lnk--> non-voting delegate (currently <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-<!--del_lnk--> DC At-Large)) who sits on committees and participates in debate but cannot vote. D.C. has no representation at all in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">Senate</a>. Attempts to change this situation, including the proposed <!--del_lnk--> District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment, have been unsuccessful.<p>Citizens of Washington, D.C. are not unique in having diminished representation in their federal legislature, although they are unique in having no voting representation at all. Some nations that have built capital cities from scratch, including <!--del_lnk--> Nigeria, have diminished representation for a federal district. Washington&#39;s situation can also be compared to the historical status of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. territories, which had only non-voting delegates to the House. However, unlike U.S. territories today (such as American Samoa and Guam), citizens of the District of Columbia are fully taxed and subject to all U.S. laws, just as the citizens of the fifty states. In recent years, &quot;Taxation Without Representation&quot; has been the ironic motto featured on D.C. license plates.<p>With the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> 23rd Amendment in 1961, citizens of the District became eligible to vote for President. The District has three <!--del_lnk--> electoral votes--the same number as states with the smallest populations, such as Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>

      <p>Pierre L&#39;Enfant&#39;s original plan for the city provided for a grid of streets and a diagonal array of avenues, all centered on the Capitol building. The north-south streets are primarily named with numbers and the east-west streets with letters. With the Capitol as the centre, one set of numbered streets sweeps eastward from it (1st Street, 2nd Street, etc.) and another set sweeps westward (1st Street, 2nd Street, etc.) Similarly, sets of lettered streets sweep northward from the Capitol (A Street, C Street, etc.) and southward. The diagonal avenues in L&#39;Enfant&#39;s plan are chiefly named after states (e.g., Pennsylvania Avenue). Street addresses are identified by their location in one of the four <!--del_lnk--> quadrants of the city, centered on the Capitol building: <!--del_lnk--> Northeast (NE), <!--del_lnk--> Northwest (NW), <!--del_lnk--> Southeast (SE), and <!--del_lnk--> Southwest (SW). Addresses end with a quadrant suffix to indicate whether the location is, for example, on 4th Street NE, 4th Street NW, 4th Street SE or 4th Street SW. Outside the original city boundaries, street layout and naming practices are less regular. However, the alphabetic order of east-west streets, ending with W Street, is in some areas succeeded by an alphabetic progression of two-syllable names (e.g., Adams, Bryant, Channing), followed by a three-syllable progression (e.g., Allison, Buchanan, Crittenden)<p>Major interstates running through the area include the <!--del_lnk--> Capital Beltway (I-495), <!--del_lnk--> I-66, <!--del_lnk--> I-95, <!--del_lnk--> I-395, <!--del_lnk--> I-295, and <!--del_lnk--> I-270 (which does not reach D.C., terminating at I-495). Other major highways include the <!--del_lnk--> Whitehurst Freeway, and <!--del_lnk--> Anacostia Freeway in D.C., the <!--del_lnk--> George Washington Parkway in D.C. and Virginia, the <!--del_lnk--> Suitland Parkway in D.C. and Maryland, <!--del_lnk--> US Route 50, the <!--del_lnk--> Clara Barton Parkway, and the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore-Washington Parkway in Maryland, and the <!--del_lnk--> Dulles Toll Road in Virginia.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Washington area is served by the <a href="../../wp/w/Washington_Metro.htm" title="Washington Metro">Washington Metro</a> public transportation system, which operates public <!--del_lnk--> buses (<!--del_lnk--> Metrobus) and the region&#39;s subway system (<!--del_lnk--> Metrorail). A <!--del_lnk--> public-private partnership operates the <!--del_lnk--> DC Circulator buses downtown. Many of the jurisdictions around the region run public buses that interconnect with the Metrobus/Metrorail system. <!--del_lnk--> Union Station is served by <!--del_lnk--> MARC and <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Railway Express commuter trains, and <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> intercity rail. Intercity bus service is available from the <!--del_lnk--> Greyhound Bus Terminal in <!--del_lnk--> Northeast and from <!--del_lnk--> dragon buses leaving from Chinatown.<p>Washington, D.C. is served by three major <!--del_lnk--> airports, one in Maryland and two in Virginia. <!--del_lnk--> Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>DCA</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KDCA</b>) is the closest &mdash; located in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River from <!--del_lnk--> Hains Point, and accessible via Washington Metro. The airport is conveniently located to the downtown area; however it has somewhat restricted flights to airports within the United States because of noise and security concerns. Most major international flights arrive and depart from <!--del_lnk--> Washington Dulles International Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>IAD</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KIAD</b>), located 26.3 miles (42.3 km) west of the city in <!--del_lnk--> Fairfax and <!--del_lnk--> Loudoun counties in Virginia. Dulles is the second busiest international gateway on the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Seaboard. Dulles offers service from several low-cost carriers including <!--del_lnk--> JetBlue, although the low-cost selection decreased greatly when <!--del_lnk--> Independence Air (which was headquartered at Dulles) folded in January 2006. <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (<!--del_lnk--> IATA: <b>BWI</b>,&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ICAO: <b>KBWI</b>), is located 31.7 miles (51.0 km) northeast of the city in <!--del_lnk--> Anne Arundel County, Maryland, near Baltimore. BWI has had the highest passenger volume of the three major airports in the Baltimore-Washington Metroplex for several months.<p>General aviation is additionally available at several smaller airfields, including <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery County Airpark (<!--del_lnk--> Gaithersburg, Maryland), <!--del_lnk--> College Park Airport (<!--del_lnk--> College Park, Maryland), <!--del_lnk--> Potomac Airfield (<!--del_lnk--> Friendly CDP of <!--del_lnk--> Prince George&#39;s County, Maryland), and <!--del_lnk--> Manassas Regional Airport (<!--del_lnk--> Manassas, Virginia). Since 2003, the general aviation airports closest to Washington, D.C. have had their access strictly limited by the implementation of the <!--del_lnk--> Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h2>

      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> violent crime wave of the early 1990s, Washington, D.C. was known as the murder capital of the United States, and often rivaled <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans as the nation&#39;s most murderous city. Murders peaked in 1991 at 482, with violence declining drastically since then: murders declined to 198 in 2004, with a slight decline to 195 in 2005. Once plagued with violent crime, many D.C. neighborhoods, such as <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Heights, are becoming safe and vibrant areas as a result of <!--del_lnk--> gentrification. While not as intensely violent, crime hot spots have since displaced farther into the eastern sections of Washington, D.C. and across the border into Maryland. Although the southeastern side of the city has developed a reputation for being unsafe, these crime hot spots are generally concentrated in very specific areas that are associated with <!--del_lnk--> drugs and <!--del_lnk--> gangs. Other areas east of the U.S. Capitol, as well as the city&#39;s wealthier <!--del_lnk--> Northwest neighborhoods, experience low levels of crime. Despite the declining trends, Washington D.C. crime rates (2005) remain among the highest of U.S. cities, and it was most recently ranked as the 13th most dangerous city in the nation. Washington D.C. surpasses L.A. and New York in crime.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Metropolitan Police Chief <!--del_lnk--> Charles H. Ramsey declared a &quot;crime emergency&quot; in the city in response to a rising homicide rate (the city had logged 13 murders since July 1st, most notably the killing of a prominent British political activist in <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown. While the declaration allowed for more flexible and increased policing in high-crime neighborhoods, it was temporary and scheduled to be revisited following a 30-day trial period. <p><a id="Nature" name="Nature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nature</span></h2>

      <p>DC has many natural areas and birdwatching spots inside the city. DC&#39;s parks and natural areas include <!--del_lnk--> Anacostia Park, the National Arboretum, <!--del_lnk--> Rock Creek Park, The <!--del_lnk--> Arlington Cemetery, The <!--del_lnk--> National Zoological Park, Langley Oaks Park, Roosevelt Island, the <!--del_lnk--> C&amp;O Canal, the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River and <!--del_lnk--> Anacostia River. The <!--del_lnk--> American Forests Report found that &quot;The region Washington DC Metro area is comprised of 187,767 acres of tree canopy (46%), 110,300 acres of impervious surfaces (27%), 70,747 acres of open space (17%), 27,072 acres of bare soil area (7%), and 11,036 acres of water (3%). The total storm water retention capacity of the urban forest on these lands is 949 million cubic feet in avoided storage of water and is valued at $4.7 billion (based on construction costs estimated at $5 per cubic foot to build equivalent retention facilities). The urban forest provides air quality benefits by removing nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide ozone and particulate matter 10 microns or less. The Metro DC areas urban forest removes 20 million pounds of pollutants from the air each year, a benefit worth $49.8 million annually.&quot;<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
