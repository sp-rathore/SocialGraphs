      <p>The sole son of <!--del_lnk--> Robert the Magnificent and <!--del_lnk--> Herleva, most likely the daughter of a local tanner named Fulbert, William was born <!--del_lnk--> illegitimate in <!--del_lnk--> Falaise, <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. The exact date of birth is uncertain, but is known to have been either in 1027 or 1028, and more likely in the autumn of the latter year. He was the <!--del_lnk--> grandnephew of Queen <!--del_lnk--> Emma, wife of King <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready and later of King <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute</a>.<p>William succeeded to his father&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy at the young age of 7 in <!--del_lnk--> 1035 and was known as Duke William II of Normandy (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">Fr.</a> <i>Guillaume II, duc de Normandie</i>). He lost three guardians to plots to usurp his place. Count <!--del_lnk--> Alan of Brittany was a later guardian. King <!--del_lnk--> Henry I of France knighted him at the age of 15. By the time he turned 19 he was successfully dealing with threats of rebellion and invasion. With the assistance of King Henry, William finally secured control of Normandy by defeating the rebel Norman barons at <!--del_lnk--> Caen in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Val-&egrave;s-Dunes in <!--del_lnk--> 1047.<p>He married his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Matilda of Flanders, against the wishes of the <!--del_lnk--> pope in <!--del_lnk--> 1053 at the Cathedral of Notre Dame at <!--del_lnk--> Eu, Normandy (now in <!--del_lnk--> Seine-Maritime). He was 26, she was 22. Their marriage produced four sons and six daughters (see list below).<p>His half-brothers <!--del_lnk--> Odo of Bayeux and <!--del_lnk--> Robert, Count of Mortain played significant roles in his life. He also had a sister, <!--del_lnk--> Adelaide of Normandy.<p><a id="Conquest_of_England" name="Conquest_of_England"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conquest of England</span></h2>

      <p>Upon the death of William&#39;s cousin King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> of England (January <!--del_lnk--> 1066), William claimed the throne of England, asserting that the childless and purportedly celibate Edward had named him his heir during a visit by William (probably in <!--del_lnk--> 1052) and that <!--del_lnk--> Harold Godwinson, England&#39;s foremost <!--del_lnk--> magnate and brother-in-law of the late King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, had reportedly pledged his support while shipwrecked in Normandy (c. <!--del_lnk--> 1064). Harold made this pledge while in captivity and was reportedly tricked into swearing on a saint&#39;s bones that he would give the throne to William. Even if this story is true, however, Harold made the promise under duress and so may have felt free to break it. More realistically, by the mid 1050s, Harold was effectively ruling England through the weak King Edward and was unlikely to surrender the throne to a foreign noble.<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #8888AA; border-collapse: collapse; float: right; font-size: 95%; margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px; padding: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 240px;">

      <p>The assembly of England&#39;s leading nobles known as the <!--del_lnk--> Witenagemot approved Harold Godwinson&rsquo;s coronation which took place on <!--del_lnk--> 5 January <!--del_lnk--> 1066 making him King <!--del_lnk--> Harold II of England. In order to pursue his own claim, William obtained the support of the <!--del_lnk--> Pope Alexander II for his cause. He assembled a Norman invasion fleet of around 600 ships and an army of 7000 men. He landed at <!--del_lnk--> Pevensey in <!--del_lnk--> Sussex on <!--del_lnk--> 28 September <!--del_lnk--> 1066 and assembled a prefabricated wooden castle (<!--del_lnk--> Motte-and-bailey) near <!--del_lnk--> Hastings as a base. This was a direct provocation to Harold Godwinson as this area of Sussex was Harold&#39;s own personal estate, and William began immediately to lay waste to the land. It may have prompted Harold to respond immediately and in haste rather than await reinforcements in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>King Harold Godwinson was in the north of England and had just defeated another rival, <!--del_lnk--> Harald III of Norway, supported by his own brother Tostig. He marched an army of similar size to William&#39;s 250 miles in 9 days to challenge him at the crucial battle of Senlac, which later became known as the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Hastings.htm" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>. This took place on <!--del_lnk--> 14 October <!--del_lnk--> 1066. According to some accounts, perhaps based on an interpretation of the <!--del_lnk--> Bayeux Tapestry commemorating the Norman victory, Harold was allegedly killed by an arrow through the eye, and the English forces fled giving William victory.<p>This was the defining moment of what is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest. Unable to enter London, William travelled to <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford, was welcomed in by <!--del_lnk--> Wigod who supported his cause. This is where the first submissions took place including that of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The remaining Anglo-Saxon noblemen surrendered to William at <!--del_lnk--> Berkhamsted, <!--del_lnk--> Hertfordshire and he was acclaimed King of England there. William was then crowned on <!--del_lnk--> 25 December <!--del_lnk--> 1066 in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.<p>Although the south of England submitted quickly to Norman rule, resistance continued, especially in the North for six more years until <!--del_lnk--> 1072. Harold&#39;s illegitimate sons attempted an invasion of the south-west peninsula. Uprisings occurred in the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Marches and at <!--del_lnk--> Stafford. Separate attempts at invasion by the <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danes</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scots</a> also occurred. William&#39;s defeat of these led to what became known as <!--del_lnk--> The Harrying of the North (Sometimes called Harrowing) in which <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria was laid waste as revenge and to deny his enemies its resources. The last serious resistance came with the <!--del_lnk--> Revolt of the Earls in <!--del_lnk--> 1075. It is estimated that one fifth of the people of England were killed during these years by war, massacre, and starvation.<p><a id="William.27s_reign" name="William.27s_reign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">William&#39;s reign</span></h2>
      <p>William initiated many major changes. In <!--del_lnk--> 1085, in order to ascertain the extent of his new dominions and maximize taxation, William commissioned the compilation of the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a>, a survey of England&#39;s productive capacity similar to a modern <!--del_lnk--> census. He also ordered many <!--del_lnk--> castles, <!--del_lnk--> keeps, and <!--del_lnk--> mottes, among them the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, to be built across England to ensure that the rebellions by the English people or his own followers would not succeed. His conquest also led to <!--del_lnk--> Norman replacing <!--del_lnk--> English as the language of the ruling classes for nearly 300 years.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>William is said to have deported some of the Anglo-Saxon land owning classes into slavery through Bristol. Many of the latter ended up in <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Spain and <!--del_lnk--> Moorish lands. Ownership of nearly all land in England and titles to religious and public offices were given to Normans. Many surviving Anglo-Saxon nobles emigrated to other European kingdoms.<p><a id="Death.2C_burial.2C_and_succession" name="Death.2C_burial.2C_and_succession"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death, burial, and succession</span></h2>
      <p>William died at the age of 59, at the Convent of St Gervais, near <!--del_lnk--> Rouen, France, on <!--del_lnk--> 9 September <!--del_lnk--> 1087 from abdominal injuries received from his saddle pommel when he fell off a horse at the Siege of <!--del_lnk--> Mantes. William was <!--del_lnk--> buried in the church of St. Stephen in <!--del_lnk--> Caen, <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. In a most unregal postmortem, his <!--del_lnk--> corpulent body would not fit in the stone <!--del_lnk--> sarcophagus, and burst after some unsuccessful prodding by the assembled <!--del_lnk--> bishops, filling the chapel with a foul smell and dispersing the mourners. <p>William was succeeded in <!--del_lnk--> 1087 as King of England by his younger son <a href="../../wp/w/William_II_of_England.htm" title="William II of England">William Rufus</a> and as Duke of Normandy by his elder son <!--del_lnk--> Robert Curthose. This led to the <!--del_lnk--> Rebellion of 1088. His youngest son <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_I_of_England.htm" title="Henry I of England">Henry</a> also became King of England later, after William II died without a child to succeed him.<p><a id="Genealogy" name="Genealogy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Genealogy</span></h2>
