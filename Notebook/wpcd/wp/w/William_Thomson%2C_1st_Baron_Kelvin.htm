      <p><a id="Family" name="Family"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h3>
      <p>William&#39;s father was Dr. James Thomson, the son of a <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> <!--del_lnk--> farmer. James received little youthful instruction in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> but, when 24 years old, started to study for half the year at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Glasgow, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, while working as a <!--del_lnk--> teacher back in Belfast for the other half. On graduating, he became a <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> teacher at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He married Margaret Gardner in <!--del_lnk--> 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy.<p>William, and his elder brother <!--del_lnk--> James, were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father&#39;s encouragement, affection and financial support and was prepared for a fashionable career in <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. However, James was a sickly youth and proved unsuited to a sequence of failed <!--del_lnk--> apprenticeships. William soon became his father&#39;s favourite.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1832, the father was appointed professor of mathematics at <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and the family relocated there in October <!--del_lnk--> 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father&#39;s rural upbringing, spending the summer of <!--del_lnk--> 1839 in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and, the boys, being tutored in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. The summer of <!--del_lnk--> 1840 was spent in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Language study was given a high priority.<p><a id="Youth" name="Youth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Youth</span></h3>
      <p>William began study at Glasgow University in <!--del_lnk--> 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any preconcociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for abler pupils and this was a typical starting age. In <!--del_lnk--> 1839, <!--del_lnk--> John Pringle Nichol, the professor of <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, took the chair of <!--del_lnk--> natural philosophy. Nichol updated the curriculum, introducing the new mathematical works of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier. The mathematical treatment much impressed Thomson.<p>In the academic year 1839-<!--del_lnk--> 1840, Thomson won the class prize in <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> for his <i>Essay on the figure of the Earth</i> which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. Throughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a <!--del_lnk--> coping strategy at times of personal <!--del_lnk--> stress.<p>Thomson became intrigued with Fourier&#39;s <i>Th&eacute;orie analytique de la chaleur</i> and committed himself to study the &quot;Continental&quot; mathematics resisted by a <!--del_lnk--> British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>. Unsurprisingly, Fourier&#39;s work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, <!--del_lnk--> Philip Kelland authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published <!--del_lnk--> scientific paper under the <!--del_lnk--> pseudonym <i>P.Q.R.</i>, defending Fourier, and submitted to the <i>Cambridge Mathematical Journal</i> by his father. A second P.Q.R paper followed almost immediately.<p>While vacationing with his family in <!--del_lnk--> Spamalot in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial, P.Q.R. paper <i>On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity</i>. In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of <!--del_lnk--> heat conduction and <!--del_lnk--> electrostatics, an <!--del_lnk--> analogy that <a href="../../wp/j/James_Clerk_Maxwell.htm" title="James Clerk Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable <i>science-forming ideas.</i><p><a id="Cambridge" name="Cambridge"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cambridge</span></h3>
      <p>William&#39;s father was able to make a generous provision for his favourite son&#39;s education and, in <!--del_lnk--> 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at <!--del_lnk--> Peterhouse, Cambridge. In <!--del_lnk--> 1845 Thomson graduated as second <!--del_lnk--> wrangler. However, he won a <!--del_lnk--> Smith&#39;s Prize, sometimes regarded as a better test of originality than the <!--del_lnk--> tripos. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner <i>You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.</i><p>While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports and athletics. He won the Silver Sculls, and rowed in the winning boat of the <!--del_lnk--> Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race. He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, physics, and in particular, of <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a>, had captivated his imagination.<p>In 1845 he gave the first mathematical development of <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Faraday</a>&#39;s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or &quot;dielectric&quot;, and not by some incomprehensible &quot;action at a distance&quot;. He also devised a hypothesis of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, or the science which deals with the forces of electricity at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September of 1845 that led to the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> Faraday effect, which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.<p>On gaining a fellowship at his college, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated <!--del_lnk--> Henri Victor Regnault, at <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>; but in 1846 he was appointed to the chair of natural <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> in the University of Glasgow. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a learned professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a freshman but a few years before.<p><a id="Thermodynamics" name="Thermodynamics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Thermodynamics</span></h3>
      <p>By <!--del_lnk--> 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the <!--del_lnk--> British Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. At that meeting, he heard <!--del_lnk--> James Prescott Joule making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the <!--del_lnk--> caloric theory of <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">heat</a> and the theory of the <!--del_lnk--> heat engine built upon it by <!--del_lnk--> Sadi Carnot and <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Clapeyron. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and <a href="../../wp/m/Mechanical_work.htm" title="Mechanical work">mechanical work</a> and for their mechanical equivalence.<p>Thomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule&#39;s results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot-Clapeyron school. He predicted that the <!--del_lnk--> melting point of <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> must fall with <!--del_lnk--> pressure, otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a <i><!--del_lnk--> perpetuum mobile</i>. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1848, he extended the Carnot-Clapeyron theory still further through his dissatisfaction that the <!--del_lnk--> gas thermometer provided only an <!--del_lnk--> operational definition of temperature. He proposed an <i><!--del_lnk--> absolute temperature scale</i> in which <i>a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature</i> T<i>&deg; of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (</i>T<i>-1)&deg;, would give out the same mechanical effect</i> [work]<i>, whatever be the number</i> T<i>.</i> Such a scale would be <i>quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.</i> By employing such a &quot;waterfall&quot;, Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of <i><a href="../../wp/a/Absolute_zero.htm" title="Absolute zero">absolute zero</a></i> about which <!--del_lnk--> Guillaume Amontons had speculated in <!--del_lnk--> 1702. Thomson used data published by Regnault to <!--del_lnk--> calibrate his scale against established measurements.<p>In his publication, Thomson wrote:<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>... the conversion of heat (or <i>caloric</i>) into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered</blockquote>
      <p>- but a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule&#39;s <i>very remarkable discoveries</i>. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on <!--del_lnk--> 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on <!--del_lnk--> 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.<p>Thomson returned to <i>critique</i> Carnot&#39;s original publication and read his analysis to the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society of Edinburgh in January <!--del_lnk--> 1849, still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot&#39;s theory and convinced of Joule&#39;s. In February <!--del_lnk--> 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. However, he was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the <!--del_lnk--> second law of thermodynamics. In Carnot&#39;s theory, lost heat was <i>absolutely lost</i> but Thomson contended that it was &quot;<i>lost to man</i> irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world&quot;. Moreover, his <!--del_lnk--> theological beliefs led to speculation about the <!--del_lnk--> heat death of the universe.<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on - I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a>, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth (planet)">earth</a> and other <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a> are losing <i><!--del_lnk--> vis viva</i> which is converted into heat; and that although some <i>vis viva</i> may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be <i>precisely</i> compensated and I think it probable that it is under compensated.</blockquote>
      <p>Compensation would require <i>a creative act or an act possessing similar power</i>.<p>In final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared &quot;the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.&quot; Thomson went on to state a form of the second law:<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.</blockquote>
      <p>In the paper, Thomson supported the theory that heat was a form of motion but admitted that he had been influenced only by the thought of Sir <a href="../../wp/h/Humphry_Davy.htm" title="Humphry Davy">Humphry Davy</a> and the experiments of Joule and <!--del_lnk--> Julius Robert von Mayer, maintaining that experimental demonstration of the conversion of heat into work was still outstanding.<p>As soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from <!--del_lnk--> 1852 to <!--del_lnk--> 1856, its discoveries including the <!--del_lnk--> Joule-Thomson effect, and the published results did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule&#39;s work and the <!--del_lnk--> kinetic theory.<p><a id="Transatlantic_cable" name="Transatlantic_cable"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transatlantic cable</span></h2>

      <p>Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September <!--del_lnk--> 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum but her health broke down on their <!--del_lnk--> honeymoon and, over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On <!--del_lnk--> 16 October <!--del_lnk--> 1854, <!--del_lnk--> George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> on the proposed <!--del_lnk--> transatlantic telegraph cable.<dl>
       <dd><i>To understand the technical issues in which Thomson became involved, see <!--del_lnk--> Submarine communications cable: Bandwidth problems</i></dl>
      <p>Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent &mdash; in modern terms, the <!--del_lnk--> bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the <!--del_lnk--> data rate that could be achieved and the <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economic</a> consequences in terms of the potential <!--del_lnk--> revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further <!--del_lnk--> 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its <!--del_lnk--> profitability.<p>Thomson contended that the speed of a signal through a given core was inversely proportional to the <!--del_lnk--> square of the <!--del_lnk--> length of the core. Thomson&#39;s results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in <!--del_lnk--> 1856 by <!--del_lnk--> Wildman Whitehouse, the <!--del_lnk--> electrician of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well underway. He believed that Thomson&#39;s calculations implied that the cable must be &quot;abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible.&quot;<p>Thomson attacked Whitehouse&#39;s contention in a letter to the popular <i><!--del_lnk--> Athenaeum</i> magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger <!--del_lnk--> conductor with a larger <!--del_lnk--> cross section of <!--del_lnk--> insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he may have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson&#39;s work had, however, caught the eye of the project&#39;s undertakers and in December <!--del_lnk--> 1856, he was elected to the <!--del_lnk--> board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.<p><a id="Scientist_to_engineer" name="Scientist_to_engineer"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Scientist to engineer</span></h3>
      <p>Thomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Tilston Bright as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the <!--del_lnk--> specification, supported by Faraday and <!--del_lnk--> Samuel F. B. Morse.<p>Thomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship <i>HMSS Agamemnon</i> in August <!--del_lnk--> 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after just 380&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the <i>Engineer</i> the whole theory of the <!--del_lnk--> stresses involved in the laying of a submarine <!--del_lnk--> cable, and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.<p>Thomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a <!--del_lnk--> character every 3.5&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> seconds. He <!--del_lnk--> patented the key elements of his system, the <!--del_lnk--> mirror galvanometer and the <!--del_lnk--> siphon recorder, in <!--del_lnk--> 1858.<p>However, Whitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson&#39;s many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using a purer <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.<p>The board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, about which the board had been unenthusiastic, alongside Whitehouse&#39;s equipment. However, Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the <i>Agamemnon</i> had to return home following the disastrous <!--del_lnk--> storm of June 1858. Back in London, the board was on the point of abandoning the project and mitigating their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, <!--del_lnk--> Cyrus Field and <!--del_lnk--> Curtis M. Lampson argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed real engineer&#39;s instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to lend a hand in manual work. A cable was finally completed in <!--del_lnk--> August 5.<p><a id="Disaster_and_triumph" name="Disaster_and_triumph"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Disaster and triumph</span></h3>
      <p>Thomson&#39;s fears were realised and Whitehouse&#39;s apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson&#39;s mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded only in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> V. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse&#39;s proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient energy.<p>A joint committee of inquiry was established by the <!--del_lnk--> Board of Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable&#39;s failure was found to rest with Whitehouse. The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of <!--del_lnk--> reliability, most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October <!--del_lnk--> 1863.<p>In July <!--del_lnk--> 1865 Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the <i><!--del_lnk--> SS Great Eastern</i> but the voyage was again dogged with technical problems. The cable was lost after 1,200&nbsp;miles had been laid and the expedition had to be abandoned. A further expedition in <!--del_lnk--> 1866 managed to lay a new cable in two weeks and then go on to recover and complete the <!--del_lnk--> 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was <!--del_lnk--> knighted on <!--del_lnk--> November 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1866.<p>To exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with <!--del_lnk--> C.F. Varley and <!--del_lnk--> Fleeming Jenkin. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an <!--del_lnk--> automatic curb sender, a kind of <!--del_lnk--> telegraph key for sending messages on a cable.<p><a id="Later_expeditions" name="Later_expeditions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later expeditions</span></h3>
      <p>Thomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic <!--del_lnk--> submarine communications cable of <!--del_lnk--> 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student <!--del_lnk--> James Alfred Ewing. He was present at the laying of the <!--del_lnk--> Par&aacute; to <!--del_lnk--> Pernambuco section of the Brazilian coast cables in <!--del_lnk--> 1873.<p>Thomson&#39;s wife had died on <!--del_lnk--> 17 June <!--del_lnk--> 1870 and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ton <!--del_lnk--> schooner, the <i>Lalla Rookh</i> and used it as a base for entertaining friends and scientific colleagues. His maritime interests continued in <!--del_lnk--> 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of the <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Captain</i>.<p>In June <!--del_lnk--> 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were onboard the <i>Hooper</i>, bound for <a href="../../wp/l/Lisbon.htm" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> with 2,500&nbsp;miles of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in <!--del_lnk--> Madeira followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On <!--del_lnk--> 2 May <!--del_lnk--> 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the <i>Lalla Rookh</i>. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence <i>Will you marry me?</i> and Fanny signalled back <i>Yes</i>. Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on <!--del_lnk--> 24 June <!--del_lnk--> 1874.<p><a id="Thomson_.26_Tait:_Treatise_on_Natural_Philosophy" name="Thomson_.26_Tait:_Treatise_on_Natural_Philosophy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Thomson &amp; Tait: <i>Treatise on Natural Philosophy</i></span></h2>
      <p>Over the period <!--del_lnk--> 1855 to <!--del_lnk--> 1867, Thomson collaborated with <!--del_lnk--> Peter Guthrie Tait on a <!--del_lnk--> text book that unified the various branches of physical science under the common principle of energy.

      <p>Thomson was an enthusiastic yachtsman, his interest in all things relating to the sea perhaps arising, or at any rate fostered, from his experiences on the <i>Agamemnon</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Great Eastern</i>.<p>Thomson introduced a method of deep-sea <!--del_lnk--> sounding, in which a steel <!--del_lnk--> piano wire replaces the ordinary land line. The wire glides so easily to the bottom that &quot;flying soundings&quot; can be taken while the ship is going at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson.<p>About the same time he revived the <!--del_lnk--> Sumner method of finding a ship&#39;s place at sea, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application. He also developed a <!--del_lnk--> tide predicting machine.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable <!--del_lnk--> compass in order to correct errors arising from <!--del_lnk--> magnetic deviation owing to the increasing use of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> in <!--del_lnk--> naval architecture. Thomson&#39;s design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction, the deviation due to the ship&#39;s own magnetism being corrected by movable masses of iron at the <!--del_lnk--> binnacle. Thomson&#39;s innovations involved much detailed work to develop princples already identified by <!--del_lnk--> George Biddell Airy and others but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson&#39;s energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by <!--del_lnk--> The Admiralty.<blockquote class="toccolours" style="float:none; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;">
       <p>Scientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other had, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors&#39;.<br />
        <br /> The truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.</blockquote>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Babbage.htm" title="Charles Babbage">Charles Babbage</a> had been among the first to suggest that a <!--del_lnk--> lighthouse might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light but Thomson pointed out the merits of the <!--del_lnk--> Morse code for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.<p><a id="Electrical_standards" name="Electrical_standards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Electrical standards</span></h2>
      <p>Thomson did more than any other electrician up to his time to introduce accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of <!--del_lnk--> William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of <!--del_lnk--> Coulomb. In the <i>Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences</i> for <!--del_lnk--> 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring <!--del_lnk--> electrometer, based on the old electroscope of <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the <!--del_lnk--> current balance, also known as the <i>Kelvin balance</i> or <i>Ampere balance</i> (<i>sic</i>), for the <!--del_lnk--> precise specification of the <!--del_lnk--> Ampere, the <!--del_lnk--> standard <!--del_lnk--> unit of <!--del_lnk--> electric current.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the <a href="../../wp/n/Niagara_Falls.htm" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a> <!--del_lnk--> power station. Despite his previous belief in the superiority of <!--del_lnk--> direct current <!--del_lnk--> electric power transmission, he was convinced by <a href="../../wp/n/Nikola_Tesla.htm" title="Nikola Tesla">Nikola Tesla</a>&#39;s demonstration of three-phase <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a> power transmission at the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago World&#39;s Fair of that year and agreed to use Tesla&#39;s system. In <!--del_lnk--> 1896, Thomson said &quot;Tesla has contributed more to electrical science than any man up to his time.&quot;<p><a id="Geology_and_theology" name="Geology_and_theology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geology and theology</span></h2>

      <p>Thomson remained a devout believer in <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> throughout his life: attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine, though he might not identify with <!--del_lnk--> fundamentalism if he were alive today. He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Evidence Society, <!--del_lnk--> 23 May <!--del_lnk--> 1889.<p>One of the clearest instances of this interaction is in his estimate of the <!--del_lnk--> age of the Earth. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth&#39;s cooling and to make historical inferences of the earth&#39;s age from his calculations. Thomson believed in an instant of <!--del_lnk--> Creation but he was no <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">creationist</a> in the modern sense. He contended that the <!--del_lnk--> laws of thermodynamics operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> and other structures, followed by a gradual &quot;heat death&quot;. He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a> and contrasted this view with that of <!--del_lnk--> uniformitarianism, that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past. He contended that &quot;This earth, certainly a moderate number of millions of years ago, was a red-hot globe ... .&quot;<p>After the publication of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Origin of Species</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of the Earth as tending to contradict an <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> explanation of <!--del_lnk--> biological diversity. He noted that the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a> could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> &mdash; unless some energy source beyond what he or any other <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era person knew of was found. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with Darwin&#39;s supporters <!--del_lnk--> John Tyndall and <!--del_lnk--> T.H. Huxley. In his response to <!--del_lnk--> Huxley&rsquo;s address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address &quot;Of Geological Dynamics&quot;, (1869) which, among his other writings, set back the scientific acceptance that the earth must be of very great age.<p>Thomson ultimately settled on an estimate that the Earth was 20-40 million years old. Shortly before his death however, <!--del_lnk--> Becquerel&#39;s discovery of <!--del_lnk--> radioactivity and <a href="../../wp/m/Marie_Curie.htm" title="Marie Curie">Marie Curie</a>&#39;s studies with <!--del_lnk--> uranium ores provided the insight into the &#39;energy source beyond&#39; that would power the sun for the long time-span required by the <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a>. Though Thomson continued to defend his estimates, privately he admitted that they were most probably wrong.<p><a id="Limits_of_classical_physics" name="Limits_of_classical_physics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Limits of classical physics</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1884, Thomson delivered a series of lectures at <!--del_lnk--> Johns Hopkins University in the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. in which he attempted to formulate a physical model for the <!--del_lnk--> aether, a medium that would support the <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic wave">electromagnetic waves</a> that were becoming increasingly important to the explanation of <!--del_lnk--> radiative phenomena. Imaginative as were the &quot;Baltimore lectures&quot;, they had little enduring value owing to the imminent demise of the mechanical world view.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1900, he gave a lecture titled <i>Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light</i>. The two &quot;dark clouds&quot; he was alluding to were the unsatisfactory explanations that the physics of the time could give for two phenomena: the <!--del_lnk--> Michelson-Morley experiment and <!--del_lnk--> black body radiation. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the <!--del_lnk--> Theory of relativity; for the second, <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, in <!--del_lnk--> 1905, published the so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Annus Mirabilis Papers&quot;, one of which explained the photoelectric effect and was of the foundation papers of quantum mechanics, another of which described <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>.<p><a id="Other_work" name="Other_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other work</span></h2>
