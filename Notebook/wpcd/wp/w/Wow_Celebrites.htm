<h2>WOW Celebrities</h2>
<p>In 2006, we're very lucky to have celebrities supporting our World Orphan Week balloon races - WOW Ambassadors The OperaBabes, Tracey Edwards MBE and Lysette Anthony. Find out more about what's going on during the week <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Balloon_Races.htm">here</a>.</p><p>But we also have a number of other famous supporters, who are injecting the WOW factor into World Orphan Week 2006 and will hopefully inspire you to also take part!</p><h3>G4</h3>
<img src="../../wp/g/G4_Ghana_Tema.jpg" width="274" height="179" alt="G4 with SOS children in Ghana" class="right" /><p>Earlier this year, G4 went to Ghana to see for themselves the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village in Tema and our work with local communities. </p><p>They were all taken aback by the situation some of the children were living in - Matt said: &quot;Without SOS these children would have had to survive on the streets, most would not have survived, or would have died as abandoned babies&quot;  </p><p>You can read more about their visit to Ghana in their <a href="../../wp/g/G4_Classic_Response.htm">diary</a>.</p><h3>Wayne Rooney</h3>
<img src="../../wp/r/Rooney_Ambassado.jpg" width="128" height="129" alt="Wayne Rooney, SOS Ambassador" class="left" /><p>Following on from our hugely successful joint World Cup campaign with FIFA <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages.htm">&quot;6 villages for 2006&quot;</a>, Wayne Rooney will also be supporting World Orphan Week in his role as official <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages_Wayne_Rooney.htm">FIFA/SOS Ambassador</a>:</p><p>&ldquo;The work they (SOS Children&rsquo;s Villages) do is for kids who have suffered and have no families to help them.  I know how much it means to have a family that supports you, so I am delighted I can give my support to these kids.&rdquo;</p><h3>OperaBabes</h3>
<img src="../../wp/w/WOW_Operababes.jpg" width="216" height="147" alt="The OperaBabes visiting SOS Children's Village Piliyandala, Sri Lanka" class="right" /><p>Karen England, who along with Rebecca Knight makes up the successful classical duo The OperaBabes, explains why they are supporting World Orphan Week: </p><p>&quot;SOS Children provides a home in every sense of the word for kids who've lost everything and would otherwise have very little hope. Rebecca and I are proud to be Ambassadors and urge you to support this most deserving of causes as much as you can.&quot;</p><h3>George Alagiah</h3>
<img src="../../wp/g/GEORGEALAGIAH.jpg" width="115" height="118" alt="George Alagiah, World Orphan Week supporter" class="left" /><p>&ldquo;In my years as a BBC Foreign Correspondent, I saw that the most vulnerable people, mainly children, were always the ones that suffered.  Many end up as orphans after disasters and wars.  Please join me in supporting WOW and help SOS Children help more orphaned children; one by one.&rdquo;</p>
