      <p>Water has the <!--del_lnk--> chemical formula <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">H</a><sub>2</sub><a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">O</a> meaning that one <!--del_lnk--> molecule of water is composed of two <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> and one <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> atom. It can be described ionically as HOH, with a hydrogen <!--del_lnk--> ion (H<sup>+</sup>) that is bonded to a <!--del_lnk--> hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>). It is in <!--del_lnk--> dynamic equilibrium between the <!--del_lnk--> liquid and <!--del_lnk--> vapor states at <!--del_lnk--> standard temperature and pressure. Water alone is a <!--del_lnk--> colourless, <!--del_lnk--> tasteless, and <!--del_lnk--> odourless liquid, but upon standing it takes on the traces of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in the air and tends toward a sour solution of <!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid that is unpleasant-tasting and more inhospitable to life.<p>Water is often referred to in the sciences as <i>the universal <!--del_lnk--> solvent</i> and the only pure substance found naturally in all three <!--del_lnk--> states of matter; however, &quot;found&quot; should not mean that water is the only such natural substance that <i>can</i> be in three states at regular Earthly conditions, as its two elements are much more abundant than those of at least ten other molecules that share water&#39;s range but that are often found dissolved in water or shale.

      <p>Water strongly absorbs <!--del_lnk--> infrared radiation. As infrared radiation is next to red-colored light on the <!--del_lnk--> EM spectrum, a small amount of visible red light is absorbed as well. This results in <i>pure</i> water appearing slightly blue when seen in mass quantities such as a lake or ocean. The blue color can easily be seen as one sees the blue color of the sea or a clear lake under an overcast sky, which means that it is not a reflection of the sky. In practice, the colour of water can vary greatly, depending on impurities. <!--del_lnk--> Limestone turns bodies of water turquoise, while <!--del_lnk--> iron compounds turn it red/brown and <!--del_lnk--> copper compounds create an intense blue. <!--del_lnk--> Algae commonly colors water green.<p><a id="Solvation" name="Solvation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Solvation</span></h3>
      <p>Water is a very good <!--del_lnk--> solvent, dissolving many types of substances. The substances that will mix well and dissolve in water (e.g. <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a>) are known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hydrophilic&quot; (water-loving) substances, and those that do not mix well with water (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> fats and oils), are known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hydrophobic&quot; (water-fearing) substances. The ability of a substance to dissolve in water is determined by whether or not the substance can match or better the strong <!--del_lnk--> attractive forces that water molecules generate between themselves. If the ability of a substance to dissolve in water cannot, the molecules are &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pushed out&quot; from amongst the water and do not dissolve.<p><a id="Cohesion_and_adhesion" name="Cohesion_and_adhesion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cohesion and adhesion</span></h3>

      <p>Water sticks to itself (<!--del_lnk--> cohesion) because it is <!--del_lnk--> polar, meaning one end of the molecule has slightly more negative charge than the other, which has slightly more positive charge. In water, this happens because the oxygen atom is more <!--del_lnk--> electronegative&mdash;that is, it has a stronger &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pulling power&quot; on the molecule&#39;s <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a>, drawing them closer (along with their negative charge) and making the area around the oxygen atom more negative than the area around both the hydrogen atoms.<p>Water also has high <!--del_lnk--> adhesion properties because of its polar nature.<p><a id="Surface_tension" name="Surface_tension"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Surface tension</span></h4>

      <p>Water has a high <!--del_lnk--> surface tension caused by the strong cohesion between water molecules. This can be seen when small quantities of water are put onto a nonsoluble surface such as <!--del_lnk--> polythene: the water stays together as drops. On extremely clean/smooth <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> the water may form a thin film because the molecular forces between glass and water molecules (adhesive forces) are stronger than the cohesive forces.<p>In biological cells and <!--del_lnk--> organelles, water is in contact with membrane and protein surfaces that are <!--del_lnk--> hydrophilic; that is, surfaces that have a strong attraction to water. <!--del_lnk--> Irving Langmuir observed a strong repulsive force between hydrophilic surfaces. To dehydrate hydrophilic surfaces&mdash;to remove the strongly held layers of water of hydration&mdash;requires doing substantial work against these forces, called hydration forces. These forces are very large but decrease rapidly over a nanometer or less. Their importance in biology has been extensively studied by <!--del_lnk--> V. Adrian Parsegian of the <!--del_lnk--> National Institute of Health. They are particularly important when cells are dehydrated by exposure to dry atmospheres or to extracellular freezing.&#39;<p><a id="Capillary_action" name="Capillary_action"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Capillary action</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Capillary action refers to the process of water moving up a narrow tube against the force of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>. It occurs because water adheres to the sides of the tube, and then more water is pulled on top of that water through cohesion, which sticks to the sides of the tube. The process is repeated as the water flows up the tube until there is enough water that gravity can counteract the adhesive force.<p><a id="Heat_capacity_and_heat_of_vaporization" name="Heat_capacity_and_heat_of_vaporization"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heat capacity and heat of vaporization</span></h3>
      <p>Water has the second highest <!--del_lnk--> specific heat capacity of any known chemical compound, after <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>, as well as a high <!--del_lnk--> heat of vaporization (40.65 kJ/mol), both of which are a result of the extensive <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen bonding between its molecules. These two unusual properties allow water to moderate Earth&#39;s <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> by buffering large swings in temperature.<p><a id="Freezing_point" name="Freezing_point"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Freezing point</span></h3>
      <p>A simple but environmentally important and unusual property of water is that its common solid form, <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a>, floats on its liquid form. This solid phase is not as dense as liquid water because of the geometry of the strong hydrogen bonds which are formed only at lower temperatures. For almost all other substances and for all other 11 uncommon phases, the solid form is denser than the liquid form. Fresh water at standard atmospheric pressure is most dense at 3.98 &deg;C, and will sink by <!--del_lnk--> convection as it cools to that temperature, and if it becomes colder it will rise instead. This reversal will cause deep water to remain warmer than shallower freezing water, so that ice in a body of water will form first at the surface and progress downward, while the majority of the water underneath will hold a constant 4 &deg;C. This effectively insulates a lake floor from the cold. Almost all other chemicals are denser as solids than they are as liquids and freeze from the bottom up.<p><a id="Triple_point" name="Triple_point"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Triple point</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> triple point of water (the single combination of pressure and temperature at which pure liquid water, ice, and water vapour can coexist in a stable equilibrium) is used to define the <!--del_lnk--> kelvin, the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. As a consequence, water&#39;s triple point temperature is an exact value rather than a measured quantity&nbsp;: 273.16 kelvins (0.01 &deg;C) and a pressure of 611.73 pascals (0.0060373 <!--del_lnk--> atm).<p><a id="Electrical_conductivity" name="Electrical_conductivity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Electrical conductivity</span></h3>
      <p>A common misconception about water is that it is a powerful conductor of <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a>, with risks of <!--del_lnk--> electrocution explaining this popular belief. Any electrical properties observable in water are from the <!--del_lnk--> ions of mineral salts and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> dissolved in it. <!--del_lnk--> Water does self-ionize where two water molecules become one <!--del_lnk--> hydroxide anion and one <!--del_lnk--> hydronium cation, but not enough to carry enough <!--del_lnk--> electric current to do any work or harm for most operations ((In &quot;pure&quot; water, sensitive equipment can detect a very slight electrical <!--del_lnk--> conductivity of 0.055 <!--del_lnk--> &micro;S). Pure water can also be <!--del_lnk--> electrolyzed into oxygen and hydrogen gases but without any dissolved ions; this is a very slow process and thus very little current is conducted.<p><a id="Forms" name="Forms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Forms</span></h3>

This <!--del_lnk--> groundwater later flows back to the surface in <!--del_lnk--> springs, or more spectacularly in <!--del_lnk--> hot springs and <!--del_lnk--> geysers. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in <!--del_lnk--> wells.<p>Water can dissolve many different substances imparting upon it different tastes and odours. In fact, humans and other animals have developed senses to be able to evaluate the drinkability of water: animals generally dislike the taste of <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salty</a> <!--del_lnk--> sea water and the putrid <!--del_lnk--> swamps and favour the purer water of a mountain spring or aquifer. The taste advertised in <!--del_lnk--> spring water or <!--del_lnk--> mineral water derives from the minerals dissolved, while pure H<sub>2</sub>O is tasteless. As such, <!--del_lnk--> purity in spring and mineral water refers to purity from <!--del_lnk--> toxins, <!--del_lnk--> pollutants, and <!--del_lnk--> microbes.<p><a id="Position_of_the_Earth_relating_to_water" name="Position_of_the_Earth_relating_to_water"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Position of the Earth relating to water</span></h2>

      <p>Scientists theorize that most of the universe&#39;s water is produced as a byproduct of <!--del_lnk--> star formation. Gary Melnick, a scientist at the <!--del_lnk--> Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, explains: &quot;For reasons that aren&#39;t entirely understood, when stars are born, their birth is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflowing material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water we observe is rapidly produced in this warm dense gas.&quot; <p>The coexistence of the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of water on Earth is vital to existence of life on Earth. However, if the Earth&#39;s location in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> were even marginally closer to or further from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> (a million miles or so), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.<p>Earth&#39;s mass allows <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> to hold an <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_effect.htm" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were less massive, a thinner atmosphere would cause temperature extremes preventing the accumulation of water except in <a href="../../wp/p/Polar_ice_cap.htm" title="Polar ice cap">polar ice caps</a> (as on <!--del_lnk--> Mars).<p>It has been proposed that life itself may maintain the conditions that have allowed its continued existence. The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through <!--del_lnk--> geologic time despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation (<!--del_lnk--> insolation), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth&#39;s temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> albedo.

      <p>From a <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biological</a> standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a> that set it apart from other substances. It carries out this role by allowing <!--del_lnk--> organic compounds to react in ways that ultimately allows <!--del_lnk--> replication. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a <!--del_lnk--> solvent in which many of the body&#39;s solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many <!--del_lnk--> metabolic processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of anabolism and catabolism. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions)in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. startches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Water is thus essential and central to these metabolic processes.<p>Water is also central to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun&#39;s energy to split off water&#39;s hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize (burn) the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun&#39;s energy and reform water and CO2 in the process (cellular respiration).<p>Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>)to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a <!--del_lnk--> pH (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. <!--del_lnk--> Acids have pH values less than 7 while <!--del_lnk--> bases have values greater than 7. Stomach acid (HCl) is useful to digestion. However, its corrosive effect on the esophagus during reflux can temporarily be neutraled by ingestion of a base such as aluminum hydroxide to produce the neutral molecules water and the salt aluminium chloride. Human biochemistry that involves enzymes usually performs optimally at water&#39;s neutral ph of 7.<p><a id="Aquatic_life_forms" name="Aquatic_life_forms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aquatic life forms</span></h3>

Currently, about 1 billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and <!--del_lnk--> sanitation during the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 G8 Evian summit. Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water supplies and over 1 billion without access to adequate sanitation facilities. Poor water quality and bad sanitation are deadly; some 5 million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water.<p>In the developing world, 90% of all <!--del_lnk--> wastewater still goes untreated into local rivers and streams. Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world&rsquo;s population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles . The strain affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.<p>

      <p>Water plays many critical roles within the field of <!--del_lnk--> food science. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to insure the success of their products.<p>Solutes such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water is affected by solutes. One mole of sucrose (sugar) raises the boiling point of water by 0.52 degrees C, and one mole of salt raises the boiling point by 1.04 degrees while lowering the freezing point of water in a similar way (Vaclacik and Christian, 2003). Solutes in water also affect water activity which affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food (DeMan, 1999). Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water (Vaclacik and Christian, 2003). Solutes in water lower water activity. This is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity (DeMan, 1999). Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food but also the preservation and shelf life of food. Figure 2 shows a slice of moldy bread, an example of microbial growth.<p>Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on the amounts of removable calcium carbonate salt it contains per gallon. Water hardness is measured in grains; 0.064 gm calcium carbonate is equivalent to one grain of hardness (Vaclacik and Christian, 2003). Water is classified as soft if it contains 1 to 4 grains, medium if it contains 5 to 10 grains and hard if it contains 11 to 20 grains (Vaclacik and Christian, 2003). The hardness of water may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. The hardness of water also affects its pH balance which plays a critical role in food processing. For example, hard water prevents successful production of clear beverages. Water hardness also affects sanitation; with increasing hardness, there is a loss of effectiveness for its use as a sanitizer (Vaclacik and Christian, 2003).<p>

      <p>Because of <!--del_lnk--> overpopulation in many regions of the world, <!--del_lnk--> mass consumption, misuse, and <!--del_lnk--> water pollution, the availability of drinking water <!--del_lnk--> per capita is inadequate and shrinking as of the year 2006.

Some have predicted that clean water will become the &quot;next oil&quot;, making <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, with this resource in abundance, possibly the richest country in the world. There is a long history of conflict over water, including efforts to gain access to water, the use of water in wars started for other reasons, and tensions over shortages and control. <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO&#39;s World Water Development Report (WWDR, 2003) from its <!--del_lnk--> World Water Assessment Program indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world&#39;s inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal <!--del_lnk--> hygiene.

      <p>With nearly 2,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> cubic metres (70,000&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) of water per person and per year, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> leads the world in water consumption per capita (a large quantity of <!--del_lnk--> golf fields and <!--del_lnk--> car washing partly explain this massive consumption). In the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (<!--del_lnk--> OECD) countries, the U.S. is first for water consumption, then <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> with 1,600&nbsp;cubic&nbsp;metres (56,000&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) of water per person per year, which is about twice the amount of water used by the average person from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, three times as much as the average <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a>, and almost eight times as much as the average <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Dane</a>. Since 1980, overall water use in Canada has increased by 25.7%. This is five times higher than the overall OECD increase of 4.5%. In contrast, nine OECD nations were able to decrease their overall water use since 1980 (<a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the United States, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the <a href="../../wp/c/Czech_Republic.htm" title="Czech Republic">Czech Republic</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> and Denmark). <p><a id="United_States" name="United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">United States</span></h3>
      <p>Ninety-five percent of the United States&#39; fresh water is underground. One crucial source is a huge underground reservoir, the 1,300-kilometer (800&nbsp;mi) <!--del_lnk--> Ogallala aquifer which stretches from <!--del_lnk--> Texas to <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota and waters one fifth of U.S. irrigated land. Formed over millions of years, the Ogallala aquifer has since been cut off from its original natural sources. It is being depleted at a rate of 12 billion cubic metres (420&nbsp;billion&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) per year, amounting to a total depletion to date of a volume equal to the annual flow of 18 <a href="../../wp/c/Colorado_River.htm" title="Colorado River">Colorado Rivers</a>. Some estimates say it will dry up in as little as 25 years. Many farmers in the <!--del_lnk--> Texas High Plains, which rely particularly on the underground source, are now turning away from <!--del_lnk--> irrigated agriculture as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping.<p><a id="Mexico" name="Mexico"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mexico</span></h3>
      <p>In <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>, an estimated 40% of the city&#39;s water is lost through leaky pipes built at the turn of the 20th century. Many people advise that it is not safe to drink and may cause sickness.<p><a id="Middle_East" name="Middle_East"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle East</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> region has only 1% of the world&#39;s available fresh water, which is shared among 5% of the world&#39;s population. Thus, in this region, water is an important strategic resource. By 2025, it is predicted that the countries of the Arabian peninsula will be using more than double the amount of water naturally available to them. According to a report by the <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_League.htm" title="Arab League">Arab League</a>, two-thirds of Arab countries have less than 1,000&nbsp;cubic meters (35,000&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) of water per person per year available, which is considered the limit.<p><a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, for example, has little water, and <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dams</a> in other countries have reduced its available water over the years. The 1994 <!--del_lnk--> Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace stated that Israel would give 50 million cubic meters of water (1.7&nbsp;billion&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) per year to Jordan, which it refused to do in 1999 before backtracking. The 1994 treaty stated that the two countries would cooperate in order to allow Jordan better access to water resources, notably through dams on the <!--del_lnk--> Yarmouk River. Confronted by this lack of water, Jordan is preparing new techniques to use non-conventional water resources, such as second-hand use of irrigation water and <!--del_lnk--> desalinization techniques, which are very costly and are not yet used. A desalinization project will soon be started in <!--del_lnk--> Hisban, south of <!--del_lnk--> Amman. The <!--del_lnk--> Disi <!--del_lnk--> groundwater project, in the south of Jordan, will cost at least $250 million to bring out water. Along with the <!--del_lnk--> Unity Dam on the Yarmouk River, it is one of Jordan&#39;s largest strategic projects. Born in 1987, the &quot;Unity Dam&quot; would involve both Jordan and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. This &quot;Unity Dam&quot; still has not been implemented because of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>&#39;s opposition, Jordan and Syrian conflictual relations and refusal of world investors. However, Jordan&#39;s reconciliation with Syria following the death of <!--del_lnk--> King Hussein represents the removal of one of the project&#39;s greatest obstacles.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Both <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> and Jordan rely on the <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan_River.htm" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>, but Israel controls it, as well as 90% of the water resources in the region. Water is also an important issue in the <!--del_lnk--> conflict with the Palestinians - indeed, according to former Israeli prime minister <a href="../../wp/a/Ariel_Sharon.htm" title="Ariel Sharon">Ariel Sharon</a> quoted by Abel Darwish in the BBC, it was one of the causes of the <!--del_lnk--> 1967 Six-Day War. In practice the access to water has been a <!--del_lnk--> casus belli for Israel. The <!--del_lnk--> Israeli army prohibits <!--del_lnk--> Palestinians from pumping water, and <!--del_lnk--> settlers use much more advanced pumping equipment. Palestinians complain of a lack of access to water in the region. Israelis in the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> use four times as much water as their Palestinian neighbours. According to the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank, 90% of the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>&#39;s water is used by Israelis . Article 40 of the appendix B of the <!--del_lnk--> September 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1995 <!--del_lnk--> Oslo accords stated that &quot;Israel recognizes Palestinians&#39; rights on water in the West Bank&quot;.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Golan Heights provide 770 million cubic meters (27&nbsp;billion&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>) of water per year to Israel, which represents a third of its annual consumption. The Golan&#39;s water goes to the <a href="../../wp/s/Sea_of_Galilee.htm" title="Sea of Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a>&mdash;Israel&#39;s largest reserve&amp;dash;which is then redistributed throughout the country by the <!--del_lnk--> National Water Carrier. The Golan, which Israel annexed, represents a strategic territory for Israel because of its water resources. . However, the level on the Sea of Galilee has dropped over the years, sparking fears that Israel&#39;s main water reservoir will become salinated. On its northern border, Israel threatened military action in 2002 when <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> opened a new pumping station taking water from a river feeding the Jordan. To help ease the crisis, Israel has agreed to buy water from <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and is investigating the construction of desalination plants.<p><a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> watched with apprehension the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Atat&uuml;rk Dam in Turkey and a projected system of 22 dams on the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> rivers. According to the BBC, the list of &#39;water-scarce&#39; countries in the region grew steadily from three in 1955 to eight in 1990 with another seven expected to be added within 20 years, including three <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> nations (the Nile is shared by nine countries).<p><a id="Asia" name="Asia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Asia</span></h3>

      <p>Drinking water is often collected at <!--del_lnk--> springs, extracted from artificial <!--del_lnk--> borings in the ground, or wells. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources are rainwater and river or lake water. This surface water, however, must be <a href="../../wp/w/Water_purification.htm" title="Water purification">purified</a> for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful <!--del_lnk--> microbes. Popular methods are <!--del_lnk--> filtering with sand which only removes undissolved material, while <!--del_lnk--> chlorination and <!--del_lnk--> boiling kill harmful microbes. <!--del_lnk--> Distillation does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as <!--del_lnk--> reverse osmosis. <!--del_lnk--> Desalination of abundant <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">seawater</a> is a more expensive solution used in coastal <!--del_lnk--> arid <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climates</a>.<p>The distribution of drinking water is done through <!--del_lnk--> municipal water systems or as <!--del_lnk--> bottled water. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge. Others argue that the <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a> mechanism and <!--del_lnk--> free enterprise are best to manage this rare resource and to finance the boring of wells or the construction of dams and <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs.<p>Reducing waste by using drinking water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to conserve fresh water resources. Polluting water may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as <!--del_lnk--> externalities for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms&#39; profits are not redistributed to the local population victim of this pollution. <!--del_lnk--> Pharmaceuticals consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on <!--del_lnk--> aquatic life if they <!--del_lnk--> bioaccumulate and if they are not <!--del_lnk--> biodegradable.<p><a id="Religion.2C_philosophy.2C_and_literature" name="Religion.2C_philosophy.2C_and_literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion, philosophy, and literature</span></h2>

In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in <!--del_lnk--> most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (<i><!--del_lnk--> wudu</i>). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of <i><!--del_lnk--> misogi</i>). Water is mentioned in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> 442 times in the <!--del_lnk--> New International Version and 363 times in the <!--del_lnk--> King James Version: 2 Peter 3:5(b) states, &quot;The earth was formed out of water and by water&quot; (NIV).<p>Some faiths use water especially prepared for religious purposes (<!--del_lnk--> holy water in some Christian denominations, <i><!--del_lnk--> Amrit</i> in Sikhism and Hinduism). Many religions also consider particular sources or bodies of water to be sacred or at least auspicious; examples include <!--del_lnk--> Lourdes in <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism, the <!--del_lnk--> Zamzam Well in Islam and the River <!--del_lnk--> Ganges (among many others) in Hinduism.<p>Water is often believed to have spiritual powers.

Also water is one of the &quot;panch-tatva&quot;s (basic 5 elements, others including <a href="../../wp/f/Fire.htm" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">earth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> space, <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Air">air</a>). Alternatively, gods can be patrons of particular springs, rivers, or lakes: for example in <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Peneus was a river god, one of the three thousand <!--del_lnk--> Oceanids.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> <!--del_lnk--> Empedocles held that water is one of the four <!--del_lnk--> classical elements along with <a href="../../wp/f/Fire.htm" title="Fire">fire</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">earth</a> and <!--del_lnk--> air, and was regarded as the <!--del_lnk--> ylem, or basic substance of the universe.
