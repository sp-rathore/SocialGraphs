<h2>How you can help</h2>
<img src="../../wp/w/WOWLogoPSDV3orange2.jpg" width="200" height="165" alt="World Orphan Week Logo" class="left" /><img src="../../wp/b/Back_Of_WOW_Team_10k.jpg" width="247" height="300" alt="World Orphan Week supporters take part in the the London 10K Run" class="right" /><p>Thank you to everyone who helped make World Orphan Week such a great success last week! People held all kinds of activities to raise money for SOS Children including sponsored walks, auctions, photo exhibitions, badminton tournaments, bring and buy sales and win-a-day-off-work raffles. </p><p>SOS Children also held a number of balloon races at schools around the country - have a look at the photos for <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge_Wow_Balloon_Launch.htm">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Newcastle_Balloon_Launch.htm">Newcastle</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ealing_Wow_Balloon_Launch.htm">Ealing</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Reigate_Wow_Balloon_Launch.htm">Reigate</a>!</p><p>You can still support World Orphan Week, by sending in donations or organising an event - keep reading!</p><p>Want to give it a go?

There are so many different things you can do to raise awareness and funds and we would love to hear from you.</p><img src="../../wp/s/Sponsored.jpg" width="200" height="50" alt="Get sponsored" class="left" /><p>It's easy to get involved in an event or perhaps you could even design your own! And why not get sponsored to do it? We have put together some <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Get_Sponsored.htm">fundraising ideas</a> to get you started and here's a <a href="../../wp/w/WOW_Sponsorship_Form.pdf">sponsorship form</a> for you and your friends to download.</p><img src="../../wp/h/Hold_An_Event.jpg" width="200" height="50" alt="Hold an event" class="left" /><p>Put the WOW factor into your favourite sport and organise a special event! Possible events include tennis tournaments, half marathons, golf days, swimathons, badminton competitions, special cricket matches ... <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Hold_An_Event.htm">the possibilities are endless!</a>.</p><img src="../../wp/i/Involve_Your_School.jpg" width="200" height="50" alt="Involve your school" class="left" /><p>You can involve your school with activities!
