      <p><b>Wrestling</b> is an ancient physical combat sport in which two opponents attempt to control the other through <!--del_lnk--> grappling techniques without the use of <!--del_lnk--> striking. In modern systems, wrestlers score points for various accomplishments including, depending upon the style, takedowns, reversals, escapes and near-falls. Besides winning a match by points, a wrestler can win at any time during a match by turning his opponent to his back, known as a <!--del_lnk--> pin.<p>Wrestling is often categorized as one of the <!--del_lnk--> martial arts; its virile image and usefulness as military training helped generate such multi-cultural evolutions. Some evidence suggests that wrestling may be the oldest sport known to man. A large amount of early artwork, for example, depicts matches between two opponents. One of the most famous wresting matches appears in the book of <!--del_lnk--> Genesis where Jacob wrestles an <!--del_lnk--> angel and is renamed <i><a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a></i> for his struggle, which translates to &quot;Wrestles (or struggles) with God&quot;. Wrestling has evolved into many different styles and forms, ranging from world-wide, commercialised stadium events to less publicized, local amateur competitions.<p>Some sports commentators have observed that wrestling may be the most demanding athletic sport physically and mentally, combining a need for incredible strength, speed, conditioning and the memorizing of at least dozens and sometimes hundreds of offensive and defensive moves. Participants who are competitive in the sport typically train year-round and many lose weight to become even more competitive by participating at lower <!--del_lnk--> weight classes.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA), the governing body of international amateur wrestling, the four main forms of amateur competitive wrestling practiced internationally today are <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman wrestling, <!--del_lnk--> Freestyle wrestling, <!--del_lnk--> Judo and <!--del_lnk--> Sambo. <!--del_lnk--> Staged grappling is commonly called <!--del_lnk--> professional wrestling.<p>

      <p>On the collegiate level, several universities are known for regularly having competitive wrestling teams, including <!--del_lnk--> Iowa State, <!--del_lnk--> Lehigh University, <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania State University, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Iowa, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Nebraska&ndash;Lincoln, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oklahoma, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Minnesota, &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma State University. <i>For a discussion of the style used in American college competition, see <!--del_lnk--> Collegiate wrestling.</i><p><a id="Styles" name="Styles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Styles</span></h2>
      <p>In international competition, wrestling is conducted under either <!--del_lnk--> freestyle or <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman rules. Historically, there are almost as many wrestling styles as there are national traditions. A traditional form of wrestling is called a <b>folk style.</b> <!--del_lnk--> Folk wrestling styles include <!--del_lnk--> Schwingen in <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Glima in <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Shuai jiao in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <!--del_lnk--> B&ouml;ke in Outer and Inner <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Tuvan <!--del_lnk--> Khuresh, <!--del_lnk--> Ssireum in Korea, Native American wrestling, <!--del_lnk--> Pehlwani in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sumo.htm" title="Sumo">Sumo</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Judo in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Ya&#x11F;l&#x131; g&uuml;re&#x15F;, a type of &quot;oiled&quot; wrestling (common in Ancient Mediterranean cultures) still popular in <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.<p>In addition to its sporting nature, wrestling has often been utilized as the basis for popular spectacle, or theatrical drama. Circus and similar shows worldwide have historically included sideshow wrestling matches involving monetary wagers and even people competing against animals (particularly <!--del_lnk--> bears or <a href="../../wp/k/Kangaroo.htm" title="Kangaroo">kangaroos</a>). Such &quot;show wrestling&quot; has continued to this day in <!--del_lnk--> professional wrestling spectaculars choreographed for maximum auditory, visual, and dramatic effects.

      <p>Wrestling has historically been used by militaries as a part of training. Armies in China have used it for several thousand years.<p>The most detailed description of wrestling used in actual warfare comes from the historian Procopius, writing of the Roman versus Persian war in the 6th Century A.D. The following is his remarkable account of two duels between a Roman wrestling teacher and two Persian professional soldiers (<!--del_lnk--> Procopius, <i><!--del_lnk--> History of the Wars</i> I.XIII.29):<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;But one Persian, a young man, riding up very close to the Roman army, began to challenge all of them, calling for whoever wished to do battle with him. And no one of the whole army dared face the danger, except a certain Andreas, one of the personal attendants of Bouzes, not a soldier nor one who had ever practised at all the business of war, but a trainer of youths in charge of a certain wrestling school in Byzantium. Through this it came about that he was following the army, for he cared for the person of Bouzes in the bath; his birthplace was Byzantium. This man alone had the courage, without being ordered by Bouzes or anyone else, to go out of his own accord to meet the man in single combat. And he caught the barbarian while still considering how he should deliver his attack, and hit him with his spear on the right breast. And the Persian did not bear the blow delivered by a man of such exceptional strength, and fell from his horse to the earth. Then Andreas with a small knife slew him like a sacrificial animal as he lay on his back, and a mighty shout was raised both from the city wall and from the Roman army. But the Persians were deeply vexed at the outcome and sent forth another horseman for the same purpose, a manly fellow and well favoured as to bodily size, but not a youth, for some of the hair on his head already shewed grey. This horseman came up along the hostile army, and, brandishing vehemently the whip with which he was accustomed to strike his horse, he summoned to battle whoever among the Romans was willing. And when no one went out against him, Andreas, without attracting the notice of anyone, once more came forth, although he had been forbidden to do so by Hermogenes. So both rushed madly upon each other with their spears, and the weapons, driven against their corselets, were turned aside with mighty force, and the horses, striking together their heads, fell themselves and threw off their riders. And both the two men, falling very close to each other, made great haste to rise to their feet, but the Persian was not able to do this easily because his size was against him, while Andreas, anticipating him (for his practice in the wrestling school gave him this advantage), smote him as he was rising on his knee, and as he fell again to the ground dispatched him. Then a roar went up from the wall and from the Roman army as great, if not greater, than before; and the Persians broke their phalanx and withdrew to Ammodios, while the Romans, raising the p&aelig;an, went inside the fortifications; for already it was growing dark. Thus both armies passed that night.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>The main objectives of wrestling in military training are:<ul>
       <li>Superior balance developed from trying to keep one&#39;s balance while at the same time trying to upset the opponent&#39;s. In war, falling to the ground can quickly make one vulnerable to weapon thrusts, so good balance is a must for warriors.</ul>
