      <p><a id="Original_Khmer_name" name="Original_Khmer_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Original Khmer name</span></h3>
      <p>Saigon was known by its original Khmer inhabitants as <b>Prey Nokor</b> (<a class="image" href="../../images/49/4994.png.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="23" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PreyNokor.png" src="../../images/49/4994.png" width="50" /></a>). Prey Nokor means &quot;forest city&quot; or &quot;forest land&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Khmer (Prey = &quot;forest&quot;; <!--del_lnk--> Nokor = &quot;city, land&quot;, from <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <i>nagara</i>). The name Prey Nokor is still used in Cambodia today, and by the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Krom minority living in the Mekong delta.<p><a id="Traditional_Vietnamese_name" name="Traditional_Vietnamese_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Traditional Vietnamese name</span></h3>
      <p>After Prey Nokor was settled by Vietnamese migrating from the north, it became known as <b>S&agrave;i G&ograve;n</b>. There is much debate about the origins of the Vietnamese name Saigon, the etymology of which is analyzed below.<p>Before <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> colonization, the Vietnamese name of Saigon was <b>Gia &ETH;&#x1ECB;nh</b>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1862, the French discarded this official name and adopted &quot;Sa&iuml;gon&quot;, which had always been popular as S&agrave;i G&ograve;n.<p>From an orthographic point of view, the Vietnamese name S&agrave;i G&ograve;n is written in two syllables, which is the traditional convention in Vietnamese spelling. Some people, however, write the name of the city as S&agrave;iG&ograve;n or S&agrave;ig&ograve;n in order to save space or give it a more westernized look.<p><a id="Vietnamese_etymology" name="Vietnamese_etymology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnamese etymology</span></h4>
      <p>A frequently heard etymology is that S&agrave;i is a Chinese loan word (<a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>: &#x67F4;, pronounced <span class="Unicode">ch&aacute;i</span> in <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin) meaning &quot;firewood, logs, twigs; palisade&quot;, while G&ograve;n is another Chinese loan word (Chinese: &#x68CD;, pronounced g&ugrave;n in Mandarin) meaning &quot;stick, pole, bole&quot;, and whose meaning evolved into &quot;cotton&quot; in Vietnamese (<i>b&ocirc;ng g&ograve;n</i>, literally &quot;cotton stick&quot;, i.e. &quot;cotton plant&quot;, then shortened to <i>g&ograve;n</i>).<p>Some people say that this name originated from the many cotton plants that the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at C&acirc;y Mai temple and the surrounding areas. &hellip;<dl>
       <dd>
        <dl>
         <dd>Tr&#x1B0;&#x1A1;ng V&#x129;nh K&yacute;, &quot;Souvenirs historiques sur Sa&iuml;gon et ses environs&quot;, in <i>Excursions et Reconnaissances</i>, Imprimerie Coloniale, Sa&iuml;gon, 1885.</dl>
      </dl>
      <p>Another explanation is that the etymological meaning &quot;twigs&quot; (S&agrave;i) &amp; &quot;boles&quot; (G&ograve;n) refers to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name Prey Nokor already referred.<p>Chinese people both in Vietnam and in China do not use the name &#x67F4;&#x68CD; (pronounced Chaai-Gwan in <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese and Ch&aacute;ig&ugrave;n in <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin), although etymologically speaking it is the Chinese name from which the Vietnamese name S&agrave;i G&ograve;n is derived (if the theory here is correct). Instead, they call the city &#x897F;&#x8CA2; (pronounced Sai-Gung in Cantonese and <span class="Unicode">X&#x12B;g&ograve;ng</span> in Mandarin), which is a mere phonetic transliteration of the name &quot;Saigon&quot;.<p><a id="Khmer_etymology" name="Khmer_etymology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Khmer etymology</span></h4>
      <p>Another etymology often proposed is that &quot;Saigon&quot; comes from &quot;Sai Con&quot;, which would be the translation of the Khmer words <i>prey kor</i> (<a class="image" href="../../images/49/4995.png.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="23" longdesc="/wiki/Image:PreyKor.png" src="../../images/49/4995.png" width="40" /></a>) meaning &quot;forest of <!--del_lnk--> kapok trees&quot; (<i>prey</i> = forest; <i>kor</i> = kapok tree). The Khmer word <i>prey kor</i> should not be confused with the Khmer name &quot;Prey Nokor&quot; discussed above (<i>kor</i> is a Khmer word meaning &quot;kapok tree&quot;, while <i>nokor</i> is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning &quot;city, land&quot;).<p>This Khmer etymology theory is quite interesting given the Khmer context that existed when the first Vietnamese settlers arrived in the region. However, it fails to completely explain how Khmer &quot;<i>prey</i>&quot; led to Vietnamese &quot;S&agrave;i&quot;, since these two syllables appear phonetically quite distinct.<p><a id="Cantonese_etymology" name="Cantonese_etymology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cantonese etymology</span></h4>
      <p>A less likely etymology was offered by V&#x1B0;&#x1A1;ng H&#x1ED3;ng S&#x1EC3;n, a Vietnamese scholar in the early 20th century, who asserted that <i>S&agrave;i G&ograve;n</i> had its origins in the Cantonese name of <!--del_lnk--> Cholon (Vietnamese: <!--del_lnk--> qu&#x1ED1;c ng&#x1EEF; <span class="Unicode">Ch&#x1EE3; L&#x1EDB;n</span>; <!--del_lnk--> ch&#x1EEF; n&ocirc;m <a class="image" href="../../images/49/4996.png.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="14" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Cholon.png" src="../../images/49/4996.png" width="30" /></a>), the Chinese district of Saigon. The Cantonese (and original) name of Cholon is &quot;Tai-Ngon&quot; (&#x5824;&#x5CB8;), which means &quot;embankment&quot;. The theory posits that &quot;S&agrave;i G&ograve;n&quot; derives from &quot;Tai-Ngon&quot;.<p><a id="Current_Vietnamese_name" name="Current_Vietnamese_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Current Vietnamese name</span></h3>
      <p>On May 1, 1975, after the fall of <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam, the now ruling communist government <!--del_lnk--> renamed the city after the <!--del_lnk--> alias of their leader <a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh.htm" title="Ho Chi Minh">H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh</a>. The official name is now <i>Th&agrave;nh <span class="Unicode">ph&#x1ED1; (meaning city) H&#x1ED3;</span> Ch&iacute; Minh</i>, often abbreviated TPHCM. In English this is translated as <b>Ho Chi Minh City</b>, abbreviated HCMC, and in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> it is translated as <b>H&ocirc; Chi Minh Ville</b> (the <!--del_lnk--> circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. Still, the old name S&agrave;i G&ograve;n/Saigon is widely used by Vietnamese and is found in company names, book titles and sometimes on airport departure boards (the code for <!--del_lnk--> Tan Son Nhat International Airport is SGN).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Ho Chi Minh City began as a small fishing village known as Prey Nokor. The area that the city now occupies was originally <!--del_lnk--> swampland, and was inhabited by <!--del_lnk--> Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1623, King <!--del_lnk--> Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (<!--del_lnk--> 1618-<!--del_lnk--> 1628) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the Trinh-Nguyen civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor, and to set up a custom house at Prey Nokor. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom, weakened because of war with Thailand, could not impede, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1698, <!--del_lnk--> Nguyen Huu Canh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyen rulers of <!--del_lnk--> Hu&#x1EBF; to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large <!--del_lnk--> Vauban citadel called <!--del_lnk--> Gia Dinh has been built, which was later destroyed by the French over <!--del_lnk--> the Battle of Chi Hoa.<p>Conquered by <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1859, the city was influenced by the French during their colonial occupation of Vietnam, and a number of classical western-style buildings in the city reflect this. So much so that Saigon was called &quot;the Pearl of the Far East&quot; (<i>H&ograve;n ng&#x1ECD;c Vi&#x1EC5;n &#x110;&ocirc;ng</i>) or &quot;Paris in the Orient&quot; (<i>Paris Ph&#x1B0;&#x1A1;ng &#x110;&ocirc;ng</i>).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1954, the French were defeated by the Communist <!--del_lnk--> Viet Minh in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of &#x110;i&#x1EC7;n Bi&ecirc;n Ph&#x1EE7;, and withdrew from Vietnam. Rather than recognizing the Communists as the new government, they gave their backing to a government established by Emperor <!--del_lnk--> B&#x1EA3;o &#x110;&#x1EA1;i. B&#x1EA3;o &#x110;&#x1EA1;i had set up Saigon as his capital in <!--del_lnk--> 1950. At that time Saigon and the city of <!--del_lnk--> Cholon (Ch&#x1EE3; L&#x1EDB;n), which was inhabited primarily by Vietnamese Chinese, were combined into one administrative unit, called the Capital of Saigon (<i>&#x110;&ocirc; Th&agrave;nh S&agrave;i G&ograve;n</i> in Vietnamese). When Vietnam was officially partitioned into <!--del_lnk--> North Vietnam (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam) and <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam (the Republic of Vietnam), the southern government, led by President <!--del_lnk--> Ng&ocirc; &#x110;&igrave;nh Di&#x1EC7;m, retained Saigon as its capital.<p>At the conclusion of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1975, the city came under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam People&#39;s Army. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> this event is commonly called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Fall of Saigon,&quot; while in Vietnam it is called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Liberation of Saigon.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia &ETH;&#x1ECB;nh and 2 suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh City in honour of the late communist leader <a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh.htm" title="H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh">H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh</a>. The former name <i>Saigon</i> is still widely used by many Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term <i>Saigon</i> refers only to the urban districts of H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh City. The word &quot;Saigon&quot; can also be found on shop signs all over the country, even in Hanoi. In terms like &quot;Saigon Fashion&quot; or &quot;Saigon Style&quot; the word &quot;Saigon&quot; is employed to connote chicness and modernity.<p>Today, the city&#39;s core is still adorned with wide elegant boulevards and historic French colonial buildings. The most prominent structures in the city centre are <!--del_lnk--> Reunification Hall (<i>Dinh Th&#x1ED1;ng Nh&#x1EA5;t</i>), City Hall (<i>Uy ban Nhan dan</i>), Municipal Theatre (<i>Nha hat Thanh pho</i>), Post Office (<i>Buu dien Thanh pho</i>), Revolutionary Museum (<i>Bao tang Cach mang</i>), State Bank Office (<i>Ngan hang Nha nuoc</i>), People&#39;s Court (<i>Toa an Nhan dan</i>) and Notre Dame Cathedral (<i>Nh&agrave; th&#x1EDD; &#x110;&#x1EE9;c B&agrave;</i>).<p>Ho Chi Minh City is home to a well-established ethnic Chinese population. <!--del_lnk--> Cholon, now known as District 5 and the parts of Districts 6, 10 and 11, serves as its <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown.<p>With a population now exceeding 7 million (registered residents plus migrant workers), Ho Chi Minh City is in need of vast increase in public infrastructure. To meet this need, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centers. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city centre in District 2 and the <!--del_lnk--> Phu My Hung New City Centre in District 7 (as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International (The American School), the Japanese school, Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Taiwan and Korea schools are located).<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>
      <p>Ho Chi Minh City is located at 10&deg;45&#39;N, 106&deg;40&#39;E in the southeastern region of Vietnam, 1,760 km (1,094 miles) south of <a href="../../wp/h/Hanoi.htm" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a>.

      <p>H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh City is a municipality that exists at the same level as <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam&#39;s provinces. As such, it has a similar political structure to its provinces, with a People&#39;s Council of 95 elected deputies, and a People&#39;s Committee of 13 members chosen by the council, being the principal local governmental entities. The <i>People&#39;s Council Chairman</i> is the top governmental official while the <i>People&#39;s Committee Chairman</i> is the top executive of the city, instead of a single <!--del_lnk--> mayor position as in other cities in the world. The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) leads all political-economic-social activities in the country, therefore the <i>CPV HCMC Committee Secretary</i> is really the highest ranking leader of the city.<p>The municipality has been divided into twenty-four administrative divisions since December 2003. Five of these {Area: 1,601 km&sup2;} are designated as <i>suburban districts</i> (&quot;Huy&#x1EC7;n&quot; in Vietnamese), covering the urbanized - farmland around the city which is included in the municipality&#39;s official boundaries. These districts are named Nh&agrave; B&egrave;, C&#x1EA7;n Gi&#x1EDD;, H&oacute;c M&ocirc;n, C&#x1EE7; Chi, and B&igrave;nh Ch&aacute;nh. The remaining nineteen divisions {Area: 494 km&sup2;} are found in the city itself. Only seven of these nineteen <i>inner districts</i> (&quot;Qu&#x1EAD;n&quot; in Vietnamese) have names (T&acirc;n B&igrave;nh, B&igrave;nh Th&#x1EA1;nh, Ph&uacute; Nhu&#x1EAD;n, Th&#x1EE7; D&#x1EE9;c, B&igrave;nh T&acirc;n, T&acirc;n Ph&uacute; and G&ograve; V&#x1EA5;p) - the remainder are simply numbered from one to twelve. Each inner district is sub-divided into many wards (&quot;Ph&#x1B0;&#x1EDD;ng&quot; in Vietnamese), while a suburban district usually consists of many communes and townships (&quot;X&atilde;&quot; and &quot;Th&#x1ECB; tr&#x1EA5;n&quot; in Vietnamese). Since December 2006, Ho Chi Minh City has had 259 wards, 58 communes and 5 townships (see List of HCMC administrative units below).<table border="2" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;">

      <p>The population of Ho Chi Minh City, as of the October 1, 2004 Census, was 6,117,251 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,140,412 residents and 5 suburban districts had 976,839 inhabitants). In the middle of 2005 the city&#39;s population was estimated to be 6,239,938 (of which 19 inner districts had 5,240,516 residents and 5 suburban districts had 999,422 inhabitants), or about 7.4% of the total population of Vietnam; making it the highest population-concentrated city in the country. As an administrative unit, its population is also the largest at the provincal level. As the largest economic and financial hub of Vietnam, HCMC has attracted more and more immigrants from other Vietnamese provinces in recent years; therefore, its population is growing rapidly. From 1999 - 2004, the city population has increased by about 200,000 people per year.<p>The majority of the population are ethnic Vietnamese (<!--del_lnk--> Kinh) at about 90%. Other ethnic minorities include Chinese (<!--del_lnk--> Hoa) with 8%, (the largest Chinese community in Vietnam) and other minorities (Khmer, Cham, Nung, Rhade) 2%. The inhabitants of Ho Chi Minh City are usually known as &quot;Saigonese&quot; in English, &quot;Saigonnais&quot; in French and &quot;d&acirc;n S&agrave;i G&ograve;n&quot; in Vietnamese.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kinh speak Vietnamese with their respective regional accents: Southern (about 50%), Northern (30%) and Central Vietnam (20%). While the <!--del_lnk--> Hoa speak Cantonese, <!--del_lnk--> Teochew (Chaozhou), Fujian, <!--del_lnk--> Hainanese and <!--del_lnk--> Hakka dialects of Chinese; only a few speak standard Mandarin Chinese. A varying degree of English is spoken especially in the tourism and commerce sectors where dealing with foreign nationals is a necessity, so English has become a de facto second language for some Saigonese.<p>According to some researchers the religious breakup in HCMC is as follows: <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (all sects) 50%, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic 12%, <!--del_lnk--> Protestant 2%, others (<!--del_lnk--> Cao Dai, <!--del_lnk--> Hoa Hao, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>) 2%, and no religion or unknown 34%.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>Ho Chi Minh City is the most important economic centre in Vietnam. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, also in construction, building materials and agro-products. Currently, the city has 15 industrial parks (IP) and export-processing zones (EPZ), in addition to the Quang Trung Software Park and the Sai Gon Hi-tech Park (SHTP). There are 171 medium and large scale markets, tens of supermarket chains, dozens of luxury shopping malls and many modern fashion or beauty centers. Over 50 banks with hundreds of branches and about 20 insurance companies are situated inside the city. The first Stock Exchange of Vietnam was opened in the city in 2001.<p>In 2005, the city&#39;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was estimated at USD 11.6 billion, or about USD 1,850 per capita, (up 12.2% on 2004) and accounting for 20% GDP of the country. The GDP calculating Parity Purchasing Power method (PPP), attained USD 56 billion, or about USD 8,900 per capita (approximately 3.5 times higher than the country&#39;s average). The city&#39;s Industrial Product Value was USD 5.6 billion, equivalent to 30% of the whole nation. Export - Import Turnover through HCMC ports took USD 29 billion, or 40% of the national total. Ho Chi Minh City has also contributed about 30% to the national budget&#39;s revenue annually.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Higher education in Ho Chi Minh City is quite developed, concentrating about 50 universities and colleges with a total of over 300,000 students in such places as: Vietnam National University with 35,000 students, the most important university in the Southern Region, consisting of 6 main member schools: The University of Natural Sciences (formerly Saigon College of Sciences); The University of Social Sciences and Humanities (formerly Saigon College of Letters); The University of Polytechnic (formerly Phu Tho National Institute of Technology); The International University, Faculty of Economics and the newly-established University of Information Technology.<p>Some other important higher education establishments include: HCMC University of Pedagogy, University of Economics, University of Architecture, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Law, University of Technical Education, University of Banking, University of Transport, University of Industry, Open University, University of Sports and Physical Education, University of Fine Art, University of Culture and the Conservatory of Music. The <!--del_lnk--> RMIT University with about 2,000 students, the unique foreign-invested higher-education unit in Vietnam at the present, was founded in 2002 by the Royal Melbourne Technology Institute (RMIT) of Australia.<p><a id="Public_Health" name="Public_Health"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Public Health</span></h2>
      <p>The health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 80 publicly owned hospitals or medical centers and dozens of privately owned clinics. These establishments are equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment. The 1,400 bed Ch&#x1EE3; R&#x1EAB;y Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology, are among the top medical facilities in <!--del_lnk--> Indochina. The Hoa Hao Medical Diagnosis Centre (Medic) and FV Hospital have recently attracted many clients, including foreigners, because of their good quality of service and modern equipment. Patients come from cities in nearby provinces and Cambodia as well.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Vietnam Airlines is the national carrier of Vietnam. The airline currently operates a modern fleet of Western-built aircraft, including Airbus 320, 321, Boeing 767, 777 and the 787 in the near future. It operates over 20 domestic routes and to 39 international destinations. Vietnam&#39;s second airline, Pacific Airlines, is using a leased fleet of Boeing 737s and 767s. <!--del_lnk--> Tan Son Nhat International Airport, a joint civilian and military airport, is located 4 mi / 7 km north of the center (District 1) of Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Taxi and bus services are available for travel to and from the airport and within the city. Because of the rapid growing number of air-passengers and Tan Son Nhat Airport&#39;s proximity to the centre of the city, the Vietnamese Government has prepared to build a new international airport near Long Thanh Township, Dong Nai Province about 31 mi / 50 km to the northeast.<p>While most of the city&#39;s 10,000 taxis are metered and usually in good condition, not many drivers can speak English well. Some drivers refuse to use their meters in order to obtain a higher fare. Visitors should exercise vigilance when using motorcycle taxis (xe &ocirc;m) or three-wheeled <!--del_lnk--> cycle rickshaws (x&iacute;ch l&ocirc;), as they may sometimes leave passengers vulnerable.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Generally speaking, Ho Chi Minh city&#39;s road system is not in good condition - some of its streets are riddled with potholes. This is especially true of the city&#39;s numerous back streets and alleyways, which are sometimes little more than dirt paths. Travelling by bus is the only public transport available although the city is seeking financing sources for implementing metro (subway) and elevated train projects, including the <!--del_lnk--> Ho Chi Minh City Metro planned for completion in 2020. Recently, due to the cheap importation of motorcycles, especially from China, the number of motorcycles has increased to about 3 million. There are also over 400,000 automobiles, packing the city&#39;s arterial roads and making traffic congestion and air pollution common problems. If <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> is &quot;the City of Bicycles&quot;, then Ho Chi Minh City may be called &quot;the City of Motorbikes&quot;. Visitors shouldn&#39;t consider the city&#39;s streets as dangerous due to the motorists&#39; general behaviour of dodging pedestrians. In general most people follow traffic rules and enforcement of traffic law is improving. However, drivers can still be seen driving the wrong way up a one way street or ignoring red lights.<p>The city is the main hub of the Trans-Vietnam Railroad. Passengers can travel to <a href="../../wp/h/Hanoi.htm" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> and the Chinese border, about 1,212 mi/1,950 km to the north. There are many harbours along the Saigon and <!--del_lnk--> Dong Nai Rivers, such as: Saigon Port, Newport, Bennghe Port and VICT Port. They account for the annual 40% export-import cargo output of Vietnam.<p>From Saigon, one can travel to many places in Southern Vietnam and to Cambodia by road or waterway. The city is linked to the Central Highlands by National Highways 14 and 20, to the Central Coast and the north by National Highway 1 and to the <!--del_lnk--> Mekong River Delta by National Highways 1 and 50. Two expressways are being built to connect HCMC to <!--del_lnk--> Can Tho, the capital of the Mekong River Delta, and to <!--del_lnk--> Dau Giay Township, <!--del_lnk--> Dong Nai Province, 70 km to the northeast.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City&quot;</div>
