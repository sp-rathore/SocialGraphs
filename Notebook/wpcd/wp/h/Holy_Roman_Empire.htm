      <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Reich</i> (empire) was an <!--del_lnk--> elective monarchy whose <!--del_lnk--> Emperor was crowned by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a> until <!--del_lnk--> 1508. For most of its existence the Empire lacked the central authority of a modern <!--del_lnk--> state and was more akin to a loose religious confederation, divided into numerous territories ruled by hereditary nobles, <!--del_lnk--> prince-bishops, <!--del_lnk--> knightly orders, and <!--del_lnk--> free cities. These rulers (later only a select few of them known as <!--del_lnk--> Electors would elect the Emperor from among their number, although there was a strong tendency for the office of Emperor to become hereditary. The <!--del_lnk--> House of Habsburg, for example, furnished an almost continuous line of Emperors from 1452.<p>The concept of the <i>Reich</i> not only included the government of a specific territory, but had strong Christian religious connotations (hence the <i>holy</i> prefix). The Emperors thought of themselves as continuing the function of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperors in defending, governing and supporting the Church. This viewpoint led to much strife between the Empire and the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">papacy</a> .<p><a id="Composition" name="Composition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Composition</span></h2>
      <p>Most of the Holy Roman Empire&#39;s rulers and subjects were <!--del_lnk--> Germans. All of the Holy Roman Emperors were <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a>. However, many of its most important noble families and appointed officials came from outside the German-speaking communities. Languages spoken in the Empire included the <!--del_lnk--> High and <!--del_lnk--> Low varieties of <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, many <!--del_lnk--> Slavic languages and the precursors to modern <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Italian. Significant numbers of religious minorities, especially <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>, lived within the Empire&#39;s borders at various times, and the Empire was also the birthplace of the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation.<p><a id="Nomenclature" name="Nomenclature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nomenclature</span></h2>

      <p>The Holy Roman Empire was a conscious attempt to resurrect the <a href="../../wp/w/Western_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Western Roman Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>, considered to have ended with the abdication of <!--del_lnk--> Romulus Augustulus in 476. Although <!--del_lnk--> Pope Leo III crowned <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> as <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperator <!--del_lnk--> Augustus</i> on <!--del_lnk--> 25 December <!--del_lnk--> 800, and his son, <!--del_lnk--> Louis the Pious was also crowned as Emperor by the Pope, the Empire and the imperial office did not become formalized for some decades, due largely to the Frankish tendency to divide realms between heirs after a ruler&#39;s death. It is notable that Louis first crowned himself in 814, upon his father&#39;s death, but in 816, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Stephen V , who had succeeded Leo III, visited Rheims and again crowned Louis. By that act, the Emperor strengthened the papacy by recognising the importance of the pope in imperial coronations.<p>

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Czech: <i>Svat&aacute; &#x159;&iacute;&scaron;e &#x159;&iacute;msk&aacute;</i>, later: <i>Svat&aacute; &#x159;&iacute;&scaron;e &#x159;&iacute;msk&aacute; n&aacute;roda n&#x11B;meck&eacute;ho</i><li><a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>: <i>Heilige Roomse Rijk</i>, later <i>Heilige Roomse Rijk der Duitse Natie/Volkeren</i><li><a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>: <i>Saint Empire Romain Germanique</i><li><a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>: <i>Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich</i> [<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x2C8;ha&#x26A;l&#x26A;g&#x259;s &#x2C8;r&oslash;&#x2D0;m&#x26A;&#x283;&#x259;s ra&#x26A;&ccedil;</span>] <span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> <small>listen</small></span>&nbsp; , later <i>Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich deutscher Nation</i> [<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x2C8;ha&#x26A;l&#x26A;g&#x259;s &#x2C8;r&oslash;&#x2D0;m&#x26A;&#x283;&#x259;s ra&#x26A;&ccedil; &#x2C8;d&#x254;&#x26A;t&#x283;&#x250; n&#x251;&#x2C8;&#x2A6;jo&#x2D0;n</span>]<li><!--del_lnk--> Italian: <i>Sacro Romano Impero</i><li><a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>: <i>Sacrum Romanum Imperium</i>, later <i>Sacrum Romanum Imperium Nationis Germanic&aelig;</i> [<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x2C8;sakr&#x28A;m r&#x2D0;o&#x2C8;ma&#x2D0;n&#x28A;m &#x26A;m&#x2C8;p&#x25B;&#x2D0;r&#x26A;&#x28A;m na&#x2A6;&#x26A;&#x2C8;o&#x2D0;n&#x26A;s &#x2A4;&#x25B;r&#x2C8;ma&#x2D0;n&#x26A;&#x2A7;e</span>]<li><!--del_lnk--> Slovene: <i>Sveto rimsko cesarstvo</i>, later <i>Sveto rimsko cesarstvo nem&scaron;ke narodnosti</i><li><!--del_lnk--> Croatian: <i>Sveto Rimsko Carstvo</i></ul>
      <p>Contemporary terminology for the Empire varied greatly over the centuries. The term <i>Roman Empire</i> was used in <!--del_lnk--> 1034 to denote the lands under <!--del_lnk--> Conrad II, and <i>Holy Empire</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1157. The use of the term <i>Roman Emperor</i> to refer to <!--del_lnk--> Northern European rulers started earlier with <!--del_lnk--> Otto II (Emperor 973&ndash;983). Emperors from <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> (c. 742 or 747 &ndash; 814) to <!--del_lnk--> Otto I the Great (Emperor 962&ndash;973) had simply used the phrase <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperator Augustus</i> (&quot;August Emperor&quot;). The precise term <i>Holy Roman Empire</i> dates from <!--del_lnk--> 1254; the final version <i>Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation</i> (<a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> <i>Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich Deutscher Nation</i>) appears in <!--del_lnk--> 1512, after several variations in the late <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>.<p>Contemporaries did not quite know how to describe this entity either. In his famous <!--del_lnk--> 1667 description <i>De statu imperii Germanici</i>, published under the alias Severinus de Monzambano, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Pufendorf wrote: <i>&quot;Nihil ergo aliud restat, quam ut dicamus Germaniam esse irregulare aliquod corpus et monstro simile ...&quot;</i> (&quot;We are therefore left with calling Germany a body that conforms to no rule and resembles a monster&quot;).<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Faust I,</i> in a scene written in <!--del_lnk--> 1775, the German author <!--del_lnk--> Goethe has one of the drinkers in <!--del_lnk--> Auerbach&#39;s Cellar in <!--del_lnk--> Leipzig ask &quot;Our Holy Roman Empire, lads, what still holds it together?&quot; Goethe also has a longer, not very favourable essay about his personal experiences as a trainee at the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichskammergericht</i> in his autobiographical work <i><!--del_lnk--> Dichtung und Wahrheit</i>.<p><a id="Institutions" name="Institutions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Institutions</span></h2>
      <p>From the <!--del_lnk--> High Middle Ages onwards, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reich</i> was stamped by a coexistence of the Empire with the struggle of the <!--del_lnk--> dukes of the local territories to take <!--del_lnk--> power away from it. As opposed to the rulers of the <!--del_lnk--> West <!--del_lnk--> Frankish lands, which later became <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the Emperors never managed to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, Emperors were forced to grant more and more powers to the individual dukes in their respective territories. This process began in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> and was more or less concluded with the <!--del_lnk--> 1648 <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Westphalia. Several attempts were made to reverse this degradation of the <i>Reich&#39;s</i> former glory, but failed.<p>Formally, the <i>Reich</i> comprised the King, to be crowned Emperor by the pope (until 1508), on one side, and the <i>Reichsst&auml;nde</i> (imperial estates) on the other.<p><a id="King_of_the_Romans" name="King_of_the_Romans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">King of the Romans</span></h3>

      <p>Becoming Emperor required becoming <!--del_lnk--> King of the Romans (<i>Rex romanorum</i>/<i>r&ouml;mischer K&ouml;nig</i>) first. Kings had been elected since <!--del_lnk--> time immemorial: in the 9th century by the leaders of the five most important tribes: the <!--del_lnk--> Salian Franks of Lorraine, the <!--del_lnk--> Riparian Franks of Franconia, and the <!--del_lnk--> Saxons, <!--del_lnk--> Bavarians, and <!--del_lnk--> Swabians, later by the main lay and clerical dukes of the kingdom, finally only by the so-called <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kurf&uuml;rsten</i> (electing dukes, electors). This college was formally established by a <!--del_lnk--> 1356 decree known as the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Bull. Initially, there were seven electors: the <!--del_lnk--> Count Palatine of the Rhine, the <!--del_lnk--> King of Bohemia, the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Saxony, the <!--del_lnk--> Margrave of Brandenburg, and the Archbishops of <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ln, <!--del_lnk--> Mainz, and <!--del_lnk--> Trier. During the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War, the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Bavaria was given the right to vote as the eighth elector. In order to be elected king, a candidate had to first win over the electors, usually with bribes or promises of land.<p>Until <!--del_lnk--> 1508, the newly-elected king then travelled to Rome to be crowned Emperor by the Pope. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was in quarrel with the Pope himself.<p>At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders: after the late <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Reichstag</i> established itself as the legislative body of the Empire, a complicated assembly that convened irregularly at the request of the Emperor at varying locations. Only after <!--del_lnk--> 1663 would the <i>Reichstag</i> become a permanent assembly.<p><a id="Imperial_estates" name="Imperial_estates"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial estates</span></h3>
      <p>An entity was considered <i>Reichsstand</i> (imperial estate) if, according to <!--del_lnk--> feudal law, it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. They included:<ul>
       <li>Territories governed by a prince or duke, and in some cases kings. (Rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, with the exception of the King of Bohemia (an elector), were not allowed to become King within the Empire, but some had kingdoms outside the Empire, as was, for instance, the case in the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain, where the ruler was also the <!--del_lnk--> Prince-elector of <!--del_lnk--> Hanover.)<li>Feudal territories led by a clerical dignitary, who was then considered a <!--del_lnk--> prince of the church. In the common case of a <!--del_lnk--> Prince-Bishop, this temporal territory (called prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped his -often larger- <!--del_lnk--> ecclesiastical diocese (<!--del_lnk--> bishopric), giving the Bishop both worldly and clerical powers. An example, among many others, was the <!--del_lnk--> Bishopric of Osnabr&uuml;ck. The most prominent Prince-Bishop (<i>F&uuml;rstbischof</i>) within the Holy Roman Empire were the three Archbishops who were generally styled after the worldy rank of <!--del_lnk--> Prince-elector, and their prince-archbishoprics rather electorates: Cologne (his large temporal estates did not include his cathedral city, so Bonn became his princely residence), Trier and the <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Mainz with his <!--del_lnk--> Holy See at <!--del_lnk--> Mainz Cathedral.<li><!--del_lnk--> Imperial Free Cities</ul>
      <p>The number of territories was amazingly large, rising to several hundred at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Westphalia. Many of these comprised no more than a few square miles, so the Empire is aptly described as a &quot;patchwork carpet&quot; (<i>Flickenteppich</i>) by many- see <!--del_lnk--> Kleinstaaterei. For a list as in 1792, see <!--del_lnk--> List of Reichstag participants (1792).<p><a id="Reichstag" name="Reichstag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reichstag</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Reichstag was the legislative body of the Holy Roman Empire. It was divided into three distinct classes:<ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Electors, which included the <!--del_lnk--> Electors of the Holy Roman Empire.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Princes, which included both laypersons and clerics. <ul>
         <li>The Secular Bench: Princes (those with the title of <!--del_lnk--> Prince, <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duke, <!--del_lnk--> Duke, <!--del_lnk--> Count Palatine, <!--del_lnk--> Margrave, or <!--del_lnk--> Landgrave) held individual votes; some held more than one vote on the basis of ruling several territories. Also, the Council included <!--del_lnk--> Counts or <!--del_lnk--> Grafs, who were grouped into four Colleges: <!--del_lnk--> Wetterau, <!--del_lnk--> Swabia, <!--del_lnk--> Franconia, and <!--del_lnk--> Westphalia. Each College could cast one vote as a whole.<li>The Ecclesiastical Bench: Bishops, certain Abbots, and the two Grand Masters of the <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Order and the <!--del_lnk--> Order of St John had individual votes. Certain other Abbots were grouped into two Colleges: Swabia and the Rhine. Each College held one collective vote.</ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Imperial Cities, which included representatives from Imperial Cities grouped into two Colleges: Swabia and the Rhine. Each College had one collective vote. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal to the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Reichstag had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as in <!--del_lnk--> 1648 with the <!--del_lnk--> peace of Westphalia ending the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War.</ul>
      <p><a id="Imperial_courts" name="Imperial_courts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial courts</span></h3>
      <p>The <i>Reich</i> also had two courts: the <i>Reichshofrat</i> (also known in English as the <!--del_lnk--> Aulic Council) at the court of the King/Emperor (that is, later in <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>), and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Reichskammergericht</i> (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Reform of <!--del_lnk--> 1495.<p><a id="Imperial_circles" name="Imperial_circles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial circles</span></h3>
      <p>As part of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichsreform</i>, six <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Circles were established in <!--del_lnk--> 1500 and extended to ten in <!--del_lnk--> 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defence, imperial taxation, supervising of coining, peace keeping functions and public security.

      <p>The Holy Roman Empire is usually considered to have been founded at the latest in <!--del_lnk--> 962 by <!--del_lnk--> Otto I the Great.<p>Although some date the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire from the coronation of <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> as Emperor of the Romans in <!--del_lnk--> 800, Charlemagne himself more typically used the title king of the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>. This title also makes clearer that the Frankish Kingdom covered an area that included modern-day <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and was thus the kernel of both countries.<p>Most historians therefore consider the establishment of the Empire to be a process that started with the split of the Frankish realm in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Verdun in <!--del_lnk--> 843, continuing the <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian dynasty independently in all three sections. The eastern part fell to <!--del_lnk--> Louis the German, who was followed by several leaders until the death of <!--del_lnk--> Louis the Child, the last Carolingian in the eastern part.<p>The leaders of Alamannia, Bavaria, Frankia and Saxonia elected <!--del_lnk--> Conrad I of the Franks, not a Carolingian, as their leader in <!--del_lnk--> 911. His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Henry (Heinrich) I the Fowler (r. 919&ndash;936), a Saxon elected at the Reichstag of <!--del_lnk--> Fritzlar in 919, achieved the acceptance of a separate Eastern Empire by the <!--del_lnk--> West Frankish (still ruled by the Carolingians) in 921, calling himself <i>rex Francorum orientalum</i> (King of the East Franks). He founded the <!--del_lnk--> Ottonian dynasty.<p>Heinrich designated his son Otto to be his successor, who was elected King in <a href="../../wp/a/Aachen.htm" title="Aachen">Aachen</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 936. A marriage alliance with the widowed queen of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> gave Otto control over that nation as well. His later crowning as Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Otto I (later called &quot;the Great&quot;) in <!--del_lnk--> 962 would mark an important step, since from then on the Empire &ndash; and not the West-Frankish kingdom that was the other remainder of the Frankish kingdoms &ndash; would have the blessing of the Pope. Otto had gained much of his power earlier, when, in <!--del_lnk--> 955, the <!--del_lnk--> Magyars were defeated in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lechfeld.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In contemporary and later writings, the crowning would be referred to as <i><!--del_lnk--> translatio imperii</i>, the transfer of the Empire from the Romans to a new Empire. The German Emperors thus thought of themselves as being in direct succession of those of the Roman Empire; this is why they initially called themselves <i>Augustus.</i> Still, they did not call themselves &quot;Roman&quot; Emperors at first, probably in order not to provoke conflict with the Roman Emperor who still existed in <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople. The term <i>imperator Romanorum</i> only became common under <!--del_lnk--> Conrad II later.<p>At this time, the eastern kingdom was not &quot;German&quot; but a &quot;confederation&quot; of the old Germanic tribes of the Bavarians, Alamanns, Franks and Saxons. The Empire as a political union probably only survived because of the strong personal influence of King Henry the Saxon and his son, Otto. Although formally elected by the leaders of the Germanic tribes, they were actually able to designate their successors.<p>This changed after <!--del_lnk--> Henry II died in <!--del_lnk--> 1024 without any children. <!--del_lnk--> Conrad II, first of the <!--del_lnk--> Salian Dynasty, was then elected king in <!--del_lnk--> 1024 only after some debate. How exactly the king was chosen thus seems to be a complicated conglomeration of personal influence, tribal quarrels, inheritance, and acclamation by those leaders that would eventually become the collegiate of <!--del_lnk--> Electors.<p>Already at this time the dualism between the &quot;territories&quot;, then those of the old tribes rooted in the Frankish lands, and the King/Emperor, became apparent. Each king preferred to spend most time in his own homelands; the Saxons, for example, spent much time in palatinates around the <!--del_lnk--> Harz mountains, among them <!--del_lnk--> Goslar. This practice had only changed under <!--del_lnk--> Otto III (king 983, Emperor 996&ndash;1002), who began to utilize bishopries all over the Empire as temporary seats of government. Also, his successors, <!--del_lnk--> Henry II, <!--del_lnk--> Conrad II, and <!--del_lnk--> Henry III, apparently managed to appoint the dukes of the territories. It is thus no coincidence that at this time, the terminology changes and the first occurrences of a <i>regnum Teutonicum</i> are found.<p>The glory of the Empire almost collapsed in the <!--del_lnk--> Investiture Controversy, in which <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory VII declared a ban on King <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV (king 1056, Emperor 1084&ndash;1106). Although this was taken back after the <!--del_lnk--> 1077 <!--del_lnk--> Walk to Canossa, the ban had wide-reaching consequences. Meanwhile, the German dukes had elected a second king, <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf of Swabia, whom Henry IV could only defeat after a three-year war in <!--del_lnk--> 1080. The mythical roots of the Empire were permanently damaged; the German king was humiliated. Most importantly though, the church became an independent player in the political system of the Empire.<p><a id="Under_the_Hohenstaufen" name="Under_the_Hohenstaufen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Under the Hohenstaufen</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Conrad III came to the throne in <!--del_lnk--> 1138, being the first of the <!--del_lnk--> Hohenstaufen dynasty, which was about to restore the glory of the Empire even under the new conditions of the <!--del_lnk--> 1122 <!--del_lnk--> Concordat of Worms. It was <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (king 1152, Emperor 1155&ndash;1190) who first called the Empire &quot;holy&quot;, with which he intended to address mainly law and legislation.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>Also, under Barbarossa, the idea of the &quot;Romanness&quot; of the Empire culminated again, which seemed to be an attempt to justify the Emperor&#39;s power independently of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in <!--del_lnk--> 1158 explicitly reclaimed imperial rights at the advice of <i>quattuor doctores</i> of the emerging judicial facility of the University of <a href="../../wp/b/Bologna.htm" title="Bologna">Bologna</a>, citing phrases such as <i>princeps legibus solutus</i> (&quot;the emperor [princeps] is not bound by law&quot;) from the <i>Digestae</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> Corpus Juris Civilis. That the Roman laws were created for an entirely different system and didn&#39;t fit the structure of the Empire was obviously secondary; the point here was that the court of the Emperor made an attempt to establish a <i>legal</i> constitution.<p>Imperial rights had been referred to as <i>regalia</i> since the Investiture Controversy, but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia as well. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture, the seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act; north of the Alps, the system was also now connected to <!--del_lnk--> feudal law, a change most visible in the withdrawal of the feuds of <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Lion in 1180 which led to his public banning. Barbarossa thus managed for a time to more closely bind the stubborn Germanic dukes to the Empire as a whole.<p>Another important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace <i>(Landfrieden)</i> for all of the Empire, an attempt to (on the one hand) abolish private vendettas not only between the many local dukes, but on the other hand a means to tie the Emperor&#39;s subordinates to a legal system of jurisdiction and public prosecution of criminal acts &ndash; a predecessor concept of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> rule of law&quot;, in modern terms, that was, at this time, not yet universally accepted.<p>In order to solve the problem that the emperor was (after the Investiture Controversy) no longer as able to use the church as a mechanism to maintain power, the Staufer increasingly lent land to <i>ministerialia</i>, formerly unfree service men, which Frederick hoped would be more reliable than local dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later <!--del_lnk--> knights, another basis of imperial power.<p>Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities, both by the emperor and the local dukes. These were partly due to the explosion in population, but also to concentrate economic power at strategic locations, while formerly cities only existed in the shape of either old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include <!--del_lnk--> Freiburg, possibly the economic model for many later cities, and <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>.<p>The later reign of the last Staufer Emperor, <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_II%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick II</a>, was in many ways different from that of earlier Emperors. Still a child, he first reigned in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, while in Germany, Barbarossa&#39;s second son <!--del_lnk--> Philip of Swabia and Henry the Lion&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Otto IV competed with him for the title of King of the Germans. After finally having been crowned emperor in <!--del_lnk--> 1220, he risked conflict with the pope when he claimed power over Rome; astonishingly to many, he managed to claim Jerusalem in a <!--del_lnk--> Crusade in <!--del_lnk--> 1228 while still under the pope&#39;s ban.<p>While Frederick brought the mythical idea of the Empire to a last highpoint, he was also the one to initiate the major steps that led to its disintegration. On the one hand, he concentrated on establishing an &ndash; for the times &ndash; extraordinarily modern state in Sicily, with public services, finances, and jurisdiction. On the other hand, Frederick was the emperor who granted major powers to the German dukes in two far-reaching privileges that would never be reclaimed by the central power. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1220 <i><!--del_lnk--> Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis</i>, Frederick basically gave up a number of <i>regalia</i> in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, jurisdiction and fortification. The <!--del_lnk--> 1232 <i><!--del_lnk--> Statutum in favorem principum</i> mostly extended these privileges to the other (non-clerical) territories (Frederick II was forced to give those privileges by a rebellion of his son, Henry). Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German dukes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick wanted to concentrate on his homelands in Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called <i>domini terrae</i>, owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Knights were invited to <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> by the duke of <!--del_lnk--> Masovia <!--del_lnk--> Konrad of Masovia to Christianize the <!--del_lnk--> Prussians in <!--del_lnk--> 1226.<p>During the long stays of the <!--del_lnk--> Hohenstaufen emperors (1138-1254) in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the German princes became stronger and began a successful, mostly peaceful colonisation of West Slavic lands, so that the empire&#39;s influence increased to eventually include <!--del_lnk--> Pomerania and <!--del_lnk--> Silesia<p><a id="Rise_of_the_territories_after_the_Staufen" name="Rise_of_the_territories_after_the_Staufen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of the territories after the Staufen</span></h3>
      <p>After the death of Frederick II in <!--del_lnk--> 1250, none of the dynasties worthy of producing the king proved able to do so, and the leading dukes elected several competing kings. The time from <!--del_lnk--> 1246 (beginning with the election of <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Raspe and <!--del_lnk--> William of Holland) to <!--del_lnk--> 1273, when <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph I of Habsburg was elected king, is commonly referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Interregnum. During the Interregnum, much of what was left of imperial authority was lost, as the princes were given time to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In 1257, there occurred a double election which produced a situation that guaranteed a long interregnum. William of Holland had fallen the previous year, and Conrad of Swabia had died three years earlier. First, three electors (<!--del_lnk--> Palatinate, <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mainz) (being mostly of the Guelph persuasion) cast their votes for <!--del_lnk--> Richard of Cornwall who became the successor of William of Holland as king. After a delay, a fourth elector, <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia, joined this choice. However, a couple of months later, Bohemia and the three other electors <!--del_lnk--> Trier, <!--del_lnk--> Brandenburg and <!--del_lnk--> Saxony voted for <!--del_lnk--> Alfonso X of Castile, this being based on <!--del_lnk--> Ghibelline party. The realm now had two kings. Was the King of Bohemia entitled to change his vote, or was the election complete when four electors had chosen a king? Were the four electors together entitled to depose Richard a couple of months later, if his election had been valid?<p>The difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of electors, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kurf&uuml;rsten</i>, whose composition and procedures were set forth in the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Bull of 1356. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between <i>Kaiser und Reich</i>, emperor and realm, which were no longer considered identical. This is also revealed in the way the post-Staufen kings attempted to sustain their power. Earlier, the Empire&#39;s strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire&#39;s own lands, the so-called <i>Reichsgut,</i> which always belonged to the respective king (and included many Imperial Cities). After the 13th century, its relevance faded (even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire&#39;s end in 1806). Instead, the <i>Reichsgut</i> was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire but, more frequently, to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to <!--del_lnk--> civilize stubborn dukes. The direct governance of the <i>Reichsgut</i> no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.<p>Instead, the kings, beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph I of Habsburg, increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the <i>Reichsgut</i>, which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were comparably compact and thus easier to control. In <!--del_lnk--> 1282, Rudolph I thus lent Austria and <!--del_lnk--> Styria to his own sons.<p>With <!--del_lnk--> Henry VII, the <!--del_lnk--> House of Luxembourg entered the stage. In 1312, he was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (<i>Hausmacht</i>): <!--del_lnk--> Louis IV of <!--del_lnk--> Wittelsbach (king 1314, emperor 1328&ndash;1347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; <!--del_lnk--> Charles IV of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. Interestingly, it was thus increasingly in the king&#39;s own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.<p>The 13th century also saw a general structural change in how land was administered. Instead of personal duties, <a href="../../wp/m/Money.htm" title="Money">money</a> increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute for their lands. The concept of &quot;property&quot; more and more replaced more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: Whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. It is important to note, however, that jurisdiction at this time did not include legislation, which virtually did not exist until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.<p>It is during this time that the territories began to transform themselves into predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were most identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, <i>e.g.</i> Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.<p><a id="Imperial_Reform" name="Imperial_Reform"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial Reform</span></h3>

      <p>The &quot;constitution&quot; of the Empire was still largely unsettled at the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Bull of <!--del_lnk--> 1356, the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat fatal that <!--del_lnk--> Sigismund of Luxemburg (king 1410, emperor 1433&ndash;1437) and <!--del_lnk--> Frederick III of Habsburg (king 1440, emperor 1452&ndash;1493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the <i>Hoftag</i>, the assembly of the realm&#39;s leading men, deteriorated. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichstag</i> as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist yet. Even worse, dukes often went into feuds against each other that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.<p>At the same time, the church was in crisis too. The conflict between several competing popes was only resolved at the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Constance (<!--del_lnk--> 1414&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1418); after <!--del_lnk--> 1419, much energy was spent on fighting the <!--del_lnk--> heresy of the <!--del_lnk--> Hussites. The medieval idea of a unified <!--del_lnk--> Corpus christianum, of which the papacy and the Empire were the leading institutions, began to decline.<p>With these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier <i>Landfrieden</i> was urgently called for. During this time, the concept of &quot;reform&quot; emerges, in the original sense of the Latin verb <i>re-formare</i>, to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> Frederick III needed the dukes to finance war against Hungary in 1486 and at the same time had his son, later <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian I elected king, he was presented with the dukes&#39; united demand to participate in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called <i>Reichstag</i> (to be joined by the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Free Cities later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliant son finally convoked the <i>Reichstag</i> at <!--del_lnk--> Worms in <!--del_lnk--> 1495, after his father&#39;s death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Reichsreform</i> (Imperial Reform): a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire back some structure. Among others, this act produced the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Circle Estates and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichskammergericht,</i> (Imperial Chamber Court); structures that would &ndash; to a degree &ndash; persist until the end of the Empire in 1806.<p>However, it should take a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted and the new court began to actually function; only in <!--del_lnk--> 1512 would the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Circles be finalized. The King also made sure that his own court, the <i>Reichshofrat</i>, continued to function in parallel to the <i>Reichskammergericht</i>. It is interesting to note that in this year, the Empire also receives its new title, the <i>Heiliges R&ouml;misches Reich Deutscher Nation</i> (&quot;Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation&quot;).<p><a id="Crisis_after_Reformation" name="Crisis_after_Reformation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Crisis after Reformation</span></h3>
      <p>In 1517, <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> initiated what would later be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation. At this time, many local dukes saw a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_V%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V</a>. The empire became then fatally divided along religious lines, with the North, the East, and many of the major cities&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Strassburg, <a href="../../wp/f/Frankfurt.htm" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg&mdash;became <!--del_lnk--> Protestant while the southern and western regions largely remained <!--del_lnk--> Catholic. Religious conflicts were waged in various parts of Europe for a century, though in German regions there was relative quiet from the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Augsburg in 1555 until the <!--del_lnk--> Defenestration of Prague in 1618. When Bohemians rebelled against the emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War (1618&ndash;1648), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but they also seized considerable chunks of territory for themselves. The long conflict bled the Empire to such a degree that it would never recover its former strength.<p><a id="The_long_decline" name="The_long_decline"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The long decline</span></h3>

      <p>The actual end of the empire came in several steps. After the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Westphalia in <!--del_lnk--> 1648, which gave the territories almost complete <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty, even allowing them to form independent alliances with other states, the Empire was only a mere conglomeration of largely independent states. By the rise of <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a> of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the Holy Roman Empire as such had lost all power and clout in major European politics. The <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg emperors relied more on their role as Austrian archdukes than as emperors when challenged by <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, portions of which were part of the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts. From 1792 onwards, <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary France was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently. The Empire was formally dissolved on <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1806 when the last Holy Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Francis II (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French Army under <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Pressburg). Napoleon reorganized much of the empire into the <!--del_lnk--> Confederation of the Rhine. This ended the so-called <!--del_lnk--> First Reich. Francis II&#39;s family continued to be called Austrian emperors until <!--del_lnk--> 1918. In fact, the Habsburg Emperors of Austria, however nostalgically and sentimentally, considered themselves, as the lawful heirs of the Holy Roman monarchs, to be themselves the final continuation of the Holy Roman Imperial line, their dynasty dying out with the ousting of <!--del_lnk--> Karl I in 1918 (reigned 1916-1918). Germany itself would not become one unified state until <!--del_lnk--> 1871 after the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War. In addition, at the time of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the First World War, it was argued that <a href="../../wp/l/Liechtenstein.htm" title="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a> as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire (supposedly still incarnated in Liechtensteiner eyes at an abstract level in the person of the then-destitutued Austro-Hungarian Emperor, despite its formal dissolution in 1806) was no longer bound to Austria, then emerging as an independent monarchy which did not consider itself as the legal successor to the Empire. Liechtenstein is thus the last independent state in Europe which can claim an element of continuity from the Holy Roman Empire.<p><a id="Analysis" name="Analysis"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Analysis</span></h2>
      <p>It has been said that modern history of Germany was primarily predetermined by three factors: the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reich</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, and the later dualism between <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Prussia. Many attempts have been made to explain why the <i>Reich</i> never managed to gain a strong centralized power over the territories, as opposed to neighbouring France. Some reasons include:<ul>
       <li>The <i>Reich</i> had been a very federal body from the beginning: again, as opposed to France, which had mostly been part of the Roman Empire, in the eastern parts of the Frankish kingdom, the Germanic tribes later comprising the German nation (<!--del_lnk--> Saxons, <!--del_lnk--> Thuringians, <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bavarians, <!--del_lnk--> Alamanni or <!--del_lnk--> Swabians) were much more independent and reluctant to cede power to a central authority. All attempts to make the kingdom hereditary failed; instead, the king was always elected. Later, every candidate for the king had to make promises to his electorate, the so-called <i>Wahlkapitulationen</i> (election capitulations), thus granting the territories more and more power over the centuries.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Due to its religious connotations, the <i>Reich</i> as an institution was severely damaged by the contest between the Pope and the German Kings over their respective coronations as Emperor. It was never entirely clear under which conditions the pope would crown the emperor and especially whether the worldly power of the emperor was dependent on the clerical power of the pope. Much debate occurred over this, especially during the 11th century, eventually leading to the <!--del_lnk--> Investiture Controversy and the <!--del_lnk--> Concordat of Worms in <!--del_lnk--> 1122.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Whether the <!--del_lnk--> feudal system of the <i>Reich</i>, where the King formally was the top of the so-called &quot;feudal pyramid&quot;, was a cause of or a symptom of the Empire&#39;s weakness is unclear. In any case, military obedience, which &ndash; according to Germanic tradition &ndash; was closely tied to the giving of land to tributaries, was always a problem: when the <i>Reich</i> had to go to war, decisions were slow and brittle.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Until the sixteenth century, the economic interests of the south and west diverged from those of the north where the <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic League operated. The Hanseatic League was far more closely allied to Scandinavia and the Baltic than the rest of Germany.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>German historiography nowadays often views the Holy Roman Empire as a well balanced system of organizing a multitude of (effectively independent) states under a complex system of legal regulations. Smaller estates like the Lordships or the Imperial Free cities survived for centuries as independent entities, although they had no effective military strength. The supreme courts, the <!--del_lnk--> Reichshofrat and the <!--del_lnk--> Reichskammergericht helped to settle conflicts, or at least keep them as wars of words rather than shooting wars.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The multitude of different territories with different religious denominations and different forms of government led to a great variety of cultural diversification, which can be felt even in present day Germany with regional cultures, patterns of behaviour and dialects changing sometimes within the range of kilometres.</ul>

      <p>After the unification of Germany as a <!--del_lnk--> nation state in <!--del_lnk--> 1871 (see <!--del_lnk--> German Empire), the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was also known as the Old <!--del_lnk--> Empire (First Reich) while the new empire was known as the New Empire, second Empire, or <!--del_lnk--> Second Reich.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire&quot;</div>
