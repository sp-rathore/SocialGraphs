In the process, its geographical extent became considerable so as to affect at one time or another most of the Asian continent. The history of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is also characterized by the development of numerous movements and schisms, foremost among them the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada, <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na and <!--del_lnk--> Vajrayana traditions, punctuated by contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.<p>

      <p>According to the Buddhist tradition, the historical Buddha <a href="../../wp/g/Gautama_Buddha.htm" title="Gautama Buddha">Siddharta Gautama</a> was born to the <!--del_lnk--> Shakya clan, at the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Magadha period (546&ndash;324 BCE), in the plains of <!--del_lnk--> Lumbini, Southern <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>. He is also known as the <i>Shakyamuni</i> (literally &quot;The sage of the Shakya clan&quot;).<p>After an early life of luxury under the protection of his father, &#x15A;uddhodana, the ruler of Kapilavastu (later to be incorporated into the state of <!--del_lnk--> Magadha), Siddharta entered into contact with the realities of the world and concluded that real life was about inescapable suffering and sorrow. Siddharta renounced his meaningless life of luxury to become an <!--del_lnk--> ascetic. He ultimately decided that asceticism was also meaningless, and instead chose a <!--del_lnk--> middle way, a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.<p>Under a <!--del_lnk--> fig tree, now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bodhi tree, he vowed never to leave the position until he found <!--del_lnk--> Truth. At the age of 35, he attained <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment. He was then known as Gautama Buddha, or simply &quot;The Buddha&quot;, which means &quot;the enlightened one&quot;.<p>For the remaining 45 years of his life, he travelled the <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic Plain of central <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> (region of the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges/Ganga river</a> and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine and discipline to an extremely diverse range of people.<p>The Buddha&#39;s reluctance to name a successor or to formalise his doctrine led to the emergence of many movements during the next 400 years: first the schools of <!--del_lnk--> Nikaya Buddhism, of which only <!--del_lnk--> Theravada remains today, and then the formation of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana, a pan-Buddhist movement based on the acceptance of new scriptures.<p><a id="Early_Buddhism" name="Early_Buddhism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early Buddhism</span></h2>
      <p>Before the royal sponsorship of <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE, Buddhism seems to have remained a relatively minor phenomenon, and the historicity of its formative events is poorly established. Two formative councils are supposed to have taken place, although our knowledge of them is based on much later accounts. The councils tend to explain the formalization of the Buddhist doctrine, and the various subsequent <!--del_lnk--> schisms inside the Buddhist movement.<p><a name="1st_Buddhist_council_.285th_c._BCE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1st Buddhist council (5th c.

      <p>The first Buddhist council was held soon after the death of the Buddha under the patronage of king <!--del_lnk--> Ajatasatru of the <!--del_lnk--> Magadha empire, and presided by a monk named <!--del_lnk--> Mahakasyapa, at Rajagriha (today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Rajgir). The objective of the council was to record the Buddha&#39;s sayings (<!--del_lnk--> sutra) and codify monastic rules (<a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a>): <!--del_lnk--> Ananda, one of the Buddha&#39;s main disciples and his cousin, was called upon to recite the discourses of the Buddha, and Upali, another disciple, recited the rules of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a>. These became the basis of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>, which has been the orthodox text of reference throughout the history of Buddhism.<p><a name="2nd_Buddhist_council_.28383_BCE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2nd Buddhist council (383 BCE)</span></h3>

      <p>The second Buddhist council was convened by King Kalasoka and held at Vaisali, following conflicts between the traditional schools of Buddhism and a more liberal interpretational movement called the <!--del_lnk--> Mahasanghikas. The traditional schools considered the Buddha as a human being who reached enlightenment, which could be most easily attained by monks following the monastic rules and practicing the teaching for the sake of overcoming suffering and attaining <!--del_lnk--> Arahantship. The secessionist Mahasangikas, however, tended to consider this approach too individualistic and selfish. They considered the objective of becoming an arhat insufficient, and instead proposed that the only true goal was to reach full buddhahood, in a sense opening the way to future <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na thought. They became proponents of more relaxed monastic rules, which could appeal to a large majority of monastic and lay people (hence their name the &quot;great&quot; or &quot;majority&quot; assembly).<p>The council ended with the rejection of the Mahasanghikas. They left the council and maintained themselves for several centuries in northwestern India and Central Asia according to <!--del_lnk--> Kharoshti inscriptions found near the <!--del_lnk--> Oxus and dated c. 1st century CE.<p><a id="Ashokan_proselytism_.28c._261_BCE.29" name="Ashokan_proselytism_.28c._261_BCE.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ashokan proselytism (c. 261 BCE)</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka the Great (273&ndash;232 BCE) converted to Buddhism after his bloody conquest of the territory of Kalinga (today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Orissa) in <!--del_lnk--> eastern India. Regretful of the horrors brought by the conflict, the king decided to renounce violence, and propagate the faith by building <!--del_lnk--> stupas and pillars urging for the respect of all animal life, and enjoining people to follow the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma. He also built roads, hospitals, resthouses, <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">universities</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> systems around the country. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics or <!--del_lnk--> caste.<p>This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the plates and pillars left by Ashoka (the <!--del_lnk--> Edicts of Ashoka), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far as the Greek kingdoms in the West, in particular the neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.<p><a name="3rd_Buddhist_council_.28c.250_BCE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">3rd Buddhist council (c.250 BCE)</span></h3>

      <p>King <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BCE at Pataliputra (today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Patna). It was held by the monk Moggaliputta. The objective of the council was to reconcile the different schools of Buddhism, to purify the Buddhist movement, particularly from opportunistic factions which had been attracted by the royal patronage, and to organize the dispatch of Buddhist missionaries throughout the known world.<p>The Pali canon (<a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Tipitaka">Tipitaka</a>, or <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a> in Sanskrit, literally the &quot;Three Baskets&quot;), which comprises the texts of reference of traditional Buddhism and is considered to be directly transmitted from the Buddha, was formalized at that time. It consists of the doctrine (the Sutra Pitaka), the monastic discipline (<a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">Vinaya</a> Pitaka) and an additional new body of subtle philosophy (the <!--del_lnk--> Abhidharma Pitaka).<p>The efforts of Ashoka to purify the Buddhist faith also had the effect of segregating against other emerging movements. In particular, after 250 BCE, the <!--del_lnk--> Sarvastivadin (who had been rejected by the 3rd council, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada tradition) and the <!--del_lnk--> Dharmaguptaka schools became quite influential in northwestern India and Central Asia, up to the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire in the first centuries of the common era. The Dharmaguptakas were characterized by a belief that Buddha was separate, and above, the rest of the Buddhist community. The Sarvastivadin believed that past, present, and future are all simultaneous.<p><a id="Hellenistic_world" name="Hellenistic_world"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hellenistic world</span></h3>
      <p>Some of the <!--del_lnk--> Edicts of Ashoka inscriptions describe the efforts made by Ashoka to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The Edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and location of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist proselytism: <!--del_lnk--> Antiochus II Theos of the <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Kingdom (261&ndash;246 BCE), <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy II Philadelphos of Egypt (285&ndash;247 BCE), <!--del_lnk--> Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia (276&ndash;239 BCE), <!--del_lnk--> Magas of Cyrene (288&ndash;258 BCE), and <!--del_lnk--> Alexander II of Epirus (272&ndash;255 BCE).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Ashoka also issued Edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of &quot;Piety&quot; (using the Greek term <!--del_lnk--> Eusebeia for <!--del_lnk--> Dharma) to the Greek community:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (Greek:<i>&epsilon;&#x1F50;&sigma;&#x3AD;&beta;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Eusebeia) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world.&quot;<dd>(Trans. from the Greek original by G.P. Carratelli)</dl>
      <p>It is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but some authors have commented that some level of <!--del_lnk--> syncretism between Hellenist thought and Buddhism may have started in Hellenic lands at that time. They have pointed to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria (mentioned by <!--del_lnk--> Clement of Alexandria), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the <!--del_lnk--> Therapeutae (possibly a deformation of the Pali word &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Theravada&quot;), who may have &quot;almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism&quot; (Robert Lissen).<p>Buddhist gravestones from the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic period have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel (Tarn, &quot;The Greeks in Bactria and India&quot;). Commenting on the presence of Buddhists in Alexandria, some scholars have even pointed out that &ldquo;It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established&rdquo; (Robert Linssen &quot;Zen living&quot;).<p>In the 2nd century CE, the Christian dogmatist <!--del_lnk--> Clement of Alexandria recognized Bactrian Buddhists (<!--del_lnk--> Sramanas) and Indian <!--del_lnk--> Gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations.

      <p><a id="The_Two_Fourth_Councils" name="The_Two_Fourth_Councils"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Two Fourth Councils</span></h3>
      <dl>

      </dl>
      <p>A Fourth Council is said to have been convened in the reign of the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Kanishka, around <!--del_lnk--> 100 CE at Jalandhar or in Kashmir. Because Therevada believes the The Fourth Council of Kashmir introduced unauthentic sutras as authentic, and it was itself not present at this Fourth Council to prevent this, Therav&#x101;da Buddhism does not recognize the authenticity of this council, and sometimes they call it the &ldquo;council of heretical monks&rdquo;. Theravada Buddhism had its own Fourth Council in Sri Lanka. Therefore there are two Fourth Councils: one in Sri Lanka (Theravada), and one in Kashmir (Sarvastivadin).<p>It is said that for the Fourth Council of Kashmir, <!--del_lnk--> Kanishka gathered 500 monks headed by <!--del_lnk--> Vasumitra, partly, it seems, to compile extensive commentaries on the Abhidharma, although it is possible that some editorial work was carried out upon the existing canon itself. The main fruit of this Council was the redaction of Agamas and complilation of the vast commentary known as the <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;-Vibh&#x101;sh&#x101; (&quot;Great Exegesis&quot;), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;din Abhidharma.<p>Scholars believe that it was also around this time that a significant change was made in the language of the Sarv&#x101;stiv&#x101;din canon, by converting an earlier <!--del_lnk--> Prakrit version into <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the official holy language of <!--del_lnk--> Brahmanism in India, and was also being used by other thinkers (regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance), thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices. For this reason, all major (Mahayana) Buddhist scholars in India thereafter wrote their commentaries and treatises in Sanskrit. Therevada however never switched to Sanskrit, partly because Buddha explicitly forbade translation of his discourses into Sanskrit because it was an elitist religious language (like <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> was in Europe before). He wanted his monks to use a local language instead; a language which could be understood by all. Over time however, the language of the Theravadin scriptures (<!--del_lnk--> Pali) became a scholarly or elitist language as well.<p><a id="Asian_expansion" name="Asian_expansion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Asian expansion</span></h3>
      <p>In the areas east of the Indian subcontinent (today&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>), Indian culture strongly influenced the <!--del_lnk--> Mons. The Mons are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200 BCE under the proselytizing of the Indian king <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka, before the fission between <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana and <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana Buddhism. Early Mon Buddhist temples, such as Peikthano in central Burma, have been dated between the 1st and the 5th century CE.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhist_art.htm" title="Buddhist art">Buddhist art</a> of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in South-East Asia following the expansion of the Mon kingdom between the 5th and 8th centuries. The Theravada faith expanded in the northern parts of Southeast Asia under Mon influence, until it was progressively displaced by Mahayana Buddhism from around the 6th century CE.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> was allegedly proselytized by Ashoka&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Mahinda and six companions during the 2nd century BCE.

The <a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a> was put in writing in Sri Lanka during the reign of king Vittagamani (r. 29&ndash;17 BCE), and the Theravada tradition flourished there, harbouring some great commentators such as <!--del_lnk--> Buddhaghosa (4th&ndash;5th century). Although <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism gained some influence at that time, Theravada ultimately prevailed, and Sri Lanka turned out to be the last stronghold of <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism, from where it would expand again to South-East Asia from the 11th century.<p>There is also a legend, not directly validated by the edicts, that Ashoka sent a missionary to the north, through the Himalayas, to <!--del_lnk--> Khotan in the <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, then the land of the <!--del_lnk--> Tocharians, speakers of an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European language.<p><a id="Rise_of_the_Sunga_.282nd.E2.80.931st_c.BCE.29" name="Rise_of_the_Sunga_.282nd.E2.80.931st_c.BCE.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of the Sunga (2nd&ndash;1st c.BCE)</span></h2>

After deposing King <!--del_lnk--> Brhadrata (last of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan rulers), military commander-in-chief <!--del_lnk--> Pusyamitra Sunga took the throne. An orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Brahmin, Sunga was allegedly hostile towards Buddhists and allegedly persecuted the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist faith</a>. He is recorded as having &quot;destroyed monasteries and killed Monks&quot; (Divyavadana, pp. 429&ndash;434): 84,000 Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> stupas which had been built by Ashoka were &quot;destroyed&quot; (R. Thaper), and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk (Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p. 81 ff cited in Hars.407). A large number of Buddhist monasteries (<!--del_lnk--> viharas) were said to have been converted to <!--del_lnk--> Hindu temples, in such places as <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda, <!--del_lnk--> Bodhgaya, <!--del_lnk--> Sarnath, or <!--del_lnk--> Mathura.<p>During the period, Buddhist monks deserted the <!--del_lnk--> Ganges valley, following either the Northern road (Uttarapatha) or the Southern road (Daksinapatha).

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian king <!--del_lnk--> Demetrius I invaded India in 180 BCE as far as <!--del_lnk--> Pataliputra, establishing an <a href="../../wp/i/Indo-Greek_Kingdom.htm" title="Indo-Greek Kingdom">Indo-Greek kingdom</a> that was to last in various part of northern India until the end of the 1st century BCE. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan empire, and to protect the Buddhist faith from the alleged religious persecutions of the <!--del_lnk--> Sungas (185&ndash;73 BCE).<p>One of the most famous Indo-Greek kings is <!--del_lnk--> Menander (reigned c. 160&ndash;135 BCE). He apparently converted to Buddhism and is presented in the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana tradition as one of the great benefactors of the faith, on a par with king <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka or the later Kushan king <!--del_lnk--> Kanishka. Menander&#39;s coins bear the mention &quot;Saviour king&quot; in Greek, and sometimes designs of the eight-spoked wheel. Direct cultural exchange is also suggested by the dialogue of the <!--del_lnk--> Milinda Panha between <!--del_lnk--> Menander and the monk <!--del_lnk--> Nagasena around 160 BCE. Upon his death, the honour of sharing his remains was claimed by the cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in <!--del_lnk--> stupas, in a parallel with the historic <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Plutarch, Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6). Several of Menander&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Greek successors inscribed the mention &quot;Follower of the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Kharoshthi script on their coins, and depicted themselves or their divinities forming the <i>vitarka</i> <!--del_lnk--> mudra.<p>The interaction between Greek and Buddhist cultures may have had some influence on the evolution of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana, as the faith developed its sophisticated philosophical approach and a man-god treatment of the Buddha somewhat reminiscent of Hellenic gods. It is also around that time that the first <!--del_lnk--> anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha are found, often in realistic <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist style: &quot;One might regard the classical influence as including the general idea of representing a man-god in this purely human form, which was of course well familiar in the West, and it is very likely that the example of westerner&#39;s treatment of their gods was indeed an important factor in the innovation&quot; (Boardman, &quot;The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity&quot; ).<p><a id="Rise_of_Mahayana_.281st_c.BCE.E2.80.932nd_c.CE.29" name="Rise_of_Mahayana_.281st_c.BCE.E2.80.932nd_c.CE.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of Mahayana (1st c.BCE&ndash;2nd c.CE)</span></h2>
      <p>The rise of Mahayana Buddhism from the 1st century BCE was accompanied by complex political changes in northwestern India. The <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Greek kingdoms were gradually overwhelmed, and their culture assimilated by the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Scythians, and then the <!--del_lnk--> Yuezhi, who founded the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire from around 12 BCE.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Kushans were supportive of Buddhism, and a fourth Buddhist council was convened by the <!--del_lnk--> Kushan emperor <!--del_lnk--> Kanishka, around 100 CE at Jalandhar or in Kashmir, and is usually associated with the formal rise of <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism and its secession from Theravada Buddhism. <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism does not recognize the authenticity of this council, and it is sometimes called the &quot;council of heretical monks&quot;.<p>It is said that Kanishka gathered 500 <!--del_lnk--> bhikkhus in Kashmir, headed by Vasumitra, to edit the <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a> and make references and remarks. Allegedly, during the council there were all together three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. This council did not rely on the original <!--del_lnk--> Pali canon (the <a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Tipitaka">Tipitaka</a>). Instead, a set of new scriptures was approved, as well as fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine.

(In modern day West Bengal.) <!--del_lnk--> Xuanzang compliments the patronage of <!--del_lnk--> Harshavardana during the same period. After <!--del_lnk--> Harshavardanas kingdom, the rise of many small kingdoms that lead to the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Rajputs across the gangetic plains and marked the end of Buddhist ruling clans along with a sharp decline in royal patronage until a revival under the <!--del_lnk--> Pala Empire in the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal region. Here Mahayana Buddhism flourished and spread to <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> between the 8th and the 12th century before the Palas collapsed under the assault of the Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Sena dynasty. The Palas created many temples and a distinctive school of Buddhist art. <!--del_lnk--> Xuanzang noted in his travels that in various regions <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> was giving way to <!--del_lnk--> Jainism and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>.<!--del_lnk-->  By the 10th century Buddhism had experienced a sharp decline beyond the Pala realms in Bengal under a resurgent Hinduism and the incorporation in <!--del_lnk--> Vaishnavite Hinduism of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> as the 9th incarnation of <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu.<!--del_lnk--> <p>A milestone in the decline of Indian Buddhism in the North occurred in 1193 when <!--del_lnk--> Turkic Islamic raiders under <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Khilji burnt Nalanda.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Central Asia had been influenced by Buddhism probably almost since the time of the Buddha. According to a legend preserved in <!--del_lnk--> Pali, the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada canon, two merchant brothers from Bactria, named Tapassu and Bhallika, visited the Buddha and became his disciples. They then returned to Bactria and built temples to the Buddha (Foltz).<p>Central Asia long played the role of a meeting place between <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Persia. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the <!--del_lnk--> Former Han to the west brought them into contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms. Thereafter, the expansion of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> to the north led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oases of Central Asia. Some <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between east and west.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Hinayana traditions first spread among the <!--del_lnk--> Turkic tribes before combining with the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, eastern and coastal <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>.

Among the first of these Turkic tribes to adopt Buddhism was the Turki-<!--del_lnk--> Shahi who adopted Buddhism as early as the 3rd century BCE. It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrians, <!--del_lnk--> Hindus, <!--del_lnk--> Nestorian Christians, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Manichaeans, and followers of <!--del_lnk--> shamanism, <!--del_lnk--> Tengrism, and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief.<p>Various <!--del_lnk--> Nikaya schools persisted in Central Asia and China until around the 7th century CE. Mahayana started to become dominant during the period, but since the faith had not developed a Nikaya approach, <!--del_lnk--> Sarvastivadin and <!--del_lnk--> Dharmaguptakas remained the Vinayas of choice in Central Asian monasteries.<p>Various Buddhism kingdoms rose and prospered in both the Central Asian region and downwards into the Indian sub-continent such as <!--del_lnk--> Kushan Empire prior to the <!--del_lnk--> White Hun invasion in the 5th century where under the King Mihirkula they were heavily persecuted.<p>Buddhism in Central Asia started to decline with the expansion of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and the destruction of many stupas in war from the 7th century.

      <p>The eastern part of central Asia (<!--del_lnk--> Chinese Turkestan, <!--del_lnk--> Tarim Basin, <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang) has revealed extremely rich Buddhist works of art (wall paintings and reliefs in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. <!--del_lnk--> Serindian art is highly reminiscent of the Gandharan style, and scriptures in the Gandhari script <!--del_lnk--> Kharosthi have been found.<p>Central Asians seem to have played a key role in the transmission of Buddhism to the East.

      <p>Buddhism flourished during the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Tang Dynasty (618&ndash;907). The dynasty was initially characterized by a strong openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India from the 4th to the 11th century. The Tang capital of <!--del_lnk--> Chang&#39;an (today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Xi&#39;an) became an important centre for Buddhist thought. From there Buddhism spread to <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, and Japanese embassies of Kentoshi helped gain footholds in Japan.<p>However foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang Dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor <!--del_lnk--> Wu-Tsung outlawed all &quot;foreign&quot; religions (including Christian <!--del_lnk--> Nestorianism, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism, and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>) in order to support the indigenous <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>. Throughout his territory, he confiscated Buddhist possessions, destroyed monasteries and temples, and executed Buddhist monks, ending Buddhism&#39;s cultural and intellectual dominance.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pure Land and <!--del_lnk--> Chan Buddhism, however, continued to prosper for some centuries, the latter giving rise to Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Zen. In China, Chan flourished particularly under the <!--del_lnk--> Song dynasty (1127&ndash;1279), when its monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.<p>Today, China boasts one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts and heritages in the world. <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <!--del_lnk--> World Heritage Sites such as the <!--del_lnk--> Mogao Caves near <!--del_lnk--> Dunhuang in <!--del_lnk--> Gansu province, the <!--del_lnk--> Longmen Grottoes near <!--del_lnk--> Luoyang in <!--del_lnk--> Henan province, the <!--del_lnk--> Yungang Grottoes near <!--del_lnk--> Datong in <!--del_lnk--> Shanxi province, and the <!--del_lnk--> Dazu Rock Carvings near <!--del_lnk--> Chongqing are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The <!--del_lnk--> Leshan Giant Buddha, carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during <!--del_lnk--> Tang Dynasty and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.<p><a id="Korea" name="Korea"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a></span></h4>

      <p>Buddhism was introduced around 372 CE, when Chinese ambassadors visited the Korean kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Goguryeo, bringing scriptures and images. Buddhism prospered in Korea, and in particular Seon (<!--del_lnk--> Zen) Buddhism from the 7th century onward. However, with the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Confucean Yi Dynasty of the <!--del_lnk--> Joseon period in 1392, Buddhism was strongly discriminated against until it was almost completely eradicated, except for a remaining Seon movement.<p><a id="Japan" name="Japan"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a></span></h4>

      <p>Japan discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when Korean monks traveled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century.<p>Being geographically at the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road, Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.<p>From 710 CE numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of <!--del_lnk--> Nara, such as the five-story <!--del_lnk--> pagoda and Golden Hall of the <!--del_lnk--> Horyuji, or the <!--del_lnk--> Kofuku-ji temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th century during the periods of <!--del_lnk--> Nara, <!--del_lnk--> Heian, and <!--del_lnk--> Kamakura.<p>From the 12th and 13th, a further development was <!--del_lnk--> Zen art, following the introduction of the faith by <!--del_lnk--> Dogen and <!--del_lnk--> Eisai upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as <!--del_lnk--> sumi-e and the <!--del_lnk--> Enso) and poetry (especially <!--del_lnk--> haikus), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned &quot;non-dualistic&quot; representations. The search for enlightenment &quot;in the moment&quot; also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the <!--del_lnk--> Chanoyu tea ceremony or the <!--del_lnk--> Ikebana art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques (<!--del_lnk--> martial arts).<p>Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved and regularly restored.<p><a id="South-East_Asia" name="South-East_Asia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">South-East Asia</span></h3>

      <p>During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise in the Middle-East of the <!--del_lnk--> Parthian empire, an unvanquished enemy of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the Mediterranean and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connection, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>, central and southern <!--del_lnk--> Siam, lower <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> and southern <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.<p>For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The <!--del_lnk--> Pali and <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> languages and the Indian script, together with <!--del_lnk--> Theravada and <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmanism, and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the <a href="../../wp/r/Ramayana.htm" title="Ramayana">Ramayana</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Mahabharata.htm" title="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>.<p>From the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The main Buddhist influence now came directly by sea from the Indian subcontinent, so that these empires essentially followed the Mahayana faith. The <!--del_lnk--> Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the <!--del_lnk--> Bodhisattvas.<p><a id="Vietnam" name="Vietnam"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnam</span></h4>

      <p>Vajray&#x101;na Buddhism, also called <!--del_lnk--> Tantric Buddhism, first emerged in eastern India between the 5th and 7th centuries CE. It is sometimes considered a sub-school of Mahayana and sometimes a third major &quot;vehicle&quot; (<i>Yana</i>) of Buddhism in its own right. The Vajrayana is an extension of Mahayana Buddhism in that it does not offer new philosophical perspectives, but rather introduces additional techniques (upaya, or &#39;skilful means&#39;), including the use of visualizations and other yogic practices. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are also derived from <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> (the usage of <!--del_lnk--> mantras, <!--del_lnk--> yoga, or the burning of sacrificial offerings). This school of thought was founded by the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmin <!--del_lnk--> Padmasambhava.<p>Early Vajrayana practitioners were forest-dwelling <!--del_lnk--> mahasiddas who lived on the margins of society, but by the 9th century Vajrayana had won acceptance at major Mahayana monastic universities such as <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda and <!--del_lnk--> Vikramshila. Along with much of the rest of Indian Buddhism, the Vajrayana was eclipsed in the wake of the late 12th century Muslim invasions. It has persisted in Tibet, where it was wholly transplanted from the 7th to 12th centuries and became the dominant form of Buddhism to the present day, and on a limited basis in Japan as well where it evolved into <!--del_lnk--> Shingon Buddhism.<p><a id="Theravada_Renaissance_.2811th_century_CE.E2.80.94_.29" name="Theravada_Renaissance_.2811th_century_CE.E2.80.94_.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theravada Renaissance (11th century CE&mdash; )</span></h2>

      <p>From the 11th century, the destruction of Buddhism in the Indian mainland by Islamic invasions led to the decline of the Mahayana faith in South-East Asia. Continental routes through the Indian subcontinent being compromised, direct sea routes between the <!--del_lnk--> Middle-East through <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> developed, leading to the adoption of the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism of the <!--del_lnk--> Pali canon, introduced to the region around the 11th century CE from <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.<p>King <!--del_lnk--> Anawrahta (1044&ndash;1077); the historical founder of the <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burmese</a> empire, unified the country and adopted the Theravada Buddhist faith. This initiated the creation of thousands of Buddhist temples at <!--del_lnk--> Pagan, the capital, between the 11th and 13th century. Around 2,000 of them are still standing. The power of the Burmese waned with the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Thai, and with the seizure of the capital Pagan by the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols in 1287, but Theravada Buddhism remained the main Burmese faith to this day.<p>The Theravada faith was also adopted by the newly founded ethnic <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thai</a> kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Sukhothai around 1260. Theravada Buddhism was further reinforced during the <!--del_lnk--> Ayutthaya period (14th&ndash;18th century), becoming an integral part of the Thai society.<p>In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> in the 13th century. However, from the 14th century, on the coastal fringes and in the islands of South-East Asia, the influence of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> proved stronger, expanding into <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and most of the islands as far as the southern <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.<p>However, since 1966 with <!--del_lnk--> Soeharto&#39;s rise of power in the aftermath of the bloody events after the so called &quot;September 30th, 1965 murders&quot;, allegedly executed by the Communists Party, there has been a remarkable renaissance of Buddhism in Indonesia. This is partly due to the Soeharto&#39;s New Order&#39;s requirements for the people of <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> to adopt one of the five official religions: <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Protestantism, <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism, <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.

      <p>After the Classical encounters between Buddhism and the West recorded in Greco-Buddhist art, information and legends about Buddhism seem to have reached the West sporadically. During the 8th century, Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> Jataka stories were translated into <!--del_lnk--> Syriac and <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> as <!--del_lnk--> Kalilag and Damnag. An account of Buddha&#39;s life was translated in to <!--del_lnk--> Greek by <!--del_lnk--> John of Damascus, and widely circulated to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> as the story of <!--del_lnk--> Barlaam and <!--del_lnk--> Josaphat. By the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">1300s</a> this story of <!--del_lnk--> Josaphat had become so popular that he was made a <!--del_lnk--> Catholic saint.<p>The next direct encounter between Europeans and Buddhism happened in Medieval times when the <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan friar <!--del_lnk--> William of Rubruck was sent on an embassy to the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol court of <!--del_lnk--> Mongke by the French king <!--del_lnk--> Saint Louis in 1253. The contact happened in Cailac (today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Qayaliq in <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>), and William originally thought they were wayward Christians (Foltz, &quot;Religions of the Silk Road&quot;).<p>Major interest for Buddhism emerged during colonial times, when Western powers were in a position to witness the faith and its artistic manifestations in detail. European philosophy was strongly influenced by the study of oriental religions during that period.<p>The opening of <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in 1853 also created a considerable interest for the arts and culture of Japan, and provided access to one of the most thriving Buddhist cultures in the world.<p>Buddhism started to enjoy a strong interest from the general population in the West during the 20th century, following the perceived failure of social utopias, from <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">Fascism</a> to <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a>. After the Second World War, the focus of progress tended to shift to personal self-realization, on the material as well as spiritual plane.<p>In this context, Buddhism has been displaying a strong power of attraction, due to its tolerance, its lack of deist authority and determinism, and its focus on understanding reality through self inquiry. According to the latest census it is now the fastest growing religion in Britain.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Buddhism&quot;</div>
