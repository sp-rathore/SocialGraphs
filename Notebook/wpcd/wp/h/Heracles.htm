      <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, <b>Heracles</b> or <b>Herakles</b> (&quot;glory of <!--del_lnk--> Hera&quot;, or <b>Alcides</b>, original name) &quot;<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F2D;p&alpha;</span> + <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&kappa;&lambda;&#x3AD;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F29;p&alpha;&kappa;&lambda;&#x1FC6;&sigmaf;</span>)&quot; was a <!--del_lnk--> divine hero, the son of <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Alcmene, stepson of <!--del_lnk--> Amphitryon and great-grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Perseus. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, a paragon of masculinity, the ancestor of <!--del_lnk--> royal clans and a champion of the <!--del_lnk--> Olympian order against <!--del_lnk--> chthonic monsters. In <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> modern <!--del_lnk--> West, he is known as <!--del_lnk--> Hercules, with whom the later <!--del_lnk--> Roman Emperors, in particular <!--del_lnk--> Commodus and <!--del_lnk--> Maximinus, often identified themselves. The Romans adopted the Greek version of his life and works essentially unchanged, but added anecdotal detail of their own, some of it linking the hero with the geography of the Central Mediterranean. Details of <!--del_lnk--> cult were adapted to Rome as well.<p>Extraordinary strength, <!--del_lnk--> courage, ingenuity, and sexual prowess with both males and females were among his characteristic attributes. Although he was not as clever as the likes of <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Nestor, Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice, such as when laboring for King <!--del_lnk--> Augeias, wrestling the giant <!--del_lnk--> Antaeus, or tricking <!--del_lnk--> Atlas into taking the sky back onto his shoulders. Together with <!--del_lnk--> Hermes he was the patron and protector of <!--del_lnk--> gymnasia and <!--del_lnk--> palaestrae. His iconographic attributes are the <!--del_lnk--> lion skin and the <!--del_lnk--> club. These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children. By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have &quot;made the world safe for mankind&quot; and to be its benefactor.<p>

      <p>Many popular stories were told of his life, the most famous being <!--del_lnk--> The Twelve Labours of Heracles; Alexandrian poets of the Hellenistic age drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere. His figure, which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion-fight, was known everywhere: his <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan equivalent was <b>Hercle</b>, a son of <!--del_lnk--> Tinia and <!--del_lnk--> Uni.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The greatest of Hellenic <!--del_lnk--> chthonic heroes, yet unlike other Greek heroes, in that no tomb of Heracles was identified, Heracles was both hero and god, as <!--del_lnk--> Pindar says <i>heroes theos</i>; at the same festival sacrifice was made to him, first as a hero, with a chthonic <!--del_lnk--> libation, and then as a god, upon an altar: thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> demi-god&quot;. The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of <!--del_lnk--> shamanistic crossings into the netherworld.<p><a id="Christian_dating" name="Christian_dating"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Christian dating</span></h3>
      <p>In Christian circles a <!--del_lnk--> Euhemerist reading of the widespread Heracles/Hercules cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death, Thus <!--del_lnk--> Eusebius, <i>Preparation of the Gospel</i> (10.12), <!--del_lnk--> Clement could offer historical dates for Hercules as a king in Argos: &quot;from the reign of Hercules in <!--del_lnk--> Argos to the <!--del_lnk--> deification of Hercules himself and of <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius there are comprised thirty-eight years, according to <!--del_lnk--> Apollodorus the chronicler: and from that point to the deification of <!--del_lnk--> Castor and Pollux fifty-three years: and somewhere about this time was the capture of <!--del_lnk--> Troy.&quot;<p>Christian readers with a literalist bent have asserted from this remark that, since Heracles ruled over <!--del_lnk--> Tiryns in Argos at the same time that <!--del_lnk--> Eurystheus ruled over <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae, and since at about this time <!--del_lnk--> Linus was Heracles&#39; teacher, one can conclude based on <!--del_lnk--> Jerome&#39;s date&mdash; in his universal history, his <i>Chronicon</i>&mdash; for Linus&#39; notoriety in teaching Heracles in <!--del_lnk--> 1264 BC that Heracles&#39; death and deification occurred 38 years later in approximately 1226 BC.<p><a id="Cult_of_Heracles" name="Cult_of_Heracles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cult of Heracles</span></h3>
      <p>The ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Herakleia</i>, which commemorated the death of Heracles, on the second day of the month of Metageitnion (which would fall in late July or early August).

      <p>A major factor in the well-known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the <!--del_lnk--> goddess <!--del_lnk--> Hera, wife of <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, had for him. A full account of Heracles must render it clear why Heracles was so tormented by Hera, when there are many illegitimate offspring sired by Zeus. Heracles was the fruit of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman <!--del_lnk--> Alcmene. <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> made love to her after disguising himself as her husband, <!--del_lnk--> Amphitryon, home early from war (Amphitryon did return later the same night, and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time, a case of <!--del_lnk--> superfecundation, where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers). Thus, Heracles&#39;s very existence proved at least one of Zeus&#39;s many illicit affairs, and Hera often conspired against Zeus&#39;s mortal offspring, as revenge for her husband&#39;s infidelities.<p>On the night the twins sharing the same mother were to be born, Hera, knowing of her husband Zeus&#39;s adultery, persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of <!--del_lnk--> Perseus would be High King. Once the oath was sworn, Hera hurried to Alcmene&#39;s dwelling and slowed the birth by sitting crosslegged with her clothing tied in knots. Meanwhile, she caused another boy <!--del_lnk--> Eurystheus to be born prematurely, making him High King in place of Heracles. She would have permanently delayed Heracles&#39;s birth had she not been foiled by <!--del_lnk--> Galanthis, her servant, who lied to her that she had already delivered the baby. Upon hearing this Hera jumped in surprise, therefore untying the knots and finally allowing <!--del_lnk--> Alcmene to give birth. The child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents; it was only later on that he became known as Heracles.<p>One of the boys, <!--del_lnk--> Iphicles, was Amphitryon&#39;s son and a <!--del_lnk--> mortal, while the other was the <!--del_lnk--> demi-god Heracles. Heracles was named in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera. A few months after he was born, Hera sent two serpents to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttled a snake in each hand and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were child&#39;s toys.<p><a id="Youth" name="Youth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Youth</span></h3>
      <p>After killing his music tutor with a <!--del_lnk--> lyre, he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father <!--del_lnk--> Amphitryon. Here, he was visited by two nymphs - Pleasure and Virtue - who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life. He chose the latter. One of Heracles&#39; challenges was put to him by King <!--del_lnk--> Thespius of <!--del_lnk--> Thespia who wished him to kill the Lion of Cithaeron. As a reward, the king offered him the chance to impregnate each of his 50 daughters. Accordingly, Heracles did this in one night (sometimes referred to as his 13th Labour).<p>Later in <!--del_lnk--> Thebes, Heracles married King <!--del_lnk--> Creon&#39;s daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Megara. However, Hera drove Heracles into a fit of madness during which he killed his wife and children. Upon realizing what he had done, he fled to the <!--del_lnk--> Oracle of Delphi. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King <!--del_lnk--> Eurystheus for 12 years and perform any task which he required, resulting in the Twelve Labours of Hercules.<p><a id="Twelve_Labors" name="Twelve_Labors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Twelve Labors</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In a fit of madness induced by <!--del_lnk--> Hera, Heracles slew his own and his brother&#39;s children. To expiate the crime, Heracles was required to carry out ten labors set by his arch-enemy, <!--del_lnk--> Eurystheus, who had become king in Heracles&#39; place. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Hera ordered Eurystheus to give two more tasks to Heracles, which he then carried out.<p>Not all writers gave the labors in the same order, but the Capture of Cerberus is always depicted as Heracles&#39; final task. (Note: in <!--del_lnk--> Alice Bailey&#39;s Labors of Hercules, the Capture of Cerberus is associated with <!--del_lnk--> Capricorn and is therefore 10th.) <!--del_lnk--> Apollodorus (2.5.1-2.5.12) gives the following order:<ol>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Nemean Lion.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Lernaean Hydra.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Ceryneian Hind.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Erymanthian Boar.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Augean Stables.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Stymphalian Birds.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Cretan Bull.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Mares of Diomedes.<li>The Girdle of <!--del_lnk--> Hippolyte.<li>The Cattle of <!--del_lnk--> Geryon.<li>The Apples of the <!--del_lnk--> Hesperides.<li>The Capture of <!--del_lnk--> Cerberus, the guardian dog of <!--del_lnk--> Hades.</ol>
      <p><a id="Further_adventures" name="Further_adventures"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Further adventures</span></h3>
      <p>After completing these tasks, Heracles joined the <!--del_lnk--> Argonauts in the search of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Fleece. They rescued heroines, conquered Troy, and helped the gods fight against the <!--del_lnk--> Gigantes. He also fell in love with Princess <!--del_lnk--> Iole of <!--del_lnk--> Oechalia. Heracles&#39; advances were spurned by the king and his sons, except for one - Iole&#39;s brother <!--del_lnk--> Iphitus. Iphitus became Heracles best friend. But once again, Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death. Once again, Heracles purified himself through servitude - this time to Queen <!--del_lnk--> Omphale of <!--del_lnk--> Lydia.<p><a id="Omphale" name="Omphale"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Omphale</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Omphale was a queen or princess of <!--del_lnk--> Lydia. As penalty for a murder, Heracles was her slave. He was forced to do women&#39;s work and wear women&#39;s clothes, while she wore the skin of the <!--del_lnk--> Nemean Lion and carried his <!--del_lnk--> olive-wood club. After some time, Omphale freed Heracles and married him. Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named. For further details see <!--del_lnk--> Omphale. It was at that time that the <!--del_lnk--> cercopes, mischievous wood spirits, stole Heracles&#39; weapons. He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward.<p><a id="Hylas" name="Hylas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hylas</span></h3>
      <p>While walking through the wilderness, Heracles was set upon by the <!--del_lnk--> Dryopians. He killed their king, <!--del_lnk--> Theiodamas, and the others gave up and offered him Prince <!--del_lnk--> Hylas. He took the youth on as his weapons bearer and beloved. Years later, Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the <!--del_lnk--> Argo. As <!--del_lnk--> Argonauts they only participated in part of the journey. In <!--del_lnk--> Mysia, <!--del_lnk--> Hylas was kidnapped by a nymph. Heracles, heartbroken, searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again. The ship set sail without them. <!--del_lnk--> Story of Heracles and Hylas<p><a id="Iole" name="Iole"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Iole</span></h3>
      <p>King <!--del_lnk--> Eurytus of <!--del_lnk--> Oechalia promised his daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Iole, to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest. Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise. Heracles killed him and his sons&ndash;excluding Iphitus&ndash;and abducted Iole.<p><a id="Laomedon_of_Troy" name="Laomedon_of_Troy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laomedon of Troy</span></h3>
      <p>Before the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack <!--del_lnk--> Troy. The story is related in several digressions in the <i>Iliad</i> (7.451-453, 20.145-148, 21.442-457) and is also found in Apollodorus&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Bibliotheke (2.5.9). <!--del_lnk--> Laomedon planned on sacrificing his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Hesione to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him. Heracles happened to arrive (along with <!--del_lnk--> Telamon and <!--del_lnk--> Oicles) and agreed to kill the monster if Laomedon would give him the horses received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus&#39; kidnapping <!--del_lnk--> Ganymede. Laomedon agreed. Heracles killed the monster, but Laomedon went back on his word. Accordingly in a later expedition Heracles and his followers attacked Troy and sacked it and slew all Laomedon&#39;s sons present there save <!--del_lnk--> Podarces, who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made. Telamon took Hesione as a war prize; they were married and had a son, <!--del_lnk--> Teucer.<p><a id="Other_adventures" name="Other_adventures"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other adventures</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Heracles defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Bebryces (ruled by King <!--del_lnk--> Mygdon) and gave their land to Prince <!--del_lnk--> Lycus of <!--del_lnk--> Mysia, son of <!--del_lnk--> Dascylus.<li>He killed the robber <!--del_lnk--> Termerus.<li>Heracles visited <!--del_lnk--> Evander with <!--del_lnk--> Antor, who then stayed in Italy.<li>Heracles killed King <!--del_lnk--> Amyntor of the <!--del_lnk--> Dolopes for not allowing him into his kingdom.

He learned how to wrestle from <!--del_lnk--> Autolycus. He killed the famous boxer <!--del_lnk--> Eryx of <!--del_lnk--> Sicily in a match.<li>Heracles was an <!--del_lnk--> Argonaut. He killed <!--del_lnk--> Alastor and his brothers.<li>When <!--del_lnk--> Hippocoon overthrew his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Tyndareus, as King of <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, Heracles reinstated the rightful ruler and killed Hippocoon and his sons.<li>Heracles slew the giants <!--del_lnk--> Cycnus, <!--del_lnk--> Porphyrion and <!--del_lnk--> Mimas. The expedition against Cycnus, in which Iolaus accompanied Heracles, is the ostensible theme of a short epic attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Shield of Heracles</i>.<li>Heracles went to war with <!--del_lnk--> Augeias after he denied him a promised reward for clearing his stables. Augeias remained undefeated due to the skill of his two generals, the Molionides, and after Hercules fell ill his army was badly beaten. Later, however, he was able to ambush and kill the Molionides, and thus march into Elis, sack it, and kill Augeias and his sons.<li>Heracles visited the house of <!--del_lnk--> Admetus on the day Admetus&#39; wife, <!--del_lnk--> Alcestis, had agreed to die in his place. By hiding beside the grave of Alcestis, Heracles was able to surprise Death when he came to collect her, and by squeezing him tight until he relented, was able to persuade Death to return Alcestis to her husband.</ul>

      <p>Heracles had numerous liaisons with women. Some of these were linked with later dynasties which claimed descent from his offspring, collectively referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Heracleidae.<p><a id="Heracles.27_women" name="Heracles.27_women"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heracles&#39; women</span></h3>
      <p>During the course of his life, Heracles married four times. His first marriage was to <!--del_lnk--> Megara, whose three children he murdered in a fit of madness and whom he later gave in marriage to his beloved <!--del_lnk--> Iolaus, because the sight of her was too painful. His second wife was <!--del_lnk--> Omphale, the <!--del_lnk--> Lydian queen or princess to whom he was delivered as a slave.<p>His third marriage was to <!--del_lnk--> Deianira, for whom he had to fight the river god <!--del_lnk--> Achelous. (Upon Achelous&#39; death, Heracles removed one of his horns and gave it to some nymphs who turned it into the <!--del_lnk--> cornucopia.) Soon after they wed, Heracles and Deianira had to cross a river, and a <!--del_lnk--> centaur named <!--del_lnk--> Nessus offered to help Deianira across but then attempted to rape her. Enraged, Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow (tipped with the Lernean Hydra&#39;s blood) and killed him. As he lay dying, Nessus plotted revenge and told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and, if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women, she should apply them to his vestments. Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra, and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Later, when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of Iole, she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture. Heracles&#39; servant, <!--del_lnk--> Lichas, brought him the shirt and he put it on. Instantly he was in agony, the cloth burning into him. As he tried to remove it the flesh ripped from his bones. Heracles chose a voluntary death, asking that a pyre be built for him to end his suffering. After death the gods transformed him into an immortal, or alternatively, the fire burned away the mortal part of the demi-god, so that only the god remained. Because his mortal parts had been incinerated, he could now become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on <!--del_lnk--> Mount Olympus. He then married <!--del_lnk--> Hebe.<p>No one but Heracles&#39; friend <!--del_lnk--> Philoctetes (in some versions: <!--del_lnk--> Iolaus or <!--del_lnk--> Poeas) would light his funeral pyre. For this action, Philoctetes (or Poeas) received Heracles&#39; bow and arrows, which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War. Philoctetes confronted Paris and shot a poisoned arrow at him. The Hydra poison would subsequently lead to the death of Paris. The Trojan War, however, would continue until the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan Horse was used to defeat <!--del_lnk--> Troy.<p>Another episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of King Thespios, who encouraged Heracles to make love to his daughters, all fifty of them, in one night. They all got pregnant and all bore sons. Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these, notably the kings of <!--del_lnk--> Sparta and <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedon</a>.<p><a id="Heracles.27_eromenoi" name="Heracles.27_eromenoi"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heracles&#39; <i>eromenoi</i></span></h3>

      <p>As paragon of masculinity and warriorship, Heracles also had a number of <!--del_lnk--> pederastic male beloveds. <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch, in his <i>Eroticos,</i> maintains that Heracles&#39; <!--del_lnk--> eromenoi (male lovers) were beyond counting. Of these, the one most closely linked to Heracles is the <!--del_lnk--> Theban <!--del_lnk--> Iolaus. Their story, an <!--del_lnk--> initiatory myth thought to be of ancient origin, contains many of the elements of the Greek pederastic apprenticeship in which the older warrior is the educator and the younger his helper in battle. Thus Iolaus is Heracles&#39; charioteer and squire. Also in keeping with the initiatory pattern of the relationship, Heracles in the end gives his pupil a wife, symbolizing his entry into adulthood. Iolaus&#39; ritual functions parallelled his relationship with Heracles. He was a patron of male love&mdash;Plutarch reports that down to his own time male couples would go to Iolaus&#39; tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other&mdash;and he presided over initiations in the historical era, such as the one at <!--del_lnk--> Agyrion in central <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. The tomb of Iolaus is also mentioned by Pindar.<p>One of Heracles&#39; best known love affairs, and one frequently represented in ancient as well as modern art, is the one with <!--del_lnk--> Hylas. Though it is of more recent vintage (dated to the third century) than that with Iolaus, it too exemplifies in detail the normal cycle of a youth&#39;s initiatory process, consisting of education through service to a warrior, including sexual relations, and concluding with promotion to adult status and marriage.  <!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> Sparta, as a warrior city where pederastic pedagogy&mdash;ostensibly of a chaste nature&mdash;was enshrined in the laws given by <!--del_lnk--> Lycurgus, the legendary legislator, also provided Heracles with an <!--del_lnk--> eromenos&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Elacatas, who was honored there with a sanctuary and yearly games. The myth of their love is an ancient one. <!--del_lnk--> Abdera&#39;s eponymous hero, <!--del_lnk--> Abderus, was another of Heracles&#39; beloveds. In what is considered to be initiatory myth, he was said to have been entrusted with&mdash;and slain by&mdash;the carnivorous mares of Thracian <!--del_lnk--> Diomedes. Hercules founded the city of Abdera in <!--del_lnk--> Thrace in his memory, where he was honored with athletic games. The topos of death in such stories is thought to symbolize the passage from one stage of life to another. <p>Among the lesser-known myths is that of <!--del_lnk--> Iphitus. Heracles&#39; subsequent murder of Iphitus is held to be evocative of an initiatory ritual. Another such story is the one of his love for <!--del_lnk--> Nireus, who was &quot;the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion&quot; (<i>Iliad</i>, 673). Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles, a fact thought to authenticate this tradition. The last in this category&mdash;despite the fact that Greek literature preserves no mention of this role&mdash;is the story of <!--del_lnk--> Philoctetes. He is also heir to the hero&mdash;and thus surely his disciple&mdash;and is the one who lights his pyre. Later he is the initiator of <!--del_lnk--> Neoptolemus, son of <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>.<p>There is also a series of lovers who are either later inventions or purely literary conceits. Among these are <!--del_lnk--> Admetus, who assisted in the hunt for the <!--del_lnk--> Calydonian Boar; <!--del_lnk--> Adonis; <!--del_lnk--> Corythus; and <!--del_lnk--> Nestor, who was said to have been loved for his wisdom. His role as eromenos was perhaps to explain why he was the only son of <!--del_lnk--> Neleus to be spared by the hero.<p><a id="Heracles.27_children" name="Heracles.27_children"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heracles&#39; children</span></h3>

      <p>Via the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Buddhist culture, Heraclean symbolism was transmitted to the far east.
