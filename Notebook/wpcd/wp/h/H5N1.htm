      <p><b>Influenza A virus subtype H5N1</b>, also known as <b>A(H5N1)</b> or <b>H5N1</b>, is a subtype of the <!--del_lnk--> Influenza A virus that can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called <b>HPAI A(H5N1)</b> for &quot;highly <!--del_lnk--> pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1&quot;, is the causative agent of <!--del_lnk--> H5N1 flu, commonly known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> avian influenza&quot; or &quot;bird flu&quot;. It is <!--del_lnk--> endemic in many bird populations, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is <a href="../../wp/g/Global_spread_of_H5N1.htm" title="Global spread of H5N1">spreading globally</a> after first appearing in Asia. It is <!--del_lnk--> epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the <!--del_lnk--> culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Most mentions of &quot;bird flu&quot; and H5N1 in the media refer to this strain.<p>HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease. There is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or of airborne transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) to humans. In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had extensive physical contact with infected birds. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may <!--del_lnk--> mutate or <!--del_lnk--> reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist <!--del_lnk--> Robert Webster published an article titled &quot;The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population&quot; in <i><!--del_lnk--> American Scientist</i>. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives. On <!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <!--del_lnk--> David Nabarro, the newly-appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill anywhere between 5 million and 150 million people. Experts have identified key events (creating new <!--del_lnk--> clades, infecting new species, spreading to new areas) marking the progression of an avian flu virus towards becoming pandemic, and many of those key events have occurred more rapidly than expected.<p>Due to the high lethality and <!--del_lnk--> virulence of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large <!--del_lnk--> host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus is the world&#39;s largest current pandemic threat, and billions of dollars are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential <!--del_lnk--> influenza pandemic. At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing pre-pandemic <!--del_lnk--> influenza vaccines in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness at all from the strain would require at least three months after the virus&#39;s emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.<p>

      <p>The first known strain of HPAI A(H5N1) (called A/chicken/Scotland/59) killed two flocks of chickens in Scotland in 1959; but that strain was very different from the current highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. The dominant strain of HPAI A(H5N1) in 2004 <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolved</a> from 1999 to 2002 creating the Z genotype. It has also been called &quot;Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)&quot;.<p>Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1) is divided into two <!--del_lnk--> antigenic clades. &quot;Clade 1 includes human and bird isolates from <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> and bird isolates from <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. Clade 2 viruses were first identified in bird isolates from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> before spreading westward to the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. Genetic analysis has identified six subclades of clade 2, three of which have a distinct geographic distribution and have been implicated in human infections: <!--del_lnk--> Map<ul>

Avian influenza viruses that cause HPAI are highly <!--del_lnk--> virulent, and mortality rates in infected flocks often approach 100%. LPAI viruses have negligible virulence, but these viruses can serve as progenitors to HPAI viruses. The current strain of H5N1 responsible for the deaths of birds across the world is an HPAI strain; all other current strains of H5N1, including a North American strain that causes no disease at all in any species, are LPAI strains. All HPAI strains identified to date have involved H5 and H7 subtypes. The distinction concerns pathogenicity in poultry, not humans. Normally a highly pathogenic avian virus is not highly pathogenic to either humans or non-poultry birds. This current deadly strain of H5N1 is unusual in being deadly to so many species.<p><a id="Genetic_structure_and_related_subtypes" name="Genetic_structure_and_related_subtypes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Genetic structure and related subtypes</span></h3>

      <p>H5N1 is a subtype of the species <i>Influenza A virus</i> of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Influenzavirus A</i> <!--del_lnk--> genus of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Orthomyxoviridae</i> family. Like all other influenza A subtypes, the H5N1 subtype is an <!--del_lnk--> RNA virus. It has a segmented <!--del_lnk--> genome of eight negative sense, single-strands of <!--del_lnk--> RNA, abbreviated as PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS.<p>HA codes for <!--del_lnk--> hemagglutinin, an <!--del_lnk--> antigenic <!--del_lnk--> glycoprotein found on the surface of the influenza viruses and is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected. NA codes for <!--del_lnk--> neuraminidase, an antigenic glycosylated <!--del_lnk--> enzyme found on the surface of the influenza viruses. It facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) RNA strands specify the structure of proteins that are most medically relevant as targets for antiviral drugs and <!--del_lnk--> antibodies. HA and NA are also used as the basis for the naming of the different subtypes of influenza A viruses. This is where the <i>H</i> and <i>N</i> come from in <i>H5N1</i>.<p>Influenza A viruses are significant for their potential for disease and death in humans and other animals. Influenza A virus subtypes that have been confirmed in humans, in order of the number of known human pandemic deaths that they have caused, include:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> H1N1, which caused &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Spanish flu&quot; and currently causes seasonal <!--del_lnk--> human flu<li><!--del_lnk--> H2N2, which caused &quot;Asian flu&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> H3N2, which caused &quot;Hong Kong flu&quot; and currently causes seasonal human flu<li>H5N1, the world&#39;s major current <!--del_lnk--> pandemic threat<li><!--del_lnk--> H7N7, which has unusual <!--del_lnk--> zoonotic potential and killed one person<li><!--del_lnk--> H1N2, which is currently endemic in humans and pigs and causes seasonal human flu<li><!--del_lnk--> H9N2, which has infected three people<li><!--del_lnk--> H7N2, which has infected two people<li><!--del_lnk--> H7N3, which has infected two people<li><!--del_lnk--> H10N7, which has infected two people</ul>

      <p>Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (LPAI H5N1) also called &quot;North American&quot; H5N1 commonly occurs in wild birds. In most cases, it causes minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in birds. It is not known to affect humans at all. The only concern about it is that it is possible for it to be transmitted to poultry and in poultry mutate into a highly pathogenic strain.<ul>
       <li>1975 &ndash; LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck and a wild blue goose in Wisconsin.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>1981 and 1985 &ndash; LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks by the University of Minnesota conducting a sampling procedure in which sentinel ducks were monitored in cages placed in the wild for a short period of time.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>1983 &ndash; LPAI H5N1 was detected in ring-billed gulls in Pennsylvania.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>1986 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in a wild mallard duck in Ohio.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>2005 - LPAI H5N1 was detected in ducks in Manitoba, Canada.</ul>
      <p>&quot;In the past, there was no requirement for reporting or tracking LPAI H5 or H7 detections in wild birds so states and universities tested wild bird samples independently of USDA. Because of this, the above list of previous detections might not be all inclusive of past LPAI H5N1 detections. However, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recently changed its requirement of reporting detections of avian influenza. Effective in 2006, all confirmed LPAI H5 and H7 AI subtypes must be reported to the OIE because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains. Therefore, USDA now tracks these detections in wild birds, backyard flocks, commercial flocks and live bird markets.&quot;<p><a id="Properties_of_H5N1" name="Properties_of_H5N1"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Properties of H5N1</span></h2>

      <p>H5N1 is easily transmissible between birds facilitating a potential <a href="../../wp/g/Global_spread_of_H5N1.htm" title="Global spread of H5N1">global spread of H5N1</a>. While H5N1 undergoes specific mutations and reassorting creating variations which infect species not previously known to carry the virus, not all of these variant forms can infect humans. H5N1 as an avian virus preferentially binds to a type of galactose receptors that populate the avian respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs and are virtually absent in humans, occurring only in and around the <!--del_lnk--> alveoli, structures deep in the lungs where oxygen is passed to the blood. Therefore, the virus is not easily expelled by coughing and sneezing, the usual route of transmission.<p>H5N1 is mainly spread by domestic <a href="../../wp/p/Poultry.htm" title="Poultry">poultry</a>, both through the movements of infected birds and poultry products and through the use of infected poultry manure as fertilizer or feed. Humans with H5N1 have typically caught it from chickens, which were in turn infected by other poultry or waterfowl. Migrating <!--del_lnk--> waterfowl (wild ducks, geese and swans) carry H5N1, often without themselves becoming sick. Many species of birds and mammals can be infected with HPAI A(H5N1), but the role of animals other than poultry and waterfowl as disease-spreading hosts is unknown.<p><a id="Virulence" name="Virulence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Virulence</span></h3>
      <p>H5N1 has <!--del_lnk--> mutated into a variety of <!--del_lnk--> strains with differing pathogenic profiles, some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Each specific known genetic variation is traceable to a virus isolate of a specific case of infection. Through <!--del_lnk--> antigenic drift, H5N1 has mutated into dozens of highly pathogenic varieties divided into genetic clades which are known from specific isolates, but all currently belonging to genotype Z of avian influenza virus H5N1, now the dominant genotype. H5N1 isolates found in <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> in 1997 and 2001 were not consistently transmitted efficiently among birds and did not cause significant disease in these animals. In 2002 new isolates of H5N1 were appearing within the bird population of Hong Kong. These new isolates caused acute disease, including severe neurological dysfunction and death in ducks. This was the first reported case of lethal influenza virus infection in wild aquatic birds since 1961. Genotype Z emerged in 2002 through <!--del_lnk--> reassortment from earlier highly pathogenic genotypes of H5N1 that first infected birds in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> in 1996, and first infected humans in <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> in 1997. Genotype Z is endemic in birds in Southeast Asia, has created at least two clades that can infect humans, and is spreading across the globe in bird populations. Mutations are occurring within this genotype that are increasing their pathogenicity. Birds are also able to shed the virus for longer periods of time before their death, increasing the transmissibility of the virus.<p><a id="Transmission_and_host_range" name="Transmission_and_host_range"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transmission and host range</span></h3>

      <p>Infected birds transmit H5N1 through their <!--del_lnk--> saliva, <!--del_lnk--> nasal secretions, <!--del_lnk--> feces and <!--del_lnk--> blood. Other animals may become infected with the virus through direct contact with these bodily fluids or through contact with surfaces contaminated with them. H5N1 remains infectious after over 30 days at 0 &deg;C ( 32.0 &deg;F) (over one month at freezing temperature) or 6 days at 37 &deg;C ( 98.6 &deg;F) (one week at human body temperature) so at ordinary temperatures it lasts in the environment for weeks. In arctic temperatures, it doesn&#39;t degrade at all.<p>Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, it is spreading to all parts of the world. H5N1 is different from all previously known highly pathogenic avian flu viruses in its ability to be spread by animals other than poultry.<p>In October 2004, researchers discovered that H5N1 is far more dangerous than was previously believed. <!--del_lnk--> Waterfowl were revealed to be directly spreading the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 to <a href="../../wp/c/Chicken.htm" title="Chicken">chickens</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Crow.htm" title="Crow">crows</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pigeon.htm" title="Pigeon">pigeons</a>, and other birds, and the virus was increasing its ability to infect mammals as well. From this point on, avian flu experts increasingly referred to containment as a strategy that can delay, but not ultimately prevent, a future avian flu pandemic.<p>&quot;Since 1997, studies of influenza A (H5N1) indicate that these viruses continue to evolve, with changes in antigenicity and internal gene constellations; an expanded host range in avian species and the ability to infect felids; enhanced pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice and ferrets, in which they cause systemic infections; and increased environmental stability&quot;.<p><i>The New York Times</i>, in an article on transmission of H5N1 through smuggled birds, reports Wade Hagemeijer of Wetlands International stating, &quot;We believe it is spread by both bird migration and trade, but that trade, particularly illegal trade, is more important&quot;.<p><a id="High_mutation_rate" name="High_mutation_rate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">High mutation rate</span></h3>
      <p>Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of <!--del_lnk--> RNA viruses. The segmentation of the influenza <!--del_lnk--> genome facilitates <!--del_lnk--> genetic recombination by segment reassortment in hosts who are infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time. H5N1 viruses can <!--del_lnk--> reassort genes with other strains that co-infect a host organism, such as a pig, bird, or human, and mutate into a form that can pass easily among humans. This is one of many possible paths to a pandemic.<p>The ability of various influenza strains to show species-selectivity is largely due to variation in the <!--del_lnk--> hemagglutinin genes. Genetic <!--del_lnk--> mutations in the hemagglutinin gene that cause single <!--del_lnk--> amino acid substitutions can significantly alter the ability of viral hemagglutinin proteins to bind to <!--del_lnk--> receptors on the surface of host cells. Such mutations in avian H5N1 viruses can change virus strains from being inefficient at infecting human cells to being as efficient in causing human infections as more common human influenza virus types. This doesn&#39;t mean that one amino acid substitution can cause a pandemic, but it does mean that one amino acid substitution can cause an avian flu virus that is not pathogenic in humans to become pathogenic in humans.<p><!--del_lnk--> H3N2 (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> swine flu&quot;) is endemic in pigs in China, and has been detected in pigs in Vietnam, increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. The dominant strain of annual flu virus in January 2006 was <!--del_lnk--> H3N2, which is now resistant to the standard antiviral drugs <!--del_lnk--> amantadine and <!--del_lnk--> rimantadine. The possibility of H5N1 and H3N2 exchanging genes through reassortment is a major concern. If a reassortment in H5N1 occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype, or it could shift subtypes, as <!--del_lnk--> H2N2 did when it evolved into the Hong Kong Flu strain of <!--del_lnk--> H3N2.<p>Both the <!--del_lnk--> H2N2 and <!--del_lnk--> H3N2 pandemic strains contained <!--del_lnk--> avian flu virus RNA segments. &quot;While the pandemic human influenza viruses of 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) clearly arose through reassortment between human and avian viruses, the influenza virus causing the &#39;Spanish flu&#39; in 1918 appears to be entirely derived from an avian source&quot;.<p><a id="Humans_and_H5N1" name="Humans_and_H5N1"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Humans and H5N1</span></h2>
      <p>The earliest infections of humans by H5N1 coincided with an <!--del_lnk--> epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong&#39;s poultry population. This <!--del_lnk--> panzootic (a disease affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area) outbreak was stopped by the killing of the entire domestic poultry population within the territory.<p>

      <p>Avian influenza <!--del_lnk--> hemagglutinin bind alpha 2-3 <!--del_lnk--> sialic acid receptors while human influenza <!--del_lnk--> hemagglutinin bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Usually other differences also exist. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught <b>avian</b> H5N1.<p>Humans who catch a humanized <!--del_lnk--> Influenza A virus (in other words a <!--del_lnk--> human flu virus of type A) usually have symptoms that include <!--del_lnk--> fever, <!--del_lnk--> cough, <!--del_lnk--> sore throat, <!--del_lnk--> muscle aches, <!--del_lnk--> conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, severe breathing problems and <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> that may be fatal. The severity of the infection will depend to a large part on the state of the infected person&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> immune system and if the victim has been exposed to the strain before, and is therefore partially immune. No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized <!--del_lnk--> H5N1 flu.<p>Highly pathogenic H5N1 <!--del_lnk--> avian flu in a human is far worse, killing 50% of humans that catch it. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced <!--del_lnk--> diarrhea followed rapidly by a <!--del_lnk--> coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. There have been studies of the levels of <!--del_lnk--> cytokines in humans infected by the H5N1 flu virus. Of particular concern is elevated levels of <!--del_lnk--> tumor necrosis factor alpha, a protein that is associated with tissue destruction at sites of infection and increased production of other cytokines. Flu virus-induced increases in the level of cytokines is also associated with flu symptoms including fever, chills, vomiting and headache. Tissue damage associated with pathogenic flu virus infection can ultimately result in death. The <!--del_lnk--> inflammatory cascade triggered by H5N1 has been called a &#39;<!--del_lnk--> cytokine storm&#39; by some, because of what seems to be a <!--del_lnk--> positive feedback process of damage to the body resulting from <!--del_lnk--> immune system stimulation. H5N1 induces higher levels of cytokines than the more common flu virus types.<p><a id="Treatment_and_prevention_for_humans" name="Treatment_and_prevention_for_humans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Treatment and prevention for humans</span></h3>

      <p>There is no highly effective treatment for <!--del_lnk--> H5N1 flu, but <!--del_lnk--> oseltamivir (commercially marketed by <!--del_lnk--> Roche as <i><!--del_lnk--> Tamiflu</i>), can sometimes inhibit the influenza virus from spreading inside the user&#39;s body. This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to be seen as making preparations for a possible H5N1 pandemic. On April 20, 2006, Roche AG announced that a <!--del_lnk--> stockpile of three million treatment courses of Tamiflu is waiting at the disposal of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> to be used in case of a flu pandemic; separately Roche donated two million courses to the WHO for use in <!--del_lnk--> developing nations that may be affected by such a pandemic but lack the ability to purchase large quantities of the drug.<p>However, WHO expert Hassan al-Bushra has said:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Even now, we remain unsure about <!--del_lnk--> Tamiflu&#39;s real effectiveness. As for a <!--del_lnk--> vaccine, work cannot start on it until the emergence of a new virus, and we predict it would take six to nine months to develop it. For the moment, we cannot by any means count on a potential vaccine to prevent the spread of a contagious influenza virus, whose various precedents in the past 90 years have been highly pathogenic&quot;.</dl>
      <p>There are several H5N1 <!--del_lnk--> vaccines for several of the avian H5N1 varieties, but the continual mutation of H5N1 renders them of limited use to date: while vaccines can sometimes provide cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Dr. Daniel Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown University has made this point, &quot;There is no H5N1 <!--del_lnk--> pandemic so there can be no pandemic <!--del_lnk--> vaccine&quot;. However, &quot;pre-pandemic vaccines&quot; have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic. Vaccine manufacturing companies are being encouraged to increase capacity so that if a pandemic vaccine is needed, facilities will be available for rapid production of large amounts of a vaccine specific to a new pandemic strain.<p>Animal and lab studies suggest that Relenza (<!--del_lnk--> Zanamivir), which is in the same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be effective against H5N1, in a study performed on mice in 2000, &quot;zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals&quot; (Leneva 2001). However another paper, <i>de Jong 2005</i>, suggested that Zazamivir might not provide protection in humans from the current avian strain of H5N1 if &quot;systemic involvement of influenza infection is suspected - as has recently been suggested by some reports on avian H5N1 influenza in humans.&quot; While no one knows if zanamivir will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile zanamivir as well as oseltamivir in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts.<p>In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine.<p><a id="Preparations_for_pandemic" name="Preparations_for_pandemic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations for pandemic</span></h3>
