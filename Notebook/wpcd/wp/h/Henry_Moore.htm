      <p><b>Henry Spencer Moore</b> <!--del_lnk--> OM <!--del_lnk--> CH, (<!--del_lnk--> 30 July <!--del_lnk--> 1898 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 31 August <!--del_lnk--> 1986) was a <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> artist and <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculptor</a>. The son of a mining engineer, born in the <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire town of <!--del_lnk--> Castleford, Moore became well known for his large-scale <a href="../../wp/a/Abstract_art.htm" title="Abstract art">abstract</a> cast bronze and carved marble sculptures. Substantially supported by the British art establishment, Moore helped to introduce a particular form of <!--del_lnk--> modernism into the United Kingdom.<p>His ability to satisfy large-scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy towards the end of his life. However, he lived frugally and most of his wealth went to endow the <!--del_lnk--> Henry Moore Foundation, which continues to support education and promotion of the arts. He was influenced by three key factors. The materials he used, the war, ancient art such as Roman and Greek and the idea of mother and child, he based alot of his sculptures on a mother protecting a child.<p>His signature form is a pierced reclining figure, first influenced by a <!--del_lnk--> Toltec-<a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a> sculpture known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chac Mool&quot;, which he had seen as a <!--del_lnk--> plaster cast in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1925. Early versions are pierced conventionally as a bent arm reconnects with the body. Later more abstract versions are pierced directly through the body in order to explore the concave and convex shapes. These more extreme piercings developed in parallel with <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Hepworth&#39;s sculptures. Hepworth first pierced a torso after misreading a review of one of Henry Moore&#39;s early shows.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Moore is best known for his abstract monumental bronzes which can be seen in many places around the world as public works of art. The subjects are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically <i>mother-and-child</i> or <i>reclining figures</i>. Interestingly, apart from a flirtation with family groups in the 1950s, the subject is nearly always a female figure. Characteristically, Moore&#39;s figures are pierced, or contain hollow voids. Many interpret the undulating form of his reclining figures as references to the landscape and hills of Yorkshire where Moore was born.<p>When Moore&#39;s niece asked why his sculptures had such simple titles, he replied:<dl>
       <dd><i>All art should have a certain mystery and should make demands on the spectator. Giving a sculpture or a drawing too explicit a title takes away part of that mystery so that the spectator moves on to the next object, making no effort to ponder the meaning of what he has just seen. Everyone thinks that he or she looks but they don&#39;t really, you know.</i></dl>
      <p>Moore&#39;s early work focused on <!--del_lnk--> direct carving in which the form of the sculpture evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block (see <!--del_lnk--> <i>Half-figure</i> 1932). In the 1930s Moore&#39;s transition into <!--del_lnk--> Modernism paralleled that of <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Hepworth with both sculptors bouncing new ideas off each other and several other artists living in <!--del_lnk--> Hampstead at the time. Moore made many preparatory sketches and drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived, providing an insight into his development. By the end of the 1940s Moore increasingly produced sculptures by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the <!--del_lnk--> lost wax technique.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War Moore&#39;s Bronzes took on their monumental scale, particularly suited for the public art commissions he was receiving. As a matter of practicality he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the <!--del_lnk--> maquettes.<p>At his home in <!--del_lnk--> Much Hadham, Moore built up a collection of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he often produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Sometimes a full-scale plaster model was constructed, allowing Moore to refine the final shape and add surface marks before casting.<p><a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>

      <p>Moore was born in <!--del_lnk--> Castleford, <!--del_lnk--> West Yorkshire, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, the seventh of eight children to Raymond Spencer Moore and Mary Baker. His father was a mining engineer who rose to be under-manager of the Wheldale colliery in Castleford. He was an autodidact with an interest in music and literature, and he saw formal education as the route to advancement for his children.<p>Moore decided to become a sculptor when he was only eleven, and was encouraged by his Sunday school teacher who introduced him to the work of Michaelangelo. Despite his showing early promise after he began modelling in clay and carving in wood while at secondary school, Moore&#39;s parents were against a career as a sculptor; they saw it as manual labour.<p>On turning 18 in 1917, at the height of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Moore was called up into the army. The youngest man in his regiment, the Civil Service Rifles, he was injured in a gas attack during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cambrai. After recovering in hospital, he saw out the remainder of the war as a physical training instructor. In stark contrast to many of his contemporaries, Moore&#39;s wartime experience was largely untroubled. He said later, &quot;for me the war passed in a romantic haze of trying to be a hero.&quot; After the war, Moore received an ex-serviceman&#39;s grant to continue his education and became the first student of sculpture at <!--del_lnk--> Leeds School of Art in 1919 &mdash; the school had to set up a sculpture studio especially for him.<p><a id="College_education" name="College_education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">College education</span></h3>

      <p>While at Leeds, Moore met fellow art student <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Hepworth, beginning a friendship which would last for many years. Moore was also fortunate to be introduced to African tribal sculpture, by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Michael Sadler, the <!--del_lnk--> Vice-Chancellor at the Leeds School.<p>In 1921 Moore won a scholarship to study at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal College of Art (RCA) in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, where Hepworth had gone the year before. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria and Albert Museum and the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum.<p>Both Moore and Hepworth&#39;s earliest sculptures followed standard teaching in romantic Victorian style; subjects were natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore increasingly felt uncomfortable with these classically derived ideas. With his knowledge of primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as <!--del_lnk--> Brancusi, <!--del_lnk--> Epstein and <!--del_lnk--> Dobson he started to develop a style of <!--del_lnk--> direct carving in which imperfections in the material and tool marks are incorporated into the finished sculpture. In doing so he had to fight against his academic tutors who did not appreciate the modern approach. In one exercise set by <!--del_lnk--> Derwent Wood, the professor of Sculpture at the RCA, Moore was supposed to reproduce a marble relief of <!--del_lnk--> Rosselli&#39;s <i>The Virgin and Child</i>, by first modelling the relief in plaster then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical technique of &#39;<!--del_lnk--> pointing&#39;. Instead, Moore carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the surface prick marks that would have been left by the pointing machine. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Nevertheless, in 1924, Moore won a six month travelling scholarship which he spent in Northern Italy studying the great works of <a href="../../wp/m/Michelangelo.htm" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Giotto and several other Old Masters. Since Moore had already started to break away from the classical tradition, it is not clear that he drew much influence from this trip, though in later life he would often claim Michelangelo as an influence.<p><a id="Life_in_Hampstead" name="Life_in_Hampstead"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Life in Hampstead</span></h3>

      <p>On returning to London, Moore began a seven-year teaching post at the RCA. He was only required to teach two days a week, which gave him plenty of time to spend on his own work. In July 1929, he married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the RCA &mdash; Irina was born in Kiev on <!--del_lnk--> 26 March <!--del_lnk--> 1907 to Russian-Polish parents. Her father disappeared in the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a> and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather&rsquo;s relatives in <!--del_lnk--> Buckinghamshire. With such a troubled childhood, it is not surprising that Irina had a reputation of being quiet and a little withdrawn. However, she found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him.<p>Shortly after getting married the pair moved to a studio in <!--del_lnk--> Hampstead on Parkhill Road, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were starting to take root there. Shortly afterwards, Hepworth and her partner <!--del_lnk--> Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while <!--del_lnk--> Naum Gabo, <!--del_lnk--> Roland Penrose and the art critic <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Read also lived in the area. This led to a rapid cross-fertilisation of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore&#39;s public profile. The area was also a stopping off point for a large number of refugee architects and designers from continental Europe enroute to America many of whom would later commission works from Moore.<p>In the early 1930s, Moore took up a post as the Head of the Department of Sculpture at the <!--del_lnk--> Chelsea School of Art. Artistically, Moore, Hepworth and other members of the <!--del_lnk--> 7 and 5 Society would develop steadily more abstract work, partly influenced by their frequent trips to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and contact with leading progressive artists, notably <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Picasso</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Braque, <!--del_lnk--> Arp and <!--del_lnk--> Giacometti. Moore flirted with <!--del_lnk--> Surrealism, joining <!--del_lnk--> Paul Nash&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Unit One Group in 1933. Both Moore and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Nash were on the organizing committee of the London International Surrealist Exhibition, which took place in 1936. In 1937 Roland Penrose purchased an abstract &#39;Mother and Child&#39; in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The piece proved controversial with other residents and a campaign was run against the piece by the local press over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary <!--del_lnk--> maquettes in clay or plaster.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>This inventive and productive period was brought to an end by the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War. The Chelsea School of Art evacuated to Northampton and Moore resigned his teaching post. During the war, Moore was commissioned as a war artist, notably producing powerful drawings of Londoners sleeping in the London Underground while sheltering from the blitz <!--del_lnk--> . These drawings helped to boost Moore&#39;s international reputation, particularly in America.<p>After their Hampstead home was hit by bomb shrapnel in 1940, he and Irina moved out of London to live in a farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near <!--del_lnk--> Much Hadham, <!--del_lnk--> Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore&#39;s final home and workshop. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to a larger home and apart from adding a number of outbuildings and workshops the house changed little.<p><a id="International_recognition" name="International_recognition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International recognition</span></h3>
      <p>After the war and following several earlier miscarriages, Irina gave birth to their daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Moore on <!--del_lnk--> 7 March <!--del_lnk--> 1946. The child was named after Moore&#39;s mother, who had died a couple of years earlier. Both the loss of his mother and the arrival of a baby focused Moore&#39;s mind on the family, which he expressed in his work by producing many <i>mother-and-child</i> compositions, although <i>reclining figures</i> also remained popular. In the same year, Moore made his first visit to America when a retrospective exhibition of his work opened at the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Modern Art in New York. <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Clark became an unlikely but influential champion of Moore&#39;s work and through his position as member of the Arts Council of Great Britain secured exhibitions and commissions for the artist. In 1948 he won the International Sculpture Prize at the <!--del_lnk--> Venice Biennale and was one of the featured artists of the <!--del_lnk--> Festival of Britain in 1951 and <!--del_lnk--> Documenta 1 in 1955.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Towards the end of the war, Moore had been approached by <!--del_lnk--> Henry Morris who was in the process of trying to reform education with the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> village college. Morris had engaged <!--del_lnk--> Walter Gropius as the architect for his second village college at <!--del_lnk--> Impington near <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and he wanted Moore to design a major public sculpture for the site. Unfortunately, the County Council could not afford Gropius&#39;s full design, and scaled back the project when Gropius emigrated to America. Lacking funds, Morris had to cancel Moore&#39;s sculpture, which had not progressed beyond the maquette stage. Fortunately, Moore was able to reuse the design in 1950 for a similar commission outside a secondary school for the new town of <!--del_lnk--> Stevenage. This time, the project was completed and <i>Family Group</i> became Moore&#39;s first large scale public bronze.<p>In the 1950s, Moore began to receive increasingly significant commissions, including one for the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO building in Paris 1957. With many more public works of art, the scale of Moore&#39;s sculptures grew significantly and he started to employ a number of assistants to work with him at Much Hadham, including <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Caro and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Wentworth.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The last three decades of Moore&#39;s life continued in a similar vein, with several major retrospectives around the world, notably a very prominent exhibition in the summer of 1972 in the grounds of the <!--del_lnk--> Forte di Belvedere overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Florence. By the end of the 1970s, there were some 40 exhibitions a year featuring his work.<p>The number of commissions continued to increase; he completed <i>Knife Edge Two Piece</i> in 1962 for <!--del_lnk--> College Green next to the <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Houses of Parliament</a> in London. Moore commented;<dl>

      <p>As his personal wealth grew dramatically, Moore began to worry about his legacy. With the help of his daughter Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from <!--del_lnk--> death duties. By 1977 he was paying about a million pounds a year in income tax, and so to mitigate this tax burden he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to promote the public appreciation of art and to preserve Moore&#39;s sculptures. It now runs Hoglands as a gallery and museum of Moore&#39;s workshops. The Foundation also manages the Henry Moore Institute in Leeds that supports exhibition and research activities into international sculpture. While by the Foundation&#39;s own admission general interest in Moore&#39;s work has declined since his death the institutions he endowed continue to play an essential role in promoting contemporary art in the United Kingdom.<p>Although Moore had turned down a <!--del_lnk--> knighthood in 1951 he was later awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Companion of Honour in 1955 and the <!--del_lnk--> Order of Merit in 1963. He was a trustee of both the <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery and <!--del_lnk--> Tate Gallery. His proposal that a wing of the latter should be devoted to his sculptures aroused hostility among some artists. In 1975 he became the first President of the <!--del_lnk--> Turner Society, which had been founded to campaign for a separate museum in which the whole <!--del_lnk--> Turner Bequest might be reunited, an aim defeated by the National Gallery and Tate Gallery.<p>Henry Moore died on <!--del_lnk--> 31 August <!--del_lnk--> 1986, at the age of 88, in his home in Hertfordshire. His body is interred in the Artist&#39;s Corner at <a href="../../wp/s/St_Paul%2527s_Cathedral.htm" title="St Paul&#39;s Cathedral">St Paul&#39;s Cathedral</a>.<p>On Thursday December 15, 2005, thieves gained access to the courtyard of the Henry Moore Foundation and stole a bronze statue worth &pound;3m ($5.3m). The 1969/1970 work, known as <i>Reclining Figure LH608</i> is 3.6m long, 2m high by 2m wide and weighs 2.1 tonnes. A substantial reward has been offered by the Foundation for information leading to its recovery. It is feared it may have been stolen for melting down as scrap metal. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Selected_works_from_America" name="Selected_works_from_America"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Selected works from America</span></h2>
