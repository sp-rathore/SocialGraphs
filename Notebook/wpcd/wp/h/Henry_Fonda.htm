      <p><b>Henry Jaynes Fonda</b> (<!--del_lnk--> May 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1905 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1982) was a highly acclaimed <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award-winning <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">actor</a>, best known for his roles as plain-speaking idealists. Fonda&#39;s subtle, <!--del_lnk--> naturalistic acting style preceded by many years the popularization of <!--del_lnk--> method acting.<p>Fonda made his mark early as a <!--del_lnk--> Broadway actor, and made his <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood debut in <!--del_lnk--> 1935. Fonda&#39;s career gained momentum after his <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award-nominated performance in <!--del_lnk--> 1940&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Grapes of Wrath</i>, an <!--del_lnk--> adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> John Steinbeck&#39;s novel about an <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma family who moved west during the <!--del_lnk--> Dust Bowl. Throughout six decades in Hollywood, Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in such classics as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ox-Bow Incident</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mister Roberts</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> 12 Angry Men</i>. Later, Fonda moved toward both more challenging and lighter roles in such epics as <i><!--del_lnk--> Once Upon a Time in the West</i> and family comedies like <i><!--del_lnk--> Yours, Mine and Ours</i> (with <!--del_lnk--> Lucille Ball).<p>He was the patriarch of a family of famous actors, including daughter <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Fonda.htm" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>, son <!--del_lnk--> Peter Fonda, granddaughter <!--del_lnk--> Bridget Fonda, and grandson <!--del_lnk--> Troy Garity.<p>In 1999, the <!--del_lnk--> American Film Institute named Fonda among the <!--del_lnk--> Greatest Male Stars of All Time, ranking at No. 6.<p>

      <p>He was born in <!--del_lnk--> Grand Island, Nebraska to William Brace Fonda and Herberta Krueger Jaynes, observant <!--del_lnk--> Christian Scientists. The Fonda family had emigrated westward from <!--del_lnk--> New York in the 1800s, and can trace its ancestry from <!--del_lnk--> Genoa, Italy to <!--del_lnk--> The Netherlands in the 1500s, and then to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a> in the 1600s (see<!--del_lnk--> ). In Henry Fonda&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> autobiography, he wrote:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Early records show the family ensconced in northern <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> in the sixteenth century where they fought on the side of the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, fled to <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Holland</a>, intermarried with Dutch burghers&#39; daughters, picked up the first names of the Low Countries, but retained the Italianate &quot;Fonda&quot;. Before <!--del_lnk--> Pieter Stuyvesant surrendered <!--del_lnk--> Nieuw Amsterdam to the English the Fondas, instead of settling in Manhattan, canoed up the Hudson River to the Indian village of Caughawaga. Within a few generations, the <!--del_lnk--> Mohawks and the <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois were butchered or fled and the town became known to mapmakers as <!--del_lnk--> Fonda, New York&quot; (see <!--del_lnk--> ).</dl>
      <p>As a youth in Nebraska, Fonda was active in the <!--del_lnk--> Boy Scouts of America as a youth and was a Scoutmaster, but was <i>not</i> an <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle_Scout_%2528Boy_Scouts_of_America%2529.htm" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a> as some report.Fonda relayed the story in the Parkinson show (UK) in the mid 1970s that his father had taken him to see the aftermath of a lynching. This so enraged the young Fonda that a keen social awareness of prejudice was present within him for his entire adult life.He then attended the <!--del_lnk--> University of Minnesota, majoring in <!--del_lnk--> journalism (see<!--del_lnk--> ), although he did not graduate.<p>At age twenty, he started his acting career at the <!--del_lnk--> Omaha Community Playhouse when his mother&#39;s friend <!--del_lnk--> Dodie Brando (mother of <!--del_lnk--> Marlon Brando) needed a young man to play the lead in <i>You and I</i>. He went east to perform with the <!--del_lnk--> Provincetown Players and <!--del_lnk--> Joshua Logan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> University Players, an intercollegiate <!--del_lnk--> summer stock company, where he worked with <!--del_lnk--> Margaret Sullavan, his future wife, and began a lifelong friendship with <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Stewart.<p><a id="Early_career" name="Early_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early career</span></h3>
      <p>Fonda and Stewart headed for <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where the two were roommates and honed their skills on <!--del_lnk--> Broadway. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934, and made his first film appearance (1935) as the leading man in <!--del_lnk--> 20th Century Fox&#39;s screen adaptation of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Farmer Takes a Wife</i>, reprising his role from the Broadway production of the same name. In 1935 Fonda starred in the RKO film &quot;I Dream Too Much&quot; with the famous opera star Lily Pons. Pons was a coloratura soprano who could sing a high &quot;F&quot; note. She was credited with saving the MET during the great depression.<p>Fonda&#39;s film career blossomed as he costarred with <!--del_lnk--> Sylvia Sidney and <!--del_lnk--> Fred MacMurray in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Trail of the Lonesome Pine</i> (1936), the first <!--del_lnk--> Technicolor movie filmed outdoors. Fonda also got the nod for the lead role in <i><!--del_lnk--> You Only Live Once</i> (1937), also costarring Sidney, and directed by <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Lang. A critical success opposite <a href="../../wp/b/Bette_Davis.htm" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Jezebel</i> (1938) was followed by the title role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Young Mr. Lincoln</i> and his first collaboration with director <!--del_lnk--> John Ford.<p>Fonda&#39;s successes led Ford to recruit him to play &quot;Tom Joad&quot; in the film version of <!--del_lnk--> John Steinbeck&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Grapes of Wrath</i> (1940), but a reluctant <!--del_lnk--> Darryl Zanuck, who preferred <!--del_lnk--> Tyrone Power, insisted on Fonda&#39;s signing a seven-year contract with the studio, <!--del_lnk--> Twentieth Century-Fox (<!--del_lnk--> ). Fonda agreed, and was ultimately nominated for an Academy Award for his work in the 1940 film, which many consider to be his finest role, but he was &quot;pipped at the post&quot; (edged out) by Stewart, who won the award for his role in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Philadelphia Story</i>.<p><a id="World_War_II_service" name="World_War_II_service"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">World War II service</span></h4>
      <p>Fonda played opposite <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Stanwyck in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lady Eve</i> (1941), and was acclaimed for his role in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ox-Bow Incident</i>, but he then enlisted in the <!--del_lnk--> Navy to fight in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be in a fake war in a studio&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> ).<p>Previously, he and Stewart had helped raise funds for the defense of <!--del_lnk--> Britain from the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> (<!--del_lnk--> ). Fonda served for three years, initially as a <!--del_lnk--> Quartermaster 3rd Class on the <!--del_lnk--> destroyer <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Satterlee</i>; he was later commissioned as a <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant Junior Grade in Air Combat Intelligence in the Central Pacific and won a Presidential Citation and the <!--del_lnk--> Bronze Star (<!--del_lnk--> , <!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="Post-war_career" name="Post-war_career"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war career</span></h4>
      <p>After the war, Fonda appeared in the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Fort Apache</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1948), and his contract with Fox expired. Refusing another long-term studio contract, Fonda returned to Broadway, wearing his own officer&#39;s cap to originate the title role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Mister Roberts</i>, a comedy about the Navy. He won a 1948 <!--del_lnk--> Tony Award for the part, and later reprised his performance in the national tour and the <!--del_lnk--> 1955 film version opposite <!--del_lnk--> James Cagney, continuing a pattern of bringing his acclaimed stage roles to life on the big screen. On the set of <i>Mister Roberts</i>, Fonda came to blows with <!--del_lnk--> John Ford and vowed never to work for him again. He never did.<p><a id="Career_in_the_1950s_and_1960s" name="Career_in_the_1950s_and_1960s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Career in the 1950s and 1960s</span></h3>
      <p>After a six-year break from Hollywood, Fonda returned in the critically acclaimed <i><!--del_lnk--> Mister Roberts</i>, as Lt. Douglas Roberts, a role he had originated in the play. He followed this with <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures&#39;s production of the <a href="../../wp/l/Leo_Tolstoy.htm" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> epic <i><a href="../../wp/w/War_and_Peace.htm" title="War and Peace">War and Peace</a></i>, in which Fonda played Pierre Bezukhov opposite <!--del_lnk--> Audrey Hepburn. Fonda worked with <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_Hitchcock.htm" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> in 1956, playing a man falsely accused of murder in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wrong Man</i>.<p>In 1957, Fonda made his first foray into production with <i><!--del_lnk--> 12 Angry Men</i>, based on a script by <!--del_lnk--> Reginald Rose and directed by <!--del_lnk--> Sidney Lumet. The intense film about twelve jurors deciding the fate of a young man accused of murder was well-received by critics worldwide. Fonda shared the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award and <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe nominations with co-producer Reginald Rose and won the 1958 <!--del_lnk--> BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his performance as the logical &quot;Juror #8&quot;. Fonda vowed that he would never ever produce a movie again. After a series of ordinary <!--del_lnk--> western movies, Fonda returned to the production seat for the <!--del_lnk--> NBC western television series <i><!--del_lnk--> The Deputy</i> (1959-1961), in which he also starred.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1960s saw Fonda perform in a number of war and western epics, including 1962&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Longest Day</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> How the West Was Won</i>, 1965&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> In Harm&#39;s Way</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Bulge</i>, and the suspense film <i><!--del_lnk--> Fail-Safe</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1964), about possible nuclear holocaust. He also returned to more light-hearted cinema in <i><!--del_lnk--> Spencer&#39;s Mountain</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1963) with actors <!--del_lnk--> Kym Karath and <!--del_lnk--> Veronica Cartwright, which was the inspiration for the TV series, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Waltons</i>.<p>He appeared against type as the villain &quot;Frank&quot; in 1968&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Once Upon a Time in the West</i>. After initially turning down the role, he was convinced to accept it by the actor <!--del_lnk--> Eli Wallach and director <!--del_lnk--> Sergio Leone, who flew from Italy to the United States to persuade him to play the part. Fonda had planned on wearing a pair of brown-colored <!--del_lnk--> contact lenses, but Leone had worked important close-up shots of Fonda&#39;s blue eyes into the film.<p>Fonda&#39;s relationship with Jimmy Stewart survived their disagreements over politics &mdash; Fonda was a <!--del_lnk--> liberal <!--del_lnk--> Democrat, and Stewart a <!--del_lnk--> conservative <!--del_lnk--> Republican. After a heated argument, they avoided talking politics with each other. In 1970, Fonda and Stewart costarred in the <!--del_lnk--> western <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cheyenne Social Club</i>, a minor film in which the two humorously argued politics. They had first appeared together on film in <i><!--del_lnk--> On Our Merry Way</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1948), a comedy which also starred <!--del_lnk--> William Demarest and <!--del_lnk--> Fred MacMurray and featured a grown-up <!--del_lnk--> Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer (see<!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="Marriages_and_children" name="Marriages_and_children"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marriages and children</span></h3>
      <p>Henry Fonda was married five times. His marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Margaret Brooke Sullavan in 1931 soon ended in separation, which was finalized in a 1933 divorce. In 1936, he married <!--del_lnk--> Frances Ford Seymour. They had two children, <!--del_lnk--> Peter and <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Fonda.htm" title="Jane Fonda">Jane</a>. In 1950, Seymour committed <!--del_lnk--> suicide. Fonda married in <!--del_lnk--> 1950 <!--del_lnk--> Susan Blanchard, the stepdaughter of <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Hammerstein II. Together, they adopted a daughter, Amy (born 1953) (<!--del_lnk--> ), but divorced three years later. In 1957 Fonda married Italian <!--del_lnk--> Countess <!--del_lnk--> Afdera Franchetti (<!--del_lnk--> ). They remained married until 1961. Soon after, Fonda married <!--del_lnk--> Shirlee Mae Adams and remained with her until his death in 1982.<p>His relationship with his children has been described as &quot;emotionally distant&quot;. In Peter Fonda&#39;s 1998 autobiography <i>Don&#39;t Tell Dad</i>, he described how he was never sure how his father felt about him, and that he did not tell his father he loved him until his father was elderly and he finally heard the words, &quot;I love you, son&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> ). His daughter, Jane, rejected her father&#39;s friendships with right-wingers such as <!--del_lnk--> Republican actors such as <!--del_lnk--> John Wayne, and as a result, their relationship was extremely strained.<p>Jane Fonda also reported feeling detached from her father, especially during her early acting career. Henry Fonda introduced her to <!--del_lnk--> Lee Strasberg, who became her acting teacher, and as she developed as an actress using the techniques of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Method,&quot; she found herself frustrated and unable to understand her father&#39;s effortless acting style. In the late 1950s, when she asked him how he prepared before going on stage, he baffled her by answering, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know, I stand there, I think about my wife, Afdera, I don&#39;t know.&quot;<p>Writer Al Aronowitz, while working on a profile of Jane Fonda for <i><!--del_lnk--> The Saturday Evening Post</i> in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about Method acting: &quot;I can&#39;t articulate about the Method,&quot; he told me, &quot;because I never studied it. I don&#39;t mean to suggest that I have any feelings one way or the other about it...I don&#39;t know what the Method is and I don&rsquo;t care what the Method is. Everybody&#39;s got a method. Everybody can&rsquo;t articulate about their method, and I can&#39;t, if I have a method&mdash;and Jane sometimes says that I use the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&quot;<p>Fonda&#39;s daughter shared this view: &quot;My father can&#39;t articulate the way he works.&quot; Jane said. &quot;He just can&#39;t do it. He&#39;s not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for me to try to articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, &#39;Shut up, I don&#39;t want to hear about it.&rsquo; He didn&rsquo;t want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it.&quot;<p><a id="Late_career" name="Late_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Late career</span></h3>
      <p>Despite approaching his seventies, Henry Fonda continued to work in both television and film through the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s. In <!--del_lnk--> 1970 Fonda appeared in three films, the most successful of these ventures being <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cheyenne Social Club</i>. The other two films were <i><!--del_lnk--> Too Late the Hero</i>, in which Fonda played a secondary role, and <i><!--del_lnk--> There Was a Crooked Man</i>, about Paris Pitman Jr. (played by <!--del_lnk--> Kirk Douglas) trying to escape from an Arizona prison.<p>Fonda made a return to both foreign and television productions, which provided career sustenance through a decade in which many aging screen actors suffered waning careers. He starred in the <!--del_lnk--> ABC television series <i>The Smith Family</i> between 1971 and 1972. 1973&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> TV-movie <i>The Red Pony</i>, an adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> John Steinbeck&#39;s novel, earned Fonda an <!--del_lnk--> Emmy nomination. After the unsuccessful <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood melodrama, <i>Ash Wednesday</i>, he filmed three <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> productions released in 1973 and 1974. The most successful of these, <i>Il Mio nome &egrave; Nessuno</i> (<i>My Name Is Nobody</i>), presented Fonda in a rare comedic performance as an old gunslinger whose plans to retire are dampened by a &quot;fan&quot; of sorts.<p>Henry Fonda continued stage acting throughout his last years, including several demanding roles in <!--del_lnk--> Broadway plays. He returned to Broadway in 1974 for the biographical drama, <i><!--del_lnk--> Clarence Darrow</i>, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award. Fonda&#39;s health had been deteriorating for years, but his first outward symptoms occurred after a performance of the play in April 1974, when he collapsed from exhaustion. After the appearance of a <!--del_lnk--> heart arrhythmia, a pacemaker was installed and Fonda returned to the play in 1975. After the run of a 1978 play, <i>First Monday of October</i>, he took the advice of his doctors and quit plays, though he continued to star in films and television.<p>In 1976, Fonda appeared in several notable television productions, the first being <i>Collision Course</i>, the story of the volatile relationship between President Harry Truman (<!--del_lnk--> E.G. Marshall) and General MacArthur (Fonda), produced by ABC. After an appearance in the acclaimed <!--del_lnk--> Showtime broadcast of <i>Almos&#39; a Man</i>, based on a story by <!--del_lnk--> Richard Wright, he starred in the epic <!--del_lnk--> NBC miniseries <i>Captains and Kings</i>, based on <!--del_lnk--> Taylor Caldwell&#39;s novel. Three years later, he appeared in ABC&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Roots: The Next Generations</i>, but the miniseries was overshadowed by its predecessor, <i><!--del_lnk--> Roots</i>. Also in 1976, Fonda starred in the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> blockbuster <i><!--del_lnk--> Midway</i>.<p>Fonda finished the 1970s in a number of <!--del_lnk--> disaster films. The first of these was the 1977 Italian killer <!--del_lnk--> octopus thriller <i>Tentacoli</i> (<i>Tentacles</i>) and the mediocre <i><!--del_lnk--> Rollercoaster</i>, in which Fonda appeared with <!--del_lnk--> Richard Widmark and a young <!--del_lnk--> Helen Hunt. He performed once again with Widmark, <!--del_lnk--> Olivia de Havilland, <!--del_lnk--> Fred MacMurray, and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Ferrer in the <!--del_lnk--> killer bee action film <i>The Swarm</i>. He also acted in the global disaster film <i><!--del_lnk--> Meteor</i>, with <!--del_lnk--> Natalie Wood and <!--del_lnk--> Martin Landau, and then the <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> production <i><!--del_lnk--> City on Fire</i>, which also featured <!--del_lnk--> Shelley Winters and <!--del_lnk--> Ava Gardner.<p>As Fonda&#39;s health continued to suffer and he took longer breaks between filming, critics began to take notice of his extensive body of work. In 1979, the <!--del_lnk--> Tony Awards committee gave Fonda a special award for his achievements on Broadway. Lifetime Achievement awards from the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globes and <!--del_lnk--> Academy Awards followed in 1980 and 1981, respectively.<p>Fonda continued to act into the early 1980s, though all but one of the productions he was featured in before his death were for television. These television works included the critically acclaimed live performance of <!--del_lnk--> Preston Jones&#39; <i>The Oldest Living Graduate</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Emmy nominated <i><!--del_lnk--> Gideon&#39;s Trumpet</i> (co-starring <!--del_lnk--> Fay Wray in her last performance), and 1981&#39;s <i>Summer Solstice</i>, which teamed Fonda with the legendary <!--del_lnk--> Myrna Loy for the first time. This is the last film on which Henry Fonda worked, and work began on it following the release of <i><!--del_lnk--> On Golden Pond</i>, an adaptation of <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Thompson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> On Golden Pond</i>.<p>The film, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Rydell, provided unprecedented collaborations between Fonda, <!--del_lnk--> Katharine Hepburn, and Fonda&#39;s daughter, <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Fonda.htm" title="Jane Fonda">Jane</a>. When premiered in December 1981, the film was well received by critics, and after a <!--del_lnk--> limited release on <!--del_lnk--> December 4 <i>On Golden Pond</i> developed enough of an audience to be widely released on <!--del_lnk--> January 22. With eleven <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award nominations, the film earned nearly $120 million at the box office, becoming an unexpected blockbuster. In addition to wins for Hepburn (Best Actress), and Thompson (Screenplay), <i>On Golden Pond</i> brought Fonda his only Oscar for Best Actor (it also earned him a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Best Actor award).
