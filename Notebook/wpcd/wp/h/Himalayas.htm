      <p>The Himalaya range runs for about 2,400 km, from <!--del_lnk--> Nanga Parbat (Pakistan) in the west to <!--del_lnk--> Namche Barwa in the east. The width varies between 250-300 km. The Himalayan range comprises three parallel ranges, arranged by elevation and geological age.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The youngest of the three is called the <!--del_lnk--> Sub-Himalayan Range (<i><!--del_lnk--> Shivalik Hills</i>) and has an elevation of about 1,200 m. This range is made up of erosion material from the rising Himalaya. Running parallel to this is the <!--del_lnk--> Lower Himalayan Range, which has an elevation between 2,000&ndash;5,000 m. The northernmost range is called the <!--del_lnk--> Great Himalayas and is also the oldest of the three. It has an elevation of more than 6,000 m and contains a large number of the world&#39;s highest peaks including the three highest, <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Everest.htm" title="Mount Everest">Mount Everest</a>, <!--del_lnk--> K2 and <!--del_lnk--> Kangchenjunga. Much of <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> lies in the Himalaya. The <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistani states</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Baltistan and Indian states of <!--del_lnk--> Jammu and Kashmir, <!--del_lnk--> Himachal Pradesh, <!--del_lnk--> Uttaranchal, <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Arunachal Pradesh lie mostly in the Himalaya. A very small portion of southeastern <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> also lies in the Himalaya. (However, the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Plateau is by definition beyond the Himalaya, and thereby not part of it). It is in fact just north of India and Bangladesh.<p><a id="Ecology" name="Ecology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecology</span></h2>
      <p>The flora and fauna of the Himalayas varies with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the front of the range. This diversity of climate, altitude, rainfall and soil conditions generates a variety of distinct plant and animal communities, or <!--del_lnk--> ecoregions.<p><a id="Lowland_forests" name="Lowland_forests"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lowland forests</span></h3>
      <p>On the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Gangetic plain at the base of the mountains, an <!--del_lnk--> alluvial plain drained by the Indus and Ganges-Brahmaputra river systems, vegetation varies from west to east with rainfall. The <!--del_lnk--> xeric <!--del_lnk--> Northwestern thorn scrub forests occupy the plains of Pakistan and the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Punjab. Further east lie the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests of <!--del_lnk--> Uttar Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Lower Gangetic plains moist deciduous forests of <!--del_lnk--> Bihar and <!--del_lnk--> West Bengal. These are monsoon forests, with drought-deciduous trees that lose their leaves during the dry season. The moister <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests occupy the plains of <!--del_lnk--> Assam.<p><a id="The_Terai_belt" name="The_Terai_belt"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Terai belt</span></h3>
      <p>Above the alluvial plain lies the <!--del_lnk--> Terai strip, a seasonally marshy zone of sand and clay soils. The Terai has higher rainfall than the plains, and the downward-rushing rivers of the Himalaya slow down and spread out in the flatter Terai zone, depositing fertile silt during the monsoon season and receding in the dry season. The Terai has a high water table, and the central part of the Terai belt is occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands, a mosaic of grasslands, savannas, deciduous and evergreen forests that includes some of the world&#39;s tallest grasslands. The grasslands of the Terai belt are home to the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Rhinoceros <i>(Rhinoceros unicornis)</i>.<p><a id="The_Bhabhar_belt" name="The_Bhabhar_belt"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Bhabhar belt</span></h3>
      <p>Above the Terai belt is an upland zone known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bhabhar, with porous and rocky soils, made up of debris washed down from the higher ranges. The Bhabhar and the lower Siwalik ranges have a subtropical climate. The <!--del_lnk--> Himalayan subtropical pine forests occupy the western end of the subtropical belt, with forests dominated by <!--del_lnk--> Chir Pine <i>(Pinus roxburghii)</i>. The central part of the range is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests, dominated by <!--del_lnk--> sal <i>(Shorea robusta)</i>.<p><a id="Montane_forests" name="Montane_forests"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Montane forests</span></h3>
      <p>At the middle elevations of the range, the subtropical forests yield to a belt of <!--del_lnk--> temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, with the <!--del_lnk--> Western Himalayan broadleaf forests at the western end of the range, and the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

      <p>The Himalayas are among the youngest mountain ranges on the planet. According to the modern theory of <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, their formation is a result of a <!--del_lnk--> continental collision or <!--del_lnk--> orogeny along the <!--del_lnk--> convergent boundary between the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Australian Plate and the <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian Plate. The collision began in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Upper Cretaceous</a> period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate, moving at about 15 cm/year, collided with the Eurasian Plate. By about 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the <!--del_lnk--> Tethys Ocean, whose existence has been determined by <!--del_lnk--> sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a> that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards. The <!--del_lnk--> Arakan Yoma highlands in <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> were also formed as a result of this collision.<p>The Indo-Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm/year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500 <!--del_lnk--> km into Asia. About 2 cm/year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by <!--del_lnk--> thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm/year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region <!--del_lnk--> seismically active, leading to <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> from time to time.<p><a id="Glaciers_and_river_systems" name="Glaciers_and_river_systems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Glaciers and river systems</span></h2>

       <li>The western rivers combine into the <i>Indus Basin</i>, of which the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus River</a> is the largest. The Indus begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows southwest through <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian Sea. It is fed by the <!--del_lnk--> Jhelum, the <!--del_lnk--> Chenab, the <!--del_lnk--> Ravi, the <!--del_lnk--> Beas, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sutlej rivers, among others.<li>Most of the other Himalayan rivers drain the <i>Ganga-Brahmaputra Basin</i>. Its two main rivers are the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmaputra. The Ganga originates as the <!--del_lnk--> Bhagirathi from the <!--del_lnk--> Gangotri glacier and flows southeast through the plains of northern India, fed by the <!--del_lnk--> Alaknanda and the <!--del_lnk--> Yamuna among other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the <!--del_lnk--> Tsangpo in western Tibet, and flows east through <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> and west through the plains of <!--del_lnk--> Assam.

      <p>The Himalaya region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most lakes are found at altitudes of less than 5,000 m, with the size of the lakes diminishing with altitude. The largest lake is the <!--del_lnk--> Pangong t&#39;so, which is spread across the border between India and Tibet. It is situated at an altitude of 4,600 m, and is 8 km wide and nearly 134 km long. A notable high (but not the highest) lake is the <!--del_lnk--> Gurudogmar in <!--del_lnk--> North Sikkim at an altitude of 5,148 m (16,890 feet) (altitude source: <!--del_lnk--> SRTM). Other major lakes include the <!--del_lnk--> Tsongmo lake, near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.<p>The mountain lakes are known to geographers as <i><!--del_lnk--> tarns</i> if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.

It also forms a barrier for the <!--del_lnk--> monsoon winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the <!--del_lnk--> Terai region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of <!--del_lnk--> Central Asian deserts such as the <!--del_lnk--> Taklamakan and <!--del_lnk--> Gobi <!--del_lnk--> deserts.<p>The mountain ranges also prevent western winter disturbances from <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> from traveling further, resulting in snow in <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> and rainfall for parts of <!--del_lnk--> Punjab and northern India. Despite being a barrier to the cold northernly winter winds, the Brahmaputra valley receives part of the frigid winds, thus lowering the temperature in the <!--del_lnk--> northeast Indian states and <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>. These winds also cause the North East monsoon during this season for these parts.<p>The weather phenomenon called <!--del_lnk--> Jet Stream in turn affects how we view the highest peaks on earth, as the strong stream of winds from the west often pass through Everest, creating a familiar plume of snows blowing from the summit.<p><a id="Mountain_passes" name="Mountain_passes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mountain passes</span></h2>

      <p>The Himalayas, due to their large size and expanse, have been a natural barrier to the movement of people for tens of thousands of years. In particular, this has prevented intermingling of people from the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent with people from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, causing significantly different languages and customs between these regions. The Himalayas have also hindered trade routes and prevented military expeditions across its expanse. For instance, <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> could not expand his empire south of the Himalayas into the subcontinent.<p><a id="Himal" name="Himal"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Himal</span></h2>
