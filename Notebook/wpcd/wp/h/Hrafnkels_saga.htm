      <p><i><b>Hrafnkels saga</b></i> (<span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> [&#x2C8;r&#x325;apnc&#x25B;ls &#x2CC;sa&#x2D0;&#x263;a]</span> ) is one of the <!--del_lnk--> Icelanders&#39; sagas. It tells of struggles between chieftains and farmers in the east of Iceland in the 10th century. The <!--del_lnk--> eponymous main character, Hrafnkell, starts out his career as a fearsome <!--del_lnk--> duellist and a dedicated worshipper of the god <!--del_lnk--> Freyr. After suffering defeat, humiliation, and the destruction of his <!--del_lnk--> temple, he becomes an <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a>. His character changes and he becomes more peaceful in dealing with others. After gradually rebuilding his power base for several years, he achieves revenge against his enemies and lives out the rest of his life as a powerful and respected chieftain. The saga has been interpreted as the story of a man who arrives at the conclusion that the true basis of power does not lie in the favour of the gods but in the loyalty of one&#39;s subordinates.<p>The saga remains widely read today and is appreciated for its logical structure, plausibility, and vivid characters. For these reasons, it has served as a test case in the dispute on the origins of the Icelandic sagas.<p>

      <p>We learn of the <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegian</a> man <b>Hallfre&eth;r</b> who becomes one of the original settlers of Iceland, arriving on the east coast around the year 900 with his teenage son <b>Hrafnkell</b>, a promising young man. Hrafnkell has ambition and soon &ndash; with the permission of his father &ndash; establishes his own settlement. He selects an uninhabited valley for his farm and names it <b>A&eth;alb&oacute;l</b> (<i>Noble home</i>). The valley subsequently receives the name <b>Hrafnkelsdalr</b> (<i>Hrafnkell&#39;s valley</i>).<p>Hrafnkell also has a large temple erected and performs lavish <!--del_lnk--> sacrificial ceremonies. He dedicates the best of his <!--del_lnk--> livestock to his patron deity <!--del_lnk--> Freyr, including his favourite <!--del_lnk--> horse, <b>Freyfaxi</b>. He swears that he will kill anyone who rides Freyfaxi without permission. From his religious activities Hrafnkell comes to be known as <b>Freysgo&eth;i</b> (<i>Freyr&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> go&eth;i</i>).<p>Hrafnkell longs for power and soon establishes himself as a chieftain by bullying people in neighbouring valleys. He has a penchant for <!--del_lnk--> duels and never pays <!--del_lnk--> wergild for anyone he kills.<p>Now the saga introduces <b>Einarr</b>, a <!--del_lnk--> shepherd of Hrafnkell&#39;s. On one occasion Einarr needs to ride to perform his duties, but every horse he approaches runs away from him except Freyfaxi. He then takes Freyfaxi and rides him for the day. But after the horse has been ridden it runs home to A&eth;alb&oacute;l and starts neighing. On seeing his horse dirty and wet with sweat, Hrafnkell realises what has happened. He rides out with his axe and reluctantly kills Einarr to fulfil his oath.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Einarr&#39;s father, <b>&THORN;orbj&ouml;rn</b>, upset at the death of his son, goes to Hrafnkell to seek wergild. Hrafnkell tells him that he pays wergild for no man. He does, however, think that this killing was among the worst he has done and is prepared to make some amends. He makes a seemingly favourable offer to &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn of taking care of him for the rest of his days.<p>&THORN;orbj&ouml;rn, however, wants nothing short of a formal settlement as between equals. Upon Hrafnkell&#39;s rejection of this, &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn starts searching for ways to achieve satisfaction. The laws of the <!--del_lnk--> Icelandic Commonwealth guarantee every free man the same rights &mdash; but since no central executive power exists, a common man would have difficulty in prosecuting a chieftain. He would generally need the support of another chieftain, both for the complicated legal manoeuvring often necessary and, if successful at the assembly, for subsequently enforcing the verdict.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>&THORN;orbj&ouml;rn tries to get the support of his brother <b>Bjarni</b>, but the latter doesn&#39;t want to become involved in a dispute with the powerful Hrafnkell. &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn then goes to Bjarni&#39;s son, <b>S&aacute;mr</b>. He, in turn, first advises &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn to accept Hrafnkell&#39;s offer but &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn remains adamant. S&aacute;mr has no desire to join the conflict, but after his uncle gets emotional he reluctantly agrees. S&aacute;mr formally accepts the case from &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn so that he effectively becomes the plaintiff.<p>S&aacute;mr starts preparing the case against Hrafnkell and summons him to the <!--del_lnk--> Al&thorn;ing the next summer. Hrafnkell regards the attempt as laughable. When S&aacute;mr and &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn reach the assembly at <!--del_lnk--> &THORN;ingvellir they quickly discover that no major chieftain wants to aid them. The emotional &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn now wants to give up, but S&aacute;mr insists they must proceed one way or the other.<p>By a coincidence S&aacute;mr and &THORN;orbj&ouml;rn meet <b>&THORN;orkell</b>, a young adventurer from <b>Vestfir&eth;ir</b> (<i>West fjords</i>). He sympathises with their cause and helps them achieve the support of his brother <b>&THORN;orgeirr</b>, a powerful chieftain. With &THORN;orgeirr&#39;s support S&aacute;mr competently prosecutes the case. The law finds Hrafnkell guilty, and he rides home to A&eth;alb&oacute;l. S&aacute;mr now has the right to kill Hrafnkell and confiscate his property. One early morning S&aacute;mr, supported by &THORN;orgeirr and &THORN;orkell, arrives at A&eth;alb&oacute;l, surprising and capturing Hrafnkell while he sleeps.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>S&aacute;mr offers Hrafnkell two options: firstly execution on the spot; or secondly to live as S&aacute;mr&#39;s subordinate, stripped of his honour and most of his property. Hrafnkell chooses to live. &THORN;orkell<sup>1</sup> cautions S&aacute;mr that he will regret sparing Hrafnkell&#39;s life.<p>S&aacute;mr subsequently takes up residence at A&eth;alb&oacute;l and invites the locals for a feast. They agree to accept him as their new chieftain.<p>Hrafnkell builds himself a new home in another valley. His spirits and ambition remain unbroken, and after a few years of hard work he has again established himself as a respectable farmer.<p>&THORN;orkell and &THORN;orgeirr decide to &quot;deliver Freyfaxi to his owner&quot; and push him off a cliff. They also set fire to Hrafnkell&#39;s temple. Upon hearing this Hrafnkell remarks: <i>I think it is folly to have faith in gods,</i> and he never performs another sacrifice. His manner improves and he becomes much gentler with his subordinates. In this way he gains popularity and loyalty.<sup>2</sup><p>After six years of peace Hrafnkell decides the time for revenge has come. He receives news that S&aacute;mr&#39;s brother, <b>Eyvindr</b>, is travelling close by with a few companions. He gathers his own men and goes to attack him.

Hrafnkell then takes up residence at A&eth;alb&oacute;l, his old home, and resumes the duties of a chieftain.<p>S&aacute;mr rides west and again seeks the support of &THORN;orkell and &THORN;orgeirr, but they tell him he has only himself to blame for his misfortune. He should have killed Hrafnkell when he had the chance. They will not support S&aacute;mr in another struggle with Hrafnkell but offer him to move his residence to their region. He refuses and rides back home. S&aacute;mr lives as Hrafnkell&#39;s subordinate for the rest of his days, never achieving revenge.<p>Hrafnkell, on the other hand, lives as a respected leader till he meets a peaceful end.

      <p>The author of <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> remains completely unidentified. The text does not name him; nor does any other extant source. He was, however, certainly an Icelander and probably lived near the area which serves as the setting for the saga&#39;s events.<p>The precise time of composition of the saga also remains unknown, but the late 13th century seems most likely. The oldest extant manuscript uses <!--del_lnk--> vellum from the first half of the 15th century, but unfortunately only one page remains. Paper copies made from the complete manuscript preserve the full text of the saga. The partially extant skin manuscript may well have copied the original composition directly. In any case the saga seems well preserved, with little rewriting and few accidental errors.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>One class of paper manuscripts, <b>C</b> and <b>C1</b> in the diagram, contains a slightly different version of the saga with several, mostly minor, additions. Most scholars have considered it as derived from the same vellum manuscript as the others with additions from the author of <i><!--del_lnk--> Flj&oacute;tsd&aelig;la saga</i>. Thus they believe the shorter text closer to the original, and have given scant attention to the extended version.<p><a id="Publishing_history" name="Publishing_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Publishing history</span></h3>
      <p>P. G. Thorsen and Konr&aacute;&eth; G&iacute;slason gave the saga its first publication, in <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in 1839. Other important scholarly editions include those of J. Jakobsen in 1902-1903 and of J&oacute;n J&oacute;hannesson in 1950.<p>The saga has seen many popular editions and translations into a number of languages. The popular edition published by <!--del_lnk--> Halld&oacute;r Laxness in 1942 caused a stir as the first to use <!--del_lnk--> modern Icelandic spelling for a text in <!--del_lnk--> Old Icelandic. The edition&#39;s detractors rejected this approach as a perversion of the original text. Its supporters in response depicted the standardised <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse spelling as an artificial construct -- no closer to the actual manuscripts than the modern spelling -- and an unnecessary burden to the casual reader. The latter view won out and the sagas have since frequently appeared using modern spelling conventions.<p><a id="Modern_reception" name="Modern_reception"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern reception</span></h3>
      <p>Today <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> remains one of the most widely read sagas. Readers especially appreciate it for its cohesive and logical story line; along with its shortness, these qualities make it an ideal first read for newcomers to the sagas. It has served as a standard text in Icelandic high schools and as an introductory text for students of <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse. <!--del_lnk--> Sigur&eth;ur Nordal called it &quot;one of the most perfect short novels in world literature&quot;.<p><a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
      <p>Precisely the attributes which make <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> so accessible have served to make it an attractive target for different theories on the origins of the Icelandic sagas. Identical elements sometimes serve to support widely different theories.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
      <p>Some commentators have seen the sagas as largely historical accounts, preserved <!--del_lnk--> orally for hundreds of years until committed to writing by faithful scribes. Scholars in the 19th century especially espoused this view; it largely went out of fashion in academia by around 1940, although many amateurs still hold to it.<p>Many see <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> as a prime example of accurately preserved oral history. They find the saga inherently plausible in that its characters have <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logical</a> motivations and the results of their actions are realistic. The text has little supernatural content. It is short enough and cohesive enough for its oral preservation to be entirely plausible. Indeed the average modern reader can probably retell the story accurately after two or three readings.<p>But the historical interpretation ran into several problems. When compared with other sources on the same period, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</i>, discrepancies spring up. As one example, <i>Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</i> tells us that Hrafnkell had a father named Hrafn, but the saga names him Hallfre&eth;r. The saga&#39;s treatment of the laws of the time also shows inconsistencies with reliable sources.<p><a id="Literature" name="Literature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Literature</span></h3>
      <p>The historical inconsistencies and other difficulties led Sigur&eth;ur Nordal to write his groundbreaking book <i>Hrafnkatla</i> in 1940. He greatly expands upon previous criticism on the saga and draws on data from many areas to cast doubt on its historical veracity.<p>Aside from the conflicts with <i>Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</i> and the laws of the time, Sigur&eth;ur argues that the saga treats geographical facts incorrectly. He claims that the valleys used as the ostensible settings for the events of the story would never have allowed for as great a population as the saga assumes. He also states that the cliff near A&eth;alb&oacute;l, the alleged site of the killing of Freyfaxi, simply doesn&#39;t exist.<p>Sigur&eth;ur sees the saga&#39;s convincing narrative and characters as evidence that a single brilliant author composed it. According to Sigur&eth;ur the author cared little for historical accuracy, and insofar as he may have used any written historical sources, he changed them according to his own whim to fit the plot of the novella he wanted to write.<p><a id="Folklore" name="Folklore"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Folklore</span></h3>
      <p>Another school of thought regarding the origin of the sagas, which came into prominence in the second half of the 20th century, emphasises the elements of <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a> and the oral survival of legends for an extended period of time.<p>In some ways this marks a return to the old idea of oral preservation of the sagas, but the folklorists do not necessarily focus on historical accuracy. They apply modern research to determine which elements of a story seem likely to endure and which seem ephemeral. Theory suggests that core story lines of the sagas will preserve oral elements long-term, whereas one can expect details &ndash; such as the names of secondary characters &ndash; to change over the centuries.<p>The Icelandic scholar <!--del_lnk--> &Oacute;skar Halld&oacute;rsson wrote a short book on <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> criticising Sigur&eth;ur Nordal&#39;s previous work. According to &Oacute;skar such details as an incorrect name for Hrafnkell&#39;s father do not constitute valid evidence for the view of the saga as a 13th-century fiction. On the contrary, &Oacute;skar takes this as confirmation that the story of Hrafnkell survived independently in the east of Iceland, and changed in unimportant details, long after the composition of <i>Landn&aacute;mab&oacute;k</i>.<p>&Oacute;skar traces the story of Freyfaxi back to horse-worship among Indo-European peoples, and in his opinion such mythic or folkloric themes strengthen the case for the oral preservation of elements of <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> since <!--del_lnk--> heathen times.<p><a id="Recent_views" name="Recent_views"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent views</span></h3>
      <p>The controversy on <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> remains unsettled. In a 1988 book, <!--del_lnk--> Hermann P&aacute;lsson again completely dismisses the idea of an oral tradition and seeks the origins of the saga in mediaeval European ideas. In a departure from previous scholarship, Hermann based his research on the extended version of the saga.<p><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;n Hnefill A&eth;alsteinsson, in his 2000 book on the saga, emphasises its heathen religious elements. While acknowledging that a large part of the story line probably represents 13th-century fiction, J&oacute;n Hnefill finds evidence of an oral tradition in such aspects of the story as Hrafnkell&#39;s sacrifices and the behaviour of Freyfaxi.<p><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;nas Kristj&aacute;nsson, in his 1988 work on the sagas, summed up the argument on <i>Hrafnkels saga</i> when he said that the great interest in it &quot;has led to deeper consideration of other texts ... It has become a test-case, the classic example, in the discussion of relations between unsophisticated oral story-telling and learned well-read authors, between inherited pragmatic attitudes and imported <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> ethics.&quot;<h2> <span class="mw-headline">English translations</span></h2>
