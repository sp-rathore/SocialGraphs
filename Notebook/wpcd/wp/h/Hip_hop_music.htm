      <p><b>Hip hop music</b>, also known as <b>rap music</b>, is a style of music which came into existence in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> during the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1970s, and became a large part of modern pop culture during the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s. It consists of two main components: <a href="../../wp/r/Rapping.htm" title="Rapping">rapping</a> (<!--del_lnk--> MCing) and <!--del_lnk--> DJing (<!--del_lnk--> production and <!--del_lnk--> scratching). Along with <!--del_lnk--> hip hop dance (notably <!--del_lnk--> breakdancing) and urban inspired art, or notably <!--del_lnk--> graffiti, these compose the four elements of <!--del_lnk--> hip hop, a cultural movement that was initiated by <!--del_lnk--> inner-city youth, mostly <!--del_lnk--> African Americans and Latinosin <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, in the early 1970s.<p>Typically, hip hop music consists of rhythmic lyrics making use of techniques like <!--del_lnk--> assonance, <!--del_lnk--> alliteration, and <!--del_lnk--> rhyme. The rapper is accompanied by an instrumental track, usually referred to as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> beat,&quot; performed by a <!--del_lnk--> DJ, created by a <!--del_lnk--> producer, or one or more instrumentalists. Historically, this beat has often been created using a <!--del_lnk--> sample of the <!--del_lnk--> percussion break of another song: usually <!--del_lnk--> funk and <!--del_lnk--> soul recordings have been utilized. However, in recent years, it has become more common for the beat to be built up from individual drum samples. In addition to the beat, other sounds are often sampled, synthesized, or performed. Sometimes a track can be <!--del_lnk--> instrumental, as a showcase of the skills of the DJ or producer.<p>Hip hop began in <!--del_lnk--> The Bronx, a <!--del_lnk--> borough in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, when DJs began isolating the percussion break from funk and <!--del_lnk--> disco songs. The early role of the MC was to introduce the DJ and the music and to keep the audience excited. MCs began by speaking between songs, giving exhortations to dance, greetings to audience members, jokes and anecdotes. Eventually this practice became more stylized and became known as <i><a href="../../wp/r/Rapping.htm" title="Rapping">rapping</a></i>. By <!--del_lnk--> 1979, hip hop had become a commercially popular music genre and began to enter the American mainstream. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, a form of hip hop called <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rap became a major part of <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Music of the United States">American music</a>, causing significant controversy over lyrics which were perceived as promoting violence, promiscuity, drug use and <!--del_lnk--> misogyny. Nevertheless, by the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> 2000s, hip hop was a staple of popular music charts and was being performed in many styles across the world.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The main historical eras of hip hop are the <!--del_lnk--> old school hip hop era (1970 to 1985), which spanned from the beginning of hip hop until its emergence into the mainstream, and the <!--del_lnk--> golden age hip hop era (1985 to 1993), which consolidated the sounds of the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast and the <!--del_lnk--> West Coast and transitioned into the modern era with the rise of <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rap and <!--del_lnk--> G-funk, created by the West Coast. The years after 1993 contain the <!--del_lnk--> hardcore hip hop, bling, and underground genres, which largely define the modern era.<p>Hip hop arose during the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s at <!--del_lnk--> block parties in New York City, at which the DJs began isolating the <!--del_lnk--> percussion breaks to hit funk, soul, R&amp;B and disco songs. These songs were based on &ndash; &quot;breakbeat&quot; DJing. Early hip hop rhythms and (sampled) riffs were derived essentially from funk music. Some funk songs, such as <!--del_lnk--> James Brown&#39;s &quot;Payback&quot; (1974) are clearly predicting hip hop music and also speaking over the music was used extensively in funk, most notably on records produced by <!--del_lnk--> George Clinton. As hip hop became popular, performers began speaking while the music played, and became known as <i>MCs</i> or <i>emcees</i>. In 1979, the first commercially issued hip hop recordings were released: &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rapper&#39;s Delight&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> The Sugarhill Gang which became a Top 40 hit on the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Billboard pop singles chart. &#39;Rapper&#39; in reference to music was actually coined by this song. Some historians cite King Tim III (Personality Jock) by the Fatback Band to be the first commercially released hip hop recording but they were a funk and disco group.<p>During the 1980s, hip hop began to diversify and develop into a more complex form. At the same time, more sophisticated techniques were developed, including <!--del_lnk--> scratching, and electronic recording. In the late 1980s, a number of new hip hop styles and subgenres began appearing as the genre gained popularity. Hip hop musicians collaborated with rock bands and spread out into the genres of <!--del_lnk--> conscious hip hop, <!--del_lnk--> jazz-rap and <!--del_lnk--> gangsta rap.<p>In the 1990s, a prolonged confrontation between West Coast gangsta rappers and the resurging East Coast began. It centered around <a href="../../wp/t/Tupac_Shakur.htm" title="Tupac Shakur">Tupac Shakur</a> and <!--del_lnk--> The Notorious B.I.G. and led to both of their deaths, in 1996 and 1997 respectively. In 1996, Cleveland-based rap group <!--del_lnk--> Bone Thugs-N-Harmony tied <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>&#39; 32-year-old record for fastest-rising single with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tha Crossroads,&quot; and in 2000, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish-American <!--del_lnk--> White rapper <!--del_lnk--> Eminem&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Marshall Mathers LP</i> sold over nine million copies and won a <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award.<p><a id="Social_impact" name="Social_impact"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Social impact</span></h2>
      <p>Hip hop music is a part of hip hop, a cultural movement that includes the activities of breakdancing and graffiti art, as well as associated slang, <!--del_lnk--> fashion and other elements. The popularity of music has helped to popularize hip hop culture, both in the United States and to a lesser degree abroad.<p><a id="Lifestyle" name="Lifestyle"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Lifestyle</span></h3>
      <p>The late 1990s saw the rise in popularity of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bling-bling&quot; lifestyle in rap music, focusing on symbols of wealth and status like money, jewelry, cars, and clothing. Although references to wealth have existed since the birth of hip hop, the new, intensified &quot;bling-bling&quot; culture has its immediate roots in the enormously commercially successful late-to-mid nineties work (specifically, music videos) of <!--del_lnk--> Puff Daddy and <!--del_lnk--> Bad Boy Records as well as <!--del_lnk--> Master P&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> No Limit Records. However, the term was coined in 1999 (see <!--del_lnk--> 1999 in music) by <!--del_lnk--> Cash Money Records artist Lil&#39; Wayne on B.G.&#39;s hit single &quot;Bling-Bling&quot;, and the Cash Money roster were perhaps the epitome of the &quot;bling-bling&quot; lifestyle and attitude. Though many rappers, mostly gangsta rappers, unapologetically pursue and celebrate bling-bling, others, mostly artists outside of the hip hop mainstream, have expressly criticized the idealized pursuit of bling-bling as being <!--del_lnk--> materialistic.<p><a id="Product_Placement.2C_Advertising_and_Shilling" name="Product_Placement.2C_Advertising_and_Shilling"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Product Placement, Advertising and Shilling</span></h3>
      <p>For many years rap music has included <!--del_lnk--> product placement for cars, alcoholic drinks, clothing and other products. Rappers will discuss at length the cars they drive and the drinks they consume and glorify the excess, decadence and luxury.<p><a id="Homophobia" name="Homophobia"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Homophobia</span></h3>
      <p>Because hip hop music almost always puts an emphasis on hyper-masculinity, its lyrics have been said to reflect a <!--del_lnk--> homophobic mindset. It is often suspected that there are a great number of gay or lesbian hip hop musicians who do not come out of the closet, for fear of the decline of their career. Rumors of such have involved hip hop artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Queen Latifah, <!--del_lnk--> Da Brat, and several others. In 2001, the first annual <!--del_lnk--> PeaceOUT World Homo Hop Festival, which features performers by openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered rappers was held in Oakland, California, and the festival, curated by artist/activist <!--del_lnk--> Juba Kalamka, has continued on an annual basis since then. In 2003 the openly gay hip hop and rap artist <!--del_lnk--> Caushun, was rumored to have signed to the <!--del_lnk--> Baby Phat imprint (a project of Kimora Lee Simmons,at the time married to hip hop mogul <!--del_lnk--> Russell Simmons); however, his record was apparently never released. In September 2005, the documentary <i><!--del_lnk--> Pick Up the Mic</i> premiered at the <!--del_lnk--> 30th Annual Toronto International Film Festival, focusing on LGBT hip hop performers, such as Kalamka&#39;s group <!--del_lnk--> Deep Dickollective, <!--del_lnk--> JenRO, <!--del_lnk--> Tori Fixx and the duo <!--del_lnk--> God-Des and She.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>
      <p>Hip hop has a distinctive <!--del_lnk--> slang. Due to hip hop&#39;s extraordinary commercial success in the late nineties and early 21st century, many of these words have been assimilated into many different dialects across America and the world and even to non-hip hop fans (the word <i><!--del_lnk--> dis</i> for example is remarkably prolific). There are also words like <i><!--del_lnk--> homie</i> which predate hip hop but are often associated with it. Sometimes, terms like <i>what the dilly, yo</i> are popularized by a single song (in this case, &quot;Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> Busta Rhymes) and are only used briefly. Of special importance is the rule-based slang of <!--del_lnk--> Snoop Dogg and <!--del_lnk--> E-40, who <!--del_lnk--> add <i>-izz</i> to the middle of words so that <i>shit</i> becomes <i>shizznit</i> (the addition of the <i>n</i> occurs occasionally as well). This practice, with origins in <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Smith&#39;s non-sensical language from his 1980 single &quot;Double Dutch Bus,&quot; has spread to even non-hip hop fans, who may be unaware of its derivation.<p><a id="Censorship_issues" name="Censorship_issues"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Censorship issues</span></h3>
      <p>Hip hop has probably encountered more problems with censorship than any other form of popular music in recent years, due to the use of expletives. It also receives flak for being <!--del_lnk--> anti-establishment, and many of its songs depict wars and <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39; etats that in the end overthrows the government. For example, Public Enemy&#39;s &quot;Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need&quot; song was edited without their permission, removing the words &quot;free <!--del_lnk--> Mumia&quot;. The pervasive use of <!--del_lnk--> profanity in many songs has created challenges in the broadcast of such material both on television stations such as <!--del_lnk--> MTV, in <!--del_lnk--> music video form, and on radio. As a result, many hip hop recordings are broadcast in censored form, with offending language blanked out of the soundtrack (though usually leaving the backing music intact), or even replaced with completely different lyrics. The result &ndash; which quite often renders the remaining lyrics unintelligible or contradictory to the original recording &ndash; has become almost as widely identified with the genre as any other aspect of the music, and has been parodied in films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Austin Powers in Goldmember</i>, in which a character &ndash; performing in a parody of a hip hop music video &ndash; performs an entire verse that is blanked out.<p>In 1995 <!--del_lnk--> Roger Ebert wrote:<table align="center" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; background-color:transparent;">

      <p>Although hip hop music originated in the US, it has spread throughout the world. Hip hop was almost entirely unknown outside of the United States prior to the 1980s. During that decade, it began its spread to every continent and became a part of the music scene in dozens of countries. The spread of the music was intertwined with that of <!--del_lnk--> hip hop culture - as elements such as <!--del_lnk--> breakdancing gained popularity, so did rappers and hip hop groups. Today <!--del_lnk--> Eminem &amp; <a href="../../wp/t/Tupac_Shakur.htm" title="Tupac Shakur">2 Pac</a> are among the best selling artists and also best selling ever with close to 80 million albums sold each.<p><a id="Europe" name="Europe"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Europe</span></h3>

      <p>In the late 1990s many hip hop artists were gaining an underground following including <!--del_lnk--> Roots Manuva and <!--del_lnk--> Blak Twang. Since the year 2000 acts such as <!--del_lnk--> The Streets, <!--del_lnk--> So Solid Crew, <!--del_lnk--> Dizzee Rascal, <!--del_lnk--> Goldie Lookin Chain, have enjoyed mainstream success. The popularity of <!--del_lnk--> garage music and <!--del_lnk--> grime which also feature emceeing have helped to boost the growth in popularity of <!--del_lnk--> UK hip hop.

      <p>Hip hop first appeared in France in 1979, just as the genre was achieving some success in the US. By 1982, a number of hip hop radio stations had appeared, including Rapper Dapper Snapper, and the future star DJ Dee Nasty made his first appearance. That same year saw the first major hip hop concert, the New York City Rap Tour, sponsored by Europe 1 and featuring Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmixer DST, Fab 5 Freddy, Mr Freeze and the Rock Steady Crew.<p>By 1983, hip hop was a notable part of the French music scene. <!--del_lnk--> Dee Nasty&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Paname City Rappin&#39;</i>, released in 1984, was the first French hip hop record. <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> produced a number of native-born stars, such as <!--del_lnk--> IAM and <!--del_lnk--> Supr&ecirc;me NTM, though the most famous French rapper is probably the Senegalese-born <!--del_lnk--> MC Solaar.<p>In Europe, hip hop was the domain of both ethnic nationals and immigrants.<p><a id="Germany" name="Germany"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a></span></h4>
      <p>Germany, for example, produced the well-known <!--del_lnk--> Optik Army and its frontman <!--del_lnk--> Kool Savas as well as several other rap combos like <!--del_lnk--> Aggro Berlin, <!--del_lnk--> Die Fantastischen Vier, <!--del_lnk--> Ersguterjunge, <!--del_lnk--> Fettes Brot, <!--del_lnk--> Amstaff or <!--del_lnk--> Shok Muzik.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Danish hip hop was pioneered by the influential group <!--del_lnk--> MC Einar, named satirically after their lead singer <!--del_lnk--> Einar Enemark. Artists of the 80&#39;s had very little commercial success, as all attention to the genre was given to contemporary pop-acts experimenting.

      <p>In Asia, the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> is said to have developed the first hip hop scene in all of Asia and the Pacific islands. The birth of Filipino hip hop music, or Pinoy Rap, occurred in the early 1980s with songs by Dyords Javier (&quot;Na Onseng Delight&quot;) and Vincent Dafalong (&quot;Nunal&quot;). The genre developed slowly during the 1980s but soon hit the mainstream with Francis Magalona&#39;s debut album, Yo! which included the nationalistic hit &quot;Mga Kababayan&quot; (My countrymen). Magalona, who rapped in both English and Tagalog became a pioneer in the genre and a superstar as a result. Mainstream stars rose to prominence in the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, led by <!--del_lnk--> Michael V., <!--del_lnk--> Rap Asia, <!--del_lnk--> MC Lara and <!--del_lnk--> Lady Diane, and in Japan, where underground rappers had previously found a limited audience, and popular <!--del_lnk--> teen idols brought a style called <!--del_lnk--> J-rap to the top of the charts in the middle of the 1990s.<p>In <a href="../../wp/s/Seoul.htm" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Korean hip hop scene has expanded into a form of cultural phenomenon. Some fans assert that Korean hip hop artists possess skills that can rival their U.S. counterparts. Notable performers include <!--del_lnk--> Jo PD, <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger, <!--del_lnk--> Psy, and <!--del_lnk--> Epik High. Some suggest that Korean hip hop music firmly stands as the respectable and socially-conscious antithesis to an often superficial and confused pop genre that pervades the Korean music industry.<p>Hip hop music started gaining popularity in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> in the mid-1990s. Famous mainstream Korean hip hop performers often resemble R&amp;B or pop music with artists mimicking the vocal (and dance) styles of rap acts from the United States. Early performers&mdash;who rarely penned their own songs&mdash;included <!--del_lnk--> Kim Gun Mo, <!--del_lnk--> Seo Taiji and Boys, <!--del_lnk--> Deux, and <!--del_lnk--> DJ DOC. The Korean language was initially used almost exclusively, unlike modern Korean hip hop songs that heavily incorporates English. <!--del_lnk--> Seo Taiji, coming from a questionable heavy metal music background, often featured heavy metal guitars in his mixes, and other artists also incorporated techno influences.<p>A few artists, including <!--del_lnk--> Seo Taiji and <!--del_lnk--> MC Sniper, also incorporated influences from traditional Korean music such as pansori or nongak (farmers&#39; music). It was evident that the first acts were mimicking popular American acts. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> Seo Taiji&#39;s &quot;Come Back Home&quot; has vocal/production style resembling Cypress Hill. The first &quot;rap&quot; album that featured rap in every track was <!--del_lnk--> Kim Jin Pyo&#39;s first album in 1997. According to <!--del_lnk--> Epik High&#39;s rapper Tablo, &quot;The form [of Korean Hip Hop], at least, has definitely been mastered now &mdash; the beats, the rhymes, the performances, the look &mdash; it&rsquo;s indistinguishable from the United States scene. The social relevance, however, has a long way to go. The message is slowly catching up to the medium.&quot;<p>Many rap artists have been successful in the mainstream of Korean music. These include performers such as <!--del_lnk--> Jinusean, <!--del_lnk--> 1TYM, <!--del_lnk--> MC Sniper, <!--del_lnk--> Jo PD, and <!--del_lnk--> Epik High. Other lesser known underground artists who focus mainly on using non-flashy beats and lyrical skill include <!--del_lnk--> Quiett, <!--del_lnk--> PaloAlto, <!--del_lnk--> TBNY, etc.<p>Korean American hip hop began in the United States in the mid 1990s, mainly attributed to the efforts of the Korean rapper duo Tiger JK and DJ Shine of <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger. <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger was created after the song &quot;Black Korea&quot; by Ice Cube and used music as a means of cultural exchange and as an attempt to promote racial harmony. Following the success of <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger, many new groups and production companies emerged to further popularize the musical style. In order to represent the elite group of Korea&#39;s best rappers, Tiger JK and <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger formed <!--del_lnk--> The Movement Crew (<!--del_lnk--> Bobby Kim, <!--del_lnk--> Drunken Tiger, <!--del_lnk--> Eun Ji-Won and <!--del_lnk--> Tasha Reid).<p>Japanese hip hop (nip hop or j-hip hop) is said to have begun in 1983 when Charlie Ahearn&#39;s Wild Style was shown in Tokyo. The movie focused on graffiti artists but also featured some early old school MCs like Busy Bee and Double Trouble, DJs like Grandmaster Flash and breakdancers like the Rock Steady Crew.<p>Following the showing, street musicians began to breakdance in Yoyogi Park. Crazy A soon emerged as a prominent b-boy, and he eventually founded the Rock Steady Crew Japan, while DJ Krush has become a world-renowned DJ after arising from the Yoyogi Park scene. More DJs followed, beginning in 1985. A year later, an all hip hop club opened in Shibuya. There was some hesitation at the time that the Japanese language, due to the lack of stress accents and highly variable verb endings, might prove unsuited for rapping. A few rappers emerged, however, including Ito Seiko, Chikado Haruo, Tinnie Punx and Takagi Kan.<p>In the 1990s, teen-oriented J rap music appeared, and hip hop entered the Japanese mainstream. The first hit was Scha Dara Parr&#39;s &quot;Kon&#39;ya wa Boogie Back&quot;. The following year saw &quot;Da.Yo.Ne.&quot; and &quot;Maicca&quot; by East End X Yuri go platinum. Lately hip-hop in Japan has split into two forms: normal, &quot;hardcore&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Japanese hip hop, and the somewhat &quot;weaker&quot;, more R&amp;B influenced <!--del_lnk--> J-Urban. The group most commonly cited as the originator of J-Urban music is the group <!--del_lnk--> m-flo (AKA &quot;mediarite flo). Originally composed of a single Japanese DJ (DJ Taku) and a single Korean-Japanese emcee (Verbal), they combined with a singer named LISA who is of Peruvian-Japanese descent. Their debut album, Planet Shining was released in 2000, and since then, many J-Urban acts such as <!--del_lnk--> Crystal Kay, <!--del_lnk--> AI, <!--del_lnk--> Heartsdales, and even collaborations with popstars like <!--del_lnk--> Namie Amuro and <!--del_lnk--> BoA. Other popular J-Urban acts like <!--del_lnk--> RIP SLYME have worked with m-flo.<p>Starting in the late 1990s, hip hop began gaining greater popularity in Greater China, beginning in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and eventually spreading to the Mainland. Taiwanese rapper MC Hot Dog gained stature with his creative beats, off-kilter flow, and vulgar depiction of life for disaffected middle class youth in the island nation. The hip hop collective Lazy Motherfucker, representing Hong Kong, have often been described as the Chinese Wu-Tang Clan given the large size of the group and their ill flow. However, frequent aesthetic misappropriations and shiny pop stylings have often left underground heads wanting.<p>It was hard for Asian hip-hop artists to break into the mainstream in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, but in 2002 <!--del_lnk--> Chinese-American rapper <!--del_lnk--> Jin Au-Yeung (better known as just Jin or Jin Tha Emcee), created a buzz. He won Freestyle Friday seven consecutive weeks on BET&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 106 &amp; Park, a show dedicated to hip-hop, and was retired. Jin announced he had signed with the label Ruff Ryders after he won the battle on his final week. This was a breakthrough for Asian-American artists, as he garnished much attention. Two years later, he released an album under Virgin/Ruff Ryder titled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rest Is History</i>. Jin became the first Asian-American to put out a solo album on the mainstream, though the album was not successful. Many hip hop lovers believe this was because of a lack of promotion as well as the album being pushed back seven months.<p><a id="Middle_East" name="Middle_East"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Middle East</span></h3>
