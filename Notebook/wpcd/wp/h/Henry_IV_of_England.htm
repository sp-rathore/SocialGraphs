      <p><b>Henry IV</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 3 April <!--del_lnk--> 1367 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 20 March <!--del_lnk--> 1413) was the King of England and France and Lord of Ireland from <!--del_lnk--> 1399 to <!--del_lnk--> 1413. He was born at <!--del_lnk--> Bolingbroke Castle in <!--del_lnk--> Lincolnshire, hence the other name by which he was known, &quot;Henry (of) Bolingbroke&quot;. His father, <!--del_lnk--> John of Gaunt, was the third and oldest surviving son of King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a>, and enjoyed a position of considerable influence during much of the reign of <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_II_of_England.htm" title="Richard II of England">Richard II</a>. Henry&#39;s mother was <!--del_lnk--> Blanche, heiress to the considerable Lancaster estates.<p>His half-sister <!--del_lnk--> Catalina Plantagenet by his father&#39;s second wife, <!--del_lnk--> Constanza of Castile ruled as co-consort of <!--del_lnk--> Castile. He also had four half-siblings by <!--del_lnk--> Katherine Swynford, his father&#39;s longtime mistress and eventual third wife. His relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> Beauforts and their mother was equivocal. He expressed resentment that his former governess had taken his mother&rsquo;s place, as well as the favour shown to them by their father. Upon his accession, he revoked his <!--del_lnk--> half-brother&rsquo;s marquessate, and passed further legal measures barring them from the throne. However, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Swynford, a son from Katherine&rsquo;s first marriage was a trusted and able companion.<p>Henry enjoyed a rather more equivocal relationship with Richard II than his father had: they were first cousins and childhood playmates. They were admitted together to the <a href="../../wp/o/Order_of_the_Garter.htm" title="Order of the Garter">Order of the Garter</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1377, but Henry participated in the <!--del_lnk--> Lords Appellant&rsquo;s rebellion against the king in <!--del_lnk--> 1387. After regaining power, Richard did not punish Henry (many of the other rebellious barons were executed or exiled). In fact, Richard elevated Henry from <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Derby to <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Hereford.<p>The relationship between Henry and the King reached a second crisis in <!--del_lnk--> 1398, when Richard banished Henry from the kingdom for ten years (with the approval of Henry&#39;s father, John of Gaunt) to avoid a blood feud between Henry and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, who was exiled for life. Henry spent a full year supporting the unsuccesfull seige of <!--del_lnk--> Vilnius (capital of Grand dutchy of <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>) by <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic knights with his 300 fellow knights.<p>The following year, however, John of Gaunt died, and without explanation, Richard cancelled the legal documents that would have allowed Henry to inherit Gaunt&#39;s land automatically -- instead, Henry would be required to ask for the lands from Richard. After some hesitation, Henry met with the exiled <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Arundel, former (and future) <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, who had lost his position because of his involvement with the Lords Appellant, and Henry and Arundel returned to England while Richard was on a military campaign in Ireland. With Arundel as his advisor, Henry Bolingbroke began a military campaign, confiscating land from those who opposed him and ordering his soldiers to destroy much of Cheshire. Quickly, Henry gained enough power and support to have himself declared King Henry IV, imprisoning King Richard (who died in prison under mysterious circumstances) and by-passing Richard&rsquo;s seven-year-old heir-presumptive <!--del_lnk--> Edmund de Mortimer. Henry&#39;s coronation, on <!--del_lnk--> 13 October <!--del_lnk--> 1399, is notable as the first time following the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest that the monarch made an address in <!--del_lnk--> English. Henry consulted with Parliament frequently, but was sometimes at odds with them, especially over ecclesiastical matters. On Arundel&#39;s advice, Henry passed the <i><!--del_lnk--> De heretico comburendo</i> and was thus the first English king to allow the burning of <!--del_lnk--> heretics, mainly to suppress the <!--del_lnk--> Lollard movement.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Rebellions continued throughout the first ten years of Henry&rsquo;s reign, including the revolt of <!--del_lnk--> Owain Glynd&#x175;r, who declared himself <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales in <!--del_lnk--> 1400, and the rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. The king&#39;s success in putting down these rebellions was due partly to the military ability of his eldest son, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_V_of_England.htm" title="Henry V of England">Henry</a>, who would later become king, though the son (who had maintained a close relationship with Richard II) managed to seize much effective power from his father in <!--del_lnk--> 1410.<p><a id="Foreign_relations" name="Foreign_relations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign relations</span></h3>
      <p>Early in his reign, Henry hosted the visit of <!--del_lnk--> Manuel II Palaiologos, the only Byzantine emperor ever to visit England, from December 1400 to January 1401 at <!--del_lnk--> Eltham Palace, with a <!--del_lnk--> joust being given in his honour. He also sent monetary support with him upon his departure to aid him against the Ottoman Empire.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1406, English pirates captured the future <!--del_lnk--> James I of Scotland off the coast of Flamborough Head as he was going to France. James remained a prisoner of Henry for the rest of Henry&#39;s reign.<p><a id="Final_illness_and_death" name="Final_illness_and_death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Final illness and death</span></h3>
      <p>The later years of Henry&#39;s reign were marked by serious health problems. He had a stepine disfiguring skin disease, and more seriously suffered acute attacks of some grave illness in June 1405, April 1406, June 1408, during the winter of 1408&ndash;09, December 1412, and then finally a fatal bout in March 1413. Medical historians have long debated the nature of this affliction or afflictions. The skin disease might have been <!--del_lnk--> leprosy (which in any case did not mean precisely the same thing as it does to modern medicine), perhaps <!--del_lnk--> psoriasis, perhaps a symptom of <!--del_lnk--> syphilis, or some other disease. The acute attacks have been given a wide range of explanations, from <!--del_lnk--> epilepsy to some form of cardiovascular disease. <p>It is said in <!--del_lnk--> Holinshed (and taken up in <!--del_lnk--> Shakespeare&#39;s play) that it was predicted to Henry he would die in Jerusalem. Henry took this to mean that he would die on <!--del_lnk--> crusade, but in fact it meant that, in <!--del_lnk--> 1413, he died in the <i>Jerusalem</i> Chamber in the house of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbot.htm" title="Abbot">Abbot</a> of <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster</a>. He died with his <!--del_lnk--> executor <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Langley at his side.<p><a id="Burial" name="Burial"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Burial</span></h3>
      <p>Unusually for a <!--del_lnk--> King of England, he was buried not at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> but at <a href="../../wp/c/Canterbury_Cathedral.htm" title="Canterbury Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>, on the north side of what is now the Trinity Chapel as near to the shrine of <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Becket.htm" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a> as possible. (No other <!--del_lnk--> kings are buried in the Cathedral, although his uncle the <!--del_lnk--> Black Prince is buried on the opposite, south side of the chapel, also as near the shrine as possible.) Becket&#39;s cult was then at its height, as evidenced by the <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury Tales by Richard and Henry&#39;s court poet <!--del_lnk--> Chaucer, and Henry was particularly devoted to it (he was anointed at his coronation with oil supposedly given to Becket by the Virgin Mary, which had then passed to Henry&#39;s father). Henry was given an <!--del_lnk--> alabaster effigy, alabaster being a valuable English export in the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>. His body was well embalmed, as a <!--del_lnk--> Victorian exhumation some centuries later established <p>

She was the widow of <!--del_lnk--> John IV of Brittany, with whom she had four daughters and four sons, but she and Henry had no children. The fact that in <!--del_lnk--> 1399 Henry had four sons from his first marriage was undoubtedly a clinching factor in his acceptance onto the throne.
