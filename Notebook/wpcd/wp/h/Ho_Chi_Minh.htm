      <p>Nguy&#x1EC5;n Sinh Cung was born in Ho&agrave;ng Tr&ugrave; Village (maternal hometown) and lived there from <!--del_lnk--> 1890 to <!--del_lnk--> 1895. He grew up in Kim Li&ecirc;n Village (paternal hometown), Nam &#x110;&agrave;nawr District, <!--del_lnk--> Ngh&#x1EC7; An Province, Vietnam. Following <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucian</a> traditions, he received the name Nguy&#x1EC5;n T&#x1EA5;t Th&agrave;nh at age 10. He had three siblings, his sister B&#x1EA1;ch Li&ecirc;n (or Nguy&#x1EC5;n Th&#x1ECB; Thanh) who worked as a clerk in the French Army, his brother <!--del_lnk--> Nguy&#x1EC5;n Sinh Khi&ecirc;m (or Nguy&#x1EC5;n T&#x1EA5;t &#x110;&#x1EA1;t), a <!--del_lnk--> geomancer and traditional herbalist and another brother (Nguy&#x1EC5;n Sinh Nhu&#x1EAD;n) who died in his infancy.<p>His father, Nguy&#x1EC5;n Sinh S&#x1EAF;c, was a Confucian scholar, and a teacher. He himself received a strong Confucian upbringing. He also received a modern secondary education at a French-style <!--del_lnk--> lyc&eacute;e in <!--del_lnk--> Hu&#x1EBF;, the <!--del_lnk--> alma mater of his later disciples, <!--del_lnk--> Ph&#x1EA1;m V&#x103;n &ETH;&#x1ED3;ng and <!--del_lnk--> V&otilde; Nguy&ecirc;n Gi&aacute;p. H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh applied for a course at the French &quot;Colonial Administrative School&quot; immediately after he arrived in <a href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>. However, his application was rejected.<p><a id="In_France" name="In_France"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In France</span></h3>
      <p>In 1911, H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh went to the South to <!--del_lnk--> Gia Dinh (<a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh_City.htm" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Saigon</a>) and joined a ship en route to <a href="../../wp/m/Marseille.htm" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>, France as a cabin-boy. H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh&rsquo;s first time abroad was not easy; he worked hard as a cleaner, waiter, cook&#39;s helper, and film developer. Regardless, he was very excited with what he learned from a totally different world each day. He often went to the public library, read newspapers and paid close attention to the current affairs and political issues. He also appreciated the French everyday life, and enjoyed <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Chevalier songs, which he knew by heart.<p><a id="In_the_USA" name="In_the_USA"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In the USA</span></h3>
      <p>It is believed that he even travelled to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, first arriving in <!--del_lnk--> New York in 1912 during a stop-over while working as an on-board cook on a ship. Ho claimed he later worked for a wealthy family in <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn between 1917 and 1918, and during this time he may have heard <!--del_lnk--> Marcus Garvey speak in <!--del_lnk--> Harlem. It is believed that while in the United States Ho made contact with <!--del_lnk--> Korean <!--del_lnk--> nationalists, an experience that served to develop his political outlook.<p><a id="In_England" name="In_England"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In England</span></h3>
      <p>He lived in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> more specifically Crouch End in north London, at various points between <!--del_lnk--> 1913 and <!--del_lnk--> 1919 where it is claimed he trained as a pastry chef under the legendary French master, <!--del_lnk--> Escoffier, at the <!--del_lnk--> Carlton Hotel in the Haymarket, <!--del_lnk--> Westminster, although there is no contemporary evidence to support this. There is a commemorative <!--del_lnk--> Blue Plaque on the building, which is now <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand House. The city&#39;s fancy restaurants were beyond his means, but he indulged in one luxury &mdash; American cigarettes, preferably <!--del_lnk--> Camel or <!--del_lnk--> Lucky Strike brands.<p><a id="Political_education" name="Political_education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Political education</span></h3>
      <p>H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh embraced <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> while living abroad in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> from ca. <!--del_lnk--> 1919-<!--del_lnk--> 1923. Ho claimed to have arrived in Paris in 1917, however the French police documented his arrival in the French capital from London in June 1919. Following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, as Nguy&#x1EC5;n &Aacute;i Qu&#x1ED1;c (Nguyen the Patriot), on behalf of the &quot;Group of Vietnamese Patriots&quot; he petitioned the great powers at the <!--del_lnk--> Versailles peace talks for equal rights in <!--del_lnk--> French Indochina but was ignored. He asked sitting <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> for help to remove the French by any means possible in <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, for a new nationalist movement and new government, but this idea was ignored. Ho Chi Minh soon helped to form the <!--del_lnk--> French Communist Party and spent all his time in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. It was at this time that Nguy&#x1EC5;n &Aacute;i Qu&#x1ED1;c became &quot;H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh&quot;, a Sino-Vietnamese name with a common surname (H&#x1ED3;) and a given name meaning &#39;enlightened will&#39; (Ch&iacute; meaning &#39;will&#39;, and Minh meaning &#39;light&#39;). In other words he became &quot;the one (he) who enlightens&quot;.<p><a id="In_China_and_the_Soviet_Union" name="In_China_and_the_Soviet_Union"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In China and the Soviet Union</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1923 Ho moved to <a href="../../wp/g/Guangzhou.htm" title="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, where he married a <!--del_lnk--> Chinese communist cadre. From 1925-26 he organised &#39;Youth Education Classes&#39; and occasionally gave lectures at the <!--del_lnk--> Whampoa Military Academy on the revolutionary movement in Indochina. He stayed in <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> as a representative of the <!--del_lnk--> Communist International. In June <!--del_lnk--> 1931 He was arrested there by British police and remained in prison until his release in <!--del_lnk--> 1937. He then made his way back to the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, where he reportedly spent several years recovering from <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1938 he returned to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and served as an adviser with Chinese <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a> armed forces.<p><a id="Independence_movement" name="Independence_movement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Independence movement</span></h3>
      <p>He returned to Vietnam in <!--del_lnk--> 1941 to lead the <!--del_lnk--> Vi&#x1EC7;t Minh independence movement, conducting successful military actions against the Japanese occupation forces and later against the French bid to reoccupy the country (<!--del_lnk--> 1946-<!--del_lnk--> 1954). At one point he was captured by the Japanese but escaped. However he suffered under their torture and was nursed back to health by American doctors. He was jailed for many months by <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-shek&#39;s local authorities. After his release in 1943 he returned to Vietnam. After the <!--del_lnk--> August Revolution (1945) organized by the Vi&#x1EC7;t Minh, he became Chairman of Provisional Government (Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), when he forced Emperor <!--del_lnk--> B&#x1EA3;o &#x110;&#x1EA1;i to abdicate, but this government was not recognized internationally. He petitioned American President <!--del_lnk--> Harry Truman to accept Vietnamese independence, but was rebuffed due to French pressure on the U.S. and the fact that he was Communist.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1945, His subordinates executed a number of nationalists that were not part of the <!--del_lnk--> Viet Minh, including the leader of the Constitutional Party, the head of the Party for Independence, and <!--del_lnk--> Ngo Dinh Diem&#39;s brother, <!--del_lnk--> Ngo Dinh Khoi.  . Purges and killings of <!--del_lnk--> Trotskyists, the rival anti-Stalinist communists, have also been documented  During <!--del_lnk--> 1946, when Ho was out of the country, his subordinates, without him being aware, imprisoned 25,000 non-communist nationalists and forced 6,000 others to flee  Hundreds of political opponents were also killed in July.  All parties apart from the <!--del_lnk--> Viet Minh were banned and local governments purged  which ensured that there was little opposition to H&#x1ED3;&#39;s regime later on.<p><a id="Birth_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam" name="Birth_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Vietnam"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam</span></h3>
      <p>It was on <!--del_lnk--> September 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1945 that he read the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vi&#x1EC7;t Nam. Before this speech, both the new Vietnamese anthem (Ti&ecirc;n Qu&acirc;n Ca) written by V&#x103;n Cao and the American anthem (the <!--del_lnk--> Star-Spangled Banner) were played. Before the speech, he had tried unsuccessfully to acquire a copy of the <!--del_lnk--> American Declaration of Independence from the OSS. Unable to get one, he quoted it from memory as, &quot;All <i>people</i> are created equal. They are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. Among these are the right to live, the right to be happy, and the right to be free&quot;.<p>During this period, the <!--del_lnk--> History Channel reports that a team of American paramedics rescued him from a certain death. <!--del_lnk--> Paramedics per se, however, did not come into existence until the late 1960s. It is possible that the <!--del_lnk--> History Channel reference should have been to <!--del_lnk--> corpsmen.<p>He signed an agreement with France which recognized Vietnam as an autonomous state in the Indochinese Federation and the <!--del_lnk--> French Union on <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1946. But soon after, the agreement broke down. The purpose of the agreement on the Vietnamese side was to get the Chinese army to withdraw from northern Vietnam. Soon after the Chinese left, fighting broke out with the French. H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh was almost captured by a group of French soldiers led by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Etienne Valluy at <!--del_lnk--> Vi&#x1EC7;t B&#x1EAF;c, but he was able to escape.<p>In January <!--del_lnk--> 1950 the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> recognized Ho&#39;s government and in February Ho went to Moscow to meet with <!--del_lnk--> Stalin and <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao">Mao</a>. Ho was told by Stalin that <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> would be responsible for backing his <!--del_lnk--> Viet Minh  . Mao&#39;s emissary to Moscow stated in August that China planned to train 60-70,000 Viet Minh in the near future.  China&#39;s crucial support to Ho enabled him to carry on the fight against the French.<p>In 1954, the important <!--del_lnk--> Battle of &#x110;i&#x1EC7;n Bi&ecirc;n Ph&#x1EE7; was fought between the French and Viet Minh, which convinced France to give up its empire in Indochina.<p><a id="Becoming_president" name="Becoming_president"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Becoming president</span></h3>
      <p>H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh became president of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (<!--del_lnk--> North Vietnam) in <!--del_lnk--> 1955. North Vietnam operated as a <!--del_lnk--> single-party <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a>-led <!--del_lnk--> state.<p>From 1953 to 1956, the government of H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh conducted the Land Reform Campaign due to pressure from China to mimic the <!--del_lnk--> Land Reform of <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>. In the process, tens of thousands of landowners were publicly denounced , with their land distributed to poor peasants. Of the identified 44,444 landlords, 3939 were tried and 1175 were executed.<!--del_lnk--> . <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Moise, a leftist historian on land reform, commented &quot;There were valid reasons for the exaggeration of classism.... But this extreme view of the class nature of rural affairs sometimes went beyond the real interests of the revolution and it often went beyond the bounds of objective truth&quot; and also implied that punishment for non-existent crimes was proportionately larger than in Mao&#39;s Chinese Land Reform.  President H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh would later weep as he publicly apologized for the campaign.<p>Another controversial incident occurred on November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1956 when villagers in H&#x1ED3;&#39;s home province of Ngh&#x1EC7; An revolted and were subsequently put down by the military. According to one estimate, 6,000 people were deported or executed. <p>During the early years of Ho&#39;s government, 900,000 to 1 million Vietnamese, mostly <!--del_lnk--> Catholic, left for <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam while 130,000, mostly <!--del_lnk--> Viet Minh personnel, went from South to North.   This was partly due to claims by church officials that the <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Mary had moved South out of distaste for life under <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a>. Although this migration was allowed under the Geneva Agreement for 300 days, Canadian observers claimed that some were forced by North Vietnamese authorities to remain against their will. <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1959 Ho&#39;s government began to back the Hanoi-controlled <!--del_lnk--> National Liberation Front in <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam (via the <!--del_lnk--> Ho Chi Minh Trail), which escalated the fighting that had begun in <!--del_lnk--> 1957.  In late <!--del_lnk--> 1964 North Vietnamese combat troops were sent southwest into neutral <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>. <p>During the mid to late 1960s, Ho permitted <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a> to send 320,000 troops to <!--del_lnk--> North Vietnam, who helped build railways, roads, and airports, thereby freeing a similar number of North Vietnamese forces to go to the south. <p><a id="On_becoming_a_cult_hero" name="On_becoming_a_cult_hero"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">On becoming a cult hero</span></h3>
      <p>H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh is the centre of what his detractors see as a large <!--del_lnk--> personality cult in North Vietnam, though his supporters argue that this was <!--del_lnk--> charismatic authority. The former capital of <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam, Saigon, was renamed <a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh_City.htm" title="Ho Chi Minh City">Ho Chi Minh City</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 1 May <!--del_lnk--> 1975.<p>Authors like <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Karnow, Jean Laconture, had praised him as a modest leader with great achievements. Later, <!--del_lnk--> Bui Tin has disclosed some mysteries about Ho Chi Minh such as his using the pen name Tran Dan Tien to write a book to idolize himself <p>
       <br /> For the West, he remains much of a dual character: to his supporters H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh is viewed positively as a committed <!--del_lnk--> Nationalist who fought for a united Vietnamese state. To his detractors and some critics in the West he was an opportunistic communist who seized power, created an authoritarian government, plunged Vietnam into a war that wrecked the country and established economic policies that left Vietnam poor. They claimed that he mandated the invasion of South Vietnam that resulted in the deaths of over a million of its citizens. Many more, as many as two million, fled South Vietnam after the unification of Vietnam. Some criticize the <!--del_lnk--> Vi&#x1EC7;t C&#x1ED9;ng, who were subordinate to him, for &quot;terrorism&quot; in the south, even though his direct knowledge of these exactions is still not clearly known by his biographers.<p>In 1975, the Students&#39; Union of <!--del_lnk--> Wadham College, Oxford renamed a college quadrangle from the &quot;JCR Quad&quot; to the &quot;Ho Chi Minh Quad&quot;, reflecting student sympathies following the end of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>.<p><a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death and legacy</span></h3>

Many across the country tearfully mourned his death. <!--del_lnk--> Santiago &Aacute;lvarez&#39;s 1969 documentary film &#39;Seventy-Nine Spring Times Of Ho Chi Minh&#39; (much of which was based on found footage) documents some of this, with powerful scenes depicting crying school children and weeping mourners, for example. His death day was initially reported to be <!--del_lnk--> September 3. The death day was actually September 2, but was changed since it coincided with the National Day as celebrated in Vietnam. Recently the government changed his official death day to September 2. His embalmed body was put on display in a granite <!--del_lnk--> mausoleum modeled after <!--del_lnk--> Lenin&#39;s Tomb in Moscow. This was consistent with other Communist leaders who have been similarly displayed before and since, including <a href="../../wp/m/Mao_Zedong.htm" title="Mao Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Kim Il-Sung, and for a time, <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Josef Stalin">Josef Stalin</a>, but the &quot;honour&quot; violated H&#x1ED3;&#39;s last wishes. He wished to be cremated and his ashes buried in urns on three Vietnamese hilltops, each in one of the three main regions of Vietnam (North, Central and South). He wrote, &quot;Not only is cremation good from the point of view of hygiene, but it also saves farmland.&quot;<p>In Vietnam today, he is elevated by the Communist government to an almost cult-like status even though the government has abandoned most of his economic policies. He is still referred to as &quot;Uncle H&#x1ED3;&quot; in Vietnam. H&#x1ED3; Ch&iacute; Minh appears on the <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese currency, and his image is featured prominently in many of Vietnam&#39;s public spaces. <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO had planned to officially recognize him as a &quot;great man of culture&quot; on his 100th birthday, but the Vietnamese exile community blocked this from happening.<p><a id="Quotes" name="Quotes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Quotes</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>&quot;Nothing is more precious than independence and liberty.&quot;<li>&quot;I only follow one party: the Vietnamese party.&quot;<li>&quot;You can kill ten of our men for every one we kill of yours. But even at those odds, you will lose and we will win.&quot; (referring to France and America in their wars in Vietnam)<li>&quot;It is better to sacrifice everything than to live in slavery!&quot;<li>&ldquo;The Vietnamese people deeply love independence, freedom and peace. But in the face of United States aggression they have risen up, united as one man.&quot;<li>&quot;We have to win independence at any cost, even if the Truong Son mountains burn.&quot;<li>&quot;In (Lenin&#39;s Theses on the National and Colonial Questions) there were political terms that were difficult to understand. But by reading them again and again finally I was able to grasp the essential part. What emotion, enthusiasm, enlightenment and confidence they communicated to me! I wept for joy. Sitting by myself in my room, I would shout as if I were addressing large crowds: &quot;Dear martyr compatriots! This is what we need, this is our path to liberation!&quot; Since then (the 1920s) I had entire confidence in Lenin, in the Third International!&quot;<li>&quot;When the prison doors are opened, the real dragon will fly out.&quot;<li>&quot;It was patriotism, not communism, that inspired me.&quot;<li>&quot;Remember, the storm is a good opportunity for the pine and the cypress to show their strength and their stability.&quot;<li>&quot;My only desire is that all of our Party and people, closely united in struggle, construct a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic and prosperous, and make a valiant contribution to the world Revolution.&quot; (Hanoi, May 10, 1969.)</ul>
