</script><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Hydrology has been a subject of investigation and engineering for millennia. For example, in about 4000 B.C. the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> was dammed to improve agricultural productivity of previously barren lands. <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamian</a> towns were protected from flooding with high earthen walls. <!--del_lnk--> Aqueducts were built by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>, while the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese built irrigation and flood control works. The ancient <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese used hydrology to build complex <!--del_lnk--> Irrigation Works of Ancient Sri Lanka, known for inventiion of the Valve Pit which allowed construction of large reservoirs, anicuts and canals which still function.<p><!--del_lnk--> Marcus Vitruvius, in the first century B.C., described a philosophical theory of the hydrologic cycle, in which precipitation falling in the mountains infiltrated the earth&#39;s surface and led to streams and springs in the lowlands. With adoption of a more scientific approach, <a href="../../wp/l/Leonardo_da_Vinci.htm" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Palissy independently reached an accurate representation of the hydrologic cycle. It was not until the 17th century that hydrologic variables began to be quantified.<p>Pioneers of the modern science of hydrology include <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Perrault, <!--del_lnk--> Edme Mariotte, and <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Halley. By measuring rainfall, runoff, and drainage area, Perrault showed that rainfall was sufficient to account for flow of the <!--del_lnk--> Seine. Marriotte combined velocity and river cross-section measurements to obtain discharge, again in the Seine. Halley showed that the evaporation from the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> was sufficient to account for the outflow of rivers flowing into the sea.<p>Advances in the 18th century included the Bernoulli piezometer and <!--del_lnk--> Bernoulli&#39;s equation, by <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Bernoulli, the <!--del_lnk--> Pitot tube, and the <!--del_lnk--> Chezy formula. The 19th century saw development in groundwater hydrology, including <!--del_lnk--> Darcy&#39;s law, the Dupuit-Thiem well formula, and Hagen-Poiseuille&#39;s capillary flow equation.<p>Rational analyses began to replace empiricism in the 20th century, while governmental agencies began their own hydrological research programs. Of particular importance were Leroy Sherman&#39;s unit hydrograph, the infiltration theory of <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Horton, and C.V. Theis&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> equation describing well hydraulics.<p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, hydrology has been approached with a more theoretical basis than in the past, facilitated by advances in the physical understanding of hydrological processes and by the advent of <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computers</a>.<p><a id="Hydrologic_cycle" name="Hydrologic_cycle"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Hydrologic cycle</span></h2>
      <p>The central theme of hydrology is that water moves throughout the Earth through different pathways and at different rates. The most vivid image of this is in the evaporation of water from the ocean, which forms clouds. These clouds drift over the land and produce rain. The rainwater flows into lakes, rivers, or aquifers. The water in lakes, rivers, and aquifers then either evaporates back to the atmosphere or eventually flows back to the ocean, completing a cycle.<p><a id="Branches_of_hydrology" name="Branches_of_hydrology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Branches of hydrology</span></h2>

      <p>The movement of water through the Earth can be measured in a number of ways. This information is important for both assessing water resources and understanding the processes involved in the hydrologic cycle. Following is a list of devices used by hydrologists and what they are used to measure.<ul>

      <p><a id="Hydrologic_prediction" name="Hydrologic_prediction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Hydrologic prediction</span></h2>
      <p>Observations of hydrologic processes are used to make <!--del_lnk--> predictions of the future behaviour of hydrologic systems (water flow, water quality). One of the major current concerns in hydrologic research is the Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB), i.e. in basins where no or only very few data exist.<p><a id="Statistical_hydrology" name="Statistical_hydrology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Statistical hydrology</span></h3>
      <p>By analysing the <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistical</a> properties of hydrologic records, such as rainfall or river flow, hydrologists can estimate future hydrologic phenomena. This, however, assumes the characteristics of the processes remain unchanged.<p>These estimates are important for <!--del_lnk--> engineers and <!--del_lnk--> economists so that proper <!--del_lnk--> risk analysis can be performed to influence investment decisions in future infrastructure and to determine the yield reliability characteristics of water supply systems. Statistical information is utilised to formulate <!--del_lnk--> operating rules for <!--del_lnk--> large dams forming part of systems which include <!--del_lnk--> agricultural, <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> and <!--del_lnk--> residential demands.<p>See: <!--del_lnk--> return period.<p><a id="Hydrologic_modeling" name="Hydrologic_modeling"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hydrologic modeling</span></h3>
      <p>Hydrologic models are simplified, conceptual representations of a part of the hydrologic cycle. They are primarily used for hydrologic prediction and for understanding hydrologic processes. Two major types of hydrologic models can be distinguished:<ul>
       <li>Models based on data. These models are <!--del_lnk--> black box systems, using mathematical and statistical concepts to link a certain input (for instance <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a>) to the model output (for instance <!--del_lnk--> runoff). Commonly used techniques are <!--del_lnk--> regression, <!--del_lnk--> transfer functions, <!--del_lnk--> neural networks and <!--del_lnk--> system identification. These models are known as stochastic hydrology models.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Models based on process descriptions. These models try to represent the physical processes observed in the real world. Typically, such models contain representations of <!--del_lnk--> surface runoff, <!--del_lnk--> subsurface flow, <!--del_lnk--> evapotranspiration, and <!--del_lnk--> channel flow, but they can be far more complicated. These models are known as deterministic hydrology models. Deterministic hydrology models can be subdivided into single-event models and continuous simulation models.</ul>
      <p>Recent research in hydrologic modeling tries to have a more global approach to the understanding of the <!--del_lnk--> behaviour of hydrologic systems to make better predictions and to face the major challenges in water resources management.<p><a id="Hydrologic_transport" name="Hydrologic_transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Hydrologic transport</span></h2>
      <p>Water movement is a significant means by which other material, such as soil or pollutants, are transported from place to place. Initial input to receiving waters may arise from a <!--del_lnk--> point source discharge or a <!--del_lnk--> line source or <!--del_lnk--> area source, such as <!--del_lnk--> surface runoff. Since the 1960s rather complex <!--del_lnk--> mathematical models have been developed, facilitated by the availability of high speed computers. The most common pollutant classes analyzed are <!--del_lnk--> nutrients, <!--del_lnk--> pesticides, <!--del_lnk--> total dissolved solids and <!--del_lnk--> sediment.<p><a id="Applications_of_hydrology" name="Applications_of_hydrology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications of hydrology</span></h2>
