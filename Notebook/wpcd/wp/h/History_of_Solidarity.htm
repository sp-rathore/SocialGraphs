      <p>The <b>history of Solidarity</b>, a Polish <!--del_lnk--> non-governmental <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">trade union</a>, began in August 1980 at the <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk Shipyards where <!--del_lnk--> Lech Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa and others formed <!--del_lnk--> Solidarity (<!--del_lnk--> Polish: <span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl"><i><!--del_lnk--> Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;</i></span>). In the early 1980s, it became the first independent labor union in a <!--del_lnk--> Soviet-bloc country. Solidarity gave rise to a broad <!--del_lnk--> anti-communist <!--del_lnk--> nonviolent <!--del_lnk--> social movement that, at its height, united some 10 million members and vastly contributed to the <!--del_lnk--> fall of communism.<p><!--del_lnk--> Poland&#39;s communist government attempted to destroy the union by instituting <!--del_lnk--> martial law in 1981, followed by several years of political repression, but in the end was forced to begin negotiating with the union. The <!--del_lnk--> Roundtable Talks between the weakened government and the Solidarity-led opposition resulted in <!--del_lnk--> semi-free elections in 1989. By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led coalition government had been formed, and, in December 1990, Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa <!--del_lnk--> was elected <!--del_lnk--> president. This was soon followed by the dismantling of the communist governmental system and by Poland&#39;s transformation into a modern <!--del_lnk--> democratic state. Solidarity&#39;s survival meant a break in the hard-line stance of the <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">communist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Polish United Workers&#39; Party (<i>PZPR</i>), and was an unprecedented event not only for the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republic of Poland&mdash;a <!--del_lnk--> satellite of the <!--del_lnk--> USSR ruled by a <!--del_lnk--> one-party <!--del_lnk--> communist regime&mdash;but for the whole of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern bloc. Solidarity&#39;s example led to the spread of anti-communist ideas and movements throughout the countries of the Eastern Bloc, weakening their communist governments; a process that eventually culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Revolutions of 1989 (the &quot;Autumn of Nations&quot;).<p>In the 1990s, Solidarity&#39;s influence on <!--del_lnk--> Poland&#39;s political scene waned. A political arm of the &quot;Solidarity&quot; movement, <!--del_lnk--> Solidarity Electoral Action (<i>AWS</i>), was founded in 1996 and would win the Polish parliamentary <!--del_lnk--> elections in 1997, only to lose the subsequent, <!--del_lnk--> 2001 elections. As of 2006 the Solidarity has little political influence and is more active as a traditional trade union.<p>

      <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the initial success of Solidarity in particular, and of <!--del_lnk--> dissident movements in general, was fed by a deepening crisis within Soviet-style societies brought about by declining morale, worsening economic conditions (a <!--del_lnk--> shortage economy), and the growing stresses of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>After a brief period of economic boom, from 1975 the policies of the Polish government, led by Party First Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Edward Gierek, precipitated a slide into increasing depression, as <!--del_lnk--> foreign debt mounted. In June 1976, the first workers&#39; strikes took place, involving violent incidents at factories in <!--del_lnk--> Radom and <!--del_lnk--> Ursus. When these incidents were quelled by the government, the worker&#39;s movement received support from <!--del_lnk--> intellectual dissidents, many of them associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Committee for Defense of the Workers (<!--del_lnk--> Polish: <span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl"><i>Komitet Obrony Robotnik&oacute;w</i></span>, abbreviated <i>KOR</i>), formed in 1976. The following year, <i>KOR</i> was renamed the <!--del_lnk--> Committee for Social Self-defence (<i>KSS-KOR</i>).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1978, the <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Krak&oacute;w, <!--del_lnk--> Karol Wojty&#x142;a, was elected <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>. A year later, during his first pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were attended by millions of his countrymen. The Pope called for the respecting of <!--del_lnk--> national and <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces; he was a <!--del_lnk--> bellwether of change, and became an important symbol&mdash;and supporter&mdash;of changes to come.<p><a id="Early_strikes_.281980.E2.80.9381.29" name="Early_strikes_.281980.E2.80.9381.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early strikes (1980&ndash;81)</span></h2>
      <p>Strikes did not occur merely due to problems that had emerged shortly before the labor unrest, but due to governmental and economic difficulties spanning more than a decade. In July 1980, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Gierek&#39;s government, facing economic crisis, decided to raise prices while slowing the growth of wages. At once there ensued a wave of strikes and factory occupations. Although the strike movement had no coordinating centre, the workers had developed an information network to spread news of their struggle. A &quot;dissident&quot; group, the Committee for the Defense of the Workers (<i>KOR</i>), which had originally been set up in 1976 to organize aid for victimized workers, attracted small groups of working-class militants in major industrial centers. At the <!--del_lnk--> Lenin Shipyard in <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk, the firing of <!--del_lnk--> Anna Walentynowicz, a popular crane operator and activist, galvanized the outraged workers into action.<p>On August 14, the shipyard workers began their strike, organized by the <!--del_lnk--> Free Trade Unions of the Coast (<i>Wolne Zwi&#x105;zki Zawodowe Wybrze&#x17C;a</i>). The workers were led by electrician <!--del_lnk--> Lech Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at the shipyard late in the morning of August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa, as well as the according of respect to workers&#39; rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a <!--del_lnk--> monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of independent trade unions.<p>The Polish government enforced censorship, and official media said little about the &quot;sporadic labor disturbances in Gda&#x144;sk&quot;; as a further precaution, all phone connections between the coast and the rest of Poland were soon cut. Nonetheless, the government failed to contain the information: a spreading wave of <i><!--del_lnk--> samizdat</i>s (<!--del_lnk--> Polish: <i>bibu&#x142;a</i>), including <i><!--del_lnk--> Robotnik</i> (The Worker), and <!--del_lnk--> grapevine gossip, along with <!--del_lnk--> Radio Free Europe broadcasts that penetrated the <!--del_lnk--> Iron Curtain, ensured that the ideas of the emerging Solidarity movement quickly spread.<p>On August 16, delegations from other strike committees arrived at the shipyard. Delegates (<!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Lis, <!--del_lnk--> Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an <!--del_lnk--> Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (<i>Mi&#x119;dzyzak&#x142;adowy Komitet Strajkowy</i>, or <i>MKS</i>). On August 17 a priest, <!--del_lnk--> Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard&#39;s gate, at which <!--del_lnk--> 21 demands of the <i>MKS</i> were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, independent trade unions and going on to call for a relaxation of the <!--del_lnk--> censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.<p>Next day, a delegation of <i>KOR</i> <!--del_lnk--> intelligentsia, including <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz Mazowiecki, arrived to offer their assistance with negotiations. A <i><!--del_lnk--> bibu&#x142;a</i> news-sheet, <i>Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;</i>, produced on the shipyard&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> printing press with <i>KOR</i> assistance, reached a daily print run of 30,000 copies. Meanwhile, <!--del_lnk--> Jacek Kaczmarski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> protest song, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mury</i> (<i>Walls</i>), gained popularity with the workers.<p>On August 18, the <!--del_lnk--> Szczecin Shipyard joined the strike, under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Marian Jurczyk. A tidal wave of strikes swept the coast, closing ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With <i>KOR</i> assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the <!--del_lnk--> Upper Silesian Industrial Area. More and more new unions were formed, and joined the federation.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Thanks to popular support within Poland, as well as to international support and media coverage, the Gda&#x144;sk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (<i>Komisja Rz&#x105;dowa</i>) including <!--del_lnk--> Mieczys&#x142;aw Jagielski arrived in Gda&#x144;sk, and another one with <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers&#39; demands, including the right to strike. This agreement came to be known as the August or <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk agreement (<i>Porozumienia sierpniowe</i>). Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the <!--del_lnk--> Party&#39;s monopoly of power. The workers&#39; main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers&rsquo; needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gda&#x144;sk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Kania as Party First Secretary.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Encouraged by the success of the August strikes, on September 17 workers&#39; representatives, including Lech Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa, formed a nationwide labor union, Solidarity (<i>Niezale&#x17C;ny Samorz&#x105;dny Zwi&#x105;zek Zawodowy (NSZZ) &quot;Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;&quot;</i>). It was the first independent labor union in a Soviet-bloc country. Its name was suggested by <!--del_lnk--> Karol Modzelewski, and its famous <!--del_lnk--> logo was conceived by <!--del_lnk--> Jerzy Janiszewski, designer of many Solidarity-related posters. The new union&#39;s supreme powers were vested in a <!--del_lnk--> legislative body, the Convention of Delegates (<i>Zjazd Delegat&oacute;w</i>). The <!--del_lnk--> executive branch was the National Coordinating Commission (<i>Krajowa Komisja Porozumiewawcza</i>), later renamed the National Commission (<i>Komisja Krajowa</i>). The Union had a regional structure, comprising 38 regions (<i>region</i>) and two districts (<i>okr&#x119;g</i>). On <!--del_lnk--> December 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1980, the <!--del_lnk--> Monument to Fallen Shipyard Workers was unveiled. On <!--del_lnk--> January 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, a Solidarity delegation, including Lech Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa, met in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> with <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>. From September 5 to 10, and from September 26 to October 7, Solidarity&#39;s first national congress was held, and Lech Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa was elected its president.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Meanwhile Solidarity had been transforming itself from a trade union into a social movement or more specifically, a <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary movement. Over the 500 days following the Gda&#x144;sk Agreement, 9-10 million workers, intellectuals and students joined it or its suborganizations, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Independent Student Union (<i>Niezale&#x17C;ne Zrzeszenie Student&oacute;w</i>, created in September 1980), the Independent Farmers&#39; Trade Union (<i>NSZZ Rolnik&oacute;w Indywidualnych &quot;Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;&quot;</i>, created in May 1981) and the Independent Craftsmen&#39;s Trade Union. It was the only time in recorded history that a quarter of a country&#39;s population (some 80% of the total Polish work force) had voluntarily joined a single organization. <i>&quot;History has taught us that there is no bread without freedom,&quot;</i> the Solidarity program stated a year later. <i>&quot;What we had in mind was not only bread, butter and sausages, but also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the repair of the republic.&quot;</i><div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Using strikes and other protest actions, Solidarity sought to force a change in government policies. At the same time, it was careful never to use force or violence, so as to avoid giving the government any excuse to bring security forces into play. After 27 <!--del_lnk--> Bydgoszcz Solidarity members, including <!--del_lnk--> Jan Rulewski, <!--del_lnk--> were beaten up on March 19, a 4-hour strike on March 27, involving over half a million people, paralyzed the country. This was the largest strike in the history of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern bloc, and it forced the government to promise an investigation into the beatings. This concession, and Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa&#39;s agreement to defer further strikes, proved a setback to the movement, as the euphoria that had swept Polish society subsided. Nonetheless the Polish communist party&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Polish United Workers&#39; Party (<i>PZPR</i>)&mdash;had lost its total control over society.<p>Yet while Solidarity was ready to take up negotiations with the government, the <!--del_lnk--> Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bid their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement as the only way out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes in response to the worsening economic situation.On December 3 Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.<p><a id="Martial_law_.281981.E2.80.9383.29" name="Martial_law_.281981.E2.80.9383.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Martial law (1981&ndash;83)</span></h2>

      <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk Agreement, the Polish government was under increasing pressure from the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to take action and strengthen its position. <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on <!--del_lnk--> October 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, the Party Central Committee put him in the minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. <!--del_lnk--> Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, Jaruzelski began a crack-down on Solidarity, declaring <!--del_lnk--> martial law and creating a <!--del_lnk--> Military Council of National Salvation (<i>Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego</i>, or <i>WRON</i>). Solidarity&#39;s leaders, gathered at <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk, were arrested and isolated in facilities guarded by the Security Service (<i><!--del_lnk--> S&#x142;u&#x17C;ba Bezpiecze&#x144;stwa</i> or <i>SB</i>), and some 5,000 Solidarity supporters were arrested in the middle of the night. Censorship was expanded, and military forces appeared on the streets. A couple of hundred strikes and occupations occurred, chiefly at the largest plants and at several <!--del_lnk--> Silesian coal mines, but were broken by <!--del_lnk--> ZOMO paramilitary <!--del_lnk--> riot police. One of the largest demonstrations, on <!--del_lnk--> December 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, took place at the <!--del_lnk--> Wujek Coal Mine, where government forces opened fire on demonstrators, killing 9 and seriously injuring 22.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Next day, during protests at <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk, government forces again fired at demonstrators, killing 1 and injuring 2.

      <p>Almost immediately after the legal Solidarity leadership had been arrested, underground structures began to arise. On <!--del_lnk--> April 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1982, <!--del_lnk--> Radio Solidarity began broadcasting. On <!--del_lnk--> April 22, <!--del_lnk--> Zbigniew Bujak, <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Lis, <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Frasyniuk and W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Hardek created an Interim Coordinating Commission (<i>Tymczasowa Komisja Koordynacyjna</i>) to serve as an underground leadership for Solidarity. On May 6 another underground Solidarity organization, an <i>NSSZ &quot;S&quot;</i> Regional Coordinating Commission (<i>Regionalna Komisja Koordynacyjna NSZZ &quot;S&quot;</i>), was created by <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Borusewicz, <!--del_lnk--> Aleksander Hall, Stanis&#x142;aw Jarosz, <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Lis and Marian &#x15A;witek. June 1982 saw the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> Fighting Solidarity (<i>Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107; Walcz&#x105;ca</i>) organization.<p>Throughout the mid-1980s, Solidarity persevered as an exclusively underground organization. Its activists were dogged by the Security Service (<i>SB</i>), but managed to strike back: on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1982, a series of anti-government protests brought out thousands of participants&mdash;several dozen thousand in Gda&#x144;sk. On May 3 more protests took place, during celebrations of the <a href="../../wp/c/Constitution_of_May_3%252C_1791.htm" title="Constitution of May 3, 1791">Constitution of May 3, 1791</a>. Further strikes occurred at Gda&#x144;sk between October 11 and 13.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1982, <!--del_lnk--> Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa was released. However on December 9 the <i><!--del_lnk--> SB</i> carried out a large anti-Solidarity operation, arresting over 10,000 activists. On December 27 Solidarity&#39;s assets were transferred by the authorities to a pro-government trade union, the <!--del_lnk--> All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions (<i>Og&oacute;lnopolskie Porozumienie Zwi&#x105;zk&oacute;w Zawodowych</i>, or <i>OPZZ</i>). Yet Solidarity was far from broken: by early 1983 the underground had over 70,000 members, whose activities included publishing over 500 <!--del_lnk--> underground newspapers.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1983, the martial law was lifted, and amnesty was granted to many imprisoned Solidarity members, who were released. On October 5, Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa was awarded a <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. The Polish government, however, refused to issue him a passport to travel to <a href="../../wp/s/Stockholm.htm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>; Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa&#39;s prize was accepted on his behalf by his wife. It later transpired that the <i><!--del_lnk--> SB</i> had prepared bogus documents, accusing Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa of immoral and illegal activities, that had been given to the Nobel committee in an attempt to derail his nomination.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1984, three agents of the Ministry of Internal Security murdered a popular pro-Solidarity priest, <!--del_lnk--> Jerzy Popie&#x142;uszko. As the facts emerged, thousands of people declared their solidarity with the murdered priest by attending his funeral, held on <!--del_lnk--> November 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1984. The government attempted to smooth over the situation by releasing thousands of <!--del_lnk--> political prisoners; a year later, however, there followed a new wave of arrests. Frasyniuk, Lis and <!--del_lnk--> Adam Michnik, members of the &quot;<i>S</i>&quot; underground, were arrested on <!--del_lnk--> February 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1985, placed on a <!--del_lnk--> show trial, and sentenced to several years&#39; imprisonment.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1985, power in the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> was assumed by <a href="../../wp/m/Mikhail_Gorbachev.htm" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, a leader who represented a new generation of Soviet party members. The worsening economic situation in the entire Eastern Bloc, including the Soviet Union, together with other factors, forced Gorbachev to carry out a number of reforms, not only in the field of economics (<i><!--del_lnk--> uskoreniye</i>) but in the political and social realms (<i><!--del_lnk--> glasnost</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> perestroika</i>). Gorbachev&#39;s policies soon caused a corresponding shift in the policies of <!--del_lnk--> Soviet satellites, including the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republic of Poland. On <!--del_lnk--> September 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1986, 225 Polish political prisoners were released&mdash;the last of those connected with Solidarity, and arrested during the previous years.<p>On September 30, Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa created the first public, legal Solidarity entity since the declaration of martial law&mdash;the Temporary Council of NSZZ Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107; (<i>Tymczasowa Rada NSZZ Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;</i>)&mdash;with <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Borusewicz, <!--del_lnk--> Zbigniew Bujak, <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Frasyniuk, <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz Jedynak, <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Lis, <!--del_lnk--> Janusz Pa&#x142;ubicki and <!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;zef Pinior. Soon afterwards, the new Council was admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Many local Solidarity chapters now broke their cover throughout Poland, and on <!--del_lnk--> October 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1987, the National Executive Committee (Solidarity)|National Executive Committee of NSZZ Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107; (<i>Krajowa Komisja Wykonawcza NSZZ Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;</i>) was created. Nonetheless, Solidarity members and activists continued to be persecuted and discriminated, if less so than during the early 1980s. There grew a rift between Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa&#39;s faction, which wanted to negotiate with the government, and a more radical faction, <!--del_lnk--> Fighting Solidarity, which planned for an anti-communist revolution.<p><a id="Twilight_of_the_Party_.281988.E2.80.9389.29" name="Twilight_of_the_Party_.281988.E2.80.9389.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Twilight of the Party (1988&ndash;89)</span></h2>
      <p>By 1988, Poland&#39;s economy was in worse condition than it had been eight years earlier. International sanctions, combined with the government&#39;s unwillingness to introduce reforms, intensified the old problems. Inefficient government-run <!--del_lnk--> planned-economy enterprises wasted <!--del_lnk--> labor and <!--del_lnk--> resources, producing substandard goods for which there was little <a href="../../wp/s/Supply_and_demand.htm" title="Demand">demand</a>. Polish exports were low, both because of the sanctions and because the goods were as unattractive abroad as they were at home. <!--del_lnk--> Foreign debt and <!--del_lnk--> inflation mounted. There were no funds to modernize factories, and the promised &quot;<!--del_lnk--> market socialism&quot; materialized as a <!--del_lnk--> shortage economy characterized by long queues and empty shelves. Reforms introduced by Jaruzelski and <!--del_lnk--> Mieczys&#x142;aw Rakowski came too little and too late, especially as changes in the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> had bolstered the public&#39;s expectation that change must come, and the Soviets ceased their efforts to prop up Poland&#39;s failing regime.<p>In February 1988, the government hiked food prices by 40%. On April 21, a new wave of strikes hit the country. On May 2, workers at the Gda&#x144;sk Shipyard went on strike. That strike was broken by the government between May 5 and May 10, but only temporarily: on August 15, a new strike took place at the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> July Manifesto&quot; mine in <!--del_lnk--> Jastrz&#x119;bie Zdr&oacute;j. By August 20 the strike had spread to many other mines, and on August 22 the Gda&#x144;sk Shipyard joined the strike. Poland&#39;s communist government then decided to negotiate.<p>On August 26, <!--del_lnk--> Czes&#x142;aw Kiszczak, the <!--del_lnk--> Minister of Internal Affairs, declared on television that the government was willing to negotiate, and five days later he met with Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa. The strikes ended the following day, and on October 30, during a televised debate between Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa and <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the <!--del_lnk--> All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions), Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa scored a public-relations victory.<p>On December 18, a hundred-member Citizens&#39; Committee (<i>Komitet Obywatelski</i>) was formed within Solidarity. It comprised several sections, each responsible for presenting a specific aspect of opposition demands to the government. Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa and the majority of Solidarity leaders supported negotiation, while a minority wanted an anticommunist revolution. Under Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa&#39;s leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it take any action.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1989, in a meeting between Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa and Kiszczak, a list was drawn up of members of the main negotiating teams. The conference that began on February 6 would be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Round Table Talks. The 56 participants included 20 from &quot;<i>S</i>,&quot; 6 from <i>OPZZ</i>, 14 from the <i>PZPR</i>, 14 &quot;independent authorities,&quot; and two priests. The Polish Round Table Talks took place in Warsaw from February 6 to <!--del_lnk--> April 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1989. The Communists, led by Gen. Jaruzelski, hoped to co-opt prominent opposition leaders into the ruling group without making major changes in the structure of political power. Solidarity, while hopeful, did not anticipate major changes. In fact, the talks would radically alter the shape of the Polish government and society.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1989, Solidarity was legalized, and its membership soon reached 1.5 million. The <!--del_lnk--> Solidarity Citizens&#39; Committee (<i>Komitet Obywatelski &quot;Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;&quot;</i>) was given permission to field candidates in the <!--del_lnk--> upcoming elections. <!--del_lnk--> Election law allowed Solidarity to put forward candidates for only 35% of the seats in the <!--del_lnk--> Sejm, but there were no restrictions in regard to <i><!--del_lnk--> Senat</i> candidates. Agitation and propaganda continued legally up to election day. Despite its shortage of resources, Solidarity managed to carry on an <!--del_lnk--> electoral campaign. On May 8, the first issue of a new pro-Solidarity newspaper, <!--del_lnk--> Gazeta Wyborcza (<i>The Election Gazette</i>), was published. Posters of Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa supporting various candidates, appeared throughout the country.<p>Pre-election <!--del_lnk--> public-opinion polls had promised victory to the communists. Thus the total defeat of the <i><!--del_lnk--> PZPR</i> and its satellite parties came as a surprise to all involved: after the first round of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat&mdash;all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate. The new <!--del_lnk--> Contract Sejm, named for the agreement that had been reached by the communist party and the Solidarity movement during the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Round Table Talks, would be dominated by Solidarity. As agreed beforehand, <!--del_lnk--> Wojciech Jaruzelski was elected president. However, the communist candidate for Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> Czes&#x142;aw Kiszczak, who replaced <!--del_lnk--> Mieczys&#x142;aw Rakowski, failed to gain enough support to form a government.<p>On June 23, a Solidarity Citizens&#39; Parliamentary Club (<i>Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny &quot;Solidarno&#x15B;&#x107;&quot;</i>) was formed, led by <!--del_lnk--> Bronis&#x142;aw Geremek. It formed a <!--del_lnk--> coalition with two ex-satellite parties of the <i><!--del_lnk--> PZPR</i>&mdash;<i><!--del_lnk--> ZSL</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> SD</i>&mdash;which had now chosen to &quot;rebel&quot; against the <i><!--del_lnk--> PZPR</i>, which found itself in the minority. On August 24, the Sejm elected <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a <!--del_lnk--> Solidarity representative, to be <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of Poland. Not only was he a first non-communist Polish Prime Minister since 1945, he became the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern Europe since nearly 40 years. In his speech he talked about the &quot;thick line&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> Gruba kreska</i>) which would separate his government from <!--del_lnk--> the communist past By the end of August 1989, a Solidarity-led <!--del_lnk--> coalition government had been formed.<p><a id="Bitter_success_.281989_to_the_present.29" name="Bitter_success_.281989_to_the_present.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Bitter success (1989 to the present)</span></h2>

      <p>The fall of the communist regime marked <!--del_lnk--> a new chapter in the <!--del_lnk--> history of Poland and in the history of Solidarity. Having defeated the communist government, Solidarity found itself in a role it was much less prepared for &mdash; that of a political party &mdash; and soon began to lose popularity. Conflicts among Solidarity factions intensified. Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa was elected Solidarity chairman, but support for him could be seen to be crumbling. One of his main opponents, <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Frasyniuk, withdrew from elections altogether. In September 1990, Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa declared that <!--del_lnk--> Gazeta Wyborcza had no right to use the <!--del_lnk--> Solidarity logo.<p>Later that month, Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa announced his intent to run for <!--del_lnk--> president of Poland. In December 1990, he was elected <!--del_lnk--> president. He resigned his Solidarity post and became the first president of Poland ever to be elected by popular vote.<p>These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of <!--del_lnk--> peaceful anti-communist revolutions in <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> fall of communism.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Next year, in February 1991, <!--del_lnk--> Marian Krzaklewski was elected the leader of Solidarity. President Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa&#39;s vision and that of the new Solidarity leadership were diverging. Far from supporting Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa, Solidarity was becoming increasingly critical of the government, and decided to create its own political party for action in the upcoming <!--del_lnk--> 1991 parliamentary elections.<p>The 1991 elections were characterized by a large number of competing parties, many claiming the legacy of anti-communism, and the Solidarity party garnered only 5% of the votes.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1992, Solidarity declared its first strike against the democratically elected government: a one-hour strike against a proposal to raise energy prices. Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On <!--del_lnk--> May 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a <!--del_lnk--> no-confidence motion&mdash;which passed&mdash;against the government of Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Hanna Suchocka.

      <p>It was in the ensuing <!--del_lnk--> 1993 parliamentary elections that it became evident how much Solidarity&#39;s support had eroded in the previous three years. Even though some Solidarity deputies sought to assume a more left-wing stance and to distance themselves from the right-wing government, Solidarity remained identified in the public mind with that government. Hence it suffered from the growing disillusionment of the populace, as the transition from a communist to a capitalist system failed to generate instant wealth and raise Poland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> living standards to those in the West, and the government&#39;s financial &quot;<!--del_lnk--> shock therapy&quot; (the <!--del_lnk--> Balcerowicz Plan) generated much opposition.<p>In the elections, Solidarity received only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% less than the 5% required in order to enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer then in the previous <!--del_lnk--> Senate). The victorious party was the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Left Alliance (<i>Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej</i> or <i>SLD</i>), a <!--del_lnk--> post-communist <!--del_lnk--> left-wing party.<p>Solidarity now joined forces with its erstwhile enemy, the <!--del_lnk--> All-Polish Conference of Trade Unions (<i>OPZZ</i>), and some protests were organized by both trade unions. The following year, Solidarity organized many strikes over the state of the Polish mining industry. In 1995, a demonstration before the Polish parliament was broken up by the police (now again known as <i><!--del_lnk--> policja</i>) using batons and water guns. Nonetheless, Solidarity decided to support Wa&#x142;&#x119;sa in the <!--del_lnk--> 1995 presidential elections.<p>In a second major defeat for the Polish <!--del_lnk--> right wing, the elections were won by an <i>SLD</i> candidate, <!--del_lnk--> Aleksander Kwa&#x15B;niewski, who received 51.72% of votes. A Solidarity call for new elections went unheeded, but the <!--del_lnk--> Sejm still managed to pass a resolution condemning the 1981 martial law (despite the <i>SLD</i> voting against). Meanwhile the left-wing <i>OPZZ</i> trade union had acquired 2.5 millions members, twice as many as the contemporary Solidarity (with 1.3 millions).<div class="thumb tleft">

As the public became disillusioned with the <i>SLD</i> and its allies, <i>AWS</i> was victorious in the <!--del_lnk--> 1997 parliamentary elections. <!--del_lnk--> Jerzy Buzek became the new prime minister.<p>However, controversies over domestic reforms, Poland&#39;s 1999 entry into <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a>, and the accession process to the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, combined with <i>AWS&#39;</i> fights with its political allies (the <!--del_lnk--> Freedom Union&mdash;<i>Unia Wolno&#x15B;ci</i>) and infighting within <i>AWS</i> itself, as well as <!--del_lnk--> corruption (reflected in the infamous &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> TKM</i>&quot; slogan), eventually resulted in the loss of much public support. <i>AWS</i> leader <!--del_lnk--> Marian Krzaklewski lost the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 presidential election, and in the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 parliamentary elections <i>AWS</i> failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament.
