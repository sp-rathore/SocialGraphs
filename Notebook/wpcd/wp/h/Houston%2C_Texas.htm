      <p><b>Houston</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[hju:st&#x259;n]</span>) is the largest city in the state of <!--del_lnk--> Texas and the fourth-largest in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United&nbsp;States</a>. The city covers more than 600 square miles (1,600&nbsp;km&sup2;) and is the county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Harris&nbsp;County&mdash;the third-most populous in the country. As of the 2005 U.S. Census estimate, Houston had a population of more than 2 million. The city is at the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> Houston&ndash;Sugar&nbsp;Land&ndash;Baytown metropolitan area, the largest cultural and economic centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf&nbsp;Coast region and the seventh-largest <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area in the U.S. with a population of 5.3 million in 10 counties.<p>Houston is internationally known for its energy (particularly oil) and aeronautics industries, and for its ship channel. The <!--del_lnk--> Port of Houston ranks first in the country in international commerce and is the sixth-largest port in the world. Second only to New York City in Fortune 500 headquarters, Houston is the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Medical Centre, which contains the world&#39;s largest concentration of research and healthcare institutions.<p>Houston is ranked as one of 11 U.S. <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">world-class cities</a> by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group &amp; Network. The city has an active visual and performing arts scene as Houston is one of the five U.S. cities that offer year-round resident companies in all major performing arts. In addition, the <!--del_lnk--> Houston Theatre District is ranked second in the country for the number of theatre seats in a concentrated downtown area per capita. The city is within proximity to beaches on <!--del_lnk--> Galveston Island.<p>

      <p>In August 1836, two brothers&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> John Kirby Allen and <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Chapman Allen&mdash;who were New York real estate promoters purchased 6,642 <!--del_lnk--> acres (27&nbsp;km&sup2;) of land from T. F. L. Parrot, John Austin&#39;s widow, for $9,428. The Allen brothers named their town after <!--del_lnk--> Sam Houston. Thomas H. and <!--del_lnk--> Gail Borden surveyed and mapped the town in typical grid fashion, with wide streets running parallel and perpendicular to the area&#39;s system of <!--del_lnk--> bayous. The city was granted incorporation on June 5, 1837 and James S. Holman became the first mayor. That same year, Houston also became the county seat of Harrisburg County, which was renamed Harris County in 1839. At this time, the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Legislature designated Houston as the temporary capital of the new <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Texas. The capital was later moved to <!--del_lnk--> Austin, then known as <!--del_lnk--> Waterloo, on January 14, 1839.<p>Lawlessness, epidemics, and financial problems prompted the people of the community to establish a <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Commerce, chartered by the Congress of the Republic on November 26, 1838. Because many of the first settlers were from the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_United_States.htm" title="Southern United States">South</a>, Houston endorsed the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>-<!--del_lnk--> plantation system. Slaves lived scattered through the neighborhoods, though there were a few free blacks in the city.<p>By 1860, Houston emerged as a commercial and railroad hub for the export of cotton. Railroad spurs from the Texas inland converged in Houston, where they met rail lines to the ports of Galveston and <!--del_lnk--> Beaumont. During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, Houston served as a headquarters for General <!--del_lnk--> John Bankhead Magruder, who used Houston as an organization point for the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Galveston. Houston saloon keeper <!--del_lnk--> Dick Dowling became the city&#39;s first famous personality after his victory at the battle of <!--del_lnk--> Sabine Pass in 1863. After the Civil War, Houston businessmen initiated efforts to widen the city&#39;s extensive system of bayous so the city could accept more commerce between downtown and the nearby port of Galveston.<p><a id="Early_20th_century" name="Early_20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early 20th century</span></h3>
      <p>Oil discovery at <!--del_lnk--> Spindletop in Beaumont in 1901 prompted the development of the oil industry, which eventually would transform Houston into a large city. In 1902, <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> approved a $1 million improvement project for the Houston Ship Channel. By 1910, the population of Houston was larger than that of <!--del_lnk--> Galveston. President <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> opened the Port of Houston in 1914, 74 years after digging started. By 1914, the Houston Ship Channel was dredged to give Houston a deep-water port, outpacing Galveston&#39;s port which was devastated by the <a href="../../wp/g/Galveston_Hurricane_of_1900.htm" title="Galveston Hurricane of 1900">Galveston Hurricane of 1900</a>.<p>By the end of the 1930s, Houston began having growing pains&mdash;the city was no longer a frontier town, and its air service was inadequate for its needs. By 1939, Houston was Texas&#39;s most populous city.<p>When <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> started, tonnage levels fell and five shipping lines ended service to Houston, but the war did have some economic benefits for the city. <!--del_lnk--> Ellington Field, initially built during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, was revitalized as a training centre for bombardiers, and aircraft and shipbuilding became large industries statewide. The M. D. Anderson Foundation formed the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Medical Centre in 1945. After the war, Houston&#39;s economy reverted back to a healthy, port driven economy. In 1948, several unincorporated areas were annexed into the city limits, and Houston proper began to spread across the <!--del_lnk--> prairie.<p><a id="Decades_of_growth" name="Decades_of_growth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Decades of growth</span></h3>

      <p>Shipbuilding during World War II spurred Houston&#39;s growth, as well as the establishment in 1961 of NASA&#39;s &quot;Manned Spacecraft Centre&quot; (renamed the <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon B. Johnson Space Centre in 1973), which created the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> aerospace industry. The <!--del_lnk--> Astrodome (then called the Harris County Domed Stadium), the first indoor, domed sports stadium, opened in 1965 and was quickly nicknamed the <i>&quot;Eighth Wonder of the World.&quot;</i><p>During the late 1970s, Houston experienced a population boom as people from <!--del_lnk--> Rust Belt states moved en masse into Texas, which benefited from the <a href="../../wp/1/1973_oil_crisis.htm" title="1973 oil crisis">Arab Oil Embargo</a>. Because of Houston&#39;s over-reliance on petroleum as the base of its industry, the local economy suffered and the population boom abruptly ended when oil prices fell in 1986 due to the embargo being lifted. The space industry also suffered in 1986 with the <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster.htm" title="Space Shuttle Challenger disaster">Space Shuttle Challenger disaster</a>. The late 1980s saw a <!--del_lnk--> recession for the Houston economy. Since this recession, Houston has made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and biotechnology, and reducing its dependence on petroleum. In 1990, the <!--del_lnk--> G7 Summit was held in Houston.<p><a id="The_new_millennium" name="The_new_millennium"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The new millennium</span></h3>

To date, the flooding caused by Allison was the worst in the city&#39;s history. Many neighborhoods and communities have changed since the storm; older houses in some affected neighborhoods have been torn down and replaced with larger houses with higher foundations.<p>In December 2001, Houston-based energy company <!--del_lnk--> Enron collapsed into the second-largest ever U.S. bankruptcy during an investigation surrounding fabricated partnerships that were allegedly used to hide debt and inflate profits.<p>In the wake of <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in August 2005, Houston provided shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans in various facilities around the city, including about 24,000 who were sheltered in the infrequently-used <!--del_lnk--> Reliant Astrodome stadium. This unprecedented situation involved Houston-area public school systems, which provided education for child evacuees.<p>Approximately 2.5 million Houston area residents evacuated when <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Rita approached the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast one month after Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Rita left little damage to Houston and the surrounding areas. Critical traffic congestion and gas shortages were rampant during the evacuation.

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558.4&nbsp;km&sup2;) &mdash; 579.4 square miles (1,500.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) of it is land and 22.3 square miles (57.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) of it is water. The total area is 3.7 percent water.<p>Most of Houston is located in the gulf coastal <!--del_lnk--> biome plains, and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forested land</a>, <!--del_lnk--> marshes, <!--del_lnk--> swamp, or <!--del_lnk--> prairie&mdash;all of which can still be seen in surrounding areas.<p>Much of Houston is very flat, making flooding a recurring problem for its residents. Downtown stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level&mdash;with most of the city less than 100 feet (30 m) in elevation. The city once relied on <!--del_lnk--> groundwater for its water needs, but land subsidence forced the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as <!--del_lnk--> Lake&nbsp;Houston and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Conroe.<p>Houston has four major bayous passing through the city: <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Bayou, which runs into downtown and the <!--del_lnk--> Houston Ship Channel; and three of its tributaries: Brays Bayou, which runs along the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Medical Centre; White Oak Bayou, which runs through the Heights and near the northwest area; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of Houston and downtown Houston. The ship channel goes past <!--del_lnk--> Galveston and into the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h3>
      <p>Underpinning Houston&#39;s land surface are unconsolidated <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clays</a>, clay <!--del_lnk--> shales, and poorly-cemented <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sands</a> up to several miles deep. The region&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> developed from stream deposits formed from the erosion of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rocky_Mountains.htm" title="Rocky Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. These <!--del_lnk--> sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath these tiers is a water-deposited layer of <!--del_lnk--> halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into dome shapes, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. This thick rich soil also provides a good environment for rice farming in suburban outskirts that the city continues to grow into near <!--del_lnk--> Katy. Evidence of past rice farming is even still evident in developed areas as there is an abundance of rich dark loamy top soil.<p>The Houston region is generally <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>-free. While the city of Houston contains over 150 active surface <!--del_lnk--> faults (some have estimated as many as 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to 310 <!--del_lnk--> miles (500&nbsp;km), the clay below the surface precludes the buildup of friction that produces ground shaking in earthquakes. These faults generally move at a smooth rate in what is termed &quot;fault creep.&quot;<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>When Houston was established in 1837, the city&#39;s founders&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> John Kirby Allen and <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Chapman Allen&mdash;divided it into political geographic districts called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> wards.&quot; The ward designation is the progenitor of the current-day Houston City Council districts&mdash;there are nine in all.<p>Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside <!--del_lnk--> Interstate&nbsp;610, known as the &quot;610 Loop&quot; or &quot;the Loop.&quot; Inside the loop encompasses the central business district and many residential neighborhoods that pre-date World War II. More recently, new higher-density residential development has resulted in an urban lifestyle and state of mind. The appellation &ldquo;inner&nbsp;loop Houston&rdquo; carries with it the expectations of <!--del_lnk--> cosmopolitan-style city life.<p>The outlying areas of Houston, the airports and the city&#39;s suburbs and enclaves are outside the loop. Another ring road, <!--del_lnk--> State Highway Beltway 8 (also known simply as the &quot;Beltway&quot;), encircles the city another 5 miles (8 km) farther out. The third ring road, <!--del_lnk--> State Highway 99 (also known as the Grand Parkway), is under construction.<p>Houston, being the largest city in the United States without zoning laws, has grown in an unusual manner. Rather than a single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> downtown&quot; as the centre of the city&#39;s employment, five additional <!--del_lnk--> business districts have grown throughout the city&mdash;they are <!--del_lnk--> Uptown, <!--del_lnk--> Texas&nbsp;Medical&nbsp;Centre, <!--del_lnk--> Greenway&nbsp;Plaza, <!--del_lnk--> Westchase, and <!--del_lnk--> Greenspoint. If these business districts were combined, they would form the third-largest downtown in the United States.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Houston&#39;s climate is classified as <!--del_lnk--> humid&nbsp;subtropical (<i>Cfa</i> in <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification system). The city has excessive ozone levels and is ranked among the most ozone-polluted cities in the United States. The average yearly precipitation level is approximately 48 <!--del_lnk--> inches (1,220&nbsp;mm). Spring <!--del_lnk--> supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a> to the area. Prevailing winds are from the south and southeast during most of the year, bringing heat from the deserts of <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and moisture from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a> months, the daily high temperature peaks at 94&nbsp;&deg;F (34 &deg;C) at the end of July with an average of 99 days per year above 90 &deg;F (32 &deg;C). The air tends to feel still and the humidity (averaging over 90 percent <!--del_lnk--> relative humidity in the morning in the summer and around 60 percent in the afternoon) results in a <!--del_lnk--> heat index higher than the actual temperature. To cope with the heat, people use <!--del_lnk--> air conditioning in nearly every car and building in the city. Afternoon rains are common and for most summer days, Houston meteorologists predict at least some chance of rain. The hottest <!--del_lnk--> temperature ever recorded in Houston was 109&nbsp;&deg;F (43&nbsp;&deg;C) on September 4, 2000.<p><a href="../../wp/w/Winter.htm" title="Winter">Winters</a> in Houston are cool and temperate. While the average high in January, the coldest month, is 61 &deg;F (16 &deg;C), Houston sees an average of 18 days per year of 32 &deg;F (0 &deg;C) or less. Snowfall is rare, and typically does not accumulate when it is seen. The last snowstorm to hit Houston was on <!--del_lnk--> December 24, 2004&mdash;the city&#39;s first recorded snowfall on Christmas Eve. The coldest <!--del_lnk--> temperature ever recorded in Houston was 5&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;15&nbsp;&deg;C) on January 23, 1940.<center>

      <p>Founded in 1836 and incorporated in 1837, Houston is one of the fastest growing major cities in the United States and the largest without strict <!--del_lnk--> zoning laws. The city is the county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Harris County. A portion of southwest Houston extends into <!--del_lnk--> Fort&nbsp;Bend County and a small portion in the northeast extends into <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery County.<p>The city of Houston has a strong <!--del_lnk--> mayor-council government. The City&#39;s elected officials, serving concurrent two year terms, are: the <!--del_lnk--> mayor, the city <!--del_lnk--> controller and 14 members of the <!--del_lnk--> city council. Under the strong mayor-council government, the mayor serves as the executive officer of the city. As the city&#39;s chief administrator and official representative, the mayor is responsible for the general management of the city and for seeing that all laws and <!--del_lnk--> ordinances are enforced.<p>As of 2006, the mayor of Houston is <!--del_lnk--> Bill White, who is serving his second term. <!--del_lnk--> City council members are elected from nine districts in the city, along with five at-large positions. At-large council members represent the entire city. The current city council lineup was based on a U.S. Justice Department mandate which took effect in 1979. Houston is a <!--del_lnk--> home rule city and all municipal elections in the state of Texas are <!--del_lnk--> nonpartisan.<p>Many local <!--del_lnk--> lawmakers have been impacted by the city&#39;s term limits. Several former city officials&mdash;Anthony Hall, Rodney Ellis, <!--del_lnk--> Sheila Jackson Lee, Sylvia Garcia, Martha Wong, <!--del_lnk--> Chris Bell, and <!--del_lnk--> Annise Parker&mdash;had to run for another elected position once their term expired.<p>Former mayor <!--del_lnk--> Lee P. Brown denounced the <!--del_lnk--> term limits, saying they prevented incumbents from gaining enough experience in city government. A proposal to double the current two-year term of office has been debated&mdash;as of 2005, several candidates for the city council have brought up the issue of whether term limits should be amended or eliminated.<p>Some elected officials from the Greater Houston area within the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Legislature&mdash;primarily <!--del_lnk--> Garnet Coleman and Sylvester Turner&mdash;have also spoken against term limits.<p>Houston is best considered to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. The affluent western-central portions of Houston&mdash;such as River Oaks and the Memorial/Spring Branch area&mdash;consistently vote Republican, while many of the inner city neighbohoods are heavily Democrats. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 67 percent of non-Hispanic whites in the city are declared or favour <!--del_lnk--> Republicans while 88 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the city are declared or favour <!--del_lnk--> Democrats. About 58 percent Hispanics (of any race) in the city are declared or favour Democrats. The master-planned communities of <!--del_lnk--> Kingwood and <!--del_lnk--> Clear Lake City in the northeast and southeast portions of the city, respectively, are heavily Republican.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Houston ranks second in employment growth rate and fourth in nominal employment growth among the 10 most populous metro areas. In 2006, the Houston metropolitan area ranked first in Texas and third in the U.S. within the category of &quot;Best Places for Business and Careers&quot; by <i><!--del_lnk--> Forbes</i>.<p>Houston&#39;s energy industry is recognized worldwide (particularly <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a>), but <!--del_lnk--> biomedical research, aeronautics, and the ship channel are also large parts of the city&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> base. The area is also the world&#39;s leading centre for building <!--del_lnk--> oilfield equipment. Much of Houston&#39;s success as a <!--del_lnk--> petrochemical complex is due to its busy man-made ship channel, the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Houston. The port ranks first in the country in international commerce and is the sixth-largest port in the world. Unlike most places, where high <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a> prices are seen as harmful to the economy, they are generally seen as beneficial for Houston as many are employed in the energy industry.<p>The Houston&ndash;Sugar Land&ndash;Baytown MSA&#39;s Gross Area Product (GAP) in 2005 was $308.7 billion, up 5.4 percent from 2004 in constant dollars&mdash;slightly larger than <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>&#39;s Gross Domestic Product (<!--del_lnk--> GDP). Only 28 nations other than the United States have a GDP exceeding Houston&#39;s GAP. <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">Mining</a>, which in Houston is almost entirely oil and gas exploration and production, accounts for 11 percent of Houston&#39;s GAP&mdash;down from 21 percent as recently as 1985. The reduced role of oil and gas in Houston&#39;s GAP reflects the rapid growth of other sectors&mdash;such as <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a> services, health services, and <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>.<p>Forty foreign governments maintain <!--del_lnk--> trade and commercial offices here and the city has 23 active foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations.

      <p>Houston is a diverse and international city, in part because of its many academic institutions and strong biomedical, energy, manufacturing and aerospace industries. According to the U.S. Census 2000, the racial makeup of the city was 49.27 percent <!--del_lnk--> White, 25.31 percent <!--del_lnk--> Black or <!--del_lnk--> African American, 0.44 percent <!--del_lnk--> Native American, 5.31 percent <!--del_lnk--> Asian, 0.06 percent <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Islander, 16.46 percent from <!--del_lnk--> other races, and 3.15 percent from <!--del_lnk--> two or more races. Thirty-seven percent of the population was <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic or <!--del_lnk--> Latino of any race.<p>The Hispanic population in Houston is increasing as more immigrants (illegal or otherwise) from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries look for work in Houston. The city has the third-largest Hispanic population in the United States. It is estimated that about 400,000 immigrants reside in the Houston area illegally. This influx of immigrants is partially responsible for Houston having a population younger than the national average.<p>Houston also has large populations of <!--del_lnk--> immigrants from <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>. In addition, the city has the largest <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese American population in Texas and third-largest in the United&nbsp;States.<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h3>
      <p>Houston recorded 336 <!--del_lnk--> murders in 2005, in comparison to 272 in 2004. This means that it had a murder rate of 17 murders per year for every 100,000 people, which was roughly the same as that of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. Despite the rise in <!--del_lnk--> homicides of 23.5 percent, overall crime in the city dropped by 2 percent in 2005 compared to 2004. Most of the homicides that occurred in the last quarter of 2005 occurred in the city&#39;s apartment complexes&mdash;primarily in the southwest and north-central areas of Houston. So far, Houston is on pace for over 400 murders by the end of 2006.<p>At one time Houston was the murder capital of the United States in 1982 when it recorded 702 homicides. In years since, the city had at least an average of 600-plus murders throughout the 1980s, until it finally had less than 300 murders on average every year since 1995.<p>Houston is, as of 2006, going through a spike in crime due in part to an influx of people from <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans into the city following <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. These hurricane victims seeking refuge are believed to have been involved in nearly 17 percent of all homicides. Houston&#39;s murder rate increased 70 percent in November and December of 2005 compared to 2004&#39;s levels. At least 35 percent of the city&#39;s December 2005 increase in homicides&mdash;five of 14 over last year&rsquo;s level&mdash;have been directly attributed to the presence of hurricane victims from New Orleans.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Officially, Houston is <!--del_lnk--> nicknamed the <i>&quot;Space&nbsp;City&quot;</i> as it is home to <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon B. Johnson Space Centre, where <!--del_lnk--> Mission Control Centre is located. Because of this, &quot;Houston&quot; was the first word spoken on the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">moon</a>. Many locals, however, prefer to call it the <i>&quot;Bayou City.&quot;</i> Other nicknames include <i>&quot;H-Town,&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Clutch&nbsp;City,&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Magnolia&nbsp;City&quot;</i>.<p>About 90 languages are frequently spoken in the Houston area. Some neighborhoods with high populations of Vietnamese and Chinese residents have <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese street signs in addition to English ones. Houston has two <!--del_lnk--> Chinatowns&mdash;the original located in Downtown and the more recent one developed is along Bellaire Boulevard in the southwest area of the city. The city also has a <!--del_lnk--> Little Saigon in <!--del_lnk--> Midtown and Vietnamese businesses located in the southwest Houston Chinatown.<p>There are many popular events held in the city celebrating cultures of Houstonians. The largest and longest running is the annual <!--del_lnk--> Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo that is held over 20 days from late February through early March. The event begins with trail rides that originate from several points throughout the state, all of which convene at <!--del_lnk--> Reliant Park for a barbeque cook-off. The rodeo includes typical rodeo events, as well as concert performances from major artists and carnival rides. Another large celebration is the annual night-time <!--del_lnk--> Houston Pride Parade held at the end of June held along Westheimer Road in <!--del_lnk--> Neartown&mdash;home to many 1950s-style restaurants, vintage shops, tattoo parlors, bars, <!--del_lnk--> nightclubs, <!--del_lnk--> coffeehouses, and gay entertainment. Other events held annually include the Houston <!--del_lnk--> Greek festival, Art Car Parade, and Houston International Festival.<p><a id="Arts_and_theatre" name="Arts_and_theatre"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Arts and theatre</span></h3>

      <p>In the 1960s, <!--del_lnk--> Downtown Houston comprised of a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> skylines in the United States. In 1960, the <!--del_lnk--> central business district had 10 million <!--del_lnk--> square feet (1,000,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m&sup2;) of office space, increasing to about 16 million square feet (1,600,000&nbsp;m&sup2;) in 1970. Downtown Houston was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with 8.7 million square feet (870,000&nbsp;m&sup2;) of office space planned or under construction and huge projects being launched by <!--del_lnk--> real estate developers. Houston experienced another downtown construction spurt in the 1970s with the energy industry boom. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s&mdash;many by real estate developer <!--del_lnk--> Gerald D. Hines&mdash;culminating with Houston&#39;s tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot-tall (305&nbsp;m) <!--del_lnk--> JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), which was completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, <!--del_lnk--> ninth-tallest building in the United States and the <!--del_lnk--> 29th-tallest skyscraper in the world. In 1983, the 71-floor, 970-foot-tall (296&nbsp;m) <!--del_lnk--> Wells Fargo Bank Plaza was completed, which became the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas, and 11th-tallest in the country. As of December 2001, downtown Houston had about 40 million square feet (4,000,000&nbsp;m&sup2;) of office space, including 28 million square feet (2,800,000&nbsp;m&sup2;) of class A office space.<p>In addition, many buildings in downtown are linked by a <!--del_lnk--> system of tunnels and skywalks. The tunnel system also includes shops, restaurants, and convenience stores.<p><a id="Uptown" name="Uptown"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Uptown</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Uptown District is mainly centered around Post Oak Boulevard and <!--del_lnk--> the Galleria. The district boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 610 west. Uptown became one of the most impressive instances of an <!--del_lnk--> edge city. The highest achievement of Uptown was the construction of the 899-foot-tall (274&nbsp;m), <!--del_lnk--> Philip Johnson and <!--del_lnk--> John Burgee designed landmark <!--del_lnk--> Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time, it was believed to the be the world&#39;s tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district.<p>The Uptown District is also home to other buildings designed by noted architects such as <!--del_lnk--> I. M. Pei and <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Pelli among others also designed by <!--del_lnk--> Philip Johnson. The district had 23.8 million square feet (2,210,000&nbsp;m&sup2;) of office space in 2001&mdash;Downtown had about 40 million square feet (4,000,000&nbsp;m&sup2;). In the late 1990s, there was a mini-boom of mid-rise <!--del_lnk--> residential tower construction, typically about 30 stories tall. Uptown has accumulated a large concentration of <!--del_lnk--> high-rise residential structures for such a low-density city.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, or METRO, provides public transportation in the form of buses, light rail, trolleys, and lift vans. METRO&#39;s various forms of public transportation still do not connect many of the suburbs to the greater city, causing Houstonians to rely on the automobile as a primary source of transportation.<p>METRO began running light rail service (<!--del_lnk--> METRORail) on January 1, 2004. Currently the track is rather short&mdash;it runs about 8 miles (13 km) from northern Downtown at <!--del_lnk--> UH&ndash;Downtown to the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Medical Centre and <!--del_lnk--> Reliant Park. Prior to the opening of METRORail, Houston was the largest city in the United States devoid of a rail transit system by a very large margin.

The airport is the ninth-busiest in the United States for total passengers, and 19th busiest worldwide. Houston is the headquarters of <!--del_lnk--> Continental Airlines, Bush Intercontinental is Continental Airlines&#39; largest hub. The airline alone offers more than 750 daily departures<p>Bush Intercontinental currently ranks third in the United States for non-stop domestic and international service with 182 destinations.

Hobby Airport (named Houston International Airport until 1967). The airport operates primarily small to medium-haul flights and is the only airport in Houston served by <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Airlines and <!--del_lnk--> JetBlue Airways. Business travelers on shorter routes to Houston from within the United States tend to prefer Hobby over Bush Intercontinental.<p>The third-largest airport and former <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Air Force base, <!--del_lnk--> Ellington Field, is primarily used for government and private aircraft. At one point, <!--del_lnk--> Continental Express operated flights across the city to Bush Intercontinental primarily for residents of southeast Houston and Galveston County. Passenger flights, however, ended on September 7, 2004.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Federal Aviation Administration and the state of Texas selected the &quot;Houston Airport System as Airport of the Year&quot; for 2005, largely because of its multi-year, $3.1 billion airport improvement program for both major airports in Houston.<p><a id="Education_and_research" name="Education_and_research"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education and research</span></h2>
