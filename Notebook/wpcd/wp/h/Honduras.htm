      <p>The Pre-Columbian city of <b><!--del_lnk--> Cop&aacute;n</b> is a locale in extreme western Honduras, in the department of Cop&aacute;n near the Guatemalan border. It is a major Maya city that flourished during the classic period (150-900 A.D). It has many beautiful carved inscriptions and <!--del_lnk--> stelae. The ancient kingdom, named <!--del_lnk--> <i>Xukpi</i>, flourished from the 5th century AD to the early 9th century, with antecedents going back to at least the 2nd century AD. The Maya civilization changed in the 9th century AD, and they stopped writing texts at Copan, but there is evidence of people still living in and around the city until at least 1200 AD. By the time the Spanish came to Honduras, the once great city-state of Cop&aacute;n was overrun by the jungle.<p>On his fourth and final voyage to the New World, <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> reached the coast of Honduras in 1502, and landed near the modern town of Trujillo, somewhere along the Guaimoreto Lagoon, and had his priests say mass. After the Spanish discovery, Honduras became part of Spain&#39;s vast empire in the New World within the Kingdom of Guatemala. The Spanish ruled Honduras for approximately three centuries.<p>Honduras declared independence from Spain on <!--del_lnk--> September 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1821 with the rest of the Central America provinces. In 1822 the Central American State was annexed to the newly declared Mexican Empire of <!--del_lnk--> Iturbide. The Iturbide Empire was overthown in 1823 and Central America separated from it, forming the Federation of the United Provinces, which disintegrated in 1838. The states of the United Provinces became independent nations.<p>Following the <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a>, Honduras joined the <!--del_lnk--> Allied Nations on the 8th of December, 1941. Less than a month later, on the first day of 1942, Honduras, along with 25 other governments signed the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration by United Nations<p>The so-called <!--del_lnk--> Soccer War of 1969 was fought with El Salvador. There had always been border tension between the two countries after <!--del_lnk--> Oswaldo L&oacute;pez Arellano, past president of Honduras, blamed the poor economy on the large number of immigrants from El Salvador. From that point on the relationship between El Salvador and Honduras had been a sour one. It reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras for a three-round football elimination match as a preliminary to the World Cup. Tensions escalated, and on <!--del_lnk--> July 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on <!--del_lnk--> July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August. The war lasted approximately 100 hours and led to an arms race between the two countries.<p>During the 1980s, the United States established a military presence in Honduras with the purpose of supporting the anti-Sandinista <!--del_lnk--> Contras fighting the Nicaraguan government and to support the El Salvador military fighting against the <!--del_lnk--> FMLN guerrillas. Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors, the Honduran army quietly waged a campaign against leftists.<p>Hurricane Fif&iacute; caused severe damage while skimming the northern coast of Honduras on September 18 and 19, 1974. Many years later, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Mitch.htm" title="Hurricane Mitch">Hurricane Mitch</a> devastated the country and wrecked its <!--del_lnk--> economic system in 1998.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>A Presidential and general election was held on <!--del_lnk--> November 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Zelaya of the <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) won, with <!--del_lnk--> Porfirio Pepe Lobo of the <!--del_lnk--> National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) coming in second. The PNH challenged the election results, and Lobo Sosa did not concede until December 7. Towards the end of December the government finally released the total ballot count, giving Zelaya the official victory. Zelaya was inaugurated as Honduras&#39; new president on <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>Honduras has five registered political parties: PNH, PLH, Social Democrats (Partido Innovaci&oacute;n Nacional y Social Dem&oacute;crata: PINU-SD), Social Christians (Partido Dem&oacute;crata-Cristiano: DC), and Democrat Unification (Partido Unificaci&oacute;n Democr&aacute;tica: UD). The PNH and PLH have ruled the country for decades. In the last years, Honduras has had five Liberal presidents: <!--del_lnk--> Roberto Suazo C&oacute;rdova, <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Azcona del Hoyo, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Roberto Reina, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Roberto Flores and <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Zelaya, and two Nationalists: <!--del_lnk--> Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero and <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo Maduro. The elections have been full of controversies, including questions about whether Azcona was born in Honduras or Spain, and whether Maduro should have been able to stand given he was born in <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a>.<p>In 1963 a military coup was led against the democratically elected president Villegas Morales and a military junta was established to rule the country without holding elections until 1981with varying executive leaders. In this year Suazo C&oacute;rdova (LPH) was elected president and Honduras transferred from a military authoritarian regime to an electoral democracy.<p>In 1986, Azcona del Hoyo was elected via the &quot;Formula B,&quot; when Azcona did not obtain the majority of votes. However, 5 Liberal candidates and 4 Nationalist were running for president at that time, and the &quot;Formula B&quot; required all votes from all candidates from the same party to be added together. Azcona then became the president. In 1990, Callejas won the election under the slogan &quot;Lleg&oacute; el momento del Cambio,&quot; (The time for Change has arrived), which was heavily criticized for resembling El Salvador&#39;s &quot;ARENAs&quot; political campaign. Callejas Romero gained a reputation for illicit enrichment. Callejas has been the subject of several scandals and accusations in the last two decades. In 1998, during Flores Facusse&#39;s mandate, Hurricane Mitch hit the country and all indications of economic growth were washed out in a period of 5 days.<p>In 2004 separate ballots were used for mayors, congress, and president. Many more candidates were registered for the 2005 election.<p>The Nationalist and Liberal parties are distinct political parties with their own dedicated band of supporters, but some have pointed out that their interests and policy measures throughout the 23 years of uninterrupted democracy have been very similar. They are often seen as primarily serving the interests of their own members, who receive jobs when their party gains power and lose them again when the other party does so. Both are seen as supportive of the elite who owns most of the wealth in the country, with neither of them promoting socialist ideals, even though in many ways Honduras is run like a democratic version of an old socialist state, with price controls and nationalized electric and land-line telephone services.<p>However, President Maduro&#39;s administration &quot;de-nationalized&quot; the telecommunications sector in a move to promote the rapid diffusion of telecom services to the Honduran population. As of November 2005, there were around 10 private-sector telecom companies in the Honduran market, including two mobile phone companies.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

The economy has continued to grow slowly but the distribution of wealth remains very polarized with average wages remaining very low. Economic growth is roughly 5% a year, but many people remain below the poverty line. It is estimated that there are more than 1.2 million people who are <!--del_lnk--> unemployed. The rate of unemployment is 28%<p>The <!--del_lnk--> World Bank and the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund classified Honduras as one of the <!--del_lnk--> Heavily Indebted Poor Countries eligible for <!--del_lnk--> debt relief, and this debt relief was given in 2005.<p>Both the electricity services (ENEE) and land line telephone services (HONDUTEL) were run by government monopolies, with the ENEE receiving heavy subsidies from the government because of its chronic financial problems. HONDUTEL however is no longer a monopoly, the telecomunication sector having been opened after <!--del_lnk--> December 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2005; this was one of the requirements before approving the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> CAFTA. There are price controls around the price of <!--del_lnk--> petrol, and other temporary price controls of basic commodities are often passed for short periods by the <!--del_lnk--> Congress.<p>After years of declining against the US dollar the <!--del_lnk--> Lempira has stabilized at around 19 Lempiras per dollar.<p>In 2005 Honduras signed the <!--del_lnk--> CAFTA (Free Trade Agreement with <!--del_lnk--> USA). In December 2005, Honduras&#39; main seaport <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Cortes was included in the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Container Security Initiative.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>The population of Honduras is predominantly of <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">Mestizo</a> descent and <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic faith. Along the northern coast were until recently communities of English speakers who maintained a separate culture, as some islands and sections along the Caribbean coast were occupied by pirates and by the British at one time or another. Groups of <!--del_lnk--> Gar&iacute;funa (people of mixed of <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> ancestry) live along the north coast and islands, where there are also many <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Latin Americans. Gar&iacute;funas are part of Honduras&#39; identity through theatrical presentations such as <!--del_lnk--> Louvavagu. <!--del_lnk--> Asians in Honduras are mostly of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese and <!--del_lnk--> Japanese descent. Hundreds of families can find their roots in the Middle East, specifically <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Palestine. These Arab-Hondurans are sometimes called &quot;turcos&quot;, because they arrived in Honduras using Turkish travel documents, as their homelands were then under the control of the Turkish <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The &quot;turcos&quot;, along with the Jewish minority population, exert considerable influence on Honduran economics and politics through their industrial and financial interests. Many other Hondurans have connections to <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> (especially <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans) and the <a href="../../wp/c/Cayman_Islands.htm" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>.<p>Chort&iacute; (Mayan descent), Pech or Paya, Tolupan or Xicaque, Lenca, Sumo or Tawahka, and Miskito still exist, and most still keep their language, Lenca being an exception.

      <p>Honduras is part of <!--del_lnk--> Mesoamerica, which is the landmass that extends from Mexico to Costa Rica. The region is considered as a <!--del_lnk--> biodiversity hotspot due to the numerous plant and animal species that can be found.
