      <p>The <b>History of the Royal Australian Navy</b> can be traced back to <!--del_lnk--> 1788 and the colonisation of Australia by the <!--del_lnk--> British. During this period until <!--del_lnk--> 1859 vessels of the Royal Navy made frequent trips to the new colonies. In 1859 the Australia Squadron was formed as a separate squadron and remained in Australia until 1913. During the period before <!--del_lnk--> Federation each of the 6 Australian colonies operated their own colonial naval force, these amalgamated in <!--del_lnk--> 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Force. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) was established in <!--del_lnk--> 1911 and in <!--del_lnk--> 1913 the fleet steamed through <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Heads for the first time.<p>The Royal Australian Navy has seen action in every ocean of the world during its short life. The navy first saw action in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and distinguished itself in three oceans. Between the wars the RAN&#39;s fortunes shifted with the financial situation of Australia, experiencing great growth during the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s but was forced to shrink in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s. Entering <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> the navy was not in the situation it was in <!--del_lnk--> 1914. During the war the size of the RAN grew to over 300 vessels of all classes. After World War II the RAN saw action in <!--del_lnk--> Korea, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a> and other smaller conflicts. Today the RAN fields a small but modern force, widely regarded as one of the most powerful forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Pacific Region.<p>

      <p>From the colonisation of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> in 1788 until 1859 the <!--del_lnk--> blue water defence of Australia was provided by detached units of the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy&#39;s</a> East Asia Squadron based in <!--del_lnk--> Sydney. In 1859 Australia was established as a separate Royal Navy squadron, this marked the first occasion the Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Australia Squadron remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 when command was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy.<p>Prior to <!--del_lnk--> Federation each self-governing colony in Australia operated its own <!--del_lnk--> colonial naval force, though <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia never operated any vessels. The colonial navies usually consisted of gunboats for coastal defence of harbours and rivers and naval brigades to man vessels and forts. In 1861, the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian colonial ship HMVS <i>Victoria</i> was deployed to assist the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> colonial government during a <!--del_lnk--> Maori rebellion. When the <i>Victoria</i> returned to Australia the vessel had suffered one fatality and taken part in several minor actions. The deployment of <i>Victoria</i> to New Zealand marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas. For the majority of the colonial period <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales had maintained the most capable naval force, but in the years leading up to Federation <!--del_lnk--> Victoria became regarded as the most powerful of all the colonial navies. After Federation all colonial vessels became part of the Commonwealth Naval Force.<p><a id="Formation" name="Formation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Formation</span></h2>

      <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Federation of Australia in <!--del_lnk--> 1901, the Commonwealth Naval Forces was formed by amalgamating the six separate colonial navies. The Commonwealth government, however, paid for the Royal Navy to continue providing blue water defence.<p>A growing number of people, among them Captain <!--del_lnk--> William Rooke Creswell, the director of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1909 <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, sought the <!--del_lnk--> British Government&#39;s agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty and in 1908 invited the <!--del_lnk--> Great White Fleet to visit Australia, this fired the public enthusiasm for a modern navy and lead to the order of two 700 ton <!--del_lnk--> River class destroyers, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> naval construction in 1909 lead the Admiralty to change their position on an Australian Navy. For his work Creswell&#39;s name lives on as the name of the naval base, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS Creswell, the site of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Naval College at <!--del_lnk--> Jervis Bay.<div class="thumb tleft">

Both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy on Monday <!--del_lnk--> 19 September <!--del_lnk--> 1910 and sailed for Australia. They arrived at <!--del_lnk--> Port Phillip on Saturday <!--del_lnk--> December 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1910 an event that was marred by the death of Engineer Lieutenant W. Robertson, RN. Robertson suffered a heart attack 8 miles outside Port Phillip Heads whilst onboard HMAS <i>Yarra</i> and drowned.<p>In October <!--del_lnk--> 1911 <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> fixed his signature to the approval for the Royal Australian Navy and the ships now officially received the prefix <i>&quot;His Majesty&#39;s Australian Ship&quot;</i> (HMAS). The manpower of the fleet stood at four hundred officers and men and, for the next two years, ships were built for the fledgling navy. On Saturday <!--del_lnk--> 4 October <!--del_lnk--> 1913 the first <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Review of the Royal Australian Navy took place, the <!--del_lnk--> battle cruiser <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australia</i>, the cruisers <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Melbourne</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sydney</i>, the protected cruiser <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Encounter</i> and the torpedo-boat destroyers <i>Parramatta</i>, <i>Yarra</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Warrego</i>, entered <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Harbour.<p><a id="World_War_I" name="World_War_I"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany, bringing the whole British Empire, including Australia, into war. The war was greeted with enthusiasm in Australia, and over 200,000 troops were deployed to the Middle East for campaigns in <!--del_lnk--> Gallipoli, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>.<p>At the outbreak of war the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Navy (RAN) consisted of <!--del_lnk--> <i>Australia</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> light cruisers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Melbourne</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Brisbane</i> (Under Construction), the <!--del_lnk--> Destroyers <!--del_lnk--> <i>Parramatta</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yarra</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Warrego</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> submarines <!--del_lnk--> AE1 and <!--del_lnk--> AE2. With 3 more destroyers under construction. The RAN also maintained a small fleet of auxiliary ships. The Royal Australian Navy at the start of the war was a formidable force.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Conference of 1911 it was decided that in the event of war the ships of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australia Navy would be transferred to Admiralty control and under the Naval Defence Act of 1912 this power to make the transfer was conferred in the <!--del_lnk--> Governor General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> with all ships and men under the direct control of the Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the upkeep of the ships and training of men.

      <p>Australian Navy ships first saw action <!--del_lnk--> Asian and Pacific theatre assisting in the attack on <!--del_lnk--> German New Guinea by the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&amp;MEF). In 1884 Germany colonised the northeastern part of <!--del_lnk--> New Guinea and several nearby island groups. The Germans used the colony as a wireless radio base, Britain required the wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by the <!--del_lnk--> German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at <!--del_lnk--> Yap in the <!--del_lnk--> Caroline Islands, <a href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> and at <!--del_lnk--> Rabaul, <!--del_lnk--> New Britain. On <!--del_lnk--> 30 August <!--del_lnk--> 1914 the AN&amp;MEF left <!--del_lnk--> Sydney under the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australia</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Melbourne</i> for <!--del_lnk--> Port Moresby where it met the <!--del_lnk--> Queensland contingent aboard the transport <!--del_lnk--> HMAHS <i>Kanowna</i>. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on September 7 but the Kanowna was left behind when her stokers refused to work. <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sydney</i> and some destroyers met the AN&amp;MEF off the eastern tip of New Guinea. <i>Melbourne</i> was detached to destroy the wireless station on <a href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Nauru">Nauru</a>, while on September 14, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Encounter</i> bombarded a ridge near the town, while half a battalion advanced towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the disappearance of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian submarine AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on <!--del_lnk--> 14 September <!--del_lnk--> 1914.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 9 November <!--del_lnk--> 1914 the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> light cruiser <!--del_lnk--> SMS <i>Emden</i> attacked the critical radio and telegraph station at <!--del_lnk--> Direction Island in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cocos_%2528Keeling%2529_Islands.htm" title="Cocos (Keeling) Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a>. The inhabitants of the island managed to transmit a distress signal and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i>, only 50 miles away, began to steam towards the island. The <i>Sydney</i> reached the area in around two hours and was engaged by <i>Emden</i>. <i>Sydney</i> which was the larger, faster and better armed of the two and eventually overpowered the <i>Emden</i>, with the captain <!--del_lnk--> Karl von M&uuml;ller running the ship aground on <!--del_lnk--> North Keeling Island to avoid sinking, at 11.15am. At first <i>Emden</i> refused to strike its colours, <i>Sydney</i> fired on the stationary <i>Emden</i> until it evetually struck its colours. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cocos was the first ship-against-ship engagement for the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Navy.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign the <!--del_lnk--> Australian submarine AE2 became the first <!--del_lnk--> Allied warship to breach the <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> defences of the <!--del_lnk--> Dardanelles. AE2 spent five days in the area and came under attack several time but was unable to find any large enemy troop transports. On <!--del_lnk--> 29 April <!--del_lnk--> 1915 she was damaged in an attack by the Turkish torpedo-boat <i>Sultan Hisar</i> in Artaki Bay and was scuttled by her crew. The wreck of AE2 remained undiscovered until <!--del_lnk--> 2 July <!--del_lnk--> 1998, 83 years after she was scuttled.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Between April 1918 and May 1919 the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Flu killed an estimated 25 million people worldwide, far more than had been killed in four years of war. A rigorous quarantine policy was implemented in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> this reduced the immediate impact of the flu, but by the end of 1919 the nations death toll stood at more than 11,500.<p>When the pandemic struck in 1918 the ships of the Royal Australian Navy were dispersed throughout the world, the speed at which the flu spread coupled with the cramped mess decks and poorly ventilated living spaces on early <!--del_lnk--> 20th Century warships created a favorable environment for the disease. The pandemic swept through the <!--del_lnk--> British Grand Fleet in 1918 and the Australian cruisers suffered high casualties, with up to 157 casualties in one ship alone. Outbreaks in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> fleets were more severe than those in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a>. <!--del_lnk--> HMAS Brisbane recorded 183 casualties between November and December 1918, of those casualties 2 men died of <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. The RAN lost a total of 26 men to the disease.

      <p>The disease arrived in the <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">South Pacific</a> on the cargo vessel <!--del_lnk--> SS Talune which sailed from <a href="../../wp/a/Auckland.htm" title="Auckland">Auckland</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 30 October <!--del_lnk--> 1918, knowingly carrying sick passengers. The Talune stopped in <a href="../../wp/f/Fiji.htm" title="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Samoa.htm" title="Samoa">Samoa</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tonga.htm" title="Tonga">Tonga</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Nauru">Nauru</a>, the first outbreaks occurred within days of the ships visits. The local authorities were generally unprepared for the size of the outbreak and the infection spread uncontrollably. The German territory of <a href="../../wp/s/Samoa.htm" title="Samoa">Samoa</a> was the worst affected of the small islands, the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> administration carried out no efforts to lessen the outbreak and rejected offers of assistance from nearby <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a>. The New Zealand government officially apologised to Samoa in 2002 for their reaction to the outbreak. On <!--del_lnk--> 29 November <!--del_lnk--> 1918 the military governor of <!--del_lnk--> Apia requested assistance from <a href="../../wp/w/Wellington.htm" title="Wellington">Wellington</a>; the request was turned down on the grounds that all doctors were needed in New Zealand. Australia offered the only alternate source of aid.<p>The Commonwealth Naval Board were aware of the worsening situation in the region, the sloop <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Fantome</i> while stationed in Fiji reported its first case on <!--del_lnk--> 11 November <!--del_lnk--> 1918, and soon half her complement was affected. On <!--del_lnk--> 20 November <!--del_lnk--> 1918 the naval board began forming a joint relief expedition from available military medical personnel. The commanding officer of <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Encounter</i> was then ordered to embark the expedition in <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> and sail as soon as possible. <i>Encounter</i> departed Sydney on <!--del_lnk--> 24 November <!--del_lnk--> 1918 ten minutes after completing loading. As a precaution all 450 members of the <i>Encounters</i> crew were doubly inoculated, the ship had suffered 74 cases earlier in the year at <!--del_lnk--> Fremantle and the captain did not want a repeat. <i>Encounter</i> arrived in <!--del_lnk--> Suva on <!--del_lnk--> 30 November and took half the available <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and 39 tonnes of water. Spanish flu was rampant in Suva and Captain Thring implemented a strict quarantine and placed guards on the wharf and all coaling was carried out by the crew, coaling was usually carried out by native labor. <i>Encounter</i> departed Suva in the evening of the same day and arrived off <!--del_lnk--> Apia on <!--del_lnk--> 3 December. Within six hours the medical landing party and their stores were ashore, <i>Encounter</i> departed for the <a href="../../wp/t/Tonga.htm" title="Tonga">Tongan</a> capital of <!--del_lnk--> Nuku&#39;alofa immediately arriving their on <!--del_lnk--> 5 December. The last of the medical staff and supplies were unloaded, <i>Encounter</i> short on coal sailed for Suva on <!--del_lnk--> 7 December. On arriving in Suva <i>Encounter</i> received orders to return to Sydney. She reached Sydney on <!--del_lnk--> 17 December and was immediately placed in quarantine. The South Pacific aid mission is regarded as Australia&#39;s first overseas relief expedition and set a precedent for future relief mission conducted by the RAN.<p><a id="Between_the_wars" name="Between_the_wars"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Between the wars</span></h2>

      <p>Following the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Government believed that an immediate evaluation of the RAN was necessary. Australia had based its naval policy on the Henderson <i>Recommendations</i> of 1911 developed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Reginald Henderson. The government sent an invitation to Admiral <!--del_lnk--> John Jellicoe, he arrived in Australia in May 1919. Jellicoe remained in Australia for 3 months and then returned to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> via <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Jellicoe submitted his findings in August 1919, titled the <i>Report on the Naval Mission to the Commonwealth</i>. The report outlined several policies designed to strengthen British naval strength in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>. The report heavily stressed a close relationship between the RAN and the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>. This would be achieved by strict adherence to the procedure and method of Administration of the Royal Navy. The report also suggested constant officer exchange between the two forces. Jellicoe also called for the creation of a large Far East Imperial Fleet which would include capital ships and aircraft carriers, this force would be mainly based in <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. The cost for the creation of such a fleet would be divided between <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, Australia and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> each contributing 75, 20 and 5% respectively. The suggested make up of the RAN would include; 1 aircraft carrier, 2 battlecruisers, 8 light cruisers, 1 flotilla leader, 12 destroyers, a destroyer depot ship, 8 submarines, 1 submarine parent ship and a small number of additional auxiliary ships. The annual cost and depreciation of the fleet was estimated to be &pound;4,024,600. None of Jellicoe&#39;s major recommendations were carried out except for the establishment of closer ties with Britain. Although some of the minor recommendations were implemented.<p>With the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Government began to worry about the threat <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> posed to Australia. Japan had extended its empire 3000km to the south bringing it right to Australia&#39;s doorstep. Japan had continued to build up its naval force and had reached a stage where it outgunned to Royal Navy in the Pacific. The RAN and the government believed that the possibility of a Japanese invasion was highly likely. Admiral Jellicoe in his report believed that the threat of a Japanese invasion of Australia would remain as long as the <!--del_lnk--> White Australia Policy remained in place. Due to the perceived threat and bilateral support in Australia for the White Australia Policy the Australian Government became a vocal supporter of the continuance of the <!--del_lnk--> 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Australia was joined in its support for the alliance by <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> but was heavily opposed by <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, Canada believed the alliance hindered the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">Empires</a> relationship with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. No decision on the alliance as agreed on. The discussion was shelved pending the outcome of the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Naval Treaty. The results of the treaty which allowed the British to retain naval supremacy in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> created a sense of security in Australia. Many Australian saw the Four Powers Pact as replacing the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. This sense of security became known as the <i>Ten Year Rule</i>. This lead to defence retrenchments in Australia following the international trend and a &pound;500,000 reduction in expenditure. The <!--del_lnk--> Governor General <!--del_lnk--> Henry Forster when opening <!--del_lnk--> parliament on <!--del_lnk--> 22 June <!--del_lnk--> 1922 was quoted as saying.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Between <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> the Royal Australian Navy suffered a severe reduction in men and ships. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Washington Naval Treaty the flagship <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australia</i> was scraped with her main armaments and sunk outside <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Heads in 1924. In the same year the RAN began a five year program of obtaining new ships from Britain - the heavy cruisers <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australia</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Canberra</i> and the seaplane carrier <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Albatross</i>. This purchase was partly paid for by scrapping <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Brisbane</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Melbourne</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i> along with most of the destroyers. The Great Depression of <!--del_lnk--> 1929 hit the RAN hard and lead to another reduction of manpower, the RAN although reduced in size had no problem filling its ranks, many men were unemployed and the pay was quite high for the period. Strength of the RAN fell to 3117 personnel plus 131 members of the Naval Auxiliary Services. In 1932 the strength of the Reserves stood at 5446. In the early 1930s, lack of funds forced the transfer of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Australian Naval College from <!--del_lnk--> Jervis Bay to Flinders Naval Depot in <!--del_lnk--> Victoria. In 1933 the Australian Government ordered 3 light cruisers the <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Perth</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hobart</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i> and sold the seaplane carrier to fund the <i>Hobart</i>. During this time the RAN also purchased destroyers of the <!--del_lnk--> V and W class the ships that would come to be know as the <!--del_lnk--> Scrap Iron Flotilla. With the ever increasing threat of <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in the late 1930s the RAN was not in the position it was at the outbreak of World War I.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h2>
      <p>Australia declared war on <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> one hour after the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>&#39;s declaration of war on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939. At the onset of war, the Royal Australian Navy numbered two <!--del_lnk--> heavy cruisers, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australian</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Canberra</i> both carried 8-inch guns and had entered service in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s - three modern <!--del_lnk--> light cruisers <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Hobart</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Perth</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i>, which mounted 6-inch guns. The older cruiser <i><!--del_lnk--> HMAS Adelaide</i> also remained in service. The RAN also possessed 4 sloops, <i><!--del_lnk--> HMAS Parramatta</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Swan</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Warrego</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yarra</i>, though only the <i>Swan</i> and <i>Yarra</i> were commissioned. The RAN&#39;s destroyer force consisted of five obsolete <!--del_lnk--> V class destroyers. The RAN also featured a variety of support and ancillary craft. Men and vessels of the RAN served in every theatre of operations, from the tropical Pacific to the frigid Russian convoys. By the end of the war the RAN&#39;s combat strength numbered 150 ships with an additional 200 auxiliary craft. The RAN reached its peak in June 1945 when it ranks swelled to 39,650. During the war the RAN lost 19 ships and 2,176 men and women died while serving in the RAN, 1,740 of them on ships of the RAN.<p>The following table illustrates the growth of the RAN between the outbreak of war and 30 June 1945:<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0">

      <p>From Mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1940 sips of the RAN, at the request of the <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty began to deploy to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to take part in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Mediterranean against <!--del_lnk--> Fascist Italy. HMAS <i>Sydney</i> deployed in May 1940 and was soon joined by <i>Hobart</i>. The RAN then offered the services of <i>Australia</i> to the Admiralty, the offer was gratefully accepted. When <i>Australia</i> arrived in the Mediterranean the RAN has sent nearly the entire combat fleet to the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Hemisphere, leaving Australian open to possible attack.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 27 June <!--del_lnk--> 1940 Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Cunningham commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Mediterranean Fleet ordered the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which included HMAS <i>Sydney</i> to rendezvous with an <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> bound convoy near <!--del_lnk--> Cape Matapan. The cruiser squadron sighted three <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> cruisers at 6 pm on <!--del_lnk--> 28 June <!--del_lnk--> 1940 and immediately engaged them. Within an hour the Italian cruiser Espero was incapacitated and <i>Sydney</i> was signaled to sink her. As <i>Sydney</i> approached the <i>Espero</i> launched torpedoes, but failed to hit any targets. <i>Sydney</i> fired four salvos, scoring 10 direct hits on the <i>Espero</i>. Sydney remained at the scene for two hours picking up survivors.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 7 July <!--del_lnk--> 1940 a 25 ship fleet departed <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria intending to meet a convoy east of <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>. The next day a submarine reported sighting a Italian fleet 500 miles away, the fleet altered course to intercept. The two fleet sighted each other at 3 pm on <!--del_lnk--> 9 July <!--del_lnk--> 1940 and a battle that became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Calabria began. Four vessels of the RAN took part in the battle the; <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sydney</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Stuart</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vampire</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Voyager</i>. <i>Sydney</i> was the first RAN vessels to engage the enemy and at 3.23 pm opened fire. The Italian fleet began to withdrawal, the Allied destroyer squadron was ordered forward. HMAS <i>Stuart</i> leading the destroyer force was the first to open fire; her opening salvo was fired at a range of 12,600 yards and was recorded as a direct hit. The Italian fleet retired under smoke and the Allied fleet retired. The fleet remained under constant air attack and <i>Sydney</i> which came under heavy attack was believed to have sunk.

The Italian cruisers began to retire from the area under a smokescreen with <i>Sydney</i> and the destroyers in pursuit. Sydney scored her first direct hit on the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Giovanni dalle Bande Nere</i> at 8.35 am and at the same time began to score repeated hits on the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bartolomeo Colleoni</i> which by 9.25 am was incapacitated.

      <p>By 10.27 am Collins decided to end the chase, largely due to the fact that the <i>Sydney</i> was almost out of ammunition. <i>Sydney</i> though hit several times during the battle she suffered no casualties, but casualties were suffered in subsequent air attacks. <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 6 September <!--del_lnk--> 1940 HMAS <i>Australia</i> was ordered to sail to <a href="../../wp/f/Freetown.htm" title="Freetown">Freetown</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> to join an <!--del_lnk--> invasion force.

When one of them the <!--del_lnk--> Gloire developed engine trouble, <i>Australia</i> escorted her towards <!--del_lnk--> Casablanca and returned to the fleet two days later. On <!--del_lnk--> 23 September <i>Australia</i> came under heavy fire from shore batteries and then drove two <!--del_lnk--> Vichy destroyers back into port. <i>Australia</i> then engaged and sunk the destroyer <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Audacieux</i> with eight salvos in sixteen minutes.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Scrap Iron Flotilla was an Australian destroyer group that operated in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> during World War II. The name Scrap Iron Flotilla was bestowed upon the group by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">Propaganda</a> Minister <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Goebbels who described the fleet as a <i>&quot;consignment of junk&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Australia&rsquo;s Scrap-Iron Flotilla&quot;</i>. The flotilla consisted of five vessels the <!--del_lnk--> Scott class destroyer <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Stuart</i> which acted as flotilla leader and four <!--del_lnk--> V class destroyers; <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vampire</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vendetta</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Voyager</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Waterhen</i>. The ships were all built to fight in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and were slow and poorly armed compared to newer ships. The five destroyers which made up Australia&#39;s total destroyer force departed Australian in November 1939 destined for <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>. In Singapore the destroyers carried out anti-submarine exercises with the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, the RAN had not seen submarines since the departure of <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Oxley</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Otway</i> in 1931. On <!--del_lnk--> 13 November <!--del_lnk--> 1939 the flotilla sailed left Singapore for the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a> following a request from the <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty for assistance. The flotilla took part in multiple actions while in the Mediterranean including the evacuation of <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> in April 1941, though the flotilla came to fame in the mission to re supply the <!--del_lnk--> besieged city of Tobruk. The resupply routes from <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria and <!--del_lnk--> Mersa Matruh to <!--del_lnk--> Tobruk became known as <i>&quot;Bomb Alley&quot;</i> and was subject to constant <!--del_lnk--> Axis air attacks. The flotilla which by this time was in poor condition but managed to make 138 runs to <!--del_lnk--> Tobruk carrying in ammunition and stores and taking out wounded soldiers. <i>Vampire</i> left the Mediterranean on <!--del_lnk--> 28 May <!--del_lnk--> 1941 but the remaining four destroyers remained until July 1941. Of the five destroyers in the flotilla three were lost during the war; <i>Waterhen</i> was sunk in the Mediterranean on <!--del_lnk--> 30 June <!--del_lnk--> 1941, while <i>Vampire</i> was sunk by <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> aircraft and <i>Voyager</i> ran aground in <!--del_lnk--> Betano Bay.<p><a id="Red_Sea" name="Red_Sea"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Red Sea</span></h3>

In August 1940 <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> forces advanced into <!--del_lnk--> British Somaliland, after a fighting withdrawal the small <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">British</a> garrison was evacuated from <!--del_lnk--> Berbera with <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Hobart</i> assisting in the destruction of the port and its facilities. To aid in the delaying action the <i>Hobart</i> sent a 3-pounder gun ashore, manned by volunteers from the crew. The volunteers were captures by the Italians, and then liberated only months later. Two RAN sloops joined the Red Sea force in 1940, the <i>Parramatta</i> on <!--del_lnk--> 30 July and the <i>Yarra</i> in September. In October <i>Yarra</i> engaged two Italian destroyers attempting to raid a convoy; <i>Yarra</i> drove the destroyers off saving the convoy.

      <p>After the Japanese attacks on the <!--del_lnk--> Allies in December 1941, the RAN redeployed its larger ships to home waters to protect the Australian mainland from Japanese attack, while several small ships remained in the Mediterranean. From 1940 onwards there was considerable <!--del_lnk--> Axis naval activity in Australian waters first from <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> commerce raiders and submarines and later by the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese navy.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, the <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> <!--del_lnk--> light cruiser <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sydney</i> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> auxiliary cruiser <!--del_lnk--> HSK <i>Kormoran</i> <!--del_lnk--> engaged each other in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, off <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia.

      <p>In March 1942 a joint <!--del_lnk--> ABDA naval force meet a Japanese invasion force in the <!--del_lnk--> Java Sea, the engagement became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Java Sea. The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Leander</i> class cruiser, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Perth</i> and the American <!--del_lnk--> heavy cruiser <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Houston</i> survived the opening battle. <i>Perth</i> and <i>Houston</i> both attempted to move through the Sunda Strait to <!--del_lnk--> Tjilatjap. The <i>Perth</i> was torpedoed by Japanese destroyers during the Battle of Sunda Strait on <!--del_lnk--> 1 March <!--del_lnk--> 1942, and sank with the loss of 350 of her crew and three civilians. While 324 of <i>Perth&#39;s</i> crew survived the sinking and were taken prisoner by the Japanese, 106 died in captivity before the end of the war. The loss of <i>Perth</i> was the second major loss suffered by the RAN at the hands of the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a>, its loss had a major psychological effect on the Australian people.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 2 May <!--del_lnk--> 1942 two ships of the RAN joined a large <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">American</a> force in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Coral Sea; <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Australia</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Hobart</i>, both ships survived the battle. The Battle of the Coral Sea averted a Japanese attack on <!--del_lnk--> Port Moresby and possibly the <!--del_lnk--> Australian mainland. In late May and early June, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, a group of five <a href="../../wp/i/Imperial_Japanese_Navy.htm" title="Imperial Japanese Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> submarines made a series of <!--del_lnk--> attacks on Sydney and the nearby port of <!--del_lnk--> Newcastle.

In the early hours of the morning of <!--del_lnk--> 9 August <!--del_lnk--> 1942 the RAN heavy cruiser HMAS <i>Canberra</i> was severely damaged off <!--del_lnk--> Guadalcanal in a surprise attack by a powerful Japanese naval force. <i>Canberra</i> was hit 24 times in less than two minutes and 84 of her crew were killed including Captain <!--del_lnk--> Frank Getting.

      <p>Following World War II, the RAN reduced its surface fleet but continued to expand in other ways, acquiring two Royal Navy <!--del_lnk--> <i>Majestic</i> class aircraft carriers then under construction (<!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Majestic</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Terrible</i>) to build up a <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Air Arm. In the 1960s the RAN began to move away from commissioning British designs; the last major British design used was the <!--del_lnk--> Type 12 frigate, which formed the basis of the &quot;River&quot; class frigates. When it was decided that the RAN should commission a destroyer armed with <!--del_lnk--> guided missiles, the obvious British design was the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;County&quot; class; however, the RAN had reservations regarding the <!--del_lnk--> gas turbine propulsion, the <!--del_lnk--> Seaslug missile system, and being able to adapt the design to Australian needs. So, the Australian government chose the <!--del_lnk--> steam turbine powered <!--del_lnk--> <i>Charles F. Adams</i> class destroyer, armed with the <!--del_lnk--> Tartar missile as the basis for its <i>Perth</i> class, the first major US warship design chosen for the RAN.<p>By the mid-late 1960s, the RAN was at the zenith of its operational capabilities; it was capable of dispatching a full <!--del_lnk--> carrier battle group in support of major operations by having in service an aircraft carrier, three large area defence destroyers of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Perth</i> class, six modern <!--del_lnk--> &quot;River&quot; class frigates and four <!--del_lnk--> <i>Oberon</i> class submarines.<p><a id="Roles_in_post-war_conflicts" name="Roles_in_post-war_conflicts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Roles in post-war conflicts</span></h3>

On <!--del_lnk--> May 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1964 the 16th Minesweeping Squadron comprising six <!--del_lnk--> Ton class minesweeper was also deployed.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 13 December <!--del_lnk--> 1964 <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Teal</i> whilst operating as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Singapore Strait patrol, was fired upon with automatic weapons by an unlit vessel. The vessel was overpowered and arrested by <i>Teal</i> following a further small arms engagement that resulted in the deaths of three Indonesian crew members. On <!--del_lnk--> 23 February <!--del_lnk--> 1965 <i>Teal</i> was again involved in another engagement, she detected an unlit vessel off <!--del_lnk--> Cape Rachado. The suspicious vessel was closed on and illuminated, and revealed nine armed men in uniform who surrendered immediately upon challenge. <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Hawk</i> became the second vessel of the 16th Minesweeping Squadron to see action when on <!--del_lnk--> 13 March <!--del_lnk--> 1966 while patrolling off <!--del_lnk--> Raffles Light came under fire from an Indonesian shore battery. Eleven high explosive rounds were fired at the ship some landing within 200 yards of the vessel, <i>Hawk</i> withdrew from the area at speed. The following morning <i>Hawk</i> intercepted a sampan with five Indonesians on board who were promptly arrested.<p>When Indonesian forces crossed the border into <!--del_lnk--> Sebatik Island, <!--del_lnk--> Sabah on <!--del_lnk--> 28 June <!--del_lnk--> 1965, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Yarra</i> was called on to carry out bombardments disrupting the withdrawal of the Indonesians.

      <p>Ships of the Royal Australian Navy were stationed on continuous operational service in Vietnam between 1965 and 1972, in total 18 ships served in Vietnam waters during the war. During this period the Navy performed a wide variety of operational tasks at sea, ashore and in the air. The RAN&#39;s primary contribution consisted of destroyers, <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Air Arm personnel attached to a <!--del_lnk--> United States Army helicopter company and <!--del_lnk--> No. 9 Squadron RAAF, a Clearance Diving Team, and a logistic support force consisting of transport and escort ships. Other RAN personnel served ashore in medical teams or performed staff duties at the Australian Embassy in <a href="../../wp/h/Ho_Chi_Minh_City.htm" title="Saigon">Saigon</a> or the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Australian Task Force Headquarters in <!--del_lnk--> Nui Dat.<p>The RAN did not deploy operationally until 1965, but in 1962 <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Vampire</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Quickmatch</i> made goodwill visits to Saigon. They were followed a year later by similar visits by <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Quiberon</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Queensborough</i>. In 1967 <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Hobart</i> became the first RAN destroyer to be operationally deployed to <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. <i>Hobart</i> served three tours in Vietnam from March to September in 1967, 1968 and 1970. During her operation she fired 10,000 rounds at 1000 shore targets and came under fire around 10 times. <i>Hobart</i> was awarded a US Navy Unit Commendation in recognition of her service in Vietnam while her sister ship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Perth</i> received both the US Navy Unit Commendation and the US Meritorious Unit Commendation. In their five years service in Vietnam, the four gunline destroyers; <i>Perth</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Brisbane</i>, <i>Hobart</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Vendetta</i> steamed over 397,000 miles and fired 102,546 rounds.<p>The aircraft carrier <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sydney</i> was converted for troopship duties in the early 1960s and began her first voyage to <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in May 1965, transporting the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Vung Tau in southern Vietnam. Sydney became known as the <i>Vung Tau Ferry</i> and made 25 voyages to Vietnam carrying 16,094 troops, 5,753 deadweight tons (5,845 t) of cargo and 2,375 vehicles.<p>In 1969 <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Melbourne</i> while performing exercises with the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy in the <a href="../../wp/s/South_China_Sea.htm" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a> again rammed and sunk another destroyer. The <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Frank E. Evans</i> was cut in half by <i>Melbourne</i>. Her bow sank instantly, taking 74 of her crew down with it. Evans was stricken from the <!--del_lnk--> Naval Vessel Register on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1969. Again the <i>Melbourne&#39;s</i> captain was cleared of any responsibility for the disaster, but he met the same fate as <i>Melbourne&#39;s</i> previous captain and was transferred to a shore posting. HMAS <i>Melbourne</i> is credited as being the only warship to ram and sink two friendly destroyers in peace time.<p>In April 1971 <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> John Gorton announced that Australian forces in Vietnam would be reduced. This led to the withdrawal of the clearance divers in May and the <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Air Arm in June. The final RAN destroyer on the gunline, <i>Brisbane</i>, returned to Sydney on <!--del_lnk--> 15 October <!--del_lnk--> 1971. The <!--del_lnk--> Whitlam government withdrew all Australian forces from and stopped military aid to <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnam. <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Jeparit</i> returned to Sydney on <!--del_lnk--> 11 March <!--del_lnk--> 1972 and was followed the next day by HMAS <i>Sydney</i>.

      <p>During the morning of <!--del_lnk--> 25 December <!--del_lnk--> 1974 <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Cyclone Tracy struck the city of <!--del_lnk--> Darwin killing 71 people and causing $4 billion of damage (1998 <!--del_lnk--> AUD). In response to the cyclone the RAN embarked upon the largest peacetime disaster relief operation in its history, involving 13 ships, 11 aircraft and some 3000 personnel.<p>When Tracy struck Darwin the RAN had a total of 351 personnel based in the city along with four <!--del_lnk--> Attack class patrol boats, the small number of men limited the capability of the RAN to render immediate assistance to the citizens of Darwin. Of the four Attack class patrol boats based in Darwin all four were damaged in some way by the storm. <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Arrow</i> sunk under Stokes Hill Wharf with the loss of two sailors, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Attack</i> was beached by the force of the winds at Doctor&#39;s Gully and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Advance</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Assail</i> were slightly damaged. Land based naval installations were also heavily damaged by the cyclone, Darwin Naval Headquarters was destroyed, as was large sections of the patrol boat base and the married quarters. The oil fuel supply installation and naval communications station at <!--del_lnk--> HMAS Coonawarra were also damaged. The initial RAN relief which was limited to search and rescue in the area of Darwin Harbour and <!--del_lnk--> Melville Island was hindered by the lack of reliable communications.<p>As the severity of the disaster was realised a naval task force under Rear Admiral R.E. Wells was established to render aid to the people of Darwin, the operation became known as Operation Help Darwin. A general recall was issued to all personnel, of the 2700 <!--del_lnk--> Sydney based sailors on leave at the time some 2200 were able to return to their ships, volunteers filled any vacant positions onboard. The first RAN assets began to arrived in Darwin on <!--del_lnk--> 26 December, a <!--del_lnk--> Hawker-Siddeley 748 from <!--del_lnk--> 851 Squadron landed at <!--del_lnk--> Darwin Airport carrying blood transfusion equipment and <!--del_lnk--> Red Cross workers, followed shortly by another HS748 carrying <!--del_lnk--> Clearance Diving Team One (CDT 1). Ships also began departing for Darwin on <!--del_lnk--> 26 December, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Balikpapan</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Betano</i> sailed from <!--del_lnk--> Brisbane, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Flinders</i> sailed from <!--del_lnk--> Cairns and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Melbourne</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Brisbane</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Stuart</i> sailed from <!--del_lnk--> Sydney.

Some displaced residents were housed in the many naval bases located on <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Harbour and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Moreton</i> in Brisbane.<p>The first vessels HMAS <i>Brisbane</i> and <i>Flinders</i> arrived in Darwin on <!--del_lnk--> 31 December, <i>Flinders</i> surveyed the approaches to Darwin ensuring the safety of the taskforce, while <i>Brisbane</i> landed working parties and established communications. The entire task force had arrived in Darwin by <!--del_lnk--> 13 January <!--del_lnk--> 1975, the force brought more than 3,000 personnel to the city. Men of the task force usually worked in small working parties of 10 to 15 men depending on the task.<p>The Men and Women of the RAN made a significant contribution to the relief effort; from <!--del_lnk--> January 1 to <!--del_lnk--> January 30 naval personnel spent 17,979 man days ashore, with up to 1200 ashore at one time. Some 1593 housing blocks were cleared and government and private facilities cleaned up. <!--del_lnk--> Westland Wessex helicopters transported 7,832 passengers, 110,912 kg of supplies and freight and made 2,505 landings. The <!--del_lnk--> Hawker-Siddeley 748 aircraft made a total of 14 return flights to Darwin and carried out 485 passengers and brought in 22,680 kg of freight. Vessels of the task force began to depart Darwin as early as 7 January, with the last vessels HMAS <i>Brisbane</i> and <i>Stalwart</i> departing on 31 January.

      <p>Following the introduction of the 1982 <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the <!--del_lnk--> exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of many coastal nations was increased from 12 nautical miles (NM) to 200 NM. The sudden expansion of responsibility dramatically increased the area of ocean requiring surveillance, monitoring and policing by these nations, increasing the strain on existing maritime patrol resources, and highlighting the need for countries without a maritime patrol force to obtain one, especially in the <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">South West Pacific</a> area.<p>In 1979 the Australian and <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand governments, at the request of Pacific island nations, sent defence representatives into the South-West Pacific region to assess surveillance and maritime patrol requirements. The governments of a number of the Pacific nations expressed their concern about the need for a suitable naval patrol force to meet their new surveillance requirements. The Australian government responded by creating the Defence Cooperation Project (DCP), to provide suitable patrol vessels, training and infrastructure to island nations in the region. The Pacific Patrol Boat Systems Program Office was created within the Minor War Vessels Branch of the RAN procurement organisation.<p>The tender for the vessels was released in August 1984 and was awarded to Australian Shipbuilding Industries Pty Ltd (now <!--del_lnk--> Tenix Western Australia) in September 1985. The frist of ten vessels was to be delivered in early 1987. The first vessel, HMPNGS <i>Tarangau</i>, was officially handed over to the <!--del_lnk--> Papua New Guinea Defence Force on <!--del_lnk--> 16 May <!--del_lnk--> 1987. Over the course of the project the number of participating countries increased. By the end of the construction phase of the project a total of 22 boats delivered to 12 countries, compared to the original order of 10 boats for 8 countries. In total, the project cost for 22 vessels and associated support was $A155.25 million.<p>The RAN never operated the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific-class patrol boat (PPB) the project has given the RAN a number of advantages in the Pacific region. The introduction of self-reliant patrol forces throughout the region has eased the strain on Australia&rsquo;s own maritime patrol force. Cooperation between Australia and its Pacific neighbours has allowed for a greater allocation of RAN patrol boats to protecting Australia&rsquo;s maritime resources, patrolling the <!--del_lnk--> Sea Lines of Communication (SLOC), and conducting border protection operations. The PPB&#39;s have recently undergone a mid life refit which could potentially see them operating in the region until at least 2027.<p><a id="Two_Ocean_Navy_Policy" name="Two_Ocean_Navy_Policy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Two Ocean Navy Policy</span></h3>
      <p>The main role of the Royal Australian Navy in the two decades following the end of Australia&#39;s involvement in the Vietnam War was supporting Australian diplomatic initiatives. In line with this goal the RAN exercised with the navies of Australia&#39;s allies and provided support to civil authorities in Australia and the South Pacific. The RAN&#39;s main military concern from the 1970s was the activities of the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Navy in the Indian Ocean. These concerns lead to increased cooperation with the United States Navy and the development of the RAN&#39;s main base in Western Australia, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Stirling</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the late 1970s the RAN replaced many of its aging ships with modern equivalents. While it was planned to purchase the British aircraft carrier <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Invincible</i> to replace <i>Melbourne</i>, Britain&#39;s offer of the carrier was withdrawn after the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War and the <i>Melbourne</i> was decommissioned without replacement in 1982 and the Fleet Air Arm retired almost all of its fixed wing aircraft on 30 June 1983.<p>In 1987 the <!--del_lnk--> Hawke Government&#39;s Defence White Paper called for the RAN to become a more self reliant <i>two-ocean</i> navy with major fleet bases in <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales and <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia. The plan called for the expansion of <!--del_lnk--> <i>Stirling</i> on <!--del_lnk--> Garden Island and <!--del_lnk--> Jervis Bay to accommodate an expanded RAN combat surface and submarine fleets. The plan originally called for the major combat units and submarines to be split between the two fleet bases, providing similar capabilities on both sided of the continent. The proposed Jervis Bay naval base never became a reality; Fleet Base East was built up around <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Kuttabul</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Sydney while HMAS <i>Stirling</i> is home to half the surface fleet and the entire submarine fleet. The rationale behind the policy included. The possibility of savings in fuel and maintenance that would result from <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> deployments beginning their journey from <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia rather than <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales. The report also classed the Indian Ocean as an area where contingencies might arise. The new facilities would increase Australia&#39;s worth to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, particularly to do with maintenance of submarines. Expansion at Jervis Bay would allow intensified east coast visits by the <!--del_lnk--> US Pacific Fleet, and its nuclear warship visits would not run into as much opposition as they do in Sydney and <!--del_lnk--> Melbourne.<p>The 1987 White Paper was seen by many as an attempt to strengthen Australia&#39;s relationship with the United States which was damaged by <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealands</a> stance against nuclear weapons in its ports. In line with this policy the RAN was structured to become more self-reliant and its activities during the late 1980s were focused on operating within Australia&#39;s local region.<p>The Two Ocean Policy remains in place today and is supported by the current <!--del_lnk--> government and the opposition. The success of the policy is especially evident at HMAS <i>Stirling</i>. The base is thriving and its location both in a global and local context gives it an advantage over Fleet Base East. It has been suggested that all 8 units of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Anzac</i> class be relocated to <i>Stirling</i>, this would create an easier training environment for sailors and would lead to significant cost savings.<p><a id="Post_Cold_War" name="Post_Cold_War"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post Cold War</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Australia&#39;s contribution to the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 Gulf War centered around a Naval Task Group which formed part of the multi-national fleet in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Oman. In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US <!--del_lnk--> hospital ship and a <!--del_lnk--> naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait&rsquo;s port facilities at the end of the war. Over the period from <!--del_lnk--> September 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1990 to <!--del_lnk--> September 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1991 the RAN deployed a total of 6 ships to the area they were <!--del_lnk--> <i>Adelaide</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Brisbane</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Darwin</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Success</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sydney</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Westralia</i>. Clearance Diving Team 3 operated in the theatre from <!--del_lnk--> 27 January <!--del_lnk--> 1991 to <!--del_lnk--> 10 May <!--del_lnk--> 1991.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 5 May <!--del_lnk--> 1998 a fire broke out onboard <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Westralia</i> while off the <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia coast. The fire was caused by the rupture of a flexible fuel line (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on cylinder number nine starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot indicator cock, which ignited a spray fire. The resulting fire caused the deaths of four people onboard. Following the fire the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as the <i>Westralia Board of Inquiry</i>. The enquiry found that the RAN and the contractor <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in the RAN and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose. In 2005 ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were apparently severely traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and sub contractor Jetrock. In August 2006 the Australian Government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock.

The last ship to leave was <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Fremantle</i> which sailed home in October 2004.<p>Operation ANODE was not the first time units of the RAN had been deployed to the Solomon Islands, ANODE was unique in that the navy&#39;s primary role was to support and facilitate the work of the Participating Police Force (PPF). Moreover, in addition to being the first time the RAN had supported a police lead mission. Operation Anode and RAMSI is one of the latest examples of the role Australia and specifically the RAN is playing in stableising the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific region.<p><a id="Modern_Navy" name="Modern_Navy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Navy</span></h2>

      <p>The Royal Australian Navy today is a medium sized modern navy in world terms but is one of the strongest navies in the <!--del_lnk--> Asia Pacific Region. Today the combat fleet of the RAN is made up of 8 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Anzac</i> class frigates, 5 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Adelaide</i> class frigates, 13 patrol boats of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Armidale</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fremantle</i> classes and 6 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Collins</i> class submarines. The RAN also comprises a large amphibious and supply force in order to transport the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Army and to resupply the combat arm of the navy. The RAN is divided into 7 <!--del_lnk--> Force Element Groups (FEG); Surface Combatants, Amphibious Warfare Forces and Afloat Support Force, <!--del_lnk--> Naval Aviation, <!--del_lnk--> Submarine Force, Mine Warfare and <!--del_lnk--> Clearance Diving, <!--del_lnk--> Patrol Boat Force and the Hydrographic Force. The FEG&#39;s were formed to manage the operations of the separate sections of the RAN in a more efficient way.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The modern RAN began to form during the late <!--del_lnk--> 1970s when the <!--del_lnk--> Fraser Government announced the purchase of 4 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Oliver Hazard Perry</i> class frigates all to be built in America; in 1980 they announced an additional 2 vessels both to be built in Australia. The 15 vessels of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fremantle</i> class have been Australia&#39;s lead patrol boat since 1979 replacing the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Attack</i> Class, all <i>Attack</i> class vessels were decommissioned by 1985. The <i>Fremantle</i> class is itself being replaced with the <i>Armidale</i> class; today only 5 of the 15 <i>Fremantle</i> class ships remain in service.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Collins</i> class is the newest class of Australian submarines, built in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> for the Royal Australian Navy. They were built by the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Submarine Corporation in <!--del_lnk--> Adelaide, South Australia. They replace much older <!--del_lnk--> <i>Oberon</i> class submarines in the Australian fleet. The first vessel <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Collins</i> was laid down in 1990 and commissioned in 1996, today all six vessels of the class are operational and based <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Stirling</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Anzac</i> class is today the main fleet unit of the Royal Australian Navy, with the last of the 8 ships, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Perth</i> commissioned on the <!--del_lnk--> 26 August <!--del_lnk--> 2006 and two ships also constructed for the <!--del_lnk--> Royal New Zealand Navy. These ships were built in both <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> with there final fitout in <!--del_lnk--> Williamstown, Victoria.<p>The amphibious and supply arm of the RAN is made up of; 2 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kanimbla</i> class landing platform, one heavy landing ship <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Tobruk</i>, 6 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Balikpapan</i> class landing craft, 2 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Leeuwin</i> class survey ships, 4 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Paluma</i> class survey vessels, one fleet oiler, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Sirius</i> and the Dual Stores Replenishment Vessel <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Success</i>. The RAN also has 6 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Huon</i> class minehunters.<p>The Royal Australian Navy maintains several bases around Australia. Under the RAN&#39;s Two Ocean Policy two of these <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Stirling</i> (Fleet Base West) and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Kuttabul</i> (Fleet Base East) are the base for all major fleet unit of the RAN. The majority of the patrol boat and amphibious fleets are located at <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Cairns</i> and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Coonawarra</i> while all <!--del_lnk--> Fleet Air Arm squadrons are located at <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Albatross</i> in <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales.<p><a id="The_future_of_the_RAN" name="The_future_of_the_RAN"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The future of the RAN</span></h2>

      <p>In 2000 a major <!--del_lnk--> white paper was produced by the <!--del_lnk--> Australian government which set out a program of defence spending that will see significant improvements to the RAN&#39;s fleet and capabilities.<p>The most significant current project is <i>Sea4000</i> the procurement of three <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hobart</i> class destroyers, which will replace the <i>Adelaide</i> class.. These ships will be fitted with the <!--del_lnk--> AEGIS combat system, and will be based on either the United States <!--del_lnk--> <i>Arleigh Burke</i> design design or the Spanish <!--del_lnk--> F100 design. The class has a planned in service date of <!--del_lnk--> 2013, with the three units to be named <i>Hobart</i>, <i>Brisbane</i> and <i>Sydney</i>.<p>The RAN is currently in the process of replacing its <!--del_lnk--> patrol boat fleet. The 15 <!--del_lnk--> Fremantle class patrol boats which entered service in 1979 are currently being replaced with 14 <!--del_lnk--> <i>Armidale</i> class vessels. Designed and built by <!--del_lnk--> Austal Ships, the lead ship of the Armidale class, <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Armidale</i> was commissioned into the RAN in June <!--del_lnk--> 2005. The entire Armidale class fleet is expected to be in service by late 2007 and will provide greater flexibility and capabilities to the RAN.<p>In August 2005 the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Government passed approval for the acquisition of two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Canberra</i> class large amphibious ships; these will displace over 20,000 tonnes and have the capability to carry over 1,000 troops and will potentially be able to operate fixed wing aircraft. The project is expected to cost between $1.5 and $2 billion <!--del_lnk--> Australian dollars and be completed by around 2014.The new ships will be named Canberra and Adelaide.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Royal_Australian_Navy&quot;</div>
