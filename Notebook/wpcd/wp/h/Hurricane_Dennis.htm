      <p><b>Hurricane Dennis</b> was an early-forming major <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricane</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean and <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> during the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. Dennis was the fourth named storm, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the season. In July, the hurricane set several records for early season hurricane activity, becoming both the earliest formation of a fourth tropical cyclone and the strongest <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane ever to form before August, according to available records.<p>Dennis hit <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> twice as a Category 4 hurricane on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and made landfall on the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> as a Category 3 storm less than a year after <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a> did so. Dennis caused at least 89 deaths (42 direct) in the U.S. and <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean and caused $2.23 billion (2005 <!--del_lnk--> US dollars) in damages to the United States, as well as an approximately equal amount of damage in the Caribbean, primarily on <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>.<p>

      <p>Hurricane Dennis began as <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Depression Four in the southeastern <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on the evening of <!--del_lnk--> July 4, the first storm of the season to form away from <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central America. Almost immediately, it made landfall on <a href="../../wp/g/Grenada.htm" title="Grenada">Grenada</a> as a tropical depression with 30 mph winds. On the morning of <!--del_lnk--> July 5, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dennis in the eastern Caribbean; this was the earliest formation of an Atlantic season&#39;s fourth storm (by comparison, during the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2004 Atlantic hurricane season">2004 season</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Alex_%25282004%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Alex (2004)">Hurricane Alex</a> formed in early August and <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Charley.htm" title="Hurricane Charley">Hurricane Charley</a> made landfall in <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> on <!--del_lnk--> August 12). The newly named Dennis began moving rapidly to the west-northwest.<p>It was very clear from early weather forecasting models that Dennis had the potential to be a major storm, and it was predicted to reach hurricane status while still a tropical depression. It reached hurricane strength on the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> July 6 while approaching the southern coast of <!--del_lnk--> Hispaniola, and it quickly became a strong and well-organized Category 1 storm on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The next day it strengthened rapidly to become a Category 4 major hurricane, the earliest in an Atlantic hurricane season that a storm had reached that strength since <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Audrey in the <!--del_lnk--> 1957 season. After rapid strengthening, Dennis&#39;s track became slightly more northerly, bringing it between <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> by <!--del_lnk--> July 7; both countries experienced high winds and heavy rain.<p>As it approached Cuba and strengthened to just under <!--del_lnk--> Category 5 intensity, Dennis&#39;s track began to wobble. Meteorologists from the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre (NHC) stated, &quot;this type of erratic motion is not unusual for intensifying major hurricanes.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane warnings were issued for Cuba at 11 a.m. <!--del_lnk--> EDT (1500 <!--del_lnk--> UTC). Dennis made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Punta del Ingl&eacute;s with 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds late that day, and dropped down to a Category 3 storm while crossing the peninsula. As it moved back into the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Guacanayabo, its wind speed increased to a peak of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h). Dennis then slammed into south-central Cuba just west of <!--del_lnk--> Punta Mangles Altos on <!--del_lnk--> July 8, again with 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) winds.<p>Crossing Cuba&#39;s mountainous terrain disrupted the storm&#39;s circulation, weakening Dennis to <!--del_lnk--> Category 1 intensity. However, NHC forecasts continued to indicate the possibility of a return to <!--del_lnk--> Category 4 status after <!--del_lnk--> convection was re-established. This prediction was borne out when Dennis rapidly reintensified on the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> July 9 over the Gulf Loop Current, a reintensification described by NHC as having occurred &quot;at a rate that bordered on insane.&quot; The storm reached Category 4 intensity again on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> July 10. At 1200 <!--del_lnk--> UTC, the storm reached its peak intensity of 930&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mbar (27.47 inHg), surpassing <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Audrey and setting a new record for the strongest storm to form prior to August; the new record stood for less than two weeks before <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Emily surpassed it by reaching a pressure of 929&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mbar (27.43&nbsp;inHg). <div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>The storm continued moving north-northwest towards the central Gulf Coast, which had seen the landfalls of <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Arlene in June and <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Cindy the previous week. By the morning of <!--del_lnk--> July 10, hurricane warnings were in effect in the U.S. for the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle, <!--del_lnk--> Alabama, and <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi, with tropical storm warnings extending further east and west along the coast. The NHC predicted a landing at near full strength in the late afternoon. However, much like <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a> which struck in the same area the previous year, the storm weakened just before landfall; its maximum sustained winds dropped from 145&nbsp;mph (235&nbsp;km/h, Category 4 strength) to 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h, Category 3 strength).<p>Continental landfall occurred at <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosa Island, between <!--del_lnk--> Pensacola, Florida, and <!--del_lnk--> Navarre Beach, Florida, at 2:25 p.m. CDT (1925 UTC) on <!--del_lnk--> July 10. Dennis was a <!--del_lnk--> Category 3 hurricane with winds of 115 to 120&nbsp;mph (185 to 195&nbsp;km/h). The highest official wind speed reported was a 121&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) wind gust at Navarre Beach. The storm lost strength over the day and was a tropical depression by early on <!--del_lnk--> July 11. The depression persisted, however, and gained a little strength while stalled over <!--del_lnk--> Illinois the next day. It finally dissipated in <!--del_lnk--> Ontario on <!--del_lnk--> July 13, with advisories ceasing a full three days after landfall.<p><a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>
      <p>Combined with Hurricane Cindy&#39;s landfall on the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast of the United States, uncertainty over Dennis&#39;s final landfall helped push oil prices to a record high of $61.28 a barrel on <!--del_lnk--> July 6, and again to $61.50 on <!--del_lnk--> July 7, although they dropped below $60 on <!--del_lnk--> July 8. Dennis was originally forecast to strike <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana, one of the oil-producing regions of the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf coast. Speculative spikes in oil prices due to Hurricane Dennis foreshadowed the far greater price spikes caused by Hurricanes <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Katrina</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Rita in late August and September.<p>In <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> officials evacuated residents along the coastline, but noted that many were not obliging. In <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> more than 600,000 residents were moved from their homes to government shelters or other locations in anticipation of Dennis.<p>In the United States, the lower <!--del_lnk--> Florida Keys were placed under a mandatory evacuation order, and a nonresident and mobile home resident evacuation was ordered for the remainder of the Keys. This evacuation was cancelled the night of <!--del_lnk--> July 8, as there was no longer sufficient time for stragglers in the Florida Keys to safely leave. Furthermore, the <!--del_lnk--> governors of <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Alabama, <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi and <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana all declared <!--del_lnk--> states of emergency in their states.<p>At 6 a.m. CDT (2300 UTC) on <!--del_lnk--> July 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, all southbound lanes on <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 65 from <!--del_lnk--> Mobile to <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery, Alabama, were closed. Traffic was redirected, making all four lanes northbound to allow evacuations. In Alabama residents in all parts of <!--del_lnk--> Mobile County, and those south of <!--del_lnk--> I-10 in <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin County, were ordered to evacuate. Similar orders were issued in Mississippi for parts of <!--del_lnk--> Jackson, <!--del_lnk--> Hancock, and <!--del_lnk--> Harrison counties; and for coastal areas in the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle stretching from <!--del_lnk--> Escambia County to <!--del_lnk--> Bay County. Likewise, military installations such as <!--del_lnk--> NAS Pensacola, <!--del_lnk--> Whiting Field, <!--del_lnk--> Eglin AFB, <!--del_lnk--> Hurlburt Field and <!--del_lnk--> Tyndall AFB were all evacuated days before the storm.<p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>

Furthermore, 24 persons are still listed as missing.<p>From there the storm moved to <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, leaving 16 people dead and $1.4 billion in damages as it roared through the island, flattening houses and downing trees and power lines. According to reports from the Cuban government, 120,000 homes were damaged, 15,000 of which were destroyed. The citrus and vegetable industries were also devastated as Cuba&#39;s primary agricultural regions were the hardest hit. Nonetheless, <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> publicly refused US aid after the storm in protest of the ongoing US trade embargo against Cuba, stating that, &quot;If they offered $1 billion we would say no.&quot; Relayed reports from Cuban meteorologists stated that a gust up to 149 mph (239 km/h) was detected at <!--del_lnk--> Cienfuegos, 85% of the power lines were down, and extensive damage to the communications infrastructure had occurred. Dennis was more destructive than the previous year&#39;s <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Charley.htm" title="Hurricane Charley">Hurricane Charley</a> and was widely regarded as the worst hurricane to strike Cuba since <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Flora in the <!--del_lnk--> 1963 season.<p><a id="United_States" name="United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">United States</span></h3>

      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, damage was not as high as originally expected, mainly because Dennis was more compact and moved more quickly than initially forecast. Dennis made landfall approximately 30 miles to the east of where <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a> had made landfall 10 months before, but did not cause as much damage as Ivan. Dennis moved about 7&nbsp;mph (11&nbsp;km/h) faster than Ivan at landfall, and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) from its centre, compared to Ivan&#39;s 105&nbsp;miles (170&nbsp;km/h).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the height of the storm, Dennis produced storm surges as high as 9&nbsp;ft (3&nbsp;m) in the <!--del_lnk--> Apalachee Bay region, and as high as 7&nbsp;(2&nbsp;m) on the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle, and left 680,000 customers without electricity in four southern states. No significant damage was reported to most structures; however, insurers initially estimated that Dennis caused $3&ndash;$5 billion in insured damage, or approximately $6&ndash;$10 billion total (insured damage estimates are generally held to be approximately one-half of total damages). However, the NHC&#39;s Tropical Cyclone Report reported total damage in the United States as only $2.23 billion with $1.115 billion of insured damage.<p>Dennis caused at least 10 tornadoes in the U.S., although only one of them reached F1 status on the <!--del_lnk--> Fujita scale. The storm dropped over 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) of rain in some areas of Alabama and Georgia (see the <!--del_lnk--> rainfall graphic). Parts of Georgia, which had received heavy rain just days earlier from <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Cindy, suffered heavy flooding, and flash-floods were reported on the outskirts of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> metropolitan area.<div style="clear: left; float: left">

      <p>In the United States, 15 storm-related deaths (14 in Florida) were reported, including one in <!--del_lnk--> Walton County, three in <!--del_lnk--> Broward County,, three in <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte County, one each in <!--del_lnk--> Nassau and <!--del_lnk--> Escambia Counties  and one in <!--del_lnk--> Decatur, Georgia. In the Gulf of Mexico, the storm heavily damaged the <!--del_lnk--> Thunder Horse, a <a href="../../wp/b/BP.htm" title="BP">BP</a> <!--del_lnk--> oil rig about 150 miles (240 km) southeast of <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans, Louisiana, causing it to list badly.<p>One beneficial effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling of the former <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Spiegel Grove</i>. <i>Spiegel Grove</i> was sunk in <!--del_lnk--> Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in an attempt to create an artificial <!--del_lnk--> reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to roll the ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing <i>Spiegel Grove</i> into its intended upright position.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h3>
