      <p>Slavery in the ancient cultures was known to occur in civilizations as old as <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a>, and found in every such civilization, including <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Akkadian_Empire.htm" title="Akkadian Empire">Akkadian Empire</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyria</a>, Greece, Rome, parts of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and the <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> <!--del_lnk--> Caliphate. Such institutions were a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> debt-slavery, punishment for crime, the enslavement of <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war, <!--del_lnk--> child abandonment, and the birth of slave children to slaves.<p>Slavery was an important element in the development of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Greek City-states. Records of <!--del_lnk--> slavery in Ancient Greece go as far back as <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean Greece. The treatment of Greek slaves could be said to be harsh, but not extremely brutal.<p>As <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> expanded outward, entire populations were enslaved, thus creating an ample supply. The people subjected to <!--del_lnk--> Roman Slavery came from all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Such oppression by an elite minority eventually led to <!--del_lnk--> slave revolts (see <!--del_lnk--> Roman Servile Wars); the <a href="../../wp/t/Third_Servile_War.htm" title="Third Servile War">Third Servile War</a> led by <!--del_lnk--> Spartacus being the most famous and severe. <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <!--del_lnk--> Africans, <!--del_lnk--> Germans, <!--del_lnk--> Thracians, <!--del_lnk--> Gauls (or <!--del_lnk--> Celts), <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, and many more were slaves used not only for labour, but also for amusement (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> gladiators). If a slave from Rome ran away, he was liable to be <!--del_lnk--> crucified. By the late Republican era, slavery had become a vital economic pillar in the wealth of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Slavery was so common, the slaves in Rome far outnumbered Roman citizens.<p><a id="The_Vikings" name="The_Vikings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Vikings</span></h3>
      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> era starting c. <!--del_lnk--> 793, the <!--del_lnk--> Norse raiders often captured and enslaved their opponents. In the <!--del_lnk--> Nordic countries the slaves were called <i>Thralls</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Old Norse: <i>&THORN;r&aelig;ll</i>). The thralls were mostly from <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, among them many <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons, and <!--del_lnk--> Celts. There is evidence of German and south European slaves as well. The Norse slavery came to an end with the breakthrough of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">christianity</a> and national laws in the Scandinavian countries.<p><a id="Tudor.2C_Stuart_and_Hanoverian_England" name="Tudor.2C_Stuart_and_Hanoverian_England"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tudor, Stuart and Hanoverian England</span></h3>
      <p>The trade in <!--del_lnk--> serfs in England was made illegal in 1102, and the last form of enforced servitude (<!--del_lnk--> villeinage) had disappeared in Britain by the beginning of the seventeenth century. It resurfaced in that century as a form of punishment against Catholics (see <i>Pre-industrial Europe</i>, below). By the eighteenth century African slaves began to be brought into <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> as personal servants. In a number of judicial decisions between slave merchants, it was tacitly accepted that slavery of Africans was legal.<p>In 1729 the then-Attorney General and Solicitor General of England signed the <!--del_lnk--> Yorke-Talbot slavery opinion expressing their view (and, by implication, that of the Government) that slavery of Africans was lawful in England. At this time slaves were openly bought and sold on markets at London and Liverpool.<p>However, in 1772 a runaway slave named <!--del_lnk--> James Somerset was recaptured, and various abolitionists brought legal proceedings demanding his release, forcing a legal decision for the first time under English law as to the legality of a slave&#39;s detention. One of Somerset&#39;s lawyers, <!--del_lnk--> Francis Hargrave, stated &quot;<i>In 1569, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a lawsuit was brought against a man for beating another man he had bought as a slave overseas. The record states, &#39;That in the 11th [year] of Elizabeth [1569], one Cartwright brought a slave from Russia and would scourge him; for which he was questioned; and it was resolved, that England was too pure an air for a slave to breathe in.</i>&#39; &quot; He argued that the court had ruled in Cartwright&#39;s case that English Common Law made no provision for slavery, and without a basis for its legality, slavery would otherwise be unlawful as <!--del_lnk--> false imprisonment and/or <!--del_lnk--> assault. In his judgment of <!--del_lnk--> 22 June <!--del_lnk--> 1772, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> William Murray, Lord Mansfield, of the <!--del_lnk--> Court of King&#39;s Bench declared: &quot;Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.&quot; Several different reports of Mansfield&#39;s long deliberated, but ultimately very short, decision appeared, and most disagree as to what was actually said. The decision was only given orally, and so no formal written record of it was issued by the court. Abolitionists widely circulated the view that it was declared that the condition of slavery did not exist under <!--del_lnk--> English law, although Mansfield himself later said that all that he actually decided was that a slave could not be forcibly removed from England against his will.<p><a id="Pre-industrial_Europe" name="Pre-industrial_Europe"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-industrial Europe</span></h3>
      <p>Item 20 of <b>The Grand Remonstrance</b>, a list of grievances against <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and presented to him in <!--del_lnk--> 1641, contains the following:<dl>

And although all this was taken upon pretence of guarding the seas, yet a new unheard-of tax of ship-money was devised, and upon the same pretence, by both which there was charged upon the subject near &pound;700,000 some years, and yet the merchants have been left so naked to the violence of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Turkish</a> <!--del_lnk--> pirates, that many great ships of value and thousands of His Majesty&#39;s subjects have been taken by them, and do still remain in miserable slavery.&quot;</dl>
      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th century</a>, slavery was used as punishment by conquering English Parliament armies against native <!--del_lnk--> Catholics in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Between the years 1659 and 1663, during the <!--del_lnk--> Cromwellian conquest of Ireland by the <!--del_lnk--> New Model Army, under the command of <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, thousands of <!--del_lnk--> Irish Catholics were forced into servitude! Cromwell had a deep dislike of the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic religion, and many Irish Catholics who had participated in <!--del_lnk--> Confederate Ireland had all their land confiscated and were transported to the British <!--del_lnk--> West Indies as indentured servants.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church</a> was later implicated in slavery. Slaves owned by the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts on its sugar <!--del_lnk--> plantations in the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies had the word &quot;society&quot; branded on their chests with red-hot irons.<p>When slaves were <!--del_lnk--> emancipated by <!--del_lnk--> Act of the <!--del_lnk--> British Parliament in <!--del_lnk--> 1834 the British Government paid compensation to slave owners. In one case the <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Exeter and three business colleagues got compensation for the 665 slaves they had to set free.<p>Recently (<!--del_lnk--> 2006), <!--del_lnk--> Southwark Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Butler, at the Anglican Church&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> General Synod stated &quot;The profits from the slave trade were part of the bedrock of our country&#39;s industrial development&quot;.<p>In that time <i><!--del_lnk--> second serfdom</i> took place in <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe during this period (particularly in <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Prussia, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>). Only in <!--del_lnk--> 1768 was a law passed in Poland that discontinued the nobility&#39;s control of the right to life or death of serfs. Serfdom remained the practice on the most part of territory of Russia until February 19, 1861.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Arab world has traded in slaves like many other cultures of the region. It was one of the oldest slave trades, predating the European transatlantic slave trade by hundreds of years. The Arab or Middle Eastern slave trade is thought to have originated with trans-Saharan slavery. The <!--del_lnk--> Moors, starting in the 8th century, raided coastal areas of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and Northern European (including British and even as far north as Scandinavian) coastal areas and would carry away sometimes whole villages to the Moorish slave markets on the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Coast. Nautical traders from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> became targets, and frequent victims, of the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates, as soon as that nation began trading with Europe and refused to pay the required tribute to the North African states. The slave trade from East Africa to Arabia was dominated by Arab and African traders in the coastal cities of <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar, <!--del_lnk--> Dar Es Salaam and <!--del_lnk--> Mombasa.<p>Male slaves were employed as servants, soldiers, or laborers by their owners, while female slaves, mostly from Africa, were long traded to Middle Eastern countries and kingdoms by Arab, Indian, or Oriental traders, some as female servants, others as sexual slaves. Arab, Indian, and Oriental traders were involved in the capture and transport of slaves northward across the Sahara desert and the Indian Ocean region into Arabia and the Middle East, Persia, and the Indian subcontinent. As many African slaves may have crossed the Sahara Desert, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean as crossed the Atlantic, perhaps more. Some sources estimate that between 11 and 17 million slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert from 650 to 1900, compared to 11.6 million across the Atlantic from 1500 to the late 1860s. The Arab or Middle Eastern slave trade continued into the early 1900s.<p>Many <!--del_lnk--> Slavic males from the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans, and <!--del_lnk--> Turkic and <!--del_lnk--> Circassian males from the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus Mountains and the eastern <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> regions were taken away from their homes and families and enlisted into special soldier classes of the army of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. These soldier classes were named <!--del_lnk--> Janissaries in the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans and <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor, and <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Janissaries eventually became a decisive factor in the intrigues of the <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> court of the Ottoman sultans, while the Mamluks were mainly responsible for the expulsion of the <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders from <!--del_lnk--> Palestine and preventing the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols from entering <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.<p>The Arab trade in slaves continued into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Written travelogues and other historical works are replete with references to slaves owned by wealthy traders, nobility and heads of state in the Arabian Peninsula well into the 1920s. Slave owning and slave-like working conditions have been documented up to and including the present, in countries of the Middle East. Though the subject is considered taboo in the affected regions, a leading Saudi government cleric and author of the country&#39;s religious curriculum has called for the outright re-legalization of slavery<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Slavery_in_Africa" name="Slavery_in_Africa"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Slavery in Africa</span></h2>

      <p>French historian <!--del_lnk--> Fernand Braudel noted that slavery was endemic in Africa and part of the structure of everyday life. &quot;Slavery came in different disguises in different societies: there were court slaves, slaves incorporated into princely armies, domestic and household slaves, slaves working on the land, in industry, as couriers and intermediaries, even as traders&quot; (Braudel 1984 p. 435). During the 16th century, Europe began to outpace the Arab world in the export traffic, with its slave traffic from Africa to the Americas. The <!--del_lnk--> Dutch imported slaves from Asia into their colony in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. Later, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, which held vast colonial territories on the African continent (including South Africa), made the practice of slavery illegal in these regions. Ironically, the end of the slave trade and the decline of slavery was imposed upon Africa by its European conquerors. This action is what today may be called an instance of <!--del_lnk--> cultural imperialism.<p>The nature of the slave societies differed greatly across the continent. There were large plantations worked by slaves in <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar, but this was not a typical use of slaves in Africa as a whole. In some slave societies, slaves were protected and incorporated into the slave-owning family. In others, slaves were brutally abused, and even used for human sacrifices. Some of the slaves taken by the European slave trade were doubtless slave-owners themselves.<p><a id="Slavery_in_North_Africa" name="Slavery_in_North_Africa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Slavery in North Africa</span></h3>
      <p>As practiced in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>, slavery was not in accord with the modern view of the term. Persons became &quot;slaves&quot; in ancient Egypt by virtue of being captives (or prisoners) of war, committing criminal or other indecent acts, or indebtedness. In many instances, some peasants in ancient Egypt led <i>better</i> livelihoods as slaves than as free persons: some Egyptian peasants purposely sold themselves into slavery as a means of repaying their debts. Though slaves in ancient Egypt could be sold, inherited or offered as gifts, they were not prohibited from learning, achieving greater social rank, purchasing property or negotiating other contracts. One papyrus from the <!--del_lnk--> New Kingdom even records masters being testified against by slave witnesses. Slave children apparently enjoyed some authoritative protection, as a letter from the <!--del_lnk--> 18th dynasty records limits to their use for harsh labor, and Egyptian households further bore the responsibility of adequately raising children of slave parents. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that slaves were not as extensively used in ancient Egypt (Kemet) contrary to popular belief or the stories depicted in the Bible, one such measure is the recent archaeological discovery regarding the pyramids not being built by &#39;slaves&#39;.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 15th and <!--del_lnk--> 16th centuries slaves were imported from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> to <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>. Slave-taking persisted into the 19th century when <!--del_lnk--> Barbary pirates would capture ships and enslave the crew. In all, about 1.5 million Europeans were transported to the <!--del_lnk--> Barbary Coast. It was a period when Europe was preoccupied by sectarian wars and European navies were depleted. The trade was run by expelled <!--del_lnk--> Moors and the slaving expeditions were often captained by Europeans with North African crews. In the early 19th century, European powers started to take action to free Christian slaves. The first major action was the <!--del_lnk--> bombardment of Algiers in <!--del_lnk--> 1816.<p><a id="Slavery_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa" name="Slavery_in_Sub-Saharan_Africa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Slavery in Sub-Saharan Africa</span></h3>

      <p>Prior to the 16th century, the bulk of slaves exported from Africa were shipped from <a href="../../wp/e/East_Africa.htm" title="East Africa">East Africa</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Arabian peninsula. <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar became a leading port on this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European traders in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male slaves.<p>The increased presence of European rivals along the East coast led Arab traders to concentrate on the overland slave caravan routes across the <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> from the <!--del_lnk--> Sahel to North Africa. The German explorer <!--del_lnk--> Gustav Nachtigal reported seeing slave caravans departing from <!--del_lnk--> Kukawa in <!--del_lnk--> Bornu bound for <a href="../../wp/t/Tripoli.htm" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1870. The slave trade represented the major source of revenue for the state of Bornu as late as 1898. Further south, the eastern regions of the <a href="../../wp/c/Central_African_Republic.htm" title="Central African Republic">Central African Republic</a> have never recovered demographically from the impact of nineteenth-century raids from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> and still have a population density of less than 1 person/km.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Middle Passage, the crossing of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic to <!--del_lnk--> the Americas, endured by slaves laid out in rows in the holds of ships, was only one element of the well-known triangular trade engaged in by Portuguese, Dutch, French and British. Ships having landed slaves in Caribbean ports would take on sugar, indigo, raw cotton, and later coffee, and make for Liverpool, Nantes, Lisbon or Amsterdam. Ships leaving European ports for West Africa would carry printed cotton textiles, some originally from India, copper utensils and bangles, pewter plates and pots, iron bars more valued than gold, hats, trinkets, gunpowder and firearms and alcohol. Tropical shipworms were eliminated in the cold Atlantic waters, and at each unloading, a profit was made.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> peaked in the late 18th century, when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by coastal African kingdoms through more formal trade agreements with European traders or by slave raiding parties through more informal bounty agreements with European traders( To see <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Blanco). The people captured on these expeditions were shipped by European traders to the <!--del_lnk--> colonies of the <!--del_lnk--> New World. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> War of Spanish Succession, the United Kingdom obtained the monopoly (<i><!--del_lnk--> asiento de negros</i>) of transporting captive Africans to <!--del_lnk--> Spanish America. It is estimated that over the centuries, twelve to twenty million people were shipped as slaves from Africa by European traders, of whom some 15 percent died during the terrible voyage, many during the arduous journey through the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Passage. The great majority were shipped to the <!--del_lnk--> Americas, but also went to Europe and the south of Africa.<p>Some historians conclude that the total loss in persons removed, those who died on the arduous march to coastal slave marts and those killed in slave raids, far exceeded the 65&ndash;75 million inhabitants remaining in Sub-Saharan Africa at the trade&#39;s end. Others believe that slavers had a vested interest in capturing rather than killing, and in keeping their captives alive; and that this coupled with the disproportionate removal of males and the introduction of new crops from the Americas (<!--del_lnk--> cassava, <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>) would have limited general population decline to particular regions of western Africa around 1760&ndash;1810, and in <a href="../../wp/m/Mozambique.htm" title="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and neighbouring areas half a century later. There has also been speculation that within Africa, females were most often captured as brides, with their male protectors being a &quot;bycatch&quot; who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for them.<p><a id="Modern_Africa" name="Modern_Africa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Africa</span></h3>
      <p>Slavery persists in Africa more than in all other continents. Slavery in <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritania.htm" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> was legally abolished by laws passed in 1905, 1961, and 1981, but several <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> organizations are reporting that the practice continues there.

In parts of <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, a family may be punished for an offense by having to turn over a virgin female to serve as a sex slave within the offended family. In this instance, the woman does not gain the title of &quot;wife&quot;. In parts of Ghana, Togo, and Benin, shrine slavery persists, despite being illegal in Ghana since 1998. In this system of slavery, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> trokosi (in Ghana) or <!--del_lnk--> voodoosi in Togo and Benin, or ritual servitude, young virgin girls are given as slaves in traditional shrines and are used sexually by the priests in addition to providing free labor for the shrine. In the Sudan, slavery continues as part of an ongoing <!--del_lnk--> civil war; see also the <!--del_lnk--> Slavery in Sudan article.

      <p>During the colonial epoch, slavery was a mainstay of the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian economy, especially in <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sugar cane production.<p>Brazil obtained 37% of all African slaves traded, and more than 3 million slaves were sent to this one country. Starting around 1550, the Portuguese began to trade African slaves to work the sugar plantations once the native <!--del_lnk--> Tupi people deteriorated. Although Portuguese Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Marqu&ecirc;s do Pombal abolished slavery in mainland Portugal on the February 12th, 1761, slavery continued in her overseas colonies. The African slaves were useful for the sugar plantations in many ways. First, African slaves were less vulnerable to tropical diseases and to tropical conditions. Second, the benefits of the slaves far exceeded the costs. After 2-3 years, slaves worked off their worth, and plantation owners began to make profits from them. Plantation owners made lucrative profits even though there was approximately a 10% death rate per year, mainly due to harsh working conditions.<p>The very harsh manual labour of the sugar cane fields saw slaves use hoes to dig large trenches. The slaves planted sugar cane in the trenches and then used their bare hands to spread manure. The average life span of a slave was eight years. Escaped slaves formed <!--del_lnk--> Maroon communities which played an important role in the histories of <!--del_lnk--> Brazil and other countries such as <!--del_lnk--> Suriname, <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_Puerto_Rico.htm" title="History of Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cuba, and <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica. In Brazil the Maroon villages were called <!--del_lnk--> palenques or <!--del_lnk--> quilombos. Maroons survived by growing vegetables and hunting. They also raided <!--del_lnk--> plantations. At these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their communities.<p>In the mid to late 19th century, many <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians were enslaved to work on rubber plantations. See <!--del_lnk--> I?? for more information.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Clapham Sect, a group of <!--del_lnk--> evangelical reformers, campaigned during much of the 19th century for the United Kingdom to use its influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16 pounds (7 kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades.<p>First, foreign slave trade was banned in 1850. Then, in 1871, the sons of the slaves were freed. In 1885, the slaves aged over 60 years were freed. The <!--del_lnk--> Paraguayan War contributed to end slavery, since slaves enlisted in exchange for freedom.(In Colonial Brazil, slavery was more a social than a racial condition. In fact, some of the greatest figures of the time, like the writer <!--del_lnk--> Machado de Assis and the engineer <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute; Rebou&ccedil;as had black ancestry).<p>Brazil&#39;s 1877-78 <!--del_lnk--> Grande Seca (Great Drought) in the cotton-growing northeast, led to major turmoil, starvation, poverty and internal migration. As wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves south, popular resistance and resentment grew, inspiring numerous emancipation societies. They succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of Ceara by 1884. (Mike Davis, <i>Late Victorian Holocausts</i>, 88-90) Slavery was legally ended nationwide on <!--del_lnk--> May 13 by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Lei Aurea</i> (&quot;Golden Law&quot;) of <!--del_lnk--> 1888. In fact, it was an institution in decadence at these times (Since the 1880&#39;s the country began to use European imigrant labor instead) . Brazil was the last nation in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery.<p>However, in 2004 the government acknowledged to the United Nations that at least 25,000 Brazilians work under conditions &quot;analogous to slavery.&quot; The top anti-slavery official in Brasilia, the capital, puts the number of modern slaves at 50,000. <p><a id="Slavery_in_the_British_and_French_Caribbean" name="Slavery_in_the_British_and_French_Caribbean"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Slavery in the British and French Caribbean</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> Lesser Antilles islands of <!--del_lnk--> Barbados, <!--del_lnk--> St. Kitts, <!--del_lnk--> Antigua, <!--del_lnk--> Martinique and <!--del_lnk--> Guadeloupe, which were the first important slave societies of the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, began the widespread use of African slaves by the end of the 17th century, as their economies converted from <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> to <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> production.<p>The slaves were treated terribly, often beaten and raped. They had such miserable lives that death was considered a welcome release.<p>By the middle of the 18th century, British <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica and French <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Domingue had become the largest slave societies of the region, rivaling Brazil as a destination for enslaved Africans. Due to overwork, the death rates for Caribbean slaves were greater than birth rates. The conditions led to increasing numbers of <!--del_lnk--> slave revolts, escaped slaves forming <!--del_lnk--> Maroon communities and fighting <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla wars against the <!--del_lnk--> plantation owners, campaigns against slavery in Europe, and the <!--del_lnk--> abolition of slavery in the European empires.<p><a id="Slavery_in_North_America" name="Slavery_in_North_America"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Slavery in North America</span></h3>

      <p>The first imported Africans were brought as indentured servants, not slaves. They were required, as white indentured servants were, to serve seven years. Many were brought to the <!--del_lnk--> British North American colonies, specifically <!--del_lnk--> Jamestown, Virginia in 1620. However, the slave trade did not immediately expand in North America. Mexico and Canada had completely abolished slavery by 1810.<p>Slavery under European rule began with importation of European <!--del_lnk--> indentured labourers, was followed by the enslavement of <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples in the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, and eventually was primarily replaced with Africans imported through a large slave trade, the cost being around 105 American dollars.<p>The shift from <!--del_lnk--> indentured servants to African slaves was prompted by a dwindling class of former servants who had worked through the terms of their indentures and thus became competitors to their former masters. These newly freed servants were rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was increasingly dominated by large planters. This caused domestic unrest culminating in <!--del_lnk--> Bacon&#39;s Rebellion. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm in regions dominated by plantations.<p>Many slaves were owned by plantation owners who lived in Britain. The British courts had made a series of contradictory rulings on the legality of slavery which encouraged several thousand slaves to flee the newly-independent United States as refugees along with the retreating British in <!--del_lnk--> 1783. The British courts having ruled in 1772 that such slaves could not be forcibly returned to North America (see <!--del_lnk--> James Somersett and <!--del_lnk--> Somersett&#39;s Case for a review of the Somerset Decision), the British Government resettled them as free men in <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

In the East, though, slavery was not abolished until later. The importation of slaves into the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> was banned on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1808; but not the internal slave trade, or involvement in the international slave trade externally.<p>Aggregation of northern free states gave rise to one contiguous geographic area, north of the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River and the old <!--del_lnk--> Mason-Dixon line. This separation of a free North and an enslaved South launched a massive political, cultural and economic struggle.<p>Refugees from slavery fled the South across the Ohio River to the North via the <!--del_lnk--> Underground Railroad, and their presence agitated Northerners. Midwestern state governments asserted <!--del_lnk--> States Rights arguments to refuse Federal jurisdiction over fugitives. Some juries exercised their right of <!--del_lnk--> jury nullification and refused to convict those indicted under the <!--del_lnk--> Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Dred Scott decision of 1857 asserted that one could take one&#39;s property anywhere (Even if one&#39;s property was <!--del_lnk--> chattel and one crossed into a free territory). It also asserted that African Americans could not be citizens, as many Northern states granted blacks citizenship, who (in some states) could even vote. This was an example of <!--del_lnk--> Slave Power, the plantation aristocracy&#39;s attempt to control the North. This turned Northern public opinion even further against slavery. After the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas-Nebraska Act, armed conflict broke out in <!--del_lnk--> Kansas Territory, where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state had been left to the inhabitants. The radical abolitionist <!--del_lnk--> John Brown was active in the mayhem and killing in &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bleeding Kansas.&quot; Anti-slavery legislators took office under the banner of the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> election of 1860, the Republicans swept <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> into the Presidency (with only 39.8% of the popular vote) and legislators into Congress. Lincoln however, did not appear on the ballots in most southern states and his election split the nation along sectional lines. After decades of controlling the Federal Government, the Southern states <!--del_lnk--> seceded from the U.S. (the Union) to form the <!--del_lnk--> Confederate States of America.<p>Northern leaders like Lincoln viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, with control over the Mississippi River and the West, as unacceptable. This led to the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>.<p>The Civil War spelled the end for chattel slavery in America. However, in August of 1962 Lincoln replied to editor Horace Greeley stating his objective was to save the Union and not to either save or destroy slavery. He went on to say that if he could save the Union without freeing a single slave, he would do it. Lincoln&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Emancipation Proclamation of <!--del_lnk--> 1863 was a reluctant gesture, that proclaimed freedom for slaves within the Confederacy, although not those in strategically important <!--del_lnk--> Border states or the rest of the Union. However, the proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal and it was implemented as the Union captured territory from the Confederacy. Slaves in many parts of the south were freed by Union armies or when they simply left their former owners. Many joined the <!--del_lnk--> Union Army as workers or troops, and many more fled to Northern cities.<p>Legally, slaves within the United States remained enslaved until the final ratification of the <!--del_lnk--> Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution on <!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1865 (with final recognition of the amendment on <!--del_lnk--> December 18), eight months after the cessation of hostilities. Only in the Border state of Kentucky did a significant slave population remain by that time.<p>After the failure of <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction, freed slaves in the United States were treated as second class citizens. For decades after their emancipation, many former slaves living in the South <!--del_lnk--> sharecropped and had a low standard of living. In some states, it was only after the <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> movement of the 1950s and 60s that blacks obtained legal protection from racial discrimination (<i>see <!--del_lnk--> segregation</i>).<p>Although slavery has been illegal in the United States for nearly a century and a half, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Department of Labor occasionally prosecutes cases against people for false imprisonment and involuntary servitude. These cases often involve illegal immigrants who are forced to work as slaves in factories to pay off a debt claimed by the people who transported them into the United States.

Though strict laws have been introduced recently in <a href="../../wp/q/Qatar.htm" title="Qatar">Qatar</a> and <!--del_lnk--> UAE - thanks to better awareness of the issue and lobbying by human rights organisations such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ansar Burney Trust - the use of children still continues in the far flung areas and during secret night time races.<p><a id="Abolitionist_movements" name="Abolitionist_movements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Abolitionist movements</span></h2>

      <p>Slavery has existed, in one form or another, through the whole of human history. So, too, have movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves. <!--del_lnk--> Moses led Israelite slaves from <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> according to the <!--del_lnk--> Biblical <!--del_lnk--> Book of Exodus - possibly the first detailed account of a movement to free slaves. However, <!--del_lnk--> abolitionism should be distinguished from efforts to help a particular group of slaves, or to restrict one practice, such as the slave trade.<p>In 1772, a legal case concerning <!--del_lnk--> James Somersett made it illegal to remove a slave from England against his will. A similar case, that of <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Knight, took place in Scotland five years later and ruled slavery to be contrary to the law of Scotland.<p>Following the work of campaigners in the United Kingdom, the <!--del_lnk--> Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was passed by <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1807. The act imposed a fine of &pound;100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to outlaw entirely the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">slave trade</a> within the whole British Empire.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Slavery Abolition Act, passed on <!--del_lnk--> August 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1833, outlawed slavery itself in the British colonies. On <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1834 all slaves in the British Empire were emancipated, but still indentured to their former owners in an apprenticeship system which was finally abolished in <!--del_lnk--> 1838.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>There were slaves in mainland <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, but the institution was never fully authorized there. However, slavery was vitally important in France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean possessions, especially <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Domingue. In 1793, unable to repress the massive slave revolt of August 1791 that had become the <!--del_lnk--> Haitian Revolution, the French Revolutionary commissioners <!--del_lnk--> Sonthonax and <!--del_lnk--> Polverel declared general emancipation. In Paris, on <!--del_lnk--> February 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1794, <!--del_lnk--> Abb&eacute; Gr&eacute;goire and the <!--del_lnk--> Convention ratified this action by officially abolishing slavery in all French territories. <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> sent troops to the Caribbean in 1802 to try to re-establish slavery. They succeeded in <a href="../../wp/g/Guadeloupe.htm" title="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, but the ex-slaves of Saint-Domingue defeated the French army and declared independence. The colony became Haiti, the first black republic, on January 1, 1804.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> was established as a country for former slaves of the British Empire in Africa. <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> served an analogous purpose for <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> slaves. The goal of the abolitionists was repatriation of the slaves to Africa. Also some <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> did not want the cheap labour of former slaves around. Nevertheless, most former slaves stayed in America.<p>Slaves in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> who escaped ownership would often make their way north to <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> via the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Underground Railroad&quot;. Famously active <!--del_lnk--> abolitionists of the U.S. include <!--del_lnk--> Harriet Tubman, <!--del_lnk--> Nat Turner, <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_Douglass.htm" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> and <!--del_lnk--> John Brown. Slavery was <!--del_lnk--> abolished in the United States in 1865.<p>The 1926 Slavery Convention, an initiative of the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, was a turning point in banning global slavery. Article 4 of the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the UN General Assembly, explicitly banned slavery. The <!--del_lnk--> United Nations 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery was convened to outlaw and ban slavery worldwide, including child slavery. In December 1966, the UN General Assembly adopted the <!--del_lnk--> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was developed from the Universal Declaraction of Human Rights. Article 8 of this international treaty bans slavery. The treaty came into force in March 1976 after it had been ratified by 35 nations. As of November 2003, 104 nations had ratified the treaty.<p>Slavery is defined as a <!--del_lnk--> crime against humanity by a <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> law of 2001.<p>
