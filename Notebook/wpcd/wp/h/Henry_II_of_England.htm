      <p><b>Henry II of England</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 5 March <!--del_lnk--> 1133 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 6 July <!--del_lnk--> 1189) ruled as <!--del_lnk--> Count of Anjou, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy, and as <!--del_lnk--> King of England (<!--del_lnk--> 1154&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1189) and, at various times, controlled parts of <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, eastern <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and western <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>.

He ranks as the first of the Plantagenet or <!--del_lnk--> Angevin Kings.<p>Following the disputed reign of <a href="../../wp/s/Stephen_of_England.htm" title="Stephen of England">King Stephen</a>, Henry&#39;s reign saw efficient consolidation.

      <p>Prior to coming to the throne he already controlled <!--del_lnk--> Normandy and <!--del_lnk--> Anjou on <!--del_lnk--> the continent; his marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor of Aquitaine on <!--del_lnk--> 18 May <!--del_lnk--> 1152 added her holdings to his, including <!--del_lnk--> Touraine, <!--del_lnk--> Aquitaine, and <!--del_lnk--> Gascony. He thus effectively became more powerful than the king of <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> &mdash; with an empire (<i>the <!--del_lnk--> Angevin Empire</i>) that stretched from the <!--del_lnk--> Solway Firth almost to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> and from the <!--del_lnk--> Somme to the <!--del_lnk--> Pyrenees. As king, he would make <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> a part of his vast domain. He also maintained lively communication with the Emperor of Byzantium <!--del_lnk--> Manuel I Comnenus.<p><a id="Life_before_accession" name="Life_before_accession"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Life before accession</span></h3>
      <p>He was born on <!--del_lnk--> 5 March <!--del_lnk--> 1133 at <!--del_lnk--> Le Mans to the <!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda and her second husband, <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey the Fair, Count of Anjou. Brought up in <!--del_lnk--> Anjou, he visited England in <!--del_lnk--> 1149 to help his mother in her disputed claim to the English throne.<p>He married <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor of Aquitaine on <!--del_lnk--> 18 May <!--del_lnk--> 1152, but from May to August he was occupied in fighting Eleanor&#39;s ex-husband <!--del_lnk--> Louis VII of France and his allies. In August Henry rushed back to her, and they spent several months together. Around the end of November 1152 they parted: Henry went to spend some weeks with his mother and then sailed for England, arriving on <!--del_lnk--> 6 January <!--del_lnk--> 1153. Some historians believe that the couple&#39;s first child, <!--del_lnk--> William, Count of Poitiers, was born in 1153. Henry&#39;s succession was established by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Wallingford in 1153, after he had challenged Stephen&#39;s forces at <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford Castle. It was agreed that Henry would become king on Stephen&#39;s death.<p><a id="Civil_and_legal_reform:_struggle_with_the_barons" name="Civil_and_legal_reform:_struggle_with_the_barons"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civil and legal reform: struggle with the barons</span></h3>
      <p>During <!--del_lnk--> Stephen&#39;s reign the <!--del_lnk--> barons had subverted the state of affairs to undermine the monarch&#39;s grip on the realm; Henry II saw it as his first task to reverse this shift in power. For example, Henry had <!--del_lnk--> castles torn down which the barons had built without authorization during Stephen&#39;s reign, and by 1159, <!--del_lnk--> scutage, a fee paid by <!--del_lnk--> vassals in lieu of military service, had become a central feature of the king&#39;s military system. Record keeping improved dramatically in order to streamline this taxation.<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #8888AA; border-collapse: collapse; float: right; font-size: 95%; margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px; padding: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 240px;">

      <p>Henry II established courts in various parts of England and first instituted the royal practice of granting magistrates the power to render legal decisions on a wide range of civil matters in the name of the Crown. His reign saw the production of the first written legal textbook, providing the basis of today&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Common Law&quot;.<p>By the <!--del_lnk--> Assize of Clarendon (<!--del_lnk--> 1166), <!--del_lnk--> trial by jury became the norm. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest, jury trials had been largely replaced by <!--del_lnk--> trial by ordeal and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> wager of battel&quot; (which English law did not abolish until <!--del_lnk--> 1819). Provision of justice and landed security was further toughened in 1176 with the <!--del_lnk--> Assize of Northampton, built on the earlier agreements at Clarendon. This reform proved one of Henry&#39;s major contributions to the social history of England.<p><a id="Dealings_with_Ireland" name="Dealings_with_Ireland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dealings with Ireland</span></h3>
      <p>Shortly after his coronation, Henry sent an embassy to the newly elected <!--del_lnk--> Pope Adrian IV. Led by Bishop Arnold of Lisieux, the group of clerics requested from Adrian a privilege authorising Henry to invade <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Most historians agree that this was the papal bull <i><!--del_lnk--> Laudabiliter</i>. W.L. Warren asserts that Henry acted under the influence of a &quot;Canterbury plot;&quot; Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Theobald of Bec, <!--del_lnk--> John of Salisbury, and other Canterbury clergy wished to assert their hierarchical supremacy over the newly created Irish diocesan structure. Other historians have argued instead that Henry intended to secure Ireland as a lordship for his younger brother William.<p>Shortly thereafter, Henry&#39;s continental affairs distracted him. William died, and the English ignored Ireland. It was not until 1166 that it came to the surface again. In that year, <!--del_lnk--> Dermot MacMurrough, having been driven from his kingdom in <!--del_lnk--> Leinster, followed Henry to <!--del_lnk--> Aquitaine. He asked the English king to help him reassert control; Henry agreed to allow Dermot to gather supporters from among his Norman vassals. The most prominent of these was a Welsh Norman, <!--del_lnk--> Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, nicknamed &quot;Strongbow.&quot; In exchange for his loyalty, Dermot offered Earl Richard his daughter Aoife (Eve) in marriage and made him heir to the kingdom.<p>The Normans quickly restored Dermot to his traditional holdings, and he even toyed with the idea of challenging for the title of <!--del_lnk--> Ard Ri, or High King. However, in <!--del_lnk--> 1171, Henry arrived from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> to assert his overlordship. All of the Normans, along with many Irish princes, took oaths of homage to Henry, and he left after six months. He never returned, but he later named his young son, the future King <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">John of England</a>, Lord of Ireland.<p><a id="The_struggle_with_the_church_and_Thomas_Becket" name="The_struggle_with_the_church_and_Thomas_Becket"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The struggle with the church and Thomas Becket</span></h3>
      <p>As a consequence of the improvements in the legal system, the power of <!--del_lnk--> church courts waned. The church naturally opposed this and found its most vehement spokesman in <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Becket.htm" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, formerly a close friend of Henry&#39;s and his <!--del_lnk--> Chancellor.<p>The conflict with Becket effectively began with a dispute over whether the secular courts could try clergy who had committed a secular offence. Henry attempted to subdue Becket and his fellow churchmen by making them swear to obey the &quot;customs of the realm&quot;, but controversy ensued over what constituted these customs, and the church proved reluctant to submit. Following a heated exchange at Henry&#39;s court, Becket left England in 1164 for France to solicit in person the support of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Alexander III, who was in exile in France due to dissension in the college of Cardinals, and of King <!--del_lnk--> Louis VII of France. Due to his own precarious position, Alexander remained neutral in the debate, although Becket remained in exile loosely under the protection of Louis and Pope Alexander until 1170. After reconciliation between Henry and Thomas in Normandy in 1170, Becket returned to England. Becket again confronted Henry, this time over the coronation of Prince Henry (see below). The much-quoted, although probably apocryphal, words of Henry II echo down the centuries: &quot;Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?&quot; Although Henry&#39;s violent rants against Becket over the years were well documented, this time four of his knights took their king literally (as he may have intended for them to do, although he later denied it) and travelled immediately to England, where they assassinated Becket in <a href="../../wp/c/Canterbury_Cathedral.htm" title="Canterbury Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 29 December <!--del_lnk--> 1170.<p>For this act Henry was excommunicated but obtained his rehabilitation thanks to the efforts of Robert de Torigny, abbot of <!--del_lnk--> Mont St Michel. As part of his penance for the death of Becket, Henry made <!--del_lnk--> a pilgrimage in sackcloth to his tomb (see also <!--del_lnk--> St. Dunstan&#39;s, Canterbury), and agreed to send money to the <!--del_lnk--> Crusader states in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine, which the <!--del_lnk--> Knights Hospitaller and the <!--del_lnk--> Knights Templar would guard until Henry arrived to make use of it on pilgrimage or <!--del_lnk--> crusade. Afterwards, on the <!--del_lnk--> 21 May <!--del_lnk--> 1172, he was flogged in public, naked, before the door of the cathedral at <!--del_lnk--> Avranches, which was his capital city in <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. Henry delayed his crusade for many years and in the end never went at all, despite a visit to him by <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem in 1184 and being offered the crown of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1188 he levied the <!--del_lnk--> Saladin tithe to pay for a new crusade; the cleric and courtier <!--del_lnk--> Gerald of Wales suggested his death was a divine punishment for the tithe, imposed to raise money for an abortive crusade to recapture <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, which had fallen to <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a> in 1187.<p><a id="Issue" name="Issue"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Issue</span></h2>

      <p>Henry&#39;s first son, William, Count of Poitiers, had died in infancy.

      <p>Henry and his wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine, had five sons and three daughters: <!--del_lnk--> William, <!--del_lnk--> Henry, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey, <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">John</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Matilda, <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor, and <!--del_lnk--> Joan.

      <p>Henry&#39;s notorious liaison with <!--del_lnk--> Rosamund Clifford, the &quot;fair Rosamund&quot; of legend, probably began in <!--del_lnk--> 1165 during one of his Welsh campaigns and continued until her death in <!--del_lnk--> 1176. However, it was not until <!--del_lnk--> 1174, at around the time of his break with Eleanor, that Henry acknowledged Rosamund as his mistress. Almost simultaneously he began negotiating the annulment of his marriage in order to marry <!--del_lnk--> Alys, daughter of King <!--del_lnk--> Louis VII of France and already betrothed to Henry&#39;s son Richard. Henry&#39;s affair with Alys continued for some years, and, unlike Rosamund Clifford, Alys allegedly gave birth to one of Henry&#39;s illegitimate children.<p>Henry also had a number of illegitimate children by various women, and Eleanor had several of those children reared in the royal nursery with her own children; some remained members of the household in adulthood. Among them were <!--del_lnk--> William de Longespee, 3rd Earl of Salisbury, whose mother was Ida, Countess of Norfolk; <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, son of a woman named Ykenai; <!--del_lnk--> Morgan, Bishop of Durham; and Matilda, <!--del_lnk--> Abbess of Barking.<p><a id="Succession_crisis" name="Succession_crisis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Succession crisis</span></h3>
      <p>Henry II&#39;s attempt to divide his titles amongst his sons but keep the power associated with them provoked them into trying to take control of the lands assigned to them (see <!--del_lnk--> Revolt of 1173-1174), which amounted to treason, at least in Henry&#39;s eyes. <!--del_lnk--> Gerald of Wales reports that when King Henry gave the kiss of peace to his son Richard, he said softly, &quot;May the Lord never permit me to die until I have taken due vengeance upon you.&quot;<p>When Henry&#39;s legitimate sons rebelled against him, they often had the help of King <!--del_lnk--> Louis VII of France. <!--del_lnk--> Henry the Young King died in <!--del_lnk--> 1183. After Henry the Young King died, there was a power struggle between the three sons that were left. Henry had wanted John to be the next king, but Eleanor favoured Richard. Henry had always loved John more than any of the other sons. Geoffrey tried to overcome both John and Richard, but he was unsuccessful. A horse trampled to death another son, <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany (1158&ndash;1186). Henry&#39;s third son, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard the Lionheart</a> (1157&ndash;1199), with the assistance of <!--del_lnk--> Philip II Augustus of France, attacked and defeated Henry on <!--del_lnk--> July 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1189; Henry died at the <!--del_lnk--> Chateau Chinon on <!--del_lnk--> July 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1189, and lies entombed in <!--del_lnk--> Fontevraud Abbey, near <!--del_lnk--> Chinon and <!--del_lnk--> Saumur in the Anjou Region of present-day France. Henry&#39;s illegitimate son <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey, Archbishop of York also stood by him the whole time and alone among his sons attended on Henry&#39;s deathbed. His last words, according to <!--del_lnk--> Gerald of Wales, were &ldquo;Shame, shame on a conquered king&rdquo;. Another version of the King&#39;s last words alludes to the fact that the only son to attend his deathbed was his illegitimate son: &quot;My other sons are the real bastards&quot;.<a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard the Lionheart</a> then became King of England. This was unfortunate to Henry because he had always wanted <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">John</a>, his youngest son, to succeed him. John succeeded to the throne upon Richard&#39;s death in <!--del_lnk--> 1199, laying aside the claims of <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey&#39;s children <!--del_lnk--> Arthur of Brittany and <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor.<p><a id="Appearance" name="Appearance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Appearance</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Peter of Blois left a description of Henry II in 1177: &quot;<i>...the lord king has been red-haired so far, except that the coming of old age and grey hair has altered that colour somewhat. His height is medium, so that neither does he appear great among the small, nor yet does he seem small among the great... curved legs, a horseman&#39;s shins, broad chest, and a boxer&#39;s arms all announce him as a man strong, agile and bold... he never sits, unless riding a horse or eating... In a single day, if necessary, he can run through four or five day-marches and, thus foiling the plots of his enemies, frequently mocks their plots with surprise sudden arrivals...Always are in his hands bow, sword, spear and arrow, unless he be in council or in books</i>.&quot;<p>Another contemporary, Gerald of Wales, described him thus: &quot;<i>A man of reddish, freckled complexion, with a large, round head, grey eyes that glowed fiercely and grew bloodshot in anger, a fiery countenance and a harsh, cracked voice. His neck was poked forward slightly from his shoulders, his chest was broad and square, his arms strong and powerful. His body was stocky, with a pronounced tendency toward fatness, due to nature rather than self-indulgence -- which he tempered with exercise</i>.&quot;<p><a id="In_the_arts" name="In_the_arts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In the arts</span></h2>
