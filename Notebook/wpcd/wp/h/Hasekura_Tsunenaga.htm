He led an <!--del_lnk--> embassy to <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and then <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> between 1613 and 1620 (called the <!--del_lnk--> Keich&#x14D; Embassy, Japanese: &#x6176;&#x9577;&#x4F7F;&#x7BC0;), after which he returned to <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>.

Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with little results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.<p>

      <p>Little is known of the early life of Hasekura Tsunenaga. He was a mid-level noble samurai in the fief of <!--del_lnk--> &#x14C;sh&#x16B; in northern Japan, who had the opportunity to directly serve the <!--del_lnk--> daimyo <!--del_lnk--> Date Masamune. They both had roughly the same age, and it is recorded that several important missions were given to him by Date as his representative.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>It is also recorded that Hasekura served as <!--del_lnk--> samurai of the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese invasion of Korea under the <!--del_lnk--> Taiko <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi Hideyoshi, during 6 months, in 1597.<p>In 1612, Hasekura&#39;s father, Hasekura Tsunenari (&#x652F;&#x5009;&#x5E38;&#x6210;), was indicted for corruption, and put to death in 1613. His fief was confiscated, and his son should normally have been executed as well. Date however gave him the opportunity to redeem his honour by taking charge of the Embassy to Europe, and soon gave him back his territories as well.<p><a id="Background:_early_contacts_between_Japan_and_Spain" name="Background:_early_contacts_between_Japan_and_Spain"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Background: early contacts between Japan and Spain</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> started <!--del_lnk--> trans-Pacific voyages between Mexico (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> New Spain&quot;) and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, through their territorial base in the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, following the travels of <!--del_lnk--> Andr&eacute;s de Urdaneta in the 16th century. <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a> became their base for the Asian region in 1571.<p>Spanish ships were periodically shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by stiff resistance from the <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits, who had started the <!--del_lnk--> evangelizing of the country in 1549, as well as the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> who did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese <!--del_lnk--> trade. However. some Japanese, such as <!--del_lnk--> Christopher and Cosmas, are known to have crossed the Pacific onboard Spanish <!--del_lnk--> galleons as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing &quot;The black elephant in particular I found most unusual.&quot;<p>In 1609, the Spanish <!--del_lnk--> Manila galleon <i>San Francisco</i> encountered bad weather on its way from <a href="../../wp/m/Manila.htm" title="Manila">Manila</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in <!--del_lnk--> Chiba, near <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship&#39;s captain, <!--del_lnk--> Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, met with the retired shogun <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on <!--del_lnk--> 29 November <!--del_lnk--> 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a <!--del_lnk--> factory in eastern Japan, <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a> specialists would be imported from <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, Spanish ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.<p><a id="First_Japanese_expeditions_to_the_Americas" name="First_Japanese_expeditions_to_the_Americas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">First Japanese expeditions to the Americas</span></h3>

      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan monk named <!--del_lnk--> Luis Sotelo, who was <!--del_lnk--> proselytizing in the area of Tokyo, convinced <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Hidetada to send him as a representative to <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (Mexico) on one of their ships, in order to advance the trade treaty. Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso Mu&ntilde;os, be sent instead as the Shogun&#39;s representative. In 1610, the returning Rodrigo de Vivero, several Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by the trader <!--del_lnk--> Tanaka Shosuke, sailed to Mexico aboard the <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Buena Ventura</i>, a ship built by the English adventurer <!--del_lnk--> William Adams for the Shogun. Once in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, Alonso Mu&ntilde;os met with the Viceroy <!--del_lnk--> Luis de Velasco, who agreed to send an <!--del_lnk--> ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer <!--del_lnk--> Sebastian Vizcaino, with the added mission of exploring the &quot;Gold and silver islands&quot; (&quot;Isla de Plata&quot;) that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles.<p>Vizcaino arrived in Japan in 1611, and had many meetings with the Shogun and feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards <!--del_lnk--> Catholic proselytism, and the intrigues of the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> against Spanish ambitions. Vizcaino finally left to search for the &quot;Silver island&quot;, during which search he encountered bad weather, forcing him to return to Japan with heavy damage.<p><a name="1612_San_Sebastian"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">1612 <i>San Sebastian</i></span></h4>
      <p>Without waiting for Vizcaino, another ship, built in <!--del_lnk--> Izu by the Bakufu under the minister of the Navy <!--del_lnk--> Mukai Shogen, and named <i>San Sebastian</i> left for Mexico on September 9 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two representatives of Date Masamune, with the objective of advancing the trade agreement with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. However, the ship foundered a few miles from <!--del_lnk--> Uraga, and the expedition had to be abandoned.<p><a id="The_1613_embassy_project" name="The_1613_embassy_project"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The 1613 embassy project</span></h2>

      <p>The Shogun decided to build a new galleon in Japan in order to bring Vizcaino back to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> Luis Sotelo. The galleon, named <i>Date Maru</i> by the Japanese and later <!--del_lnk--> <i>San Juan Bautista</i> by the Spanish, took 45 days work in building, with the participation of technical experts from the <!--del_lnk--> Bakufu (the Minister of the Navy <!--del_lnk--> Mukai Shogen, an acquaintance of <!--del_lnk--> William Adams with whom he built several ships, dispatched his Chief Carpenter), 800 <!--del_lnk--> shipwrights, 700 <!--del_lnk--> smiths, and 3,000 <!--del_lnk--> carpenters. The daimyo of <!--del_lnk--> Sendai, <!--del_lnk--> Date Masamune, was put in charge of the project. He named one of his retainers, Hasekura Tsunenaga (his fief was rated at around 600 <!--del_lnk--> koku), to lead the mission:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;The Great Ship left <!--del_lnk--> Toshima-Tsukinoura for the Southern Barbarians on September 15th [Japanese calendar], with at its head Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and those called Imaizumi Sakan, Matsuki Shusaku, Nishi Kyusuke, Tanaka Taroemon, Naito Hanjuro, Sonohoka Kyuemon, Kuranojo, Tonomo, Kitsunai, Kyuji, as well as several others under Rokuemon, as well as 40 <!--del_lnk--> Southern Barbarians, 10 men of <!--del_lnk--> Mukai Shogen, and also tradespeople, to a total 180&quot; (Records of the Date House, Keicho-Genna &#x4F0A;&#x9054;&#x5BB6;&#x6176;&#x9577;&#x5143;&#x548C;&#x7559;&#x63A7;, Gonoi p. 56).</dl>
      <p>The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, and to meet with the Pope in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: he invited Luis Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: &quot;I&#39;ll offer my land for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many padres as possible.&quot;<p>Sotelo, in his own account of the travels, emphasizes the religious dimension of the mission, claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian faith in northern Japan:<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The embassy was probably, at that time, part of a plan to diversify and increase trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the <!--del_lnk--> Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the Shogunate, with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in 1614.<p><a id="Trans-Pacific_voyage" name="Trans-Pacific_voyage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trans-Pacific voyage</span></h2>
      <p>Upon completion, the ship left on <!--del_lnk--> 28 October <!--del_lnk--> 1613 for <!--del_lnk--> Acapulco in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> with around 180 people on board, including 10 samurai of the Shogun (provided by the Minister of the Navy <!--del_lnk--> Mukai Shogen Tadakatsu), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese, including Sebastian Vizcaino who, in his own words, only had the quality of a passenger.<p><a id="New_Spain_.28Mexico.29" name="New_Spain_.28Mexico.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">New Spain (Mexico)</span></h3>

       <dd>&quot;This is the second time that the Japanese have landed one of their ships on the shore at Acapulco. They are transporting here all things of iron, and writing desks, and some cloth that they are to sell here.&quot; (Chimalpahin, &quot;Annals of His Time&quot;).<dd>&quot;It became known here in Mexico and was said that the reason their ruler the Emperor of Japan sent this said lordly emissary and ambassador here, is to go in Rome to see the Holy father Paul V, and to give him their obedience concerning the holy church, so that all the Japanase want to become Christians&quot; (Chimalpahin, &quot;Annals of His Time&quot;).</dl>
      <p>Hasekura was setted in a house next to the Church of San Francisco, and met with the Viceroy. He explained to him that he was also planning to meet king don Felipe III to offer him peace and to obtain that the Japanese could come to Mexico for trade. On Wednesday 9th April, 20 Japanese were baptized, and 22 more on 20th April by the archbishop in Mexico, don <!--del_lnk--> Juan P&eacute;rez de la Serna, at the <!--del_lnk--> Church of San Francisco. Altogether 63 of them received confirmation on April 25th. Hasekura waited for his travel to Europe to be baptized there:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;But the lordly emissary, the ambassador, did not want to be baptized here; it was said that he will be baptized later in Spain&quot; (Chimalpahin, &quot;Annals of His Time&quot;).</dl>

Hasekura remitted to the Pope two gilded letters, one in Japanese and one in Latin, containing a request for a trade treaty between Japan and Mexico and the dispatch of Christian missionaries to Japan. These letters are still visible in the <a href="../../wp/v/Vatican_City.htm" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> archives. The Latin letter, probably written by Luis Sotelo for Date Masamune, reads:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Kissing the Holy feet of the Great, Universal, Most Holy Lord of The Entire World, Pope Paul, in profound submission and reverence, I, Idate Masamune, King of W&ocirc;sh&ucirc; in the Empire of Japan, suppliantly say:<dd>The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to our country to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven&#39;t accomplished this desire due to some small issues. However, in order to encourage my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that you will be able to build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Espa&ntilde;a are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas.&quot; Translation of the Latin letter of Date Masamune to the Pope.</dl>

       <dd>&quot;The Ambassador strongly insisted that the authority and power of his ruler was superior to that of many European countries&quot; (Anonymous Roman communication, dated October 10th, 1615)<dd>&quot;The Franciscan Spanish fathers are explaining that the King of the Ambassador [Hasekura Tsunenaga] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow the will of the church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high eclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, many people have been doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are wondering if they are not looking for some other benefit.&quot; (Letter of the Venetian ambassador, November 7th, 1615).</dl>

      <p>By the time Hasekura came back, Japan had changed quite drastically: an effort to eradicate Christianity had been under way since 1614, <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Ieyasu had died in 1616 and been replaced by his more <!--del_lnk--> xenophobic son <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Hidetada, and Japan was moving towards the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> sakoku&quot; policy of <!--del_lnk--> isolation. Because news of these persecutions arrived in Europe during Hasekura&#39;s embassy, European rulers, especially the King of Spain, became very reluctant to respond favorably to Hasekura&#39;s trade and missionary proposals.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Hasekura reported his travels to Date Masamune upon his arrival in Sendai. It is recorded that he remitted a portrait of the Pope Paul V, a portrait of himself in prayer (shown above), and a set of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Ceylonese</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesian</a> daggers acquired in the Philippines, all preserved today in the <!--del_lnk--> Sendai City Museum. The &quot;Records of the House of Masamune&quot; describe his report in a rather succinct manner, ending with a rather cryptic expression of surprise bordering on the outrage (&quot;&#x5947;&#x602A;&#x6700;&#x591A;&#x30B7;&quot;) at Hasekura&#39;s discourse:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Rokuemon went to the country of the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Barbarians, he paid his respects to the king <!--del_lnk--> Paolo, he stayed there for several years, and now he sailed back from <!--del_lnk--> Luzon. He brought paintings of the king of the Southern Barbarians, and a painting of himself, which he remitted. Many of his descriptions of the Southern Barbarian countries, and the meaning of Rokuemon&#39;s declarations were surprising and extraordinary.&quot;</dl>
      <p><a id="Interdiction_of_Christianity_in_Sendai" name="Interdiction_of_Christianity_in_Sendai"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Interdiction of Christianity in Sendai</span></h3>
      <p>The direct effect of Hasekura&#39;s return to Sendai was the interdiction of Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Two days after the return of Rokuemon to Sendai, a three-point edict against the Christian was promulgated: first, that all Christians were ordered to abandon their faith, in accordance with the rule of the Shogun, and for those who did not, they would be exiled if they were nobles, and killed if they were citizens, peasants or servants. Second, that a reward would be given for the denunciation of hidden Christians. Third that propagators of the Christian faith should leave the Sendai fief, or else, abandon their religion&quot; (November 1620 letter of father Angelis, Japan-China archives of the Jesuits in Rome, quoted in Gonoi&#39;s &quot;Hasekura Tsunenaga&quot;, p231)</dl>
      <p>What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to indicate that he and his descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic, and to a certain extent disturbing, account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertized by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country.<p>Date Masamune, heretofore very tolerant of Christianity, in spite of the Bakufu&#39;s prohibition in the land it directly controlled, thus suddenly chose to distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were however comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly claimed that he only took them to appease the <!--del_lnk--> Shogun:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Date Masumune, out of fear of the Shogun, ordered the persecution of Christianity in his territory, and created several martyrs.&quot; (Letter of 17 prominent Japanese Christians from Sendai, to the Pope, 29 September 1621).</dl>
      <p>One month after Hasekura&#39;s return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the Shogun <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Hidetada, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with the approval, and even the collaboration, of the Shogun:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian countries several years ago, upon the advice of <!--del_lnk--> Mukai Shogen, I also dispatched the Southern Barbarian named Sotelo, who had resided for several years in Edo. At that time, your highness also gave messages for the Southern Barbarians, as well as presents, such as <!--del_lnk--> folding screens and sets of <!--del_lnk--> armour.&quot; (October 18th, 1620, quoted in Gonoi, p234).</dl>
      <p>Spain was by far the most threatening power for Japan at that time (with a colony and an army in the nearby <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>). Hasekura eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (<a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>) may have precipitated the Shogun <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Hidetada&#39;s decision to sever trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h3>
      <p>What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could only rely on hearsay, some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was martyred for his faith, and others that he practiced Christianity in secret. The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being Christians, would suggest that Hasekura remained strongly Christian himself, and transmitted his faith to the members of his family.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally burnt of the stake in 1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a hero who propagated the Christian faith:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;My other colleague, the ambassador Philippus Faxecura, after he reached his aforementioned king (<!--del_lnk--> Date Masamune), was greatly honored by him, and sent to his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, and the protection of the <!--del_lnk--> religious in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of this man. This is what I heard by letters from the very religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others.&quot; (Luis Sotelo, <i>De ecclesiae Iaponicae statu relatio</i>).</dl>
      <p>Hasekura also did bring back to Japan several Catholic artifacts, but he did not give them to his ruler, and instead kept them in his own estate.<p>Hasekura Tsunenaga died of illness (according to Japanese as well as Christian sources) in 1622, but the location of his grave is not known for certain. Three graves are claimed as Hasekura&#39;s. One is visible in the <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist temple of Enfukuji (Japanese: &#x5186;&#x9577;&#x5C71;&#x5186;&#x798F;&#x5BFA;) in <!--del_lnk--> Miyagi.<p><a id="Execution_of_his_descendants_and_servants" name="Execution_of_his_descendants_and_servants"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Execution of his descendants and servants</span></h3>
      <p>Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son&#39;s servants, Yogoemon and his wife, were convicted of being Christian and executed in August 1637. In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by someone from <!--del_lnk--> Edo, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the Zen temple of Komyoji (&#x5149;&#x660E;&#x5BFA;). He finally was convicted and executed in 1640, at the age of 42, after two Christian priests, the <!--del_lnk--> Dominican Pedro Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, gave his name under torture. Two other servants, Taro Saemon (71), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife (59), were executed the same day. Since the life of Christians was spared if they recanted, these executions indicate that they were steadfast and refused to deny their faith. Tsuneyori&#39;s younger brother fled and disappeared.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The privileges of the Hasekura family were abolished at this point by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura&#39;s Christian artifacts were confiscated, and kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered at the end of the 19th century.<p>Altogether, around fifty Christian artifacts were found in Hasekura&#39;s estate in 1640, such as crosses, <!--del_lnk--> rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, but they have been lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the <!--del_lnk--> Sendai City Museum and other museum in Sendai.<p>

      <p>The very existence of the travels of Hasekura was forgotten in Japan, until the reopening of the country after the <!--del_lnk--> sakoku policy of isolation.
