      <p>The book is about three families in England at the beginning of the twentieth century. The three families represent different gradations of the Edwardian middle class: the Wilcoxes, who are rich capitalists with a fortune made in the Colonies; the half-German Schlegel siblings (Margaret, Tibby, and Helen), who represent the intellectual <!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie and have a lot in common with the real-life <!--del_lnk--> Bloomsbury Group; and the Basts, a couple who are struggling members of the lower-middle class. The Schlegel sisters try to help the poor Basts and try to make the Wilcoxes less prejudiced. The motto of the book is &quot;Only connect...&quot;<p>The Schlegels frequently encounter the Wilcoxes. The youngest, Helen, is rejected by the younger Wilcox brother, Paul. The eldest, Margaret, becomes friends with his mother Ruth Wilcox. Ruth&#39;s most prized personal possession is her family house at Howards End. She wishes that Margaret could live there, as she feels that it might be in good hands with her. Ruth&#39;s own husband and children do not value the house and its rich history, because such abstractions, while being very dear to Margaret, are lost to them. As she is terminally ill, and Margaret and her family are about to be evicted from their London home by a developer, Ruth bequeaths the cottage to Margaret in a handwritten note found among her effects when she dies, causing great consternation among the Wilcoxes. Mrs Wilcox&#39;s widowed husband Henry and his children burn the note without telling Margaret about her inheritance. However, over the course of several years, Margaret becomes friends with Henry Wilcox and eventually marries him. The more free-spirited Margaret tries to get Henry to open up more, to little effect. Henry&#39;s elder son Charles and his wife try to keep Margaret from taking possession of Howards End.<p>Gradually, Margaret becomes aware of Henry&#39;s dismissive attitude towards the lower classes. On Henry&#39;s advice, Helen tells Leonard Bast to quit his promising bank job, because his company stands outside a protective group of companies and thus is vulnerable to failure. A few weeks later, Henry carelessly reverses his opinion, having entirely forgotten about Bast, but it is too late, and Bast has lost his tenuous hold on financial solvency. Bast lives with a troubled, &quot;fallen&quot; woman for whom he feels responsible and whom he eventually marries. It is later revealed that years earlier, when a teenager, she had been Henry&#39;s mistress in <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, but he had then carelessly abandoned her, an expatriate English girl on foreign soil with no way to return home. Margaret confronts Henry about his ill-treatment, and he is ashamed of the affair but unrepentant about his harsh treatment of her. Because of Margaret&#39;s marriage into the Wilcoxes and situations such as these, the Schlegel sisters drift apart somewhat. Helen continues to try to help young Leonard Bast, but it all goes terribly wrong; because of Bast&#39;s wife&#39;s connection with Henry, Henry will not countenance helping them. In a moment of pity for the poor, doomed Bast, Helen has an affair with him. Finding herself pregnant, Helen leaves England to travel through Germany to conceal her condition, but eventually returns to her sister. Margaret tries in vain to convince Henry that if he can countenance his own affair, he should forgive Helen hers. Henry&#39;s son attacks Bast for the dishonor he has brought to Helen, and accidentally kills him when his weak heart gives out. The ensuing scandal and shock cause Henry to reevaluate his life and he begins to connect with others. He bequeaths Howards End to Margaret&#39;s nephew - Helen&#39;s son by Bast. Helen reconciles with her sister and Henry, and decides to raise her child at Howards End.<p><a id="Film.2C_TV_or_theatrical_adaptations" name="Film.2C_TV_or_theatrical_adaptations"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Film, TV or theatrical adaptations</span></h2>

      <p>Forster based his description of Howards End on a house at Rooks Nest in Hertfordshire, his childhood home from 1883 to 1893. According to his description in an appendix to the novel,  Rooks Nest was a hamlet with a farm on the Weston Road just outside Stevenage. The house is marked on modern Ordnance Survey maps at <!--del_lnk--> grid reference <!--del_lnk--> TL244267. Since Forster&#39;s childhood, Stevenage has grown to meet the house but has not yet engulfed it.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howards_End&quot;</div>
