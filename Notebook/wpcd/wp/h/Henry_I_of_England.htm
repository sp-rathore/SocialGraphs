      <p><b>Henry I</b> (circa <!--del_lnk--> 1068 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 1 December <!--del_lnk--> 1135) was the fourth son of <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a> and the first born in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest of <!--del_lnk--> 1066. He succeeded his elder brother <a href="../../wp/w/William_II_of_England.htm" title="William II of England">William II</a> as <!--del_lnk--> King of England in <!--del_lnk--> 1100 and defeated his eldest brother, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Curthose, to become <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy in <!--del_lnk--> 1106. He was called <b>Beauclerc</b> for his scholarly interests and <b>Lion of Justice</b> for refinements which he brought about in the rudimentary administrative and legislative machinery of the time.<p>Henry&#39;s reign is noted for its political opportunism. His succession was wrought while his brother Robert was away on the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> and the beginning of his reign was occupied by wars with Robert for control of England and Normandy. He successfully reunited the two realms for the first time since his father&#39;s death in <!--del_lnk--> 1087. Upon his succession he granted the baronage a <!--del_lnk--> Charter of Liberties, which formed a basis for subsequent challenges to rights of kings and presaged the <a href="../../wp/m/Magna_Carta.htm" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>, which subjected the King to law.<p>The rest of Henry&#39;s reign was filled with judicial and financial reforms. He established the biannual <!--del_lnk--> Exchequer to reform the <!--del_lnk--> treasury. He used itinerant officials to curb abuses of power at the local and regional level, garnering the praise of the people. The differences between the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon and <!--del_lnk--> Norman populations began to break down during his reign and he himself married a daughter of the old Saxon royal house. He made peace with the church after the disputes of his brother&#39;s reign, but he could not smooth out his succession after the disastrous loss of his eldest son <!--del_lnk--> William in the wreck of the <!--del_lnk--> White Ship. His will was to be succeeded by his daughter, the <!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda, but his stern rule was followed by civil war known as <a href="../../wp/t/The_Anarchy.htm" title="The Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Henry was born between May <!--del_lnk--> 1068 and May <!--del_lnk--> 1069, probably in <!--del_lnk--> Selby, <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire in the north east of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. His mother, Queen <!--del_lnk--> Matilda of Flanders, was descended from the Saxon King <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> (but not through the main West Saxon Royal line). Queen Matilda named the infant Prince Henry after her uncle, King <!--del_lnk--> Henry I of France. As the youngest son of the family, he was almost certainly expected to become a Bishop and was given rather more extensive schooling than was usual for a young nobleman of that time. The Chronicler <!--del_lnk--> William of Malmesbury asserts that Henry once remarked that an illiterate King was a crowned ass. He was certainly the first <!--del_lnk--> Norman ruler to be fluent in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>.<p>William I&#39;s third son <!--del_lnk--> Richard had pre-deceased his father by being killed in an hunting accident in the New Forest so, upon his death in <!--del_lnk--> 1087, William bequeathed his dominions to his three surviving sons in the following manner:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Robert received the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy and became Duke Robert III<li><!--del_lnk--> William Rufus received the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England and became King William II<li><!--del_lnk--> Henry Beauclerc received 5,000 pounds of silver</ul>
      <p>The Chronicler <!--del_lnk--> Orderic Vitalis reports that the old King had declared to Henry: &quot;<i>You in your own time will have all the dominions I have acquired and be greater than both your brothers in wealth and power</i>.&quot;<p>Henry tried to play his brothers off against each other but eventually, wary of his devious manoeuvring, they acted together and signed an Accession Treaty which sought to bar Prince Henry from both Thrones by stipulating that if either King William or Duke Robert died without an heir, the two dominions of their father would be reunited under the surviving brother.<p><a id="Seizing_the_throne_of_England" name="Seizing_the_throne_of_England"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Seizing the throne of England</span></h2>

      <p>When, on <!--del_lnk--> 2 August <!--del_lnk--> 1100, William II was killed by an arrow in yet another hunting accident in the New Forest, Duke Robert was not yet returned from the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> and his absence, along with his poor reputation among the Norman nobles, allowed Prince Henry to seize the Royal Treasury at <!--del_lnk--> Winchester, Hampshire - where he buried his dead brother. He was accepted as King by the leading <!--del_lnk--> Barons and was crowned three days later on <!--del_lnk--> 5 August at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. He secured his position among the nobles by an act of political appeasement: he issued a <!--del_lnk--> Charter of Liberties which is considered a forerunner of the <a href="../../wp/m/Magna_Carta.htm" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>.<p><a id="First_marriage" name="First_marriage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First marriage</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 11 November <!--del_lnk--> 1100 Henry married <!--del_lnk--> Edith, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> King Malcolm III. Since Edith was also the niece of <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Atheling and the great-granddaughter of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>&#39;s paternal half-brother <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Ironside, the marriage united the Norman line with the old English line of Kings. The marriage greatly displeased the Norman Barons, however, and as a concession to their sensibilities Edith changed her name to Matilda upon becoming Queen. The other side of this coin, however, was that Henry, by dint of his marriage, became far more acceptable to the Anglo-Saxon populace.<p>The Chronicler <!--del_lnk--> William of Malmesbury described Henry thus: &quot;<i>He was of middle stature, greater than the small, but exceeded by the very tall; his hair was black and set back upon the forehead; his eyes mildly bright; his chest brawny; his body fleshy.</i>&quot;<p><a id="Conquest_of_Normandy" name="Conquest_of_Normandy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conquest of Normandy</span></h2>
      <p>In the following year, <!--del_lnk--> 1101, Robert Curthose attempted to seize the crown by invading England. In the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Alton, Robert agreed to recognise his brother Henry as King of England and return peacefully to <!--del_lnk--> Normandy, upon receipt of an annual sum of 2000 marks, which Henry proceeded to pay.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1105, to eliminate the continuing threat from <!--del_lnk--> Robert Curthose and to obviate the drain on his fiscal resources, Henry led an expeditionary force across the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>.<p><a id="Battle_of_Tinchebray" name="Battle_of_Tinchebray"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Battle of Tinchebray</span></h2>
      <p>On the morning of the <!--del_lnk--> 28 September <!--del_lnk--> 1106, exactly 40 years after William had landed in England, the decisive battle between his two sons, Robert Curthose and Henry Beauclerc took place in the small village of Tinchebray. This combat was totally unexpected and unprepared. Henry and his army were marching south from Barfleur on their way to Domfront and Robert was marching with his army from Falaise on their way to Mortain. They met at the crossroads at Tinchebray and the running battle which ensued was spread out over several kilometres. The site where most of the fighting took place is the village playing field today. Towards evening Robert tried to retreat but was captured by Henry&#39;s men at a place three kilometres (just under two miles) North of Tinchebray where a farm named &quot;Prise&quot; (taken) stands today on the D22 road. The tombstones of three knights are nearby on the same road.<p><a id="King_of_England_and_Duke_of_Normandy" name="King_of_England_and_Duke_of_Normandy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">King of England and Duke of Normandy</span></h2>
      <p>After Henry had defeated his brother&#39;s Norman army at Tinchebray he imprisoned Robert, initially in the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, subsequently at Devizes Castle and later at Cardiff. One day whilst out riding Robert attempted to escape from Cardiff but his horse was bogged down in a swamp and he was recaptured. To prevent further escapes Henry had Robert&#39;s eyes burnt out. Henry appropriated the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy as a possession of the Kingdom of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and reunited his father&#39;s dominions.<p>He attempted to reduce difficulties in Normandy by marrying his eldest son, <!--del_lnk--> William Adelin, to the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Fulk of Jerusalem (also known as Fulk V), Count of Anjou, then a serious enemy. Eight years later, after William&#39;s untimely death, a much more momentous union was made between Henry&#39;s daughter, the Empress Matilda and Fulk&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Plantagenet, which eventually resulted in the union of the two Realms under the <!--del_lnk--> Plantagenet Kings.<p><a id="Activities_as_a_King" name="Activities_as_a_King"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Activities as a King</span></h2>

      <p>Henry&#39;s need for finance to consolidate his position led to an increase in the activities of centralized government. As King, Henry carried out social and judicial reforms, including:<ul>
       <li>issuing the <!--del_lnk--> Charter of Liberties<li>restoring the laws of King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>.</ul>
      <p>Henry was also known for some brutal acts. He once threw a traitorous burgher named Conan Pilatus from the tower of Rouen; the tower was known from then on as &quot;Conan&#39;s Leap&quot;. In another instance that took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1119, Henry&#39;s son-in-law, Eustace de Pacy, and Ralph Harnec, the constable of <!--del_lnk--> Ivry, exchanged their children as hostages. When Eustace blinded Harnec&#39;s son, Harnec demanded vengeance. King Henry allowed Harnec to blind and mutilate Eustace&#39;s two daughters, who were also Henry&#39;s own grandchildren. Eustace and his wife, Juliane, were outraged and threatened to rebel. Henry arranged to meet his daughter at a parley at Breteuil, only for Juliane to draw a crossbow and attempt to assassinate her father. She was captured and confined to the castle, but escaped by leaping from a window into the moat below. Some years later Henry was reconciled with his daughter and son-in-law.<p><a id="Legitimate_children" name="Legitimate_children"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legitimate children</span></h2>
      <p>He had two children by Matilda (Edith), who died in <!--del_lnk--> 1118:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Matilda, born February <!--del_lnk--> 1102, and<li><!--del_lnk--> William Adelin, born November <!--del_lnk--> 1103.</ul>
      <p>Disaster struck when William, his only legitimate son, perished in the wreck of the <!--del_lnk--> White Ship on <!--del_lnk--> 25 November <!--del_lnk--> 1120 off the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. Also among the dead were two of Henry&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> illegitimate children, as well as a niece, Lucia-Mahaut de Blois. Henry&#39;s grieving was intense, and the succession was in crisis.<p><a id="Second_marriage" name="Second_marriage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Second marriage</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 29 January <!--del_lnk--> 1121, he married <!--del_lnk--> Adeliza, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Godfrey I of Leuven, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Lower Lotharingia and <!--del_lnk--> Landgrave of <!--del_lnk--> Brabant, but there were no children from this marriage. Left without male heirs, Henry took the unprecedented step of making his barons swear to accept his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Empress Matilda, widow of <!--del_lnk--> Henry V, the Holy Roman Emperor, as his heir.<p><a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and legacy</span></h2>
      <p>Henry visited Normandy in 1135 to see his young grandsons, the children of Matilda and Geoffrey. He took great delight in his grandchildren, but soon quarrelled with his daughter and son-in-law and these disputes led him to tarry in Normandy far longer than he originally planned.<p>Henry died on 1 December <!--del_lnk--> 1135 of <!--del_lnk--> food poisoning from eating &quot;a surfeit of <!--del_lnk--> lampreys&quot; (of which he was excessively fond) at Saint-Denis-en-Lyons (now Lyons-la-For&ecirc;t) in Normandy. His remains were sewn into the hide of a bull to preserve them on the journey, and then taken back to England and were buried at <!--del_lnk--> Reading Abbey, which he had founded fourteen years before. The Abbey was destroyed during the Reformation and no trace of his tomb has survived, the probable site being covered by St James&#39; School. There is a small <!--del_lnk--> plaque nearby and a large memorial cross in the adjoining Forbury Gardens.<p>Although Henry&#39;s barons had sworn allegiance to his daughter as their Queen, her gender and her remarriage into the <!--del_lnk--> House of Anjou, an enemy of the Normans, allowed Henry&#39;s nephew <a href="../../wp/s/Stephen_of_England.htm" title="Stephen of England">Stephen of Blois</a>, to come to England and claim the throne with popular support.<p>The struggle between the Empress and Stephen resulted in a long civil war known as <a href="../../wp/t/The_Anarchy.htm" title="The Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>. The dispute was eventually settled by Stephen&#39;s naming of Matilda&#39;s son, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry Plantagenet</a>, as his heir in <!--del_lnk--> 1153.<p><a id="Illegitimate_children" name="Illegitimate_children"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Illegitimate children</span></h2>
      <p>King Henry is famed for holding the record for the largest number of acknowledged illegitimate children born to any English king, with the number being around 20 or 25. He had many mistresses, and identifying which mistress is the mother of which child is difficult. His illegitimate offspring for whom there is documentation are:<ol>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester. Often, probably incorrectly, said to have been a son of Sybil Corbet.
