      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">Science</a> is a body of <!--del_lnk--> empirical and <!--del_lnk--> theoretical knowledge, produced by a global community of researchers, making use of specific techniques for the observation and <!--del_lnk--> explanation of real <!--del_lnk--> phenomena, this <i><!--del_lnk--> techne</i> as a whole being summed up under the heading of <!--del_lnk--> scientific method. As such, the <b>history of science</b> draws on the <!--del_lnk--> historical methods of both <!--del_lnk--> intellectual history and <!--del_lnk--> social history.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Scientific Revolution of the sixteenth and early seventeenth century saw the inception of modern scientific methods to guide the evaluation of knowledge. This change is considered to be so fundamental that some &mdash; especially philosophers of science and practicing scientists &mdash; consider such earlier inquiries into nature to be <i>pre-scientific</i>. Traditionally, historians of science have defined science sufficiently broadly to include those inquiries.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> history of mathematics, <!--del_lnk--> history of technology, and <!--del_lnk--> history of philosophy are covered in other articles. Mathematics is closely related to, but distinct from science (at least in the modern conception). Technology concerns the creative process of designing useful objects and systems, which differs from the search for empirical truth. Philosophy differs from science in that, while both the <!--del_lnk--> natural and the <!--del_lnk--> social sciences attempt to base their theories on established fact, philosophy also enquires about other areas of knowledge, notably <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>. In practice, each of these fields is heavily used by the others as an external tool.<p>

      <p>Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science <i>is</i>, how it <i>functions</i>, and whether it exhibits large-scale patterns and trends. The <!--del_lnk--> sociology of science in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work, looking closely at the ways in which they &quot;produce&quot; and &quot;construct&quot; scientific knowledge. Since the 1960s, a common trend in the <!--del_lnk--> science studies (the study of the sociology and history of science) has been to emphasize the &quot;human component&quot; to scientific knowledge, and to de-emphasize the view that scientific data is self-evident, value-free, and context-free.<p>A major subject of concern and controversy in the philosophy of science has been to inquire about the nature of <i>theory change</i> in science. Three philosophers in particular who represent the primary poles in this debate have been <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Popper.htm" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, who argued that scientific knowledge is progressive and cumulative; <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Kuhn, who argued that scientific knowledge moves through &quot;<!--del_lnk--> paradigm shifts&quot; and is not necessarily progressive; and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Feyerabend, who argued that scientific knowledge is not cumulative or progressive, and that there can be no <!--del_lnk--> demarcation between science and any other form of investigation.<p>Since the publication of Kuhn&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> in 1962, there has been much debate in the academic community over the meaning and objectivity of &quot;science.&quot; Often, but not always, a conflict over the &quot;truth&quot; of science has split along the lines of those in the scientific community and those in the social sciences or humanities (for example, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Science wars&quot;).<p><a id="Early_cultures" name="Early_cultures"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early cultures</span></h2>

      <p>In prehistoric times, advice and knowledge was passed from generation to generation in an <!--del_lnk--> oral tradition. The development of writing enabled knowledge to be stored and communicated across generations with much greater fidelity. Combined with the <!--del_lnk--> development of agriculture, which allowed for a surplus of food, it became possible for early civilizations to develop, because more time could be devoted to tasks other than survival.<p>Many ancient civilizations collected astronomical information in a systematic manner through simple observation. Though they had no knowledge of the real physical structure of the planets and stars, many theoretical explanations were proposed.<p>Basic facts about human physiology were known in some places, and <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> was practiced in several civilizations. Considerable observation of macrobiotic flora and fauna was also performed.<p><a id="Science_in_Classical_Antiquity" name="Science_in_Classical_Antiquity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Science in Classical Antiquity</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Antiquity, the inquiry into the workings of the universe took place both in investigations aimed at such practical goals as establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses and in those abstract investegations known as <!--del_lnk--> natural philosophy. The ancient peoples who are considered the first <i><!--del_lnk--> scientists</i> may have thought of themselves as <i>natural philosophers</i>, as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers).<p>The earliest Greek philosophers, known as the <!--del_lnk--> pre-Socratics, provided competing answers to the question found in the myths of their neighbors: &quot;How did the ordered <!--del_lnk--> cosmos in which we live come to be?&quot; Subsequently, Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy, which did much to shape later investigations into nature.<p>The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge, especially in anatomy, zoology, and astronomy; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems, especially those related to the problem of change and its causes; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research.<p><a id="Science_in_India" name="Science_in_India"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Science in India</span></h2>

      <p>Indian philosophers in <!--del_lnk--> ancient India developed <!--del_lnk--> atomic theories, which included formulating ideas about the <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atom</a> in a systematic manner and propounding ideas about the atomic constitution of the material world. The <!--del_lnk--> principle of relativity was also available in an early embryonic form in the Indian philosophical concept of &quot;<i>sapekshavad</i>&quot;. The literal translation of this <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word is &quot;<i>theory of relativity</i>&quot; (not to be confused with Einstein&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> theory of relativity). The <!--del_lnk--> wootz, <!--del_lnk--> crucible and <!--del_lnk--> stainless <!--del_lnk--> steels were invented in India.<p><!--del_lnk--> Aryabhata in <!--del_lnk--> 499 presented a <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> of <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravitation</a> where he presented astronomical and mathematical theories in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the <!--del_lnk--> periods of the planets were given as <!--del_lnk--> elliptical orbits with respect to the sun. He also believed that the moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight and that the orbits of the planets are ellipses. He carried out accurate calculations of astronomical constants based on this system, such as the periods of the planets, the <!--del_lnk--> circumference of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">earth</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_eclipse.htm" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lunar_eclipse.htm" title="Lunar eclipse">lunar eclipse</a>, the time taken for a single rotation of the Earth on its axis, the length of earth&#39;s revolution around the sun, and the longitudes of planets using eccentrics and <!--del_lnk--> epicycles. He also introduced a number of <!--del_lnk--> trigonometric functions (including <!--del_lnk--> sine, <!--del_lnk--> versine, <!--del_lnk--> cosine and inverse sine), <a href="../../wp/t/Trigonometry.htm" title="Trigonometry">trigonometric</a> tables, and techniques and <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> of <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">algebra</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Arabic translations of his texts were available in the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic world by the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th</a>-<a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a>.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brahmagupta briefly described the <!--del_lnk--> law of gravitation, and recognized <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> as a force of attraction. He also lucidly explained the use of <!--del_lnk--> zero as both a <!--del_lnk--> placeholder and a <!--del_lnk--> decimal digit, along with the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-Arabic numerals now used universally throughout the world. Arabic translations of his texts (around <!--del_lnk--> 770) introduced this number system to the Islamic world, where it was adapted as <!--del_lnk--> Arabic numerals.<p>The <i>Siddhanta Shiromani</i> was a mathematical astronomy text written by <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>. The 12 chapters of the first part cover topics such as: mean longitudes of the planets; true longitudes of the planets; the three problems of diurnal rotation; syzygies; lunar eclipses; solar eclipses; latitudes of the planets; risings and settings; the moon&#39;s crescent; conjunctions of the planets with each other; conjunctions of the planets with the fixed stars; and the patas of the sun and moon. The second part contains thirteen chapters on the sphere. It covers topics such as: praise of study of the sphere; nature of the sphere; cosmography and geography; planetary mean motion; eccentric epicyclic model of the planets; the armillary sphere; spherical trigonometry; ellipse calculations; first visibilities of the planets; calculating the lunar crescent; astronomical instruments; the seasons; and problems of astronomical calculations.<p>From the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara and various <!--del_lnk--> Keralese mathematicians first conceived <!--del_lnk--> differential calculus, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematical_analysis.htm" title="Mathematical analysis">mathematical analysis</a>, <!--del_lnk--> trigonometric <!--del_lnk--> series, <!--del_lnk--> floating point numbers, and concepts foundational to the overall development of <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a>.

      <p>China has a long and rich history of technological contribution.

These four discoveries had an enormous impact on the development of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese civilization and a far-ranging global impact. According to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Bacon.htm" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, writing in <i><!--del_lnk--> Novum Organum</i>,<blockquote>
       <p>Printing, gunpowder and the compass: These three have changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world; the first in <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>, the second in <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="Warfare">warfare</a>, the third in <!--del_lnk--> navigation; whence have followed innumerable changes, in so much that no empire, no sect, no star seems to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical discoveries.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Novum Organum, Liber I, CXXIX - Adapted from the <!--del_lnk--> 1863 translation)</blockquote>
      <p>In regards to mathematics, two early works on mathematics were <!--del_lnk--> The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (&#x4E5D;&#x7AE0;&#x7B97;&#x8853;) (composed in the 1st century CE but perhaps as early as 200 BCE and the <!--del_lnk--> Su&agrave;n sh&ugrave; sh&#x16B; (discovered in a tomb from 186 BC, early in the Western <!--del_lnk--> Han dynasty). Most scholars believe that Chinese mathematics and the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world developed more or less independently up to the time when the Nine Chapters reached its final form. In the third century <!--del_lnk--> Liu Hui wrote his commentary on the Nine Chapters and also wrote Haidao suanjing which dealt with using Pythagorean theorem, which in China was known as Gougu theorem, to measure the size of things. In the fifth century the manual called &quot;Zhang Qiujian suanjing&quot; discussed linear and quadratic equations. By this point the Chinese had the concept of <!--del_lnk--> negative numbers. By the <!--del_lnk--> Tang Dynasty study of math was fairly standard in the great schools. The thirteenth century saw a renaissance in Chinese mathematical theory. This saw Chinese mathematicians solving equations with methods Europe would not know until the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century. The high point of this era came with Zhu Shijie&#39;s two books <i>Suanxue qimeng</i> and the <i>Siyuan yujian</i>. In one case he reportedly gave a method equivalent to <!--del_lnk--> Gauss&#39;s pivotal condensation. He also worked with a form of <!--del_lnk--> Pascal triangle in the thirteenth century, but called it &quot;the ancient method of powers up to the eighth.&quot; Other discoveries include <!--del_lnk--> negative numbers, the <!--del_lnk--> binomial theorem, <a href="../../wp/m/Matrix_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Matrix (mathematics)">matrix</a> methods for solving systems of <!--del_lnk--> linear equations, the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese remainder theorem, and the <!--del_lnk--> rule of three<p>Western academic thought on the history of Chinese technology and science was galvanized by the work of <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Needham and the Needham Research Institute. Among the scientific accomplishments of China were early <!--del_lnk--> seismological detectors, <!--del_lnk--> matches, the independent invention of the <!--del_lnk--> decimal system, <!--del_lnk--> dry docks, sliding <!--del_lnk--> calipers, the double-action <!--del_lnk--> piston pump, <!--del_lnk--> cast iron, the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> <!--del_lnk--> plough, the multi-tube <!--del_lnk--> seed drill, the <!--del_lnk--> wheelbarrow, the <!--del_lnk--> suspension bridge, the <!--del_lnk--> parachute, <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> as fuel, , the <!--del_lnk--> raised-relief map, the <!--del_lnk--> propeller, the <!--del_lnk--> crossbow, a solid fuel <!--del_lnk--> rocket, and the <!--del_lnk--> cannon along with other contributions in <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, and numerous other fields.<p><a id="The_Middle_Ages" name="The_Middle_Ages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Middle Ages</span></h2>

      <p>Meanwhile, in the Middle East, Greek philosophy was able to find some support by the newly created Arab <!--del_lnk--> Caliphate. With the spread of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> in the 7th and 8th centuries, a period of Islamic scholarship lasted until the 14th century. This scholarship was aided by several factors. The use of a single language, <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, allowed communication without need of a translator. Access to Greek and Roman texts from the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> along with Indian sources of learning provided Islamic scholars a knowledge base to build upon. In addition, there was the <!--del_lnk--> Hajj, which facilitated scholarly collaboration by bringing together people and new ideas from all over the Islamic world.<p>Islamic scientists placed far greater emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> experiment than had the <!--del_lnk--> Greeks. In mathematics, the <!--del_lnk--> Persian scholar <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi.htm" title="Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi">Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi</a> gave his name to the Indian concept of the <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a>, while the term <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">algebra</a> is derived from <i>al-jabr</i>, the beginning of the title of one of his publications. <!--del_lnk--> Sabian mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Al-Batani (850-929) contributed to astronomy and mathematics and <!--del_lnk--> Persian scholar <!--del_lnk--> Al-Razi to chemistry. In astronomy, Al-Batani improved the measurements of <!--del_lnk--> Hipparchus, preserved in the translation of the Greek <i>H&egrave; Megal&egrave; Syntaxis</i> (<i>The great treatise</i>) translated as <i><!--del_lnk--> Almagest</i>.

      <p>An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of <!--del_lnk--> medieval universities in the 12th century. The contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily after the <!--del_lnk--> Reconquista and during the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a> allowed Europeans access to preserved copies of the Ancient Greek and Roman works along with the works of Islamic philosophers, specially <!--del_lnk--> Averroes. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities. As well as this, Europeans began to venture further and further east (most notably, perhaps, <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>) as a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Pax Mongolica. This led to the increased influence of Indian and even Chinese science on the European tradition.

      <p>At the beginning of the 13th century there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural philosophy contained in these texts began to be extended by notable <!--del_lnk--> scholastics such as <!--del_lnk--> Robert Grosseteste, <!--del_lnk--> Roger Bacon, <!--del_lnk--> Albertus Magnus and <!--del_lnk--> Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method can be seen already in Grosseteste&#39;s emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon. According to <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Duhem, the <!--del_lnk--> Condemnation of 1277 led to <i>the</i> birth of modern science, because it forced thinkers to break from relying so much on <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, and to think about the world in new ways.<p>The first half of the 14th century saw much important scientific work being done, largely within the framework of <!--del_lnk--> scholastic <!--del_lnk--> commentaries on Aristotle&#39;s scientific writings. <!--del_lnk--> William of Ockham introduced the principle of <!--del_lnk--> parsimony: natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities, so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object and an intermediary &quot;sensible species&quot; is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye. Scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Jean Buridan and <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Oresme started to reinterpret elements of Aristotle&#39;s mechanics. In particular, Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles, which was a first step towards the modern concept of <!--del_lnk--> inertia. The <!--del_lnk--> Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the <!--del_lnk--> kinematics of motion, making this analysis without considering the causes of motion.<p>In 1348, the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> and other disasters sealed a sudden end to the previous period of massive philosophic and scientific development. Yet, the rediscovery of ancient texts was improved after the <!--del_lnk--> Fall of Constantinople in 1453, when many <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> scholars had to seek refuge in the West. Meanwhile, the introduction of printing (from China) was to have great effect on European society. The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas. New ideas also helped to influence the development of European science at this point: not least the introduction of <a href="../../wp/a/Algebra.htm" title="Algebra">Algebra</a>. These developments paved the way for the <!--del_lnk--> Scientific Revolution, which may also be understood as a resumption of the process of scientific change, halted at the start of the Black Death.<p><a id="The_Scientific_Revolution" name="The_Scientific_Revolution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Scientific Revolution</span></h2>

      <p>The renewal of learning in Europe, that began with 12th century <!--del_lnk--> Scholasticism, came to an end about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent <a href="../../wp/i/Italian_Renaissance.htm" title="Italian Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a> is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. The <!--del_lnk--> Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a> <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>; the <!--del_lnk--> Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/John_Calvin.htm" title="John Calvin">John Calvin</a> questioned religious doctrine. The works of <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (astronomy), <!--del_lnk--> Galen (medicine), and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> (physics) were found not always to match everyday observations. For example, an arrow flying through the air after leaving a bow contradicts Aristotle&#39;s laws of motion, which say that a moving object must be constantly under influence of an external force, as the natural state of earthly objects is to be at rest. Work by <!--del_lnk--> Vesalius on human cadavers also found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The beginning of the 20th century brought the start of a revolution in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances.

Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of <!--del_lnk--> spacetime, on which both <!--del_lnk--> Newtonian mechanics and <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> depended, could not exist. In 1925, <!--del_lnk--> Werner Heisenberg and <!--del_lnk--> Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger formulated <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory by <!--del_lnk--> George Gamow.<div class="thumb tright">

The primary patron of physics became state governments, who recognized that the support of &quot;basic&quot; research could often lead to technologies useful to both military and industrial applications. Currently, general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other, and efforts are underway to unify the two.<p><a id="Chemistry" name="Chemistry"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Chemistry</span></h4>

      <p>The history of modern chemistry can be taken to begin with the distinction of chemistry from <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> by <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> in his work <i>The Sceptical Chymist</i>, in 1661 (although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after this) and the gravimetric experimental practices of medical chemists like <!--del_lnk--> William Cullen, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Black, <!--del_lnk--> Torbern Bergman and Pierre Macquer. It can also be dated <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>&#39;s naming of oxygen and the law of <!--del_lnk--> conservation of mass, which refuted <!--del_lnk--> phlogiston theory. Proof that all matter is made of atoms, which are the smallest constituents of matter that cannot be broken down without losing the basic chemical and physical properties of that matter, was provided by <!--del_lnk--> John Dalton in 1803. He also formulated the law of mass relationships. In 1869, <a href="../../wp/d/Dmitri_Mendeleev.htm" title="Dmitri Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> composed his <a href="../../wp/p/Periodic_table.htm" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> of elements on the basis of Dalton&#39;s discoveries.<p>The synthesis of <!--del_lnk--> urea by <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich W&ouml;hler opened a new research field, <!--del_lnk--> organic chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the nineteenth century saw the exploitation of the Earth&#39;s petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from <!--del_lnk--> whaling. By the twentieth century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in <!--del_lnk--> physiological chemistry, the precursor to <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry. The twentieth century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. <a href="../../wp/l/Linus_Pauling.htm" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>&#39;s book on <i>The Nature of the Chemical Bond</i> used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce <!--del_lnk--> bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling&#39;s work culminated in the physical modelling of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <i>the secret of life</i> (in the words of <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Crick.htm" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a>, 1953). In the same year, the <!--del_lnk--> Miller-Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple <!--del_lnk--> amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.<p><a id="Geology" name="Geology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Geology</span></h4>

      <p>Geology existed a cloud of isolated, disconnected ideas about rocks, minerals, and landforms long before it became a coherent science. <!--del_lnk--> Theophrastus&#39; work on rocks <i>Peri lith&#x14D;n</i> remained authoritative for millennia: its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution. Chinese polymath <!--del_lnk--> Shen Kua (1031 - 1095) was the first to formulate hypotheses for the process of land formation. Based on his observation of fossils in a geological <!--del_lnk--> stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he deduced that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by <!--del_lnk--> deposition of silt.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Geology was not systematically restructured during the <!--del_lnk--> Scientific Revolution, but individual theorists made important contributions. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Hooke, for example, formulated theory of earthquakes, and <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Steno developed the theory of <!--del_lnk--> superposition and argued that <!--del_lnk--> fossils were the remains of once-living creatures. Beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Burnet&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Sacred Theory of the Earth in 1685, natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time. Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth&#39;s past in terms of events described in the Bible, but their work laid the intellectual foundations for lsecular interpretations of Earth history.<p>Modern geology, like modern chemistry, gradually evolved during the 1700s and early 1800s. <!--del_lnk--> Benoit de Maillet and the <!--del_lnk--> Comte de Buffon argued that Earth was much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars. <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Etienne Guettard and <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps. <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Werner created a systemtic classifaction scheme for rocks and minerals--an achievement as significant for geology as that of <!--del_lnk--> Linnaeus was for biology. Werner also proposed a generalized interpretation of Earth history, as did contemporary Scottish polymath <!--del_lnk--> James Hutton. <!--del_lnk--> Georges Cuvier and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Brongniart, expanding on the work of <!--del_lnk--> Steno, argued that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained: a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin. The use of <!--del_lnk--> index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps, because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other, distant localities. Over the first half of the nineteenth century, geologists such as <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lyell, <!--del_lnk--> Adam Sedgwick, and <!--del_lnk--> Roderick Murchison applied the new technique to rocks throughout Europe and eastern North America, setting the stage for more detailed, government-funded mapping projects in later decades.<p>Midway through the 19th century, the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand <i>how</i> the surface of the Earth changed. The first comprehensive theories of mountain building were proposed during this period, as were the first modern theories of earthquakes and volcanoes. <!--del_lnk--> Louis Agassiz and others established the reality of continent-covering <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice ages</a>, and &quot;fluvialists&quot; like <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys were formed, over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them. <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Wegener&#39;s theory of &quot;continental drift&quot; was widely dismissed when it was proposed in the 1910s, but new data gathered in the 1950s and 1960s led to the theory of <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, which provided a plausible mechanism for it. <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">Plate tectonics</a> also provided a unified explanation for a wide range of seemingly unrelated geological phenomena. Since 1970 it has been the unifying principle in geology.<p>Geologists&#39; embrace of <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a> was part of a broadening of the field from a study of rocks into a study of the Earth as a planet. Other elements of this transformation include: geophysical studies of the interior of the Earth, the grouping of geology with <a href="../../wp/m/Meteorology.htm" title="Meteorology">meteorology</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oceanography.htm" title="Oceanography">oceanography</a> as one of the &quot;earth sciences,&quot; and comparisons of Earth and the solar system&#39;s other rocky planets.<p><a id="Astronomy" name="Astronomy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Astronomy</span></h4>

      <p>In 1847, Hungarian physician <!--del_lnk--> Ign&aacute;c F&uuml;l&ouml;p Semmelweis dramatically reduced the occurrency of <!--del_lnk--> puerperal fever by the simple experiment of requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth. This discovery predated the <!--del_lnk--> germ theory of disease. However, Semmelweis&#39; findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Lister, who in 1865 proved the principles of <!--del_lnk--> antisepsis. Lister&#39;s work was based on the important findings by French biologist <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_Pasteur.htm" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>. Pasteur was able to link microorganisms with disease, revolutionizing medicine. He also devised one of the most important methods in <!--del_lnk--> preventive medicine, when in 1880 he produced a <!--del_lnk--> vaccine against <a href="../../wp/r/Rabies.htm" title="Rabies">rabies</a>. Pasteur invented the process of <!--del_lnk--> pasteurization, to help prevent the spread of disease through milk and other foods.<p>Perhaps the most prominent and far-reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> by <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> put forward by the British naturalist <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> in his <i>On <a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">the Origin of Species</a></i> in 1859. Darwin&#39;s theory proposed that all differences in animals were formed by natural processes over long periods of time, and that even <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> were simply evolved organisms. Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both <!--del_lnk--> opposition and support from different parts of society, and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of &quot;man&#39;s place in the universe&quot;. In the early 20th century, the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Austrian monk <a href="../../wp/g/Gregor_Mendel.htm" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> in 1866.

      <p>The discipline of <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a> typically traces its origin to the synthesis of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">Darwinian evolution</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Humboldtian <!--del_lnk--> biogeography, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important in the rise of ecology, however, were <!--del_lnk--> microbiology and <a href="../../wp/s/Soil_science.htm" title="Soil science">soil science</a>&mdash;particularly the <!--del_lnk--> cycle of life concept, prominent in the work <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_Pasteur.htm" title="Louis Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Cohn. The word <i>ecology</i> was coined by <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Haeckel, whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin&#39;s theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological thinking. In the 1930&#39;s, <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of <!--del_lnk--> field biology. The history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of <!--del_lnk--> environmentalism; the <!--del_lnk--> Gaia hypothesis in the 1960s and more recently the scientific-religious movement of <!--del_lnk--> Deep Ecology have brought the two closer together.<p><a id="Social_sciences" name="Social_sciences"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><u><!--del_lnk--> Social sciences</u></span></h3>
      <p>Successful use of the scientific method in the physical sciences led to the same methodology being adapted to better understand the many fields of human endeavor. From this effort the social sciences have been developed.<p><a id="Political_science" name="Political_science"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Political science</span></h4>
      <p>While the study of politics is first found in the <!--del_lnk--> Western tradition in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, political science is a late arrival in terms of <!--del_lnk--> social sciences. However, the discipline has a clear set of antecedents such as <!--del_lnk--> moral philosophy, <a href="../../wp/p/Political_philosophy.htm" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Political_economy.htm" title="Political economy">political economy</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>, and other fields concerned with <!--del_lnk--> normative determinations of what ought to be and with <!--del_lnk--> deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal <!--del_lnk--> state. In each historic period and in almost every geographic area, we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding.<p>The antecedents of politics trace their roots back even earlier than <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, particularly in the works of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod, <a href="../../wp/t/Thucydides.htm" title="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon, and <!--del_lnk--> Euripides. Later, Plato analyzed political systems, abstracted their analysis from more <!--del_lnk--> literary- and <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Similarly, Aristotle built upon Plato&#39;s analysis to include historical empirical evidence in his analysis.<p>During the rule of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, famous historians such as <!--del_lnk--> Polybius, <!--del_lnk--> Livy and <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch documented the rise of the Roman <!--del_lnk--> Republic, and the organization and histories of other nations, while <!--del_lnk--> statesmen like <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Cicero and others provided us with examples of the politics of the republic and Rome&#39;s empire and wars. The study of politics during this age was oriented toward understanding history, understanding methods of governing, and describing the operation of governments.<p>With the <!--del_lnk--> fall of the Roman Empire, there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies. The rise of <!--del_lnk--> monotheism and, particularly for the Western tradition, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, brought to light a new space for politics and political action. During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts. Works such as <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The City of God</i> synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political. Most of the political questions surrounding the relationship between <!--del_lnk--> church and state were clarified and contested in this period.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and later other <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> areas, works such as the <!--del_lnk--> Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and Epic of Kings by <!--del_lnk--> Ferdowsi provided evidence of political analysis, while the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic <!--del_lnk--> aristotelians such as <!--del_lnk--> Avicenna and later <!--del_lnk--> Maimonides and <!--del_lnk--> Averroes, continued <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&#39;s tradition of analysis and <a href="../../wp/e/Empiricism.htm" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>, writing commentaries on Aristotle&#39;s works.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/i/Italian_Renaissance.htm" title="Italian Renaissance">Italian Renaissance</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Niccol%25C3%25B2_Machiavelli.htm" title="Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli">Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</a> established the emphasis of modern political science on direct <!--del_lnk--> empirical <!--del_lnk--> observation of political <!--del_lnk--> institutions and actors. Later, the expansion of the scientific paradigm during the <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment further pushed the study of politics beyond normative determinations. In particular, the study of <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, to study the subjects of the <!--del_lnk--> state, has been applied to <!--del_lnk--> polling and <a href="../../wp/v/Voting.htm" title="Voting">voting</a>.<p><a id="Linguistics" name="Linguistics"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Linguistics</span></h4>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Historical linguistics emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century. <!--del_lnk--> Sir William Jones proposed that <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Persian, <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gothic, and <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand de Saussure&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Cours de linguistique g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</i> spawned the development of <!--del_lnk--> descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related <!--del_lnk--> structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. <a href="../../wp/n/Noam_Chomsky.htm" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> further diversified linguistics with the development of <!--del_lnk--> generative linguistics in the 1950s.

      <p>The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study. In that year <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research (in <!--del_lnk--> Leipzig). Other important early contributors to the field include <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in memory studies), <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Pavlov (who discovered <!--del_lnk--> classical conditioning), and <a href="../../wp/s/Sigmund_Freud.htm" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. Freud&#39;s influence has been enormous, though more as cultural icon than a force in scientific psychology.<p>The 20th century saw a rejection of Freud&#39;s theories as being too unscientific, and a reaction against <!--del_lnk--> Edward Titchener&#39;s atomistic approach of the mind. This led to the formulation of <!--del_lnk--> behaviorism by <!--del_lnk--> John B. Watson, which was popularized by <!--del_lnk--> B.F. Skinner. Behaviorism proposed <!--del_lnk--> epistemologically limiting psychological study to overt behaviour, since that could be reliably measured. Scientific knowledge of the &quot;mind&quot; was considered too metaphysical, hence impossible to achieve.<p>The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology, known collectively as <!--del_lnk--> cognitive science.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Ibn Khaldun is regarded as the founder of modern sociology. As a scientific discipline, sociology emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world. Among many early sociologists (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Durkheim), the aim of sociology was in <!--del_lnk--> structuralism, understanding the cohesion of social groups, and developing an &quot;antidote&quot; to social disintegration. <a href="../../wp/m/Max_Weber.htm" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a> was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of <!--del_lnk--> rationalization, which he believed would trap individuals in an &quot;iron cage&quot; of rational thought. Some sociologists, including <!--del_lnk--> Georg Simmel and <!--del_lnk--> W. E. B. Du Bois, utilized more <!--del_lnk--> microsociological, qualitative analyses. This microlevel approach played an important role in American sociology, with the theories of <!--del_lnk--> George Herbert Mead and his student <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Blumer resulting in the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> symbolic interactionism approach to sociology.<p>American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by <!--del_lnk--> Talcott Parsons, who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore &quot;functional&quot;. This <!--del_lnk--> structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s, when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo. In reaction, <!--del_lnk--> conflict theory was developed, which was based in part on the philosophies of <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources. Symbolic interactionism also came to be regarded as central to sociological thinking. <!--del_lnk--> Erving Goffman saw social interactions as a stage performance, with individuals preparing &quot;backstage&quot; and attempting to control their audience through <!--del_lnk--> impression management. While these theories are currently prominent in sociological thought, other approaches exist, including <!--del_lnk--> feminist theory, <!--del_lnk--> post-structuralism, <!--del_lnk--> rational choice theory, and <!--del_lnk--> postmodernism.<p><a id="Anthropology" name="Anthropology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Anthropology</span></h4>

      <p>Anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behaviour. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part.<p>At the same time, the romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as <!--del_lnk--> Johann Gottfried Herder and later <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Dilthey whose work formed the basis for the <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> concept which is central to the discipline. Traditionally, much of the history of the subject was based on <!--del_lnk--> colonial encounters between Europe and the rest of the world, and much of 18th- and 19th-century anthropology is now classed as forms of <!--del_lnk--> scientific racism.<p>During the late 19th-century, battles over the &quot;study of man&quot; took place between those of an &quot;anthropological&quot; persuasion (relying on <!--del_lnk--> anthropometrical techniques) and those of an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> ethnological&quot; persuasion (looking at cultures and traditions), and these distinctions became part of the later divide between <!--del_lnk--> physical anthropology and <!--del_lnk--> cultural anthropology, the latter ushered in by the students of <!--del_lnk--> Franz Boas.<p>In the mid-20th century, much of the methodologies of earlier anthropological and ethnographical study were reevaluated with an eye towards research ethics, while at the same time the scope of investigation has broadened far beyond the traditional study of &quot;primitive cultures&quot; (scientific practice itself is often an arena of anthropological study).<p>The emergence of <!--del_lnk--> paleoanthropology, a scientific discipline which draws on the <!--del_lnk--> methodologies of <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> physical anthropology and <!--del_lnk--> ethology, among other disciplines, and increasing in scope and momentum from the mid-20th century, continues to yield further insights into human origins, evolution, genetic and cultural heritage, and perspectives on the contemporary human predicament as well.<p><a id="Emerging_disciplines" name="Emerging_disciplines"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Emerging disciplines</span></h3>
      <p>During the 20th century, a number of interdisciplinary scientific fields have emerged. Three examples will be given here:<p><!--del_lnk--> Communication studies combines <!--del_lnk--> animal communication, <!--del_lnk--> information theory, <!--del_lnk--> marketing, <!--del_lnk--> public relations, <a href="../../wp/t/Telecommunication.htm" title="Telecommunication">telecommunications</a> and other forms of communication.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">Computer science</a>, built upon a foundation of <!--del_lnk--> theoretical linguistics, <!--del_lnk--> discrete mathematics, and <a href="../../wp/e/Electrical_engineering.htm" title="Electrical engineering">electrical engineering</a>, studies the nature and limits of computation. Subfields include <!--del_lnk--> computability, <!--del_lnk--> computational complexity, <!--del_lnk--> database design, <!--del_lnk--> computer networking, <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligence, and the design of <!--del_lnk--> computer hardware. Computer science now typically distiniguishes itself by emphasising mathematical &#39;theory&#39; in contrast to the practical emphasis of <!--del_lnk--> software engineering, but this theory refers to the mathematical foundations of computation, and relates little to the practice of programming or software design.<p><!--del_lnk--> Materials science has its roots in <a href="../../wp/m/Metallurgy.htm" title="Metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> minerology, and <!--del_lnk--> crystallography. It combines chemistry, physics, and several engineering disciplines. The field studies metals, ceramics, plastics, <!--del_lnk--> semiconductors, and <!--del_lnk--> composite materials.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science&quot;</div>
