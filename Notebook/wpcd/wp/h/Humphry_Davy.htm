      <p>Sir Humphry revelled in his status, as his lectures gathered many spectators. Davy became well known due to his experiments with the physiological action of some <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gases</a>, including laughing gas (<!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide) - to which he was addicted, once stating that its properties bestowed all of the benefits of alcohol but was devoid of its flaws. Davy later damaged his eyesight in a laboratory accident with <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen trichloride. In 1801 he was nominated <!--del_lnk--> professor at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Institution of Great Britain and Fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society, over which he would later preside. He later invented the davy lamp which was a great and well known success. He discovered the element barium.<p><a id="Electrochemistry_work" name="Electrochemistry_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Electrochemistry work</span></h2>

      <p>In 1800, <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Volta announced his invention of the first electric pile or <!--del_lnk--> battery. Davy used this electric battery to separate <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a> by what is now known as <!--del_lnk--> electrolysis. With many batteries in series he was able to separate elemental <a href="../../wp/p/Potassium.htm" title="Potassium">potassium</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sodium.htm" title="Sodium">sodium</a> in 1807 and <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium.htm" title="Calcium">calcium</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Strontium.htm" title="Strontium">strontium</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Barium.htm" title="Barium">barium</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> in 1808, which is when he also discovered and named <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>. He also studied the energies involved in separating these salts, which is now the field of <!--del_lnk--> electrochemistry. According to the historian Christopher Lawrence, in the book <i>Romanticism and the Sciences</i>, his electrolytic work was driven by <!--del_lnk--> Romantic beliefs in a unity in nature, composed of polar forces.<p><a id="Retirement_and_further_work" name="Retirement_and_further_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement and further work</span></h2>
      <p>In 1812 he was knighted, gave a farewell lecture to the Royal Institution, and married a wealthy widow, <!--del_lnk--> Jane Apreece. While generally acknowledged as being faithful to his wife, their relationship was stormy and in his later years Davy travelled to continental Europe alone. In October 1813 he and his wife, accompanied by <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> as his scientific assistant (and valet) traveled to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> to collect a medal that <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon Bonaparte had awarded Davy for his electro-chemical work. Whilst in Paris Davy was asked by <!--del_lnk--> Gay-Lussac to investigate a mysterious substance isolated by <!--del_lnk--> Barnard Courtois. Davy showed it to be an element, which is now called <a href="../../wp/i/Iodine.htm" title="Iodine">iodine</a>. The party left Paris on <!--del_lnk--> December 29, travelling south through <!--del_lnk--> Montpellier and <!--del_lnk--> Nice and then to <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>.<p>After passing through Genoa, they went to <!--del_lnk--> Florence, where, in a series of experiments starting on Sunday <!--del_lnk--> March 27, Davy, with Faraday&#39;s assistance, succeed in using the sun&#39;s rays to ignite <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a>, and proved that it was composed of pure <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>. Davy&#39;s party continued on to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, and also visited <!--del_lnk--> Naples and <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Vesuvius.htm" title="Mount Vesuvius">Mount Vesuvius</a>. By the <!--del_lnk--> June 17, they were in <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>, where they met <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Volta, and continued north to <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>. They returned to Italy via <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Innsbruck, passed though <!--del_lnk--> Venice and returned to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>. Their plans to travel to <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople (Istanbul) were abandoned after Napoleon&#39;s escape from <!--del_lnk--> Elba, and they returned to England.<p><a id="Davy_lamp" name="Davy_lamp"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Davy lamp</span></h3>
      <p>After his return to England in 1815, Davy went on to produce the <!--del_lnk--> Davy lamp which was used by miners, although there is evidence to show that Davy &quot;invented&quot; his device at about the same time as an engineer, <!--del_lnk--> George Stephenson, but claimed all the credit for the invention.<p><a id="Discovery_of_chlorine" name="Discovery_of_chlorine"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Discovery of chlorine</span></h3>
      <p>He also showed that <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> could not be obtained from the substance known as <!--del_lnk--> oxymuriatic acid and proved the substance to be an element, which he named <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a>. (However <!--del_lnk--> Carl Scheele is credited as the discoverer of chlorine. Scheele had discovered it 36 years before Davy, but was unable to publish his findings.) This discovery overturned <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Lavoisier&#39;s</a> definition of acids as compounds of oxygen.<p><a id="Acid_and_bases_studies" name="Acid_and_bases_studies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Acid and bases studies</span></h3>
      <p>In 1815 Davy suggested that acids were substances that contained replaceable <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> &ndash; hydrogen that could be partly or totally replaced by <!--del_lnk--> metals. When acids reacted with metals they formed <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Bases were substances that reacted with acids to form salts and water. These definitions worked well for most of the century. Today we use the <!--del_lnk--> Br&oslash;nsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases.<p>In 1818, he was awarded a <!--del_lnk--> baronetcy and two years later he became President of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society.<p><a id="Further_electrochemistry_studies" name="Further_electrochemistry_studies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Further electrochemistry studies</span></h2>
      <p>In 1824 he proposed and eventually mounted chunks of iron to the hull of a copper clad ship in the first use of <!--del_lnk--> cathodic protection. Whilst this was effective in preventing the corrosion of copper, it eliminated the <!--del_lnk--> anti-fouling properties of the copper hull, leading to the attachment of molluscs and barnacles to the &quot;protected&quot; hull, slowing these ships and requiring extensive time in dry docks for defouling operations.He discoverd Calcium in 1808 in London England.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Davy died in <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> in 1829, his various inhalations of chemicals finally taking its toll on his health. He is buried in the Plain Palais Cemetery in <a href="../../wp/g/Geneva.htm" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>.<p>Davy&#39;s laboratory assistant, <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>, went on to enhance Davy&#39;s work and in the end became more famous and influential &ndash; to such an extent that Davy is supposed to have claimed Faraday as his greatest discovery. However, he later accused Faraday of <!--del_lnk--> plagiarism, causing Faraday (the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry) to cease all research in <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetism until his mentor&#39;s death.<p><a id="Davy.27s_Statue" name="Davy.27s_Statue"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Davy&#39;s Statue</span></h2>
