      <p>Hoover (whose family&#39;s name was originally Huber) was born into a <a href="../../wp/r/Religious_Society_of_Friends.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> family of distant <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> (Pfautz, <!--del_lnk--> Wehmeyer) and <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> (Huber, Burkhart) descent, in <!--del_lnk--> West Branch, Iowa. He was the first President to be born west of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>. Both of his parents, Jesse Hoover and Hulda Minthorn, died when Hoover was young. His father died in 1880 and his mother in 1883.<p>In 1885, eleven-year-old &quot;Bert&quot; Hoover went to <!--del_lnk--> Newberg, Oregon to become the ((( head leader over )&nbsp;??? ) *** WIKI EDITOR *** - this makes no sense.) his uncle John Minthorn, a doctor and real estate developer whom Hoover recalled as &quot;a severe man on the surface, but like all Quakers kindly at the bottom.&quot;<p>At a young age, Hoover was self-kept and goalgetting. &quot;My boyhood ambition was to be able to earn my own living, without the help of anybody, anywhere&quot; he once said. As an office boy in his uncle&#39;s Oregon Land Company he mastered bookkeeping and typing, while also went to business school in the afternoon. Thanks to a local schoolteacher, Miss Jane Gray, the boy&#39;s eyes were opened to the novels of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sir Walter Scott. <i><a href="../../wp/d/David_Copperfield_%2528novel%2529.htm" title="David Copperfield (novel)">David Copperfield</a></i>, the story of another orphan cast into the world, remained a lifelong favorite.<p><a id="Mining_Engineer" name="Mining_Engineer"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mining Engineer</span></h2>
      <p>In August and September 1905 Herbert Hoover visited the mines at <!--del_lnk--> Broken Hill, NSW Australia, to judge the activity to extract zinc from tailings left after the concentrating process had taken a lead and silver concentrate. Miles of tailings dumps had added up for the lack of a treatment process to extract the zinc. Hoover, through his workers Bewick, Moreing and Company, had been sent by the embryonic &quot;Collins House&quot; group of entrepreneurs and financiers. Judging that the on going technology of froth floatation, <!--del_lnk--> froth floatation process would be able to treat the zinc tailings Hoover acted to make contracts with the leading mines at Broken Hill to buy their tailings. Those contracts was then transferred to the Zinc Corporation which was floated in October 1908 in London and Melbourne. Hoover became a director of the Zinc Corporation at its foundation.<p>Herbert Hoover was also the mining engineer at the Prince of Wales Mine, <!--del_lnk--> Gundagai in around 1900.. He was also hired in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> to be a company representative at various gold mines in <!--del_lnk--> Western Australia. In 1902 Hoover travelled to <!--del_lnk--> Big Bell, <!--del_lnk--> Cue, <!--del_lnk--> Menzies and <!--del_lnk--> Coolgardie.<p><a id="Humanitarian" name="Humanitarian"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Humanitarian</span></h2>
      <p>Bored with making money, the Quaker side of Hoover was very anxious to be of service to others. When <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> started in August 1914, he helped get together the return home of 120,000 American tourists and businessmen from Europe. Hoover led five hundred volunteers to pass out food, clothing, steamship tickets and cash. &quot;I did not realize it at the moment, but on <!--del_lnk--> August 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1914 my career was over forever. I was on the slippery road of public life.&quot; The difference between dictatorship and democracy, Hoover liked to say, was simple: dictators organize from the top down, democracies from the bottom up.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> faced a food crisis after being invaded by Germany in fall 1914. Hoover undertook an unprecedented relief effort as head of the <!--del_lnk--> Committee for Relief in Belgium (CRB). The CRB became, in effect, an independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills and railroads. Its $11-million-a-month budget was supplied by voluntary donations and government grants. In an early form of shuttle diplomacy, he crossed the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> forty times seeking to persuade the enemies in Berlin to allow food to reach the war&#39;s victims. Long before the <!--del_lnk--> Armistice of 1918, he was an international hero. The Belgian city of <!--del_lnk--> Leuven named a prominent square after him. In addition, the Finns added the word <i>hoover</i>, meaning &quot;to help,&quot; to their language in honour of his two years of humanitarian work.<p>After the United States entered the war in April 1917, President <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> appointed Hoover head of the American <!--del_lnk--> Food Administration, with headquarters in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> He succeeded in cutting consumption of food needed overseas and avoided rationing at home. After the end of the war, Hoover, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Economic Council and head of the <!--del_lnk--> American Relief Administration, organized shipments of food for millions of starving people in <!--del_lnk--> Central Europe. To this end, he employed a newly formed Quaker organization, the <!--del_lnk--> American Friends Service Committee to carry out much of the logistical work in Europe. He extended aid to famine-stricken <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevist Russia in 1921. When a critic inquired if he was not thus helping <!--del_lnk--> Bolshevism, Hoover retorted, &quot;Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!&quot;<p>During this time, Hoover realized that he was in a unique position to collect information about the Great War and its aftermath. In 1919, he pledged US$50,000 to Stanford University to support his Hoover War Collection and donated to the University the extensive files of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, the U.S. Food Administration, and the American Relief Administration. Scholars were sent to Europe to collect pamphlets, society publications, government documents, newspapers, posters, proclamations, and other ephemeral materials related to the war and the revolutions and political movements that had followed it. The collection was later renamed the Hoover War Library and is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Hoover Institution.<p><a id="Commerce_Secretary" name="Commerce_Secretary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Commerce Secretary</span></h2>

      <p>Hoover was touted as a possible <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party presidential candidate in 1920, but he announced his support for <a href="../../wp/w/Warren_G._Harding.htm" title="Warren G. Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, and in 1921, Hoover became Secretary of Commerce. As <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of Commerce, Hoover became one of the most visible men in the country, often overshadowing Presidents Harding and <a href="../../wp/c/Calvin_Coolidge.htm" title="Calvin Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. As secretary and as President, Hoover revolutionized the relations between business and government. Rejecting the adversarial stance of <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/William_Howard_Taft.htm" title="William Howard Taft">Taft</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Wilson</a>, he sought to make the Commerce Department a powerful service organization, empowered to forge cooperative voluntary partnerships between government and business. This philosophy is often called &quot;associationalism.&quot;<p>Many of Hoover&#39;s efforts as Commerce Secretary centered on the elimination of waste and the increase of efficiency in business and industry. This included such things as reducing labor losses from trade disputes and seasonal fluctuations, reducing industrial losses from accident and injury, and reducing the amount of crude oil spilled during extraction and shipping. One major achievement was to promote progressive ideals in the areas of standardization products and designs. He energetically promoted international trade by opening offices overseas that gave advice and practical help to businessmen. He was especially eager to promote <a href="../../wp/c/Cinema_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a> films overseas. [Hart 1998] His &quot;Own Your Own Home&quot; campaign was a collaboration with organizations working to promote ownership of single-family dwellings, including the Better Houses in America movement, the Architects&#39; Small House Service Bureau, and the Home Modernizing Bureau. He worked with bankers and the savings and loan industry to promote the new long term home mortgage, which dramatically stimulated home construction.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Among Hoover&#39;s other successes were the radio conferences, which played a key role in the early organization, development and regulation of radio broadcasting. Hoover played a key role in major projects for navigation, irrigation of dry lands, electrical power, and flood control. As the new air transport industry developed, Hoover held a conference on aviation to promote codes and regulations. He became president of the American Child Health Organization, and he raised private funds to promote health education in schools and communities.<p>In the spring of 1927, the <!--del_lnk--> Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 broke the banks and levees of the Mississippi River. The governors of six states along the Mississippi asked for Herbert Hoover in the emergency, so President Coolidge sent Hoover to mobilize state and local authorities, militia, army engineers, Coast Guard, and the <!--del_lnk--> American Red Cross. He set up health units, with a grant from the <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Foundation, to work in the flooded regions for a year. These workers stamped out <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pellagra.htm" title="Pellagra">pellagra</a> and <!--del_lnk--> typhoid fever from many areas.

      <p>In 1928, when President Coolidge declined to run for a second term of office, Herbert Hoover became the leading <!--del_lnk--> Republican candidate. Hoover&rsquo;s reputation, experience, and public popularity coalesced to give him the nomination. He campaigned against <!--del_lnk--> Al Smith on the basis of efficiency and prosperity. Although Smith was the target of anti-Catholicism from the Baptist and Lutheran communities, Hoover avoided the religious issue. (Quakers were themselves under attack as pacifists.) He supported <!--del_lnk--> prohibition tentatively (calling it a &quot;noble experiment&quot;). Historians agree that Hoover&#39;s national reputation and the booming economy, combined with the deep splits in the Democratic party over religion and prohibition, guaranteed his landslide victory.<p>On poverty he promised: &quot;We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.&quot; Within months, the <!--del_lnk--> Stock Market Crash of 1929 occurred, and the nation&#39;s economy spiraled downward into what became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression.<p><a id="Presidency_1929-1933" name="Presidency_1929-1933"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency 1929-1933</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Policies" name="Policies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Policies</span></h3>
      <p>Even if the Hoover presidency has a negative imprint on it, it must be noted that there were some important reforms under the Hoover administration.<p>The President expanded <!--del_lnk--> civil service coverage, cancelled private oil leases on government lands and led the way for the prosecution of gangster <!--del_lnk--> Al Capone. He appointed a commission which set aside 3 million acres (12,000 km&sup2;) of <!--del_lnk--> national parks and 2.3 million acres (9,000 km&sup2;) of national forests; advocated tax reduction for low-income Americans (not enacted); doubled the numbers of veteran hospital facilities; negotiated a treaty on <!--del_lnk--> St. Lawrence Seaway (which failed in the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Senate); wrote a Children&#39;s Charter that advocated protection of every child regardless of race or gender; built the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Bay Bridge; created an antitrust division in the <!--del_lnk--> Justice Department; required air mail carriers to improve service; proposed federal loans for urban slum clearances (not enacted); organized the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Bureau of Prisons; reorganized the <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Indian Affairs; proposed a federal <!--del_lnk--> Department of Education (not enacted); advocated fifty-dollar-per-month pensions for Americans over 65 (not enacted); chaired <!--del_lnk--> White House conferences on child health, protection, homebuilding and homeownership; and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Norris-La Guardia Act that limited judicial intervention in labor disputes.<p>Hoover&#39;s humanitarian and Quaker reputation&mdash;along with a <!--del_lnk--> Native American vice president&mdash;gave special meaning to his Indian policies. His Quaker upbringing influenced his views that Native Americans needed to achieve economic self-sufficiency. As President, he appointed Charles J. Rhoads as commissioner of Indian affairs. Hoover supported Rhoads&#39; commitment to Indian assimilation and sought to minimize the federal role in Indian affairs. His goal was to have Indians acting as individuals (not as tribes) and assume the responsibilities of citizenship which had been granted with the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Citizenship Act of 1924.<p>In the foreign arena, Hoover began formulating what would later become Roosevelt&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Good Neighbour policy by withdrawing American troops from <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>; he also proposed an arms embargo on <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and a one-third reduction of the world&#39;s naval power, which was called the <!--del_lnk--> Hoover Plan. The <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt Corollary ceased being part of U.S. foreign policy. He and Secretary of State <!--del_lnk--> Henry Stimson outlined the <!--del_lnk--> Hoover-Stimson Doctrine that said the United States would not recognize territories gained by force.<p><a id="Great_Depression" name="Great_Depression"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Great Depression</span></h3>

      <p>The economy was put to the test with the onset of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression in the United States in 1929. It is not accurate, as was routinely claimed by his Democratic opponents, that Hoover &quot;did nothing&quot; in the face of the crisis, nor that he was a believer in <!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire policies. He explicitly denounced laissez-faire in his 1922 book <i>American Individualism</i>, took an active pro-regulation stance as Commerce Secretary, and saw tariff and agricultural support bills through Congress. In his memoirs he recalled his rejection of Treasury Secretary Mellon&#39;s suggested &quot;leave-it-alone&quot; approach. However, Hoover opposed direct relief from the federal government, seeking instead to organize voluntary measures and encourage state and local government responses. Except for accelerating public works expenditures, Hoover largely shunned legislative relief proposals until late in his term. While his efforts were small in comparison to that of the Roosevelt administration, they exceeded that of any federal administration before him.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Soon after the stock market crash, Hoover summoned industrialists to the White House and secured promises to maintain wages. Henry Ford even agreed to increase workers&#39; daily pay from six to seven dollars. From the nation&#39;s utilities, Hoover won commitments of $1.8 billion in new construction and repairs for 1930. Railroad executives made a similar pledge. Organized labor agreed to withdraw its latest wage demands. The President ordered federal departments to speed up construction projects. He contacted all forty-eight state governors to make a similar appeal for expanded public works. He went to Congress with a $160 million tax cut, coupled with a doubling of resources for public buildings and dams, highways and harbors. He appointed a <!--del_lnk--> Federal Farm Board that tried to raise farm prices.<p>Praise for the President&#39;s intervention was widespread. &quot;No one in his place could have done more,&quot; concluded the <i>New York Times</i> in the spring of 1930. &quot;Very few of his predecessors could have done as much.&quot; In February, Hoover announced&mdash;prematurely&mdash;that the preliminary shock had passed and that employment was on the mend.<p>Together government and business actually spent more in the first half of 1930 than the previous year. Yet frightened consumers cut back their expenditures by ten percent. A severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland beginning in the summer of 1930. The combination of these factors caused a downward spiral, as earning fell, smaller banks collapsed, and mortgages went unpaid. Hoover&#39;s hold-the-line policy in wages lasted little more than a year. Unemployment soared from five million in 1930 to over eleven million in 1931. A sharp recession had become the Great Depression.<p>In 1930, Hoover signed the <!--del_lnk--> Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs on over 20,000 dutiable items, despite the protests of economists. Major trading partners, like Canada, immediately retaliated. The tariff, combined with the 1932 Revenue Act, which hiked taxes and fees across the board, is often blamed for deepening the depression, and are considered by some to be Hoover&#39;s biggest political blunders. Moreover, the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Reserve System&#39;s tightening of the money supply (for fear of inflation) is regarded by <!--del_lnk--> Milton Friedman and most modern economists as a mistaken strategy, given the situation. Hoover&#39;s stance on the economy was based on <!--del_lnk--> volunteerism. From before his entry to the presidency, he was among the greatest proponents of the concept that public-private cooperation was the way to achieve high long-term growth. Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important American values. Though he was not averse to taking action which he considered was in the public good, such as regulating radio broadcasting and aviation, he preferred a voluntary, non-government approach.<p>In June 1931, to deal with a very serious banking collapse in Vienna that threatened to cause a worldwide financial meltdown, Hoover issued the <!--del_lnk--> Hoover Moratorium that called for a one-year halt in <!--del_lnk--> reparations payments by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and in the payment of Allied war debts to the United States. The Hoover Moratorium had the effect of temporarily stopping the banking collapse in Europe. In June 1932, a conference canceled all reparations payments by Germany.<p>The following is an outline of other actions Hoover took to try to help end the Depression through government taxing and spending:<ol>
       <li>Signed the <!--del_lnk--> Emergency Relief and Construction Act, the nation&#39;s first Federal <!--del_lnk--> unemployment assistance.<li>Increased public works spending. Some of Hoover&#39;s efforts to stimulate the economy through public works are as follows: <ol>
         <li>Asked Congress for a $400 million increase in the Federal Building Program<li>Directed the <!--del_lnk--> Department of Commerce to establish a Division of Public Construction in December 1929<li>Increased subsidies for ship construction through the Federal Shipping Board<li>Urged the state governors to also increase their <!--del_lnk--> public works spending, though many failed to take any action.</ol>
       <li>Signed the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Home Loan Bank Act establishing the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Home Loan Bank system to assist citizens in obtaining financing to purchase a home.<li>Increased subsidies to the nation&#39;s struggling farmers with the <!--del_lnk--> Agricultural Marketing Act; but with only limited impact.<li>Established the President&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Emergency Relief Organization to coordinate local private relief efforts resulting in over 3,000 relief committees across the U.S.<li>Authorized the repatriation to Mexico of 1-2 million people living in barrios throughout California, Texas and Michigan, 60% of whom were U.S. citizens of Mexican-descent, in an effort to ease unemployment.<li>Urged bankers to form the <!--del_lnk--> National Credit Corporation to assist banks in financial trouble and protect depositors&#39; money.<li>Actively encouraged businesses to maintain high wages during the Depression, in line with the philosophy, called <!--del_lnk--> Fordism, that high wages create prosperity. Most corporations maintained their workers&#39; wages early in the Depression in the hope that more money into the pockets of consumers would end the economic downturn.<li>Signed the <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction Finance Act. This act established the <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which made loans to the states for public works and unemployment relief. In addition, the corporation made loans to banks, railroads and agriculture credit organizations.<li>Raised tariffs. After hearings held by the <!--del_lnk--> House Ways and Means Committee generated more than 20,000 pages of testimony regarding tariff protection, Congress responded with legislation that Hoover signed despite some misgivings. Instead of protecting American jobs, the <!--del_lnk--> Smoot-Hawley tariff is widely blamed for setting off a worldwide trade war which only worsened the country&#39;s (and the world&#39;s) economic ills.</ol>

      <p>In order to pay for these and other government programs, Hoover agreed to one of the largest tax increases in American history. The <!--del_lnk--> Revenue Act of 1932 raised <!--del_lnk--> income tax on the highest incomes from 25% to 63%. The <!--del_lnk--> estate tax was doubled and <!--del_lnk--> corporate taxes were raised by almost 15%. Also, a &quot;check tax&quot; was included that placed a 2-cent tax (over 30 cents in today&#39;s dollars) on all bank checks. Economists William D. Lastrapes and George Selgin,, conclude that the check tax was &quot;an important contributing factor to that period&#39;s severe monetary contraction.&quot; Hoover also encouraged Congress to investigate the <!--del_lnk--> New York Stock Exchange, and this pressure resulted in various reforms.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>For this reason, years later <!--del_lnk--> libertarians argued that Hoover&#39;s economics were statist. <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> blasted the Republican incumbent for spending and taxing too much, increasing national debt, raising tariffs and blocking trade, as well as placing millions on the dole of the government. Roosevelt attacked Hoover for &quot;reckless and extravagant&quot; spending, of thinking &quot;that we ought to centre control of everything in Washington as rapidly as possible,&quot; and of leading &quot;the greatest spending administration in peacetime in all of history.&quot; Roosevelt&#39;s running mate, <!--del_lnk--> John Nance Garner, accused the Republican of &quot;leading the country down the path of socialism&quot;.<p>These policies pale beside the more drastic steps taken later as part of the <!--del_lnk--> New Deal. Hoover&#39;s opponents charge that his policies came too little, and too late, and did not work. Even as he asked Congress for legislation, he reiterated his view that while people must not suffer from hunger and cold, caring for them must be primarily a local and voluntary responsibility.<p>Even so, New Dealer <!--del_lnk--> Rexford Tugwell later remarked that although no one would say so at the time, &quot;practically the whole New Deal was extrapolated from programs that Hoover started.&quot;<p>Unemployment rose to 24.9% by the end of Hoover&#39;s presidency in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression.<p><a name="1932_campaign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">1932 campaign</span></h2>

      <p>Hoover was nominated by the Republicans for a second term. In his nine major radio addresses Hoover primarily defended his administration and his philosophy. He realized he would lose. The apologia approach did not allow Hoover to refute Franklin Roosevelt&#39;s charge that he was personally responsible for the depression.<p><a id="Bonus_Army" name="Bonus_Army"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bonus Army</span></h3>

      <p>Thousands of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> <!--del_lnk--> veterans and their families demonstrated and camped out in Washington, D.C., during June 1932, calling for immediate payment of a bonus that had been promised by the <!--del_lnk--> Adjusted Service Certificate Law for payment in 1924. Although offered money by <!--del_lnk--> Congress to return home, some members of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bonus army&quot; remained. Washington police attempted to remove the demonstrators from their camp, but they were unsuccessful and the conflict grew. Hoover sent <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army forces led by General <!--del_lnk--> Douglas MacArthur and aided by junior officers <a href="../../wp/d/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.htm" title="Dwight D.

      <p>Based on Hoover&#39;s previous experience with <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> at the end of World War I, in the winter of 1946 - 47 President <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_S._Truman.htm" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> selected Hoover to tour Germany in order to ascertain the food status of the occupied nation. Hoover toured what was to become <!--del_lnk--> West Germany in Field Marshall <!--del_lnk--> Herman Goering&#39;s old train coach and produced <!--del_lnk--> a number of reports sharply critical of U.S. occupation policy. The economy of Germany had &quot;sunk to the lowest level in a hundred years&quot;. As the Cold War deepened, Hoover expressed reservations about some of the activities of the American Friends Service Committee, which he previously had strongly supported.<p>On Hoover&rsquo;s initiative, a school meals program in the U.S. and British occupation zones of Germany was begun on 14 April 1947. The program served 3.5 million children ages 6 through 18.
