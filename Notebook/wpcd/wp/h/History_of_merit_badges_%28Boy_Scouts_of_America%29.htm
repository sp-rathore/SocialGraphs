      <p>The <b>history of merit badges in the Boy Scouts of America</b> (BSA) has been tracked by categorizing them into a series of <i>merit badge types</i>. In addition to the <!--del_lnk--> Boy Scouts of America, many other <a href="../../wp/s/Scouting.htm" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> and Scouting-like organizations around the world, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pathfinders, <!--del_lnk--> Baden-Powell Scouts and <!--del_lnk--> Royal Rangers, issue merit badges or their equivalent; though they are sometimes called <i>honours</i> or <i>proficiency badges</i>. Other organizations, such as <!--del_lnk--> fire brigades, issue badges or awards that they refer to as <i>merit badges</i>, but that are in some respects different from the badges awarded by the BSA.<p><!--del_lnk--> Merit badges have been an integral part of the Scouting program since the start of the movement in the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1907. Scouting came to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> in 1910; the BSA quickly issued an initial list of just 14 merit badges, but did not produce or award them. In 1911, the BSA manufactured the first official 57 merit badges and began awarding them. The number of badges available has been as high as 140 and, as of 2006, is 121. Merit badge types are identifiable by the cloth and manufacturing process used to make them. The classification of badges into types came about as a way for <!--del_lnk--> collectors to categorize and classify their collections. Merit badge collectors often <!--del_lnk--> collect other Scouting memorabilia as well.<p>

</script><a id="Purpose_of_merit_badges" name="Purpose_of_merit_badges"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Purpose of merit badges</span></h2>
      <p>Merit badges exist to encourage Scouts to explore areas that interest them and to teach them valuable skills in <!--del_lnk--> Scoutcraft. The award of merit badges sometimes leads to careers and lifelong hobbies. Scouts earn a merit badge by satisfying specified criteria; a <!--del_lnk--> Court of Honour is then held to present the badge. Scouts can earn badges at any point in their Scouting career, although this was not always the case &mdash; in the 1960s, Scouts first had to earn the rank of Second Class Scout before being allowed to work on and earn badges. The higher ranks of Star, Life Scout and <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle_Scout_%2528Boy_Scouts_of_America%2529.htm" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle</a> require merit badges be earned. Certain badges are mandatory to receive these higher ranks. For a few years during the 1980s and 90s, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> First Aid&quot; merit badge was a requirement for the First Class Scout rank. Other mandatory badges include &quot;Citizenship in the Community&quot; and &quot;Environmental Science&quot; (see <!--del_lnk--> full list). The number of merit badges required for each of these higher ranks has varied historically, as has the ratio of mandatory merit badges and non-mandatory badges for those ranks. As of 2005, Scouts must earn a total of 21 merit badges for the Eagle Scout rank, 12 of which must be from the mandatory list. Once Scouts attain the Eagle rank, they can earn <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle_Scout_%2528Boy_Scouts_of_America%2529.htm" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Palms</a>, a core requirement of which is earning more merit badges.<p><a id="Badge_history" name="Badge_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Badge history</span></h2>
      <p>The BSA changes the design, name, and availability of merit badges depending on various factors such as their popularity, shifts in the focus of the Scouting program, and changes in society. Of the original 57 merit badges from 1911, only 11 are still available that also still have the same basic design motif (<a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">Architecture</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">Art</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Athletics_%2528track_and_field%2529.htm" title="Athletics (track and field)">Athletics</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">Chemistry</a>, <!--del_lnk--> First Aid, <!--del_lnk--> Lifesaving, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">Music</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Plumbing, <!--del_lnk--> Public Health, <!--del_lnk--> Scholarship, and <!--del_lnk--> Surveying). Of those 11, only five were made available in each &quot;generation&quot; of the 10 merit badge types (these are Architecture, Art, Chemistry, Plumbing, and Public Health). The remaining six were not reproduced in a short lived &quot;generation&quot; of merit badges, <a href="#Type_I" title="">Type I</a>.<p>Examples of merit badge change due to the degree of popularity/interest in a subject include &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Interpreting&quot;, which only existed from 1911-1952, when it was dropped; and &quot;<a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">Genealogy</a>&quot; which was added in 1972 when great interest in that subject arose.<p>A good example of merit badges reflecting changes in the focus of the Scouting program is &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Civics&quot;, which was originally the only citizenship-related merit badge. In 1952, the BSA placed more emphasis on this area by splitting &quot;Civics&quot; into four separate badges, which were in turn modified several times. Since 1991, the badges in this group are &quot;Citizenship in the Community&quot;, &quot;Citizenship in the Nation&quot;, &quot;Citizenship in the World&quot;, and &quot;Family Life&quot;, all of which are currently on the mandatory list for Eagle Scout.<p>The &quot;First Aid to Animals&quot; and &quot;Plant Science&quot; merit badges have both evolved due to societal changes. &quot;First Aid to Animals&quot; was one of the original merit badges in 1911 but was dropped because of its agricultural focus in 1972. It was resurrected as &quot;Veterinary Science&quot; in 1973 with a focus on small pet-type animals vs. farm animals. It was renamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Veterinary Medicine&quot; in 1995. Merging of merit badges can be seen in &quot;Plant Science&quot;, into which all crop growing merit badges were merged in 1972 because America had changed from an <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agrarian</a> society into and an <!--del_lnk--> urban/<!--del_lnk--> suburban society since the founding of the BSA.<p>Sometimes the design of or requirements for a merit badge seem to change for no apparent reason. An example of this is &quot;Personal Health&quot;, which was an original 1911 merit badge with a heart motif. In 1952 it became &quot;Personal Fitness&quot;. In 1969 it was redesigned, displaying a youth in gym gear doing what looks like a jumping jack exercise. Currently, the BSA is &quot;field testing&quot; a Hunting merit badge, but it has not yet been released on a national basis.<p>The merit badges on the mandatory list for Eagle rank have changed several times; however, &quot;First Aid&quot; is the only merit badge that has <i>always</i> been on the mandatory list for Eagle. In 1969, the BSA began manufacturing those merit badges that are required in order to obtain the rank of Eagle Scout with a silver border vice the green border.<p><a id="Types_of_merit_badges" name="Types_of_merit_badges"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types of merit badges</span></h2>
      <p>As of 2005 and as described in <i>Merit Badge Field Guide</i>, there are 10 major types of merit badges: Types A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, and J.<p><a id="Type_A" name="Type_A"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Type A</span></h3>

Type A badges came from the manufacturer without the crease. Some people removed excess cloth before creasing them to make the merit badge round on the merit badge sash. These <i>cut&ndash;down</i> squares look similar to a Type C, but usually end up with straighter, yet uneven edges; whereas unaltered Type B, C, D, and E badges have a smooth circular edge.

Most Type C badges were not made after 1942 (see Type D section below); only the <!--del_lnk--> Air Scout <i>aviation blues</i>, which came in four designs, were made in Type C from 1942&ndash;46.

Consequently, the BSA reverted to the Type H design for an additional seven years. Since Type I was never fully adopted, not all merit badges appear in Type I. In fact, only 30 varieties appear as Type I. So while not that old, they are also not that common. Another oddity is that some Type I badges were made in two sizes: 38 mm and 42 mm. Two different sizes of merit badges can not be lined up neatly on the same sash. Some merit badges that did appear as Type I only appear in 38 mm, some as only 42 mm, and some appeared in both sizes.

      <p><a id="Errors_vs_variations" name="Errors_vs_variations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Errors vs variations</span></h2>
      <p>The visual appearance of a merit badge may alter due to several reasons. A &quot;variation&quot; is a minor change, whether intentional or not. A &quot;manufacturing error&quot; is a mistake or significant deviation from the BSA-approved badge design during production. A &quot;design error&quot; is when a badge is manufactured the way it was designed, but the design had a significant flaw.<p><a id="Specimen_variations" name="Specimen_variations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Specimen variations</span></h3>
      <p>Variations do not appreciably alter the badge&#39;s appearance or design. Two types of variations include positional changes and stitching changes. These are often caused by <i>manufacturing variations</i> and not classified separately. However, some variations have attained notoriety, such as the <i>waffle weave</i> variation found among Type C badges and the large people vs. slender people variations among Family Life badges. Such variations were very common up until the 1940s and still occur, though not as often. Collectors find these variations interesting and collect such badges.<p>Examples of positional shifts among the objects comprising the motif of a merit badge include changes in the precise positioning of the tent and the mountains among &quot;Camping&quot; Type H merit badges. Another example is the shift among the Scout, the mountains, and the clouds in Hiking Type H merit badges.<p>Stitch patterns are not always consistent. There are three known stitching variations among the Type C Personal Health merit badges: &quot;vertical heart&quot;, &quot;horizontal heart&quot;, and &quot;split heart&quot;; the variation creates the appearance of a split down the middle of the heart. A similar error appears in both Type H and Type J Citizenship in the Nation badges, where colors vary in order from red, white, and blue to blue, white, and red; the reasons for this are unknown. Large and small bell varieties also exist. <!--del_lnk--> Emergency Preparedness was made with a red cross from 1972 until 1979, when it was replaced with a green cross in 1980. This change was intentionally made. However, the colour of the green is not consistent; even today, it varies between dark green, medium green, light green, and yellow green.<p><a id="Manufacturing_errors" name="Manufacturing_errors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Manufacturing errors</span></h3>
      <p>Genuine manufacturing errors occur from time to time. Some <!--del_lnk--> Atomic Energy Type G badges were made without a nucleus. The only time a merit badge was made without a silver, green, or blue (<i>aviation blues</i> only) border was in 1987 when Whitewater Type H badges were made with a black border. Dairying appears in Type H with the cheese in both orange and burgundy. It is supposed to be orange.<p>There have been at least three Type H badges made with little or no plastic; called <i>plasticizing</i> or <i>Type G</i> errors: <!--del_lnk--> American Cultures, Colonial Philadelphia, and <!--del_lnk--> Journalism. The &quot;Colonial Philadelphia&quot; patch was only available from 1975 until 1976 to Scouts in the Philadelphia region and could only be used for Eagle Palms.<p>First Aid to Animals (FATA) Type H was made in error with a silver border in 1972. This is one of the most famous errors. It has a slight blue tint in the plastic back (see photos). It is believed that only about 100 of these were made and that only about 50 have survived to this day. Counterfeit versions of this badge error also exist. &quot;<a href="../../wp/b/Beekeeping.htm" title="Beekeeping">Beekeeping</a>&quot; Type G is also known in silver border error. Neither one has ever been a required merit badge.<p><a id="Design_errors" name="Design_errors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Design errors</span></h3>
      <p>The known design errors are all from the early years. &quot;Beekeeping&quot; was made from 1914&ndash;1938 with only four legs instead of six simply because of human design error. &quot;Beekeeping&quot; also exists in thick and thin bodies in Type C. &quot;Insect Life&quot; was first made, from 1923&ndash;1924, with a spider on it. Since a spider is an <!--del_lnk--> arachnid, not an insect, the design was changed to an <a href="../../wp/a/Aphid.htm" title="Aphid">aphid</a> the following year. As this particular merit badge specimen was only issued for one year, it is extremely rare.<p><a id="Spoof_merit_badges" name="Spoof_merit_badges"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Spoof merit badges</span></h2>
      <p><i><!--del_lnk--> Spoof</i> merit badges are created and sold by various third-parties. These are not fakes of genuine merit badges, though they are the same size and have an outer green ring. To the unsuspecting buyer, these parodies appear to be real. Dozens of varieties exist, including badges for <!--del_lnk--> snoring, <!--del_lnk--> computer viruses, <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> in the <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>, <!--del_lnk--> snow art, <!--del_lnk--> text messaging, and <!--del_lnk--> whining. A proposal for a <!--del_lnk--> duct tape merit badge has gathered widespread support from humorists. A number of spoof merit badges could possibly be legitimate if the BSA ever authorized it; examples of this group include spoof badges for <!--del_lnk--> scuba diving and <!--del_lnk--> surfing.<p>Spoofs of other BSA badges also exist, including those denoting training status and troop positions. Some of the better-known examples are: &quot;Untrained&quot;, &quot;Underpaid&quot;, &quot;Retired&quot;, &quot;Old Geezer&quot;, &quot;Old Goat Patrol&quot;, and &quot;Potty Trained&quot;. All spoof badges are unofficial and not recognized by the BSA.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_merit_badges_%28Boy_Scouts_of_America%29&quot;</div>
