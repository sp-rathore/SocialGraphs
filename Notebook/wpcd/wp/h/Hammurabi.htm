      <p>Hammurabi was one of the <!--del_lnk--> first dynasty kings of the <!--del_lnk--> city-state of Babylon, and inherited the throne from his father, <!--del_lnk--> Sin-muballit, in 1792 BC. Babylon was one of the many ancient city-states that dotted the Mesopotamian plain and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land.Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East. The kings who came before Hammurabi had begun to consolidate rule of central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the city-states of <!--del_lnk--> Borsippa, <!--del_lnk--> Kish, and <!--del_lnk--> Sippar. Thus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex geopolitical situation, surrounded by the more powerful kingdoms of <!--del_lnk--> Shamshi-Adad, <!--del_lnk--> Larsa, <!--del_lnk--> Eshnunna, and <!--del_lnk--> Elam.<p>The first few decades of Hammurabi&#39;s reign were relatively peaceful, although the death of <!--del_lnk--> Shamshi-Adad I led to the fragmentation of his northern Semitic empire, and Babylon became comparatively stronger as a result. Hammurabi used this time to undertake a series of public works, including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes, and expanding the temples. In 1766 BC, the powerful kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Elam, which straddled important trade routes across the <!--del_lnk--> Zagros Mountains, invaded the Mesopotamian plain. With allies among the plain states, Elam attacked and destroyed the empire of <!--del_lnk--> Eshnunna, destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time. In order to consolidate its position, Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi&#39;s Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Larsa. Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites, although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort. Angered by Larsa&#39;s failure to come to his aid, Hammurabi turned on that southern power, thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by 1763 BC.<p>As Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest. Continuing his expansion, Hammurabi turned his attention northward, quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna. Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states, including Babylon&#39;s former ally <!--del_lnk--> Mari, although it is possible that the &#39;conquest&#39; of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict. In just a few short years, Hammurabi had succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule. Of the major city-states in the region, only <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo and <!--del_lnk--> Qatna to the west in Syria maintained their independence.<p>Vast numbers of contract <!--del_lnk--> tablets, dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors, have been discovered, as well as 55 of his own letters. These letters give a glimpse into the daily trials of ruling an empire, from dealing with floods and mandating changes to a flawed calendar, to taking care of Babylon&#39;s massive herds of livestock. Hammurabi died and passed the reigns of the empire on to his son <!--del_lnk--> Samsu-Iluna in 1750 BC.<p>

      <p>Hammurabi is perhaps best known for the <!--del_lnk--> promulgation of a new code of <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian law &ndash; the <a href="../../wp/c/Code_of_Hammurabi.htm" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a>. This was written on a <!--del_lnk--> stele, a large stone monument, and placed in a public place so that all could see it, although it is thought that few were <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literate</a>. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, <!--del_lnk--> Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 and is now in the <!--del_lnk--> Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian, the daily language of Babylon, and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>The structure of the code is very specific, with each offense receiving a specified punishment. The punishments tended to be harsh by modern standards, with many offenses resulting in death, disfigurement, or the use of the &quot;Eye for eye, tooth for tooth philosophy&quot;. While the penalties of his laws may seem cruel to modern readers, the fact that he not only put into writing the laws of his kingdom, but attempted to make them a systematic whole, is considered an important step forward in the evolution of <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a>. Putting the laws into writing was important in itself because it suggested that the laws were immutable and above the power of any earthly king to change. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of <!--del_lnk--> presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. However, there is no provision for extenuating circumstances to alter the prescribed punishment.<p>A carving at the top of the stele portrays Hammurabi receiving the laws from the god <!--del_lnk--> Shamash, and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by the gods of his people to bring the laws to them. Parallels to this divine inspiration for laws can be seen in the laws created by <!--del_lnk--> Moses for the ancient Hebrews. Similar codes of law were created in several nearby civilizations, including the earlier Babylonian example of <!--del_lnk--> Ur-Nammu&#39;s code and the later <!--del_lnk--> Hittite code of laws.<p><a id="Legacy_and_depictions" name="Legacy_and_depictions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy and depictions</span></h2>
      <p>Under the rules of Hammurabi&#39;s successors, the Babylonian Empire was weakened by military pressure from the <!--del_lnk--> Hittites, who sacked Babylon around 1600. However it was the <!--del_lnk--> Kassites who eventually conquered Babylon and ruled Mesopotamia for 400 years, adopting parts of the Babylonian culture, including Hammurabi&#39;s code of laws.<p>Because of Hammurabi&#39;s reputation as a lawgiver, his depiction can be found in several U.S. government buildings. Hammurabi is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in <!--del_lnk--> marble <!--del_lnk--> bas-reliefs in the <!--del_lnk--> chamber of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> United States Capitol. An image of Hammurabi receiving the <a href="../../wp/c/Code_of_Hammurabi.htm" title="Code of Hammurabi">Code of Hammurabi</a> from the Babylonian <!--del_lnk--> sun god (probably <!--del_lnk--> Shamash) is depicted on the <!--del_lnk--> frieze on the south wall of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Supreme Court building.<div class="thumb tright">
