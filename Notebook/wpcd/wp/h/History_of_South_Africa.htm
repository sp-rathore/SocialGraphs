      <p>The <b>history of South Africa</b> is viewed differently by various scholars and by its various population groups because <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> is a <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Multiculturalism">multicultural</a> country. The researchers&#39; views heavily influence their perception of South African history.(See the <a href="../../wp/d/Demographics_of_South_Africa.htm" title="Demographics of South Africa">demographics of South Africa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> culture of South Africa.)<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Khoisan peoples are the aboriginal people of the region who have lived there for millennia. Black African South Africans, trace their origins to the <a href="../../wp/a/African_Great_Lakes.htm" title="African Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region of Africa. <!--del_lnk--> Whites in South Africa, descendants of later European migrations, regard themselves as products of South Africa no less than their fellow citizens, as do South Africa&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Coloureds, <!--del_lnk--> Indians, Asians and <!--del_lnk--> Jews.<p>

      <p>There are two divergent ways in which information about the past can be conveyed: The definition of &quot;history&quot; means the study of the past based almost exclusively on written records because it is &quot;usually distinguished from <!--del_lnk--> prehistory by the widespread adoption of writing in the area under study&quot; (see <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">History</a> article.) Prehistory, as studied in <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>, &quot;is concerned with all institutions of all societies, but in practice anthropologists have tended to concentrate on the seemingly more &quot;traditional&quot; institutions, usages, and customs of non-Western, often tribal, societies&quot; (see <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">Anthropology</a> article.)<p><a id="Modern_history_of_South_Africa" name="Modern_history_of_South_Africa"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern history of South Africa</span></h3>
      <p>European explorers &quot;discovered&quot; South Africa as a direct result of European countries&#39; rivalry with each other for dominance and the subsequent need for wealth which lead to the efforts to &quot;discover&quot; (by exploration) sea routes to <!--del_lnk--> trade with Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> Far East during the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Discovery. Far-off places, whether they became colonies or not, were regarded as sources for <!--del_lnk--> raw materials to be processed or enjoyed by Europeans.<p>Over time, for example, be it jewels, spices and textiles from India, foods and silver from the Americas; <!--del_lnk--> wool from Australia; fruits, gold, diamonds, coal, uranium, or iron from South Africa; wood and minerals from Africa - obtained as the result of voyages of discovery, these resources were located and shipped in huge quantities to Europe over the centuries, generating immense wealth in helping countries to move to become even more sophisticated as they developed into newly industrialized countries like Great Britain, Germany and France. In the 1800s South Africa would become the world&#39;s leading producer of gold and diamonds as well as many other resources, which made it the envy and the play-thing of stronger imperial powers to the North.<p>Once the route around the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope, located at the southern-most tip of Africa in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, had been discovered by a series of &quot;discoverers&quot; it has remained of key importance to global trade that is dependent on the free passage of ships around the world. This is related to another principle, that wealthy nations are usually great maritime naval powers, and the use of <!--del_lnk--> navies is tied in with protecting those great nations&#39; trade and their military strength both of which result in <!--del_lnk--> geostrategic dominance. Essentially, the power that has the mightiest navy and prevails on the high seas becomes the world&#39;s greatest power which is something nations have known for a long time, hence their commercial and naval rivalry on the high seas.<p>It is in this context that the position of the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, and Southern Africa should be appreciated because in the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Hemisphere, only South Africa, the southern end of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> have this key strategic position. In addition, from Europe - and also from the east coasts of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and South America (Brazil, Argentina), the route around South Africa&#39;s Cape is the shortest to Asia.<p>All the modern natives have sought to ensure that they either control these three southern &quot;gateways&quot; or that they remain open at all times to the free flow of shipping and it is why South Africa&#39;s strategic position is important in a <!--del_lnk--> geopolitical sense. It is the reason that the British knocked out the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and French navies and influence not just in Southern Africa, but all over the world, and asserted their will and continued this policy against Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia. Since World War II it has been the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy that has assumed the role of the world&#39;s most dominant fleet protecting America&#39; trade and the free flow of goods in <!--del_lnk--> the global economy and South Africa&#39;s place in this scheme of things is no less significant than it was in the times of the Dutch who established South Africa&#39;s early economy and the British who developed it into a more sophisticated modern one.<p>It should be noted that the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> did not exist for most of history. It was only completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1869, so that all shipping back and forth from Europe to Asia, Arabia, and to most of Africa had and has to be done by the long routes across the seas around South Africa&#39;s Cape. In addition, even after the Suez Canal&#39;s completion and modernization, it cannot accommodate larger vessels including many warships, tankers, and cargo vessels. Thus the Cape of Good Hope route remains one of the most important and highly desirable routes for free shipping when some of the world&#39;s other global <!--del_lnk--> choke points are closed off or in a state of turmoil such as war.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> was viewed as too dangerous and inhospitable for European sailors, let alone settlers. The Cape was known as &quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Storms&quot; because it was so dangerous for sailing ships, and it was only by <!--del_lnk--> 1652 that the Dutch finally saw fit to set up a permanent station at the Cape of Good Hope (it was not even a colony, just a station to supply passing ships with fresh water and vegetables.) This &quot;supply depot&quot; that was set up by the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> developed into the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Colony over the next two hundred years.<p>The British had long known about the importance of the Cape as a route to and from the East and had their eyes on it from the time that one of their own explorers, Sir <a href="../../wp/f/Francis_Drake.htm" title="Francis Drake">Francis Drake</a> rounded the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope, in <!--del_lnk--> 1580 in his ship the <i>Golden Hind</i>.

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> seized the Cape Colony from the Dutch at the end of the 18th century because they feared French fleets would take control following <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>&#39;s victories over much of mainland Europe. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> invaded and occupied the Cape Colony in <!--del_lnk--> 1795 (&quot;The First Occupation&quot;) but relinquished control of the territory in 1803. However, British forces returned on <!--del_lnk--> January 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1806 and occupied the Cape once again (&quot;The Second Occupation&quot;). The territory was ceded to the UK in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 and was henceforth administered as the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Colony. It remained a British colony until incorporated into the independent <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa in 1910, now known as the Republic of South Africa.<p>The ever-expanding number of European settlers led to conflicts with the natives over the rights to <!--del_lnk--> land and <!--del_lnk--> farming, which caused numerous <!--del_lnk--> fatalities on both sides. Hostilities also emerged between the Dutch and the British, and many Dutch people packed up their <!--del_lnk--> ox-wagons and <i><!--del_lnk--> trekked</i> into the central <!--del_lnk--> Highveld in order to establish their own self-governing colonies.<p>The Dutch (by then known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Boers</i>) and the British went to war twice in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Boer Wars in the late 1800s, which ended in the defeat of the Boers and of their independent <!--del_lnk--> republics.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Cape Colony, Natal and the two Boer republics united in <!--del_lnk--> 1910 as the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa. The Boer republics did not grant Black people the <a href="../../wp/s/Suffrage.htm" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a>, and the rights of Black, <!--del_lnk--> Coloured, and <!--del_lnk--> Asian people continued to erode in the Union.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> National Party came to power (<!--del_lnk--> 1948), on a platform of racial discrimination which became known as <i><!--del_lnk--> apartheid</i>. As a rising tide of <!--del_lnk--> national liberation grew in the <!--del_lnk--> Third World receiving support, arms, and training from the newly dominant <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, South Africa&#39;s Blacks demanded freedom and political rights that white South Africa had not granted them. Instead, the <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaner-dominated government answered with increased <!--del_lnk--> Apartheid policies which then became deeply entrenched in South African society, despite continued resistance.<p>When <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth nations began to threaten South Africa with economic and political <!--del_lnk--> sanctions, white South Africa headed by Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> HF Verwoerd decided to leave the commonwealth, and chose to become a <!--del_lnk--> republic in <!--del_lnk--> 1961, with its own State President <!--del_lnk--> CR Swart. This was the first that there was a South African president in sixty years, since the days of the old Transvaal <!--del_lnk--> South African Republic when President <!--del_lnk--> Paul Kruger was exiled by the British in <!--del_lnk--> 1900.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> African National Congress offered the most active black-run opposition to apartheid, and after two decades of repression and increasing economic pressures, the government of <!--del_lnk--> F.W. de Klerk dismantled the apartheid system in <!--del_lnk--> 1992. The first <!--del_lnk--> fully-inclusive election, in which blacks from the entire South Africa could vote, took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1994, electing <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> as <!--del_lnk--> President.

About a million years ago, <i><!--del_lnk--> Homo erectus</i> had emerged and ranged well beyond Africa, leaving traces in Europe and in Asia. Somewhere around 100,000 years ago, modern man replaced the hominids. Although archaeologists continue to debate the details, <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> found near the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Klasies River in <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Cape Province indicate that <i>Homo sapiens</i> may have lived in South Africa as early as 90,000 years ago.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bushmen probably became the first modern people to migrate to the southern tip of the African <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continent</a>. Skilled <!--del_lnk--> hunter-gatherers and <!--del_lnk--> nomads, the Bushmen had great respect for the land, and their lifestyle had low <!--del_lnk--> environmental impact, allowing them to sustain their way of life for years without leaving much archaeological evidence. Other than a series of striking <!--del_lnk--> rock paintings, the Bushmen left few traces of their early culture. Attempts to analyse the existing samples by <!--del_lnk--> radiocarbon dating indicate that the Bushmen lived in the area of modern-day South Africa at least as early as 25,000 years ago, and possibly as early as 40,000 years ago. Small numbers of Bushmen still live in South Africa today, making their culture one of the oldest continuously existing in the world, along with that of the <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous Australians.<p><a id="Ancient_history" name="Ancient_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient history</span></h2>
      <p>Around 2,500 years ago <!--del_lnk--> Bantu peoples <!--del_lnk--> migrated into Southern Africa from the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River Delta</a>. The Bushmen and the Bantu lived mostly peacefully together, although since neither had any method of <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">writing</a>, researchers know little of this period outside of <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a> <!--del_lnk--> artefacts.<p>Beginning around 2,500 years ago, some Bushman groups acquired <!--del_lnk--> livestock from further north. Gradually, hunting and gathering gave way to <!--del_lnk--> herding as the dominant <!--del_lnk--> economic activity as the Bushmen tended to small <!--del_lnk--> herds of <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a> and <!--del_lnk--> oxen. The arrival of livestock introduced concepts of personal <!--del_lnk--> wealth and <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a>-<!--del_lnk--> ownership into Bushman society. Community structures solidified and expanded, and <!--del_lnk--> chieftaincies developed.<p>The pastoralist Bushmen, known as <!--del_lnk--> Khoikhoi (&quot;men of men&quot;), began to move further south, reaching as far as the <!--del_lnk--> cape now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Cape of Good Hope. Along the way they intermarried with the hunter-gatherer Bushmen, whom they referred to as <i>San</i>, to the point where drawing a clear line between the two groups became impossible (prompting the use of the term <i><!--del_lnk--> Khoisan</i>). Over time the Khoikhoi established themselves along the coast, while small groups of Bushmen continued to inhabit the interior.<p><a id="Bantu_expansion" name="Bantu_expansion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bantu expansion</span></h3>
      <p>At about this time, <!--del_lnk--> Bantu-speaking peoples also began arriving in South Africa. Originally from the <!--del_lnk--> Niger Delta area in <!--del_lnk--> west Africa, they had started to make their way south and eastwards in about <!--del_lnk--> 1000 BC, reaching present-day <!--del_lnk--> KwaZulu-Natal Province by <!--del_lnk--> 500 AD. The Bantu-speakers not only had <!--del_lnk--> domestic animals, but also practised agriculture, farming <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a> and other crops. They also displayed skill in working <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, and lived in settled villages. The Bantu arrived in South Africa in small waves rather than in one cohesive migration. Some groups, the <!--del_lnk--> ancestors of today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Nguni peoples (the <a href="../../wp/z/Zulu.htm" title="Zulu">Zulu</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Xhosa, <!--del_lnk--> Swazi, and <!--del_lnk--> Ndebele), preferred to live near the coast. Others, now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Sotho-Tswana peoples (<!--del_lnk--> Tswana, <!--del_lnk--> Pedi, and <!--del_lnk--> Basotho), settled in the Highveld, while today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Venda, <!--del_lnk--> Lemba, and <!--del_lnk--> Shangaan-<!--del_lnk--> Tsonga peoples made their homes in the northeastern areas of South Africa.<p>Bantu-speakers and Khoisan mixed, as evidenced by rock paintings showing the two different groups interacting. The type of contact remains unknown, although <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistic</a> proof of integration survives, as several <!--del_lnk--> Bantu languages (notably <!--del_lnk--> Xhosa and <!--del_lnk--> Zulu) incorporated the <!--del_lnk--> click consonant characteristic of earlier <!--del_lnk--> Khoisan languages.

      <p>Although the Portuguese basked in the nautical achievement of successfully navigating the cape, they showed little interest in <!--del_lnk--> colonization. The area&#39;s fierce weather and rocky shoreline posed a threat to their ships, and many of their attempts to trade with the local Khoikhoi ended in conflict. The Portuguese found the Mozambican coast more attractive, with appealing <!--del_lnk--> bays to use as waystations, <!--del_lnk--> prawns, and links with <!--del_lnk--> gold ore in the interior.<p>The Portuguese had little competition in the region until the late 16th century, when the <!--del_lnk--> English and <!--del_lnk--> Dutch began to challenge them along their <!--del_lnk--> trade routes. Stops at the continent&#39;s southern tip increased, and the cape became a regular stopover for <a href="../../wp/s/Scurvy.htm" title="Scurvy">scurvy</a>-ridden crews. In <!--del_lnk--> 1647, a Dutch vessel got wrecked in the present-day <!--del_lnk--> Table Bay at <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>. The marooned crew, the first Europeans to attempt settlement in the area, built a <!--del_lnk--> fort and stayed for a year until they were rescued. Shortly thereafter, the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East India Company (in the Dutch of the day: <i>Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie</i>, or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European <!--del_lnk--> trading houses sailing the <!--del_lnk--> spice route to the East, had no intent of colonizing the area, but only wanted to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of <a href="../../wp/m/Meat.htm" title="Meat">meat</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetable.htm" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Jan van Riebeeck reached Table Bay on <!--del_lnk--> April 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1652.<p><a id="Arrival_of_the_Dutch" name="Arrival_of_the_Dutch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Arrival of the Dutch</span></h3>

      <p>While the new settlement <!--del_lnk--> traded out of necessity with the neighbouring Khoikhoi, one could hardly describe the relationship as friendly, and the authorities made deliberate attempts to restrict contact. Partly as a consequence, VOC employees found themselves faced with a labour shortage. To remedy this, they released a small number of Dutch from their <!--del_lnk--> contracts and permitted them to establish farms, with which they would supply the VOC settlement from their <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvests</a>. This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a>; they later raised livestock. The small initial group of free <!--del_lnk--> burghers, as these farmers were known, steadily increased and began to expand their farms further north and east into the territory of the Khoikhoi.<p>The majority of burghers had Dutch ancestry and belonged to the <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands, but there were also numerous <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germans</a> as well as some <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavians. In <!--del_lnk--> 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots, also <!--del_lnk--> Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution under <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">King Louis XIV</a>.<p>In addition to establishing the free burgher system, van Riebeeck and the VOC also began to import large numbers of <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slaves</a>, primarily from <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Coloureds and the <!--del_lnk--> Cape Malays. A significant number of the offspring from the White and slave unions were absorbed into the local proto <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> speaking White population. With this additional labour, the areas occupied by the VOC expanded further to the north and east, with inevitable clashes with the Khoikhoi. The newcomers drove the beleaguered Khoikhoi from their traditional lands, decimated them with introduced <!--del_lnk--> diseases, and destroyed them with superior <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapons</a> when they fought back, which they did in a number of major wars and with <!--del_lnk--> guerrilla resistance movements which continued into the 19th century. Most survivors were left with no option but to work for the Europeans in an exploitative arrangement that differed little from <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. Over time, the Khoisan, their European overseers, and the imported slaves mixed, with the offspring of these unions forming the basis for today&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Coloured population.<p>The best-known Khoikhoi groups included the <!--del_lnk--> Griqua, who had originally lived on the western coast between <!--del_lnk--> St Helena Bay and the <!--del_lnk--> Cederberg Range. In the late 18th century, they managed to acquire <!--del_lnk--> guns and <a href="../../wp/h/Horse.htm" title="Horse">horses</a> and began <!--del_lnk--> trekking northeast. En route other groups of Khoisan, Coloureds, and even white adventurers joined them, and they rapidly gained a reputation as a formidable <!--del_lnk--> military force. Ultimately, the Griquas reached the Highveld around present-day <!--del_lnk--> Kimberley, where they carved out territory that came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> Griqualand.<p><a id="Burgher_expansion" name="Burgher_expansion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Burgher expansion</span></h3>

      <p>As the burghers, too, continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic pastoralist lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the Khoikhoi they displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a <!--del_lnk--> wagon, a <!--del_lnk--> tent, a <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a <!--del_lnk--> mud-walled <!--del_lnk--> cottage, frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European. These were the first of the <!--del_lnk--> Trekboers (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to <!--del_lnk--> Boers), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated. Their harsh lifestyle produced courageous individualists, who knew the veld and nature intimately, and based their lives on their main source of guidance, the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>.<p><a id="The_British_at_the_Cape" name="The_British_at_the_Cape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The British at the Cape</span></h3>
      <p>As the 18th century drew to a close, Dutch mercantile power began to fade, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> moved in to fill the <!--del_lnk--> vacuum. They seized the Cape in 1795 to prevent it from falling into rival French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803) before finally garnering recognition of their <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty of the area in <!--del_lnk--> 1814.<p>At the tip of the continent the British found an established <!--del_lnk--> colony with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 Khoisan, and 1,000 freed black slaves. Power resided solely with a white <!--del_lnk--> &eacute;lite in Cape Town, and differentiation on the basis of <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a> was deeply entrenched. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white pastoralists populated the country.<p>Like the Dutch before them, the British initially had little interest in the Cape Colony, other than as a strategically located port. As one of their first tasks they tried to resolve a troublesome <!--del_lnk--> border dispute between the Boers and the Xhosa on the colony&#39;s eastern frontier. In <!--del_lnk--> 1820 the British authorities persuaded about 5,000 <!--del_lnk--> middle-class British <!--del_lnk--> immigrants (most of them &quot;in <!--del_lnk--> trade&quot;) to leave England behind and settle on tracts of land between the feuding groups with the idea of providing a buffer zone. The plan was singularly unsuccessful. Within three years, almost half of these <!--del_lnk--> 1820 Settlers had retreated to the towns, notably <!--del_lnk--> Grahamstown and <!--del_lnk--> Port Elizabeth, to pursue the jobs they had held in Britain.<p>While doing nothing to resolve the border dispute, this influx of settlers solidified the British presence in the area, thus fracturing the relative unity of white South Africa. Where the Boers and their ideas had before gone largely unchallenged, European Southern Africa now had two language groups and two cultures. A pattern soon emerged whereby English-speakers became highly urbanised, and dominated <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> trade, <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">mining</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, while the largely uneducated Boers were relegated to their farms.<p>The gap between the British settlers and the Boers further widened with the abolition of slavery in <!--del_lnk--> 1833, a move that the Boers generally regarded as against the God-given ordering of the races. Yet, the British settlers&#39; conservatism and sense of racial superiority stopped any radical social reforms, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1841 the authorities passed a <!--del_lnk--> Masters and Servants Ordinance, which perpetuated white control. Meanwhile, British numbers increased rapidly in Cape Town, in the area east of the Cape Colony (present-day <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Cape Province), in <!--del_lnk--> Natal and, after the discovery of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamonds</a>, in parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Transvaal, mainly around present-day <!--del_lnk--> Gauteng.<p><a id="Difaqane_and_destruction" name="Difaqane_and_destruction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Difaqane and destruction</span></h3>

      <p>The early 19th century saw a time of immense upheaval relating to the military expansion of the <a href="../../wp/z/Zulu.htm" title="Zulu">Zulu</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">kingdom</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Sotho-speakers know this period as the <i><!--del_lnk--> difaqane</i> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> forced migration&quot;); while <!--del_lnk--> Zulu-speakers call it the <i>mfecane</i> (&quot;crushing&quot;).<p>The full causes of the <i>difaqane</i> remain in dispute, although certain factors stand out. The rise of a unified Zulu kingdom had particular significance. In the early 19th century, <!--del_lnk--> Nguni tribes in KwaZulu-Natal began to shift from a loosely-organised collection of kingdoms into a centralised, militaristic state. <!--del_lnk--> Shaka Zulu, son of the chief of the small Zulu clan, became the driving force behind this shift. At first something of an <!--del_lnk--> outcast, Shaka proved himself in battle and gradually succeeded in consolidating power in his own hands. He built large <!--del_lnk--> armies, breaking from clan tradition by placing the armies under the control of his own officers rather than of the hereditary chiefs. Shaka then set out on a massive programme of expansion, killing or enslaving those who resisted in the territories he conquered. His <i><!--del_lnk--> impis</i> (warrior regiments) were rigorously disciplined: failure in battle meant death.<p>Peoples in the path of Shaka&#39;s armies moved out of his way, becoming in their turn aggressors against their neighbours. This wave of displacement spread throughout <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> and beyond. It also accelerated the formation of several states, notably those of the Sotho (present-day <a href="../../wp/l/Lesotho.htm" title="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>) and of the <!--del_lnk--> Swazi (now <a href="../../wp/s/Swaziland.htm" title="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1828 Shaka was killed by his half-brothers <!--del_lnk--> Dingaan and <!--del_lnk--> Umthlangana. The weaker and less-skilled Dingaan became king, relaxing military discipline while continuing the despotism. Dingaan also attempted to establish relations with the British traders on the Natal coast, but events had started to unfold that would see the demise of Zulu independence.<p><a id="The_Great_Trek" name="The_Great_Trek"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Great Trek</span></h3>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Boers had started to grow increasingly dissatisfied with British rule in the Cape Colony. The British proclamation of the equality of the races particularly angered them. Beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1835, several groups of Boers, together with large numbers of Khoikhoi and black <!--del_lnk--> servants, decided to trek off into the interior in search of greater <!--del_lnk--> independence. North and east of the <!--del_lnk--> Orange River (which formed the Cape Colony&#39;s frontier) these Boers or <!--del_lnk--> Voortrekkers (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Pioneers&quot;) found vast tracts of apparently uninhabited <!--del_lnk--> grazing lands. They had, it seemed, entered their promised land, with space enough for their cattle to graze and their culture of anti-urban independence to flourish. Little did they know that what they found &mdash; deserted <!--del_lnk--> pasture lands, disorganised bands of <!--del_lnk--> refugees, and tales of <!--del_lnk--> brutality &mdash; resulted from the <i>difaqane</i>, rather than representing the normal state of affairs.<p>With the exception of the more powerful <!--del_lnk--> Ndebele, the Voortrekkers encountered little resistance among the scattered peoples of the <!--del_lnk--> plains. The <i>difaqane</i> had dispersed them, and the remnants lacked horses and <a href="../../wp/f/Firearm.htm" title="Firearm">firearms</a>. Their weakened condition also solidified the Boers&#39; belief that European occupation meant the coming of civilisation to a savage land. However, the mountains where <!--del_lnk--> King Moshoeshoe I had started to forge the Basotho nation that would later become Lesotho and the wooded valleys of <!--del_lnk--> Zululand proved a more difficult proposition. Here the Boers met strong resistance, and their incursions set off a series of <!--del_lnk--> skirmishes, squabbles, and flimsy <!--del_lnk--> treaties that would litter the next 50 years of increasing white domination.<p><a id="British_vs._Boers_vs._Zulus" name="British_vs._Boers_vs._Zulus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British vs. Boers vs. Zulus</span></h3>

This <!--del_lnk--> massacre triggered others, as well as a revenge attack by the Boers. The culmination came on <!--del_lnk--> 16 December <!--del_lnk--> 1838, in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Blood River, fought at the <!--del_lnk--> Ncome River in Natal.

      <p>After this victory, which resulted from the possession of superior weapons, the Boers felt that their expansion really did have a long-suspected stamp of <!--del_lnk--> divine approval.

      <p>The British set about establishing large <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>-<!--del_lnk--> plantations in Natal, but found few inhabitants of the neighbouring Zulu areas willing to provide labour. The British confronted stiff resistance to their encroachments from the <a href="../../wp/z/Zulu.htm" title="Zulu">Zulus</a>, a nation with well-established traditions of waging war, who inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats on the British army at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Isandlwana in <!--del_lnk--> 1879 when it killed over 1400 British soldiers. In ongoing <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Zulu Wars, the British eventually established their control over then-named <!--del_lnk--> Zululand in large areas of present-day <!--del_lnk--> Natal.<p>The British turned to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> to resolve their labour shortage, as Zulu men refused to adopt the servile position of laborers and in <!--del_lnk--> 1860 the <!--del_lnk--> SS <i>Truro</i> arrived in Durban harbour with over 300 people on board. Over the next 50 years, 150,000 more <!--del_lnk--> indentured Indians arrived, as well as numerous free &quot;passenger Indians&quot;, building the base for what would become the largest Indian community outside of India. As early as <!--del_lnk--> 1893, when <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> arrived in Durban, Indians outnumbered whites in Natal.

      <p>The Boers meanwhile persevered with their search for land and freedom, ultimately establishing themselves in the <!--del_lnk--> Transvaal and in the <!--del_lnk--> Orange Free State.

      <p>Long-standing Boer resentment turned into full-blown rebellion in the Transvaal (under British control from 1877), and the first <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Boer War, known to <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaners as the &quot;War of Independence&quot;, broke out in <!--del_lnk--> 1880. The conflict ended almost as soon as it began with a crushing Boer victory at <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Majuba Hill (<!--del_lnk--> 27 February <!--del_lnk--> 1881). The republic regained its independence as the <i>Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek</i> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> South African Republic&quot;), or ZAR. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Kruger, one of the leaders of the uprising, became President of the ZAR in <!--del_lnk--> 1883. Meanwhile, the British, who viewed their defeat at Majuba as an aberration, forged ahead with their desire to <!--del_lnk--> federate the Southern African colonies and republics. They saw this as the best way to come to terms with the fact of a white Afrikaner majority, as well as to promote their larger strategic interests in the area.<p><a id="Inter-war_period" name="Inter-war_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Inter-war period</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1879, Zululand came under British control. Then in <!--del_lnk--> 1886, an Australian prospector <!--del_lnk--> discovered gold in the <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand, accelerating the federation process and dealing the Boers yet another blow. <a href="../../wp/j/Johannesburg.htm" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>&#39;s population exploded to about 100,000 by the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1890s, and the ZAR suddenly found itself hosting thousands of <i><!--del_lnk--> uitlanders</i>, both black and white, with the Boers squeezed to the sidelines. The influx of Black labour in particular worried the Boers, many of whom suffered economic hardship and resented the black wage-earners.<p>The enormous wealth of the mines, largely controlled by European &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Randlords&quot;, soon became irresistible for British <!--del_lnk--> imperialists. In <!--del_lnk--> 1895, a group of renegades led by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Leander Starr Jameson entered the ZAR with the intention of sparking an uprising on the Witwatersrand and installing a British administration. This incursion became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Jameson Raid. The scheme ended in fiasco, but it seemed obvious to Kruger that it had at least the tacit approval of the Cape Colony government, and that his republic faced danger. He reacted by forming an alliance with Orange Free State.<p><a id="Second_Anglo-Boer_War" name="Second_Anglo-Boer_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Second Anglo-Boer War</span></h3>

      <p>The situation peaked in <!--del_lnk--> 1899, when the British demanded voting rights for the 60,000 foreign whites on the Witwatersrand. Until that point, Kruger&#39;s government had excluded all foreigners from the <a href="../../wp/s/Suffrage.htm" title="Suffrage">franchise</a>. Kruger rejected the British demand and called for the withdrawal of British troops from the ZAR&#39;s borders. When the British refused, Kruger declared war. This <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Anglo-Boer War</a> lasted longer, and the British preparedness surpassed that of Majuba Hill. By June <!--del_lnk--> 1900, <a href="../../wp/p/Pretoria.htm" title="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, the last of the major Boer towns, had surrendered. Yet resistance by Boer <i><!--del_lnk--> bittereinders</i> continued for two more years with guerrilla-style battles, which the British met in turn with <!--del_lnk--> scorched earth tactics. By <!--del_lnk--> 1902 26,000 Boers had died of <!--del_lnk--> disease and neglect in <!--del_lnk--> concentration camps. On <!--del_lnk--> 31 May 1902 a superficial peace came with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Vereeniging. Under its terms, the Boer republics acknowledged British sovereignty, while the British in turn committed themselves to reconstruction of the areas under their control.<p><a id="Roots_of_union" name="Roots_of_union"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Roots of union</span></h2>

      <p>During the immediate post-war years the British focussed their attention on rebuilding the country, in particular the mining industry. By <!--del_lnk--> 1907 the mines of the Witwatersrand produced almost one-third of the world&#39;s annual gold production. But the peace brought by the treaty remained fragile and challenged on all sides. The Afrikaners found themselves in the ignominious position of poor farmers in a country where big mining ventures and foreign <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> rendered them irrelevant. Britain&#39;s unsuccessful attempts to anglicise them, and to impose English as the official language in schools and the <!--del_lnk--> workplace particularly incensed them. Partly as a backlash to this, the Boers came to see <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> as the <i>volkstaal</i> (&quot;people&#39;s language&quot;) and as a symbol of Afrikaner nationhood. Several nationalist organisations sprang up.<p>The system left Blacks and Coloureds completely marginalised. The authorities imposed harsh <!--del_lnk--> taxes and reduced wages, while the British caretaker administrator encouraged the immigration of thousands of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> to undercut any resistance. Resentment exploded in the <!--del_lnk--> Bambatha Rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> 1906, in which 4,000 Zulus lost their lives after protesting against onerous tax legislation.<p>The British meanwhile moved ahead with their plans for union. After several years of negotiations, the <!--del_lnk--> South Africa Act 1909 brought the colonies and republics &mdash; Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State &mdash; together as the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa. Under the provisions of the act, the Union remained British territory, but with <!--del_lnk--> home-rule for Afrikaners. The <!--del_lnk--> British High Commission territories of <!--del_lnk--> Basutoland (now <a href="../../wp/l/Lesotho.htm" title="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Bechuanaland (now <a href="../../wp/b/Botswana.htm" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>), <a href="../../wp/s/Swaziland.htm" title="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Rhodesia (now <a href="../../wp/z/Zambia.htm" title="Zambia">Zambia</a> and <a href="../../wp/z/Zimbabwe.htm" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>) continued under direct rule from Britain.<p>English and Dutch became the official languages. Afrikaans did not gain recognition as an official language until <!--del_lnk--> 1925.

      <p>On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal <!--del_lnk--> Dominion under the <!--del_lnk--> 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on September 1, 1939 was none other than <!--del_lnk--> Barry Hertzog the leader of the pro-Afrikaner anti-British <!--del_lnk--> National party that had joined in a unity government as the <!--del_lnk--> United Party.<p>Herzog&#39;s problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler&#39;s forces attacked Poland on the night of August 31, 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of South Africa, that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain&#39;s side, led by the pro-<!--del_lnk--> Allied pro-British Afrikaner and former Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Jan Smuts and General <i>against</i> then-current Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa &quot;neutral&quot;, if not pro-<!--del_lnk--> Axis.<p><a id="Declaration_of_war_against_the_Axis" name="Declaration_of_war_against_the_Axis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Declaration of war against the Axis</span></h3>

      <p>Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain&#39;s war-time Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Smuts was invited to the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial War Cabinet in <!--del_lnk--> 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. In <!--del_lnk--> 28 May <!--del_lnk--> 1941, Smuts was appointed a <!--del_lnk--> Field Marshal of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall, whereas most <!--del_lnk--> English-speaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him. (See <!--del_lnk--> Jan Smuts during World War II.)<p><a id="Military_contributions_and_casualties_in_World_War_II" name="Military_contributions_and_casualties_in_World_War_II"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Military contributions and casualties in World War II</span></h3>
      <p>South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theaters of war. South Africa&#39;s contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, men and material for the <!--del_lnk--> North African campaign (the Desert War) and the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> that converge at the tip of <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a>. Numerous volunteers also flew for the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>. (See: <!--del_lnk--> South African Army in World War II; <!--del_lnk--> South African Air Force in World War II; <!--del_lnk--> South African Navy in World War II.)<ol>
       <li>The South African Army and <!--del_lnk--> Air Force helped defeat the Italian army of the Fascist <a href="../../wp/b/Benito_Mussolini.htm" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> that had <!--del_lnk--> invaded Abyssinia (now known as <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>) in 1935. During the 1941 <!--del_lnk--> East African Campaign South African forces made important contribution to this early Allied victory.<li>Another important victory that the South African&#39;s participated in was the liberation of <!--del_lnk--> Malagasy (now known as <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>) from the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Vichy French who were allies of the Nazis. British troops aided by South African soldiers, staged their attack from South Africa, occupied the strategic island in <!--del_lnk--> 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> South African 1st Infantry Division took part in several actions in North Africa in <!--del_lnk--> 1941 and <!--del_lnk--> 1942, including the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of El Alamein, before being withdrawn to South Africa.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> South African 2nd Infantry Division also took part in a number of actions in North Africa during 1942, but on <!--del_lnk--> 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of <!--del_lnk--> Tobruk.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> South African 3rd Infantry Division never took an active part in any battles but instead organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and supplied replacements for the South African 1st Infantry Division and the South African 2nd Infantry Division. However, one of this division&#39;s constituent brigades - <i>7 SA Motorised Brigade</i> - did take part in the invasion of <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in 1942.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> South African 6th Armoured Division fought in numerous actions in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> from <!--del_lnk--> 1944 to <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<li>South Africa contributed to the war effort against Japan, supplying men and manning ships in naval engagements against the Japanese. </ol>
      <p>Of the <!--del_lnk--> 334,000 men volunteered for full time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 &quot;coloureds&quot; and Asians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action.<p><a id="Aftermath_of_World_War_II" name="Aftermath_of_World_War_II"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath of World War II</span></h2>
      <p>South Africa emerged from the Allied victory with its prestige and national honor enhanced as it had fought tirelessly for the Western Allies. South Africa&#39;s standing in the international community was rising, at a time when the Third World&#39;s struggle against colonialism had still not taken centre stage. In May <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Prime Minister Smuts represented South Africa in <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco at the drafting of the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Charter. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international body to preserve peace; he was determined that, unlike the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> would have teeth. Smuts signed the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Peace Treaty, resolving the peace in Europe, thus becoming the only signatory of both the treaty ending the First World War, and that ending the Second.<p>However, internal political struggles in the disgruntled and essentially impoverished Afrikaner community would soon come to the fore leading to Smuts&#39; defeat at the polls in the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 elections (in which only whites and coloroureds could vote) at the hands of a resurgent National Party after the war. This began the road to South Africa&#39;s eventual isolation from a world that would no longer tolerate any forms of political discrimination or differentiation based on race only.<p><a id="General_elections_and_the_slow_evolution_of_democracy" name="General_elections_and_the_slow_evolution_of_democracy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">General elections and the slow evolution of democracy</span></h2>

      <p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1910 until the present time, a series of important <!--del_lnk--> general elections have been held in a united South Africa. From 1910 until 1948 the <a href="../../wp/s/Suffrage.htm" title="Suffrage">franchise</a> to vote was given to whites and to <!--del_lnk--> Cape <!--del_lnk--> Coloreds (people of <!--del_lnk--> mixed race) only. After the ascent of the Nationalist Party in 1948, the Cape Coloreds were taken off the voters&#39; role. Only eligible whites were permited to vote from 1948 until 1994 when the vote was granted to South Africans of every racial group. The <!--del_lnk--> 1994 general election was the first post-apartheid vote based on <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage.<p>There have been three <!--del_lnk--> referendums in South Africa: <!--del_lnk--> 1960 referendum on becoming a republic; <!--del_lnk--> 1983 referendum on implementing the tricameral parliament; and <!--del_lnk--> 1992 referendum on becoming a multiracial democracy all of which were held during the era of Nationalist Party control.<p><a id="Apartheid_era" name="Apartheid_era"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Apartheid era</span></h2>

      <p>General <!--del_lnk--> Louis Botha headed the first government of the new Union, with General <!--del_lnk--> Jan Smuts as his deputy. Their <!--del_lnk--> South African National Party, later known as the <!--del_lnk--> South African Party or SAP, followed a generally pro-British, white-unity line. The more radical Boers split away under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> General Barry Hertzog, forming the <!--del_lnk--> National Party (NP) in <!--del_lnk--> 1914. The NP championed Afrikaner interests, advocating separate development for the two white groups and independence from Britain.<p>The new Union had no place for Blacks, despite their constituting over 75 percent of the population. The Act of Union denied them voting-rights in the Transvaal and Orange Free State areas, and in <!--del_lnk--> Cape Province Blacks gained the vote only if they met a property-ownership qualification. Blacks saw the failure to grant the franchise, coming on the heels of British wartime <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> promoting freedom from &quot;Boer slavery&quot;, as a blatant betrayal. Before long the Union passed a barrage of oppressive legislation, making it <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">illegal</a> for black workers to <!--del_lnk--> strike, reserving skilled jobs for whites, barring blacks from military service, and instituting restrictive <!--del_lnk--> pass laws. In <!--del_lnk--> 1913 parliament enacted the <!--del_lnk--> Natives Land Act, setting aside eight percent of South Africa&#39;s land for black occupancy. Whites, who made up only 20 percent of the population, held 90 percent of the land. Black Africans could not buy or rent land or even work as sharecroppers outside their designated area. The authorities <!--del_lnk--> evicted thousands of <!--del_lnk--> squatters from farms and forced them into increasingly overcrowded and impoverished reserves, or into the cities. Those who remained sank to the status of landless labourers.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Black and Coloured opposition began to coalesce, and leading figures such as <!--del_lnk--> John Jabavu, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Rubusana and <!--del_lnk--> Abdullah Abdurahman laid the foundations for new non-tribal black political groups. Most significantly, a <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University-educated <!--del_lnk--> attorney, <!--del_lnk--> Pixley ka Isaka Seme, called together representatives of the various African tribes to form a unified, national organisation to represent the interests of blacks, and to ensure that they had an effective voice in the new Union. Thus there originated the South African Native National Congress, known from <!--del_lnk--> 1923 as the <!--del_lnk--> African National Congress (ANC). Parallel to this, <a href="../../wp/m/Mahatma_Gandhi.htm" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> worked with the Indian populations of Natal and the Transvaal to fight against the ever-increasing encroachment on their rights.<p>The international recession which followed <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> put pressures on mine-owners, and they sought to reduce costs by recruiting lower-paid, black, semi-skilled workers. White mine-workers saw this as a threat and in <!--del_lnk--> 1922 rose in the armed <!--del_lnk--> Rand Rebellion, supported by the new <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of South Africa under the slogan &quot;<i>Workers of the World, unite and fight for a white South Africa</i>&quot;. Smuts suppressed the rising violently, but the failure led to a convergence of views between Afrikaner nationalists and white English-speaking trade-unionists. The Communists saw the failure as having resulted from a lack of mobilisation by black workers, and re-oriented their recruitment.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1924 the NP, under Hertzog, came to power in a <!--del_lnk--> coalition government with the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party, and Afrikaner <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> gained greater hold. Afrikaans, previously regarded only as a low-class dialect of Dutch, replaced Dutch as an official language of the Union, and the so-called <i>swart gevaar</i> (black threat) became the dominant issue of the <!--del_lnk--> 1929 <a href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Election">election</a>. In the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1930s, Hertzog joined the NP with the more moderate SAP of Jan Smuts to form the <!--del_lnk--> United Party; this coalition fell apart at the start <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> when Smuts took the reins and, amid much controversy, led South Africa into war on the side of the <!--del_lnk--> Allies. However, any hopes of turning the tide of Afrikaner nationalism faded when <!--del_lnk--> Daniel Fran&ccedil;ois Malan led a radical break-away movement, the Purified National Party, to the central position in Afrikaner political life. The <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret Afrikaner brotherhood formed in <!--del_lnk--> 1918 to protect Afrikaner culture, soon became an extraordinarily influential force behind both the NP and other organisations designed to promote the <i>volk</i> (&quot;people&quot;, the Afrikaners).<p>Due to the booming wartime economy, black labour became increasingly important to the mining and manufacturing industries, and the black urban population nearly doubled. Enormous <!--del_lnk--> squatter camps grew up on the outskirts of Johannesburg and (though to a lesser extent) outside the other major cities. Despite the appalling conditions in the <!--del_lnk--> townships, not only blacks knew poverty: wartime surveys found that 40 percent of white schoolchildren suffered from <!--del_lnk--> malnutrition.<p><a id="Legalised_discrimination" name="Legalised_discrimination"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Legalised discrimination</span></h3>
      <p>From 1948 successive <!--del_lnk--> National Party administrations formalised and extended the existing system of segregation and denial of rights into the legal system of <i>apartheid</i>, which lasted until the 1990s. Although many important events occurred during this period, apartheid remained the central system around which most of the historical issues of this period revolved.<p><a id="Dismantling" name="Dismantling"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dismantling</span></h3>
      <p>With increasing opposition to apartheid in the final decades of the 20th century &mdash; including an <!--del_lnk--> armed struggle, economic and cultural <!--del_lnk--> sanctions by the <!--del_lnk--> international community, pressure from the <!--del_lnk--> anti-apartheid movement around the world, a rebellion amongst Afrikaner and English-speaking youth as well as open revolt within the ruling <!--del_lnk--> National Party &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> State President <!--del_lnk--> F.W. de Klerk announced the unbanning of the <!--del_lnk--> African National Congress and <!--del_lnk--> Pan Africanist Congress as well as the release of <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 2 February <!--del_lnk--> 1990, which signaled the beginning of a transition to <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. In the <!--del_lnk--> referendum held on <!--del_lnk--> 17 March <!--del_lnk--> 1992, a white electorate voted 68% in favour of dismantling apartheid through negotiations.<p>After years of negotiations under the auspices of the <!--del_lnk--> Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), a draft <!--del_lnk--> constitution appeared on <!--del_lnk--> 26 July <!--del_lnk--> 1993, containing concessions towards all sides: a federal system of regional <!--del_lnk--> legislatures, equal voting-rights regardless of race, and a bicameral legislature.<p>From 26 to 29 April <!--del_lnk--> 1994, the South African population voted in the first <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage <!--del_lnk--> general elections. The African National Congress won election to govern for the very first time, leaving the <!--del_lnk--> National Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Inkatha Freedom Party behind it and parties such as the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party and Pan Africanist Congress took up their seats as part of the <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary opposition in the first genuine multiracial <!--del_lnk--> parliament. <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> was elected as President on 9 May 1994 and formed -according to the interim constitution of 1993- a government of national unity, consisting of the ANC, the NP and the Inkatha. On 10 May Mandela was inaugurated as South Africas new President in Pretoria and <!--del_lnk--> Thabo Mbeki and FW De Klerk as his vice-presidents.<p>Following the elections, the fostering of a culture that recognised human rights became important. After considerable debate, and following submissions from <!--del_lnk--> special-interest groups, individuals and ordinary citizens, the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament enacted a new <!--del_lnk--> Constitution and <!--del_lnk--> Bill of Rights as legislation in <!--del_lnk--> 1996.<p><a id="After_apartheid" name="After_apartheid"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">After apartheid</span></h2>
      <p>After the enactment of the constitution, focus turned to the <!--del_lnk--> Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was established in 1995 to expose crimes of the apartheid era under the dictum of Archbishop <a href="../../wp/d/Desmond_Tutu.htm" title="Desmond Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>: &quot;Without forgiveness there is no future, but without confession there can be no forgiveness&quot;. The commission heard many stories of horrific brutality and injustice from all sides of the struggle, and offered some <!--del_lnk--> catharsis to people and communities shattered by their past experiences.<p>The Commission operated by allowing victims to tell their stories and by allowing perpetrators to confess their guilt; with amnesty on offer to those who made a full confession. Those who chose not to appear before the commission would face criminal prosecution if the authorities could prove their guilt. But while some soldiers, police, and ordinary citizens confessed their crimes, few of those who had given the orders or commanded the police presented themselves. For example, State President <!--del_lnk--> P.W. Botha himself, notably, refused to appear before the Commission. It has proven difficult to gather evidence against these alleged higher-level criminals.<p><a id="Refining_democracy" name="Refining_democracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Refining democracy</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1999, South Africa held its <!--del_lnk--> second universal-suffrage elections. In <!--del_lnk--> 1997, <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Mandela</a> had handed over leadership of the ANC to his deputy, <!--del_lnk--> Thabo Mbeki, and speculation grew that the ANC vote might therefore drop. In fact, it increased, putting the party within one seat of the two-thirds majority that would allow it to alter the constitution.<p>The NP, restyled as the <!--del_lnk--> New National Party (NNP), lost two-thirds of its seats, as well as official <!--del_lnk--> opposition status to the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party (DP). The DP had traditionally functioned as a stronghold of liberal whites, and now gained new support from conservatives disenchanted with the NP, and from some middle-class blacks. Just behind the DP came the KwaZulu-Natal <!--del_lnk--> Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), historically the voice of Zulu nationalism. While the IFP lost some support, its leader, <!--del_lnk--> Chief Buthelezi, continued to exercise power as the national <!--del_lnk--> Home Affairs minister.<p><a id="Into_the_future" name="Into_the_future"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Into the future</span></h3>
      <p>While the ANC grassroots hold Mbeki in far less affection than the beloved &quot;Madiba&quot; (Mandela), he has proven himself a shrewd politician, maintaining his political pre-eminence by isolating or co-opting opposition parties. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, Mbeki manoeuvred the ANC to a two-thirds majority in parliament for the first time.<p>Yet not everything has gone the ANC&#39;s way. In the early days of his presidency, Mbeki&#39;s effective denial of the <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a> crisis invited global criticism, and his conspicuous failure to condemn the forced reclamation of white-owned farms in neighbouring <a href="../../wp/z/Zimbabwe.htm" title="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> unnerved both South African landowners and foreign <!--del_lnk--> investors.<p>Non-political <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> has increased dramatically since the end of apartheid. According to a report by <!--del_lnk--> Sibusiso Masuku, in the seven years between <!--del_lnk--> 1994 and <!--del_lnk--> 2001, &quot;violent crime increased by 33%&quot;. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> reports the killing of approximately 1,500 white farmers in non-political attacks since <!--del_lnk--> 1991. <a href="../../wp/i/Interpol.htm" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> figures showed that, in <!--del_lnk--> 2002, South Africa experienced 114.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, the world&#39;s highest murder-rate and around five times higher than that of the second-highest country, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>. As of <!--del_lnk--> 1998, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> led the world, although by a smaller margin, in reported murders and robberies. A <!--del_lnk--> 2001 report by the <!--del_lnk--> Institute for Security Studies concluded that &quot;South Africa has high but manageable levels of property crime but an extraordinary high level of violent crime. It is South Africa&rsquo;s high level of violent crime which sets the country apart from other crime ridden societies.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the government of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> published statistics showing a decrease in crime, although some observers cast doubt on their veracity. In <!--del_lnk--> 2003, <a href="../../wp/i/Interpol.htm" title="Interpol">Interpol</a> reported murder levels nearly double those given in government statistics. Mbeki has accused his critics in this regard of racism. Others note that varying rates of crime-reporting by victims and the difficulties in interpreting crime data for nations involved in active military conflicts may explain variant statistics.<p>According to <i>The Economist</i>, an estimated 250,000 white South Africans have emigrated since <!--del_lnk--> 1994. .<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_South_Africa&quot;</div>
