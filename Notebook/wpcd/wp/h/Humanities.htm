      <p>The <b>humanities</b> are a group of academic subjects united by a commitment to studying aspects of the <!--del_lnk--> human condition and a qualitative approach that generally prevents a single <!--del_lnk--> paradigm from coming to define any discipline.

      <p>The great traditions in <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> have a foundation in the art of one of the ancient civilizations:<ul>

      <p>Ancient Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Ancient Roman</a> art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (i.e. <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>&#39; thunderbolt).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine and <!--del_lnk--> Gothic art of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths.<p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> saw the return to valuation of the material world, and this shift is reflected in art forms, which show the corporeality of the human body, and the three-dimensional reality of landscape.<p>Eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of India, Tibet and Japan.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The study of individual modern and classical languages form the backbone of modern study of the humanities, while the scientific study of language is known as <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistics</a> and is a <!--del_lnk--> social science. Since many areas of the humanities such as literature, history and philosophy are based on language, changes in language can have a profound effect on the other humanities. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including <!--del_lnk--> prose forms (such as the <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novel</a>), <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">drama</a>, also lies at the heart of the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs in a <!--del_lnk--> foreign language usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself (grammar, vocabulary, etc.).<p><a id="Performing_arts" name="Performing_arts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Performing arts</span></h3>
      <p>The <b>performing arts</b> differ from the <!--del_lnk--> plastic arts insofar as the former uses the artist&#39;s own body, face, presence as a medium, and the latter uses materials such as clay, metal or paint which can be molded or transformed to create some <!--del_lnk--> art object.<p>Performing arts include <!--del_lnk--> acrobatics, <!--del_lnk--> busking, <!--del_lnk--> comedy, <a href="../../wp/d/Dance.htm" title="Dance">dance</a>, <!--del_lnk--> magic, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a>, <!--del_lnk--> juggling, <!--del_lnk--> marching arts, such as <!--del_lnk--> brass bands, and <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a>.<p>Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers, including <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">actors</a>, <!--del_lnk--> comedians, <!--del_lnk--> dancers, <!--del_lnk--> musicians, and <!--del_lnk--> singers. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as <!--del_lnk--> songwriting and <!--del_lnk--> stagecraft.<p>Performers often adapt their <!--del_lnk--> appearance, such as with <!--del_lnk--> costumes and <!--del_lnk--> stage makeup, etc.<p>There is also a specialized form of <a href="../../wp/f/Fine_art.htm" title="Fine art">fine art</a> in which the artists <i>perform</i> their work live to an audience. This is called <!--del_lnk--> Performance art. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of <!--del_lnk--> props. Dance was often referred to as a <i>plastic art</i> during the <!--del_lnk--> Modern dance era.<dl>

      <p>Music as an academic discipline mainly focuses on two career paths, music <!--del_lnk--> performance (focused on the <!--del_lnk--> orchestra and the <!--del_lnk--> concert hall) and <!--del_lnk--> music education (training music teachers). Students learn to play <a href="../../wp/m/Musical_instrument.htm" title="Musical instrument">instruments</a>, but also study <!--del_lnk--> music theory, <!--del_lnk--> musicology, <!--del_lnk--> history of music and <!--del_lnk--> composition. In the liberal arts tradition, music is also used to broaden skills of non-musicians by teaching skills such as concentration and listening.<dl>
       <dt>Theatre</dl>
      <p><b>Theatre</b> or <b>theatre</b> (Greek &quot;theatron&quot;, <i>&theta;&#x3AD;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</i>) is the branch of the <!--del_lnk--> performing arts concerned with <!--del_lnk--> acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle &mdash; indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ballet, <!--del_lnk--> mime, <!--del_lnk--> kabuki, <!--del_lnk--> classical Indian dance, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese opera, <!--del_lnk--> mummers&#39; plays, and <!--del_lnk--> pantomime.<p><a id="Dance" name="Dance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dance</span></h3>

      <p>Most historians trace the beginnings of <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious belief</a> to the Neolithic Period. Most religious belief during this time period consisted of worship of a <!--del_lnk--> Mother Goddess, a <!--del_lnk--> Sky Father, and also worship of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> and the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a> as deities. (<i>see also <!--del_lnk--> Sun worship</i>)<p>New <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophies</a> and <!--del_lnk--> religions arose in both east and west, particularly around the <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BC. Over time, a great variety of religions developed around the world, with <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism in <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a> being some of the earliest major faiths.<p>In the east, three schools of thought were to dominate Chinese thinking until the modern day. These were <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Legalism, and <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>. The Confucian tradition, which would attain predominance, looked not to the force of law, but to the power and example of tradition for political morality. In the west, the Greek philosophical tradition, represented by the works of <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, was diffused throughout Europe and the Middle East by the conquests of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander of Macedon in the <!--del_lnk--> 4th century BC.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> Abrahamic religions</b> are those <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religions</a> deriving from a common ancient <!--del_lnk--> Semitic tradition and traced by their adherents to <!--del_lnk--> Abraham (circa 1900 BCE), a <!--del_lnk--> patriarch whose life is narrated in the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew Bible/<!--del_lnk--> Old Testament, and as a <!--del_lnk--> prophet in the <!--del_lnk--> Quran and also called a prophet in Genesis 20:7.

      <p>In the West, the study of the humanities can be traced to ancient Greece, as the basis of a broad education for citizens. During Roman times, the concept of the seven <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts evolved, involving <!--del_lnk--> grammar, <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric and <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a> (the <!--del_lnk--> trivium), along with <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <!--del_lnk--> astronomia and <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a> (the <!--del_lnk--> quadrivium). These subjects formed the bulk of <!--del_lnk--> medieval education, with the emphasis being on the humanities as skills or &quot;ways of doing.&quot;<p>A major shift occurred during the Renaissance, when the humanities began to be regarded as subjects to be studied rather than practised, with a corresponding shift away from the traditional fields into areas such as literature and history. In the 20th century, this view was in turn challenged by the <!--del_lnk--> postmodernist movement, which sought to redefine the humanities in more <!--del_lnk--> egalitarian terms suitable for a <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democratic</a> society.<p><a id="Humanities_today" name="Humanities_today"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Humanities today</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Humanities_in_the_United_States" name="Humanities_in_the_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Humanities in the United States</span></h3>
      <p>Many American colleges and universities believe in the notion of a broad &quot;liberal arts education&quot;, which places an emphasis on all college students studying the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included <!--del_lnk--> Mortimer J. Adler and <!--del_lnk--> E.D. Hirsch.<p>The 1980 <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, <i>The Humanities in American Life</i>:<blockquote>
       <p>Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.</blockquote>
      <p>Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by many that see them as both expensive and relatively &quot;useless&quot; in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in many/most job fields. This is in direct contrast to the early 20th century when approximately 3% to 6% of the public at large had a university degree, and having one was a direct path to a professional life.<p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, many millions of veterans took advantage of the <!--del_lnk--> GI Bill. Further expansion of federal education grants and loans have expanded the number of adults in the United States that have attended a college or university to be at least 60% of the population. As a consequence, degrees in such things as literature, art history, classics, etc, are no longer viewed as viable career path options by many. As a result, many graduates find themselves returning to school to earn another degree or waiting much longer than average to kick off their career successfully.<p>Meanwhile, there are many changes and debates occurring today in the humanities:<p><a id="Questioning_distinctions" name="Questioning_distinctions"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Questioning distinctions</span></h4>
      <p>The very concept of the &lsquo;humanities&rsquo; as a class or kind, distinct from the &rsquo;sciences&rsquo;, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn.htm" title="Thomas Samuel Kuhn">T.S. Kuhn</a>&rsquo;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</i> argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Rorty has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty&rsquo;s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new &lsquo;fuzziness&rsquo;. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where&quot; the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, &lsquo;the humanities&rsquo; would no longer think of themselves as such....&quot;<p><a id="Modernism_and_postmodernism" name="Modernism_and_postmodernism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Modernism and postmodernism</span></h4>

      <p>In the United States, the late <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> saw a challenge to the &quot;elitism&quot; of the humanities, which <!--del_lnk--> Edward Said has characterized as a &quot;conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility.&quot; Such <!--del_lnk--> postmodernists argue that the humanities should go beyond the study of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> dead white males&quot; to include work by women and people of colour, and without religious bias. The French philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Michel Foucault has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in <i>The Order of Things</i> that &quot;we can study only individuals, not human nature.&quot;<p>However some in the humanities believe that such changes may be detrimental, as they lead to <!--del_lnk--> moral relativism and the concept that one person&#39;s interpretation is as good as any other. The literary critic <!--del_lnk--> Denis Donoghue suggests that modern criticism reduces the rich symbolism of a play like Macbeth to a simplistic &quot;find the villain&quot;, with Lady Macbeth regarded as the victim of bloody-minded, power-mad masculine society; the result is said to be what <!--del_lnk--> E. D. Hirsch Jr. refers to as declining <!--del_lnk--> cultural literacy.<p>The modernist considers that there is a canon of &quot;great works&quot; in literature and art which have an inherent quality, but the postmodernist argues that such ideas of greatness have been heavily biased by gender and culture. The modernist advocates <!--del_lnk--> close reading of a few works in literature, but the postmodernist generally favors more &quot;extensive reading&quot; of a large variety of works.<p><a id="National_institutions" name="National_institutions"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">National institutions</span></h4>
      <p>President <!--del_lnk--> Lyndon Johnson signed the <!--del_lnk--> National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act in 1965 <!--del_lnk--> , creating the National Council on the Humanities and funded the <!--del_lnk--> National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities.<p>NEH facilitated the creation of <!--del_lnk--> State Humanities Councils in the 56 U.S. states and territories. Each council operates independently, defining the &quot;humanities&quot; in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.<p><a id="Humanities_in_the_digital_age" name="Humanities_in_the_digital_age"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Humanities in the digital age</span></h3>
      <p>Language and literature are considered to lie at the heart of the humanities, so the impact of electronic communication is of great concern to those in the field. The immediacy of modern technology and the internet speeds up communication, but may threaten &quot;deferred&quot; forms of communication such as literature and &quot;dumb down&quot; language. The library is also changing rapidly as bookshelves are replaced by computer terminals. The humanities will have to adapt rapidly to these changes, though it is unlikely that the traditional pen and paper will disappear altogether.<p><a id="Terminology" name="Terminology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Terminology</span></h2>
