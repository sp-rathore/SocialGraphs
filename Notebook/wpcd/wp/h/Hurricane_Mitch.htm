      <p><b>Hurricane Mitch</b> was one of the deadliest and most powerful <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricane">hurricanes</a> observed on record, with maximum sustained winds of 180&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph (290&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h). The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the <!--del_lnk--> 1998 Atlantic hurricane season. At the time, Mitch was the strongest <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane ever observed in the month of October, though it has since been surpassed by <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Wilma of the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 season</a>. The hurricane also tied for the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane in recorded history, but it has since dropped to seventh.<p>Mitch formed in the western <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 22, and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions, it rapidly strengthened to peak at Category 5 status, the highest possible rating on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After drifting southwestward and weakening, the hurricane hit <a href="../../wp/h/Honduras.htm" title="Honduras">Honduras</a> as a minimal hurricane. It drifted through <!--del_lnk--> Central America, reformed in the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Campeche, and ultimately struck <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> as a strong tropical storm.<p>Due to its slow motion from <!--del_lnk--> October 29 to <!--del_lnk--> November 3, Hurricane Mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in Honduras and <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, with unofficial reports of up to 75 inches (1900&nbsp;mm). Deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in history; nearly 11,000 people were killed with over 8,000 left missing by the end of 1998. The flooding caused extreme damage, estimated at over $5 billion (1998 <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">USD</a>, $6 billion 2005 USD).<p>

      <p>The origin of Hurricane Mitch can be traced to a <!--del_lnk--> tropical wave that moved off the coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 10. It moved westward across the <!--del_lnk--> shear-ridden <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, and remained disorganized until entering the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 18. Upon entering the western Caribbean Sea, <!--del_lnk--> convection steadily increased, and on <!--del_lnk--> October 22, the wave organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen while 415 miles (670&nbsp;km) south of <!--del_lnk--> Kingston, Jamaica. Under weak steering currents, it drifted westward and intensified into a tropical storm on <!--del_lnk--> October 23 while 260 miles (420&nbsp;km) east-southeast of <!--del_lnk--> San Andr&eacute;s Island.<p>Initially, intensification was limited due to an upper-level low causing vertical <!--del_lnk--> wind shear over Tropical Storm Mitch. As the storm executed a small loop to the north, the shear weakened, allowing the system to strengthen. Mitch attained hurricane status on <!--del_lnk--> October 24 while 295 miles (475 km) south of Jamaica, and with warm water temperatures and well-defined outflow, the hurricane rapidly strengthened. During a 24-hour period from October 24 to the 25th, the central pressure dropped 52 <!--del_lnk--> mbar, and on <!--del_lnk--> October 26, Mitch reached peak intensity with 180 mph (290&nbsp;km/h) winds and a pressure of 905&nbsp;mbar, one of the lowest pressures ever recorded in an <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane.<div style="clear: left">

      <p>A ridge of high pressure forced the hurricane westward, resulting in land interaction with Honduras. This weakened Mitch slightly, and after passing over the <!--del_lnk--> Swan Islands on <!--del_lnk--> October 27, the hurricane steadily weakened. The ridge of high pressure built further, forcing the hurricane to drift southward along the Honduran coastline. Mitch made landfall 80 miles (130&nbsp;km) east of <!--del_lnk--> La Ceiba in Honduras on <!--del_lnk--> October 29 as a Category 1 hurricane on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale with 80 mph (130&nbsp;km/h) winds.

      <p>The remnant area of low pressure drifted northward into the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Campeche, and reorganized on <!--del_lnk--> November 3 into a tropical storm while 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) southwest of <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;rida, Yucat&aacute;n. Mitch moved to the northeast, making landfall on the <!--del_lnk--> Yucat&aacute;n Peninsula near <!--del_lnk--> Campeche on <!--del_lnk--> November 4. It weakened to a tropical depression over land, but restrengthened to a tropical storm over the southeastern <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. As Mitch accelerated to the northeast in association with a cold front, it gradually intensified, and made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Naples, Florida on <!--del_lnk--> November 5 as a tropical storm with 65 mph (100&nbsp;km/h) winds. Mitch became extratropical later that day, but it continued to persist for several days before losing its identity north of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> on <!--del_lnk--> November 9.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch&#39;s future was very uncertain, with the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre advising citizens throughout the area to closely monitor the hurricane. Just 2 days before landfall, there remained a possibility for the hurricane to spare Honduras and hit Guatemala or <a href="../../wp/b/Belize.htm" title="Belize">Belize</a>. Because of the uncertainty, government officials issued <!--del_lnk--> hurricane warnings from the Honduras/Nicaragua border to Belize from 2-3 days before landfall.<p>Due to the threat, the government of Honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the <!--del_lnk--> Bay Islands and prepared all air and naval resources. The government of Belize issued a red alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland. Because the hurricane threatened to strike near <!--del_lnk--> Belize City as a Category 4 hurricane, much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Hattie 37 years earlier. Guatemala issued a red alert as well, recommending boats to stay in port, telling people to prepare or seek shelter, and warning of potential overflown rivers. By the time Mitch made landfall, numerous people were evacuated along the western Caribbean coastline, including 100,000 in Honduras, 10,000 in Guatemala, and 20,000 in the Mexican state of <!--del_lnk--> Quintana Roo.<p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>

While the storm was drifting over the country, it dropped extreme rainfall peaking at nearly 36 inches (91&nbsp;cm) in <!--del_lnk--> Choluteca, where over 18 inches (46&nbsp;cm) of rain fell in one day. The rainfall in Choluteca was equivalent to the average rainfall total in 212 days. The <!--del_lnk--> Choluteca River at this point flooded to six times its normal width. The widespread flooding was partially caused by Honduras&#39; slash and burn agriculture, so the forests could not absorb any moisture. In addition, there were estimates of as high as 75 inches (190&nbsp;cm) in mountainous regions. The rainfall collected in rivers, causing extensive river flooding across the country. The deepest average depth was 12.5 meters on the <!--del_lnk--> Ul&uacute;a River near <!--del_lnk--> Chinda, while the average widest length was 359 meters on the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Lean near <!--del_lnk--> Arizona. The rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Mitch caused such massive and widespread damage that <!--del_lnk--> Honduran President <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the crops, totalling to about $900 million (1998 USD, $1 billion 2005 USD) in losses. An estimated 70-80% of the transportation infrastructure of the entire country was wiped out, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads; the damage was so great that existing maps were rendered obsolete. About 25 small villages were reported to have been entirely destroyed by the landslides caused by the storm. Damages to the transportation and communication network totaled to $529 million (1998 USD, $671 million 2005 USD). Across the country, the storm destroyed 33,000 houses and damaged 50,000 others. In addition, it downed numerous trees, leaving mountainsides bare and more vulnerable to mudslides. <div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Mitch&#39;s rainfall resulted in severe crop losses in the country, affecting more than 300 sq. miles (800 km&sup2;) or 29% of the country&#39;s arable land. The flooding led to severe losses in food crops, including 58% of the corn output, 24% of sorghum, 14% of rice, and 6% of the bean crop. Several important export crops faced similar losses, including 85% of banana, 60% of sugar cane, 29% of melons, 28% of African palms, and 18% of coffee. Crop damage alone totaled to more than $1.7 billion (1998 USD, $1.97 billion 2005 USD). Large amounts of animal losses occurred as well, including the death of 50,000 bovines and the losses of 60% of the fowl population. Shrimp production, which had become an important export, faced nearly complete destruction. Total animal losses amounted to $300 million (1998 USD, $348 million 2005 USD).<p>The extreme flooding and mudslides killed over 6,500, with several thousand missing. Many of the unidentified were buried in mass graves, resulting in great uncertainty over the final death toll. Over 20% of the country&#39;s population, possibly as many as 1.5 million people, were left homeless. The severe crop shortages left many villages on the brink of starvation, while lack of sanitation led to outbreaks of <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dengue fever, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a>.<p>On the offshore island of <!--del_lnk--> Guanaja, the hurricane spent three days stalling near the island. Strong winds destroyed one third of the island&#39;s houses and left most citizens without power for months. The island&#39;s two fish packing plants were damaged while two main resorts were closed. Guanaja, whose people rely on each other and the ocean, received little help from the Honduran government including some plastic tarps and soldiers. The government, which usually ignores the 9 mile long (14&nbsp;km) island, faced larger problems on the mainland. Instead, international aid arrived from former Guanaja citizens.<p><a id="Nicaragua" name="Nicaragua"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nicaragua</span></h3>

      <p>Though Mitch never entered <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, its large circulation caused extensive rainfall, with estimates of over 50 inches (127&nbsp;cm). In some places, as much as 25 inches (64&nbsp;cm) of rain fell on coastal areas. The crater lake in the <!--del_lnk--> Casita volcano overflowed from excessive rain. This caused its walls to collapse, resulting in a <!--del_lnk--> mudslide that ultimately covered an area 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) long and 5 miles (8&nbsp;km) wide.<p>Two million people in Nicaragua were directly affected by the hurricane. Across the country, Mitch&#39;s heavy rains damaged 17,600 houses and destroyed 23,900, displacing 368,300 of the population. 340 schools and 90 health centers were severely damaged or destroyed. Sewage systems and the electricity subsector were severely damaged, and, combined with property, damage totaled to $300 million (1998 USD, $348 million 2005 USD).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Transportation was greatly affected by the hurricane, as well. The rainfall left 70% of the roads unusable and destroyed or greatly damaged 71 bridges. Over 1,700 miles (2700&nbsp;km) of highways or access roads needed replacement subsequent to the storm, especially in the northern part of the country and along portions of the <!--del_lnk--> Pan-American Highway. Total transportation damage amounted to $300 million (1998 USD, $348 million 2005 USD). Agricultural losses were significant, including the deaths of 50,000 animals, mostly bovines. Crops and fisheries were affected greatly as well, and, combined with agricultural losses, damage totaled to $185 million (1998 USD, $214 million 2005 USD).<p>The situation was further compounded by a total of 75,000 live <!--del_lnk--> land mines &mdash; left over from the <!--del_lnk--> Contra insurgency of the 1980s &mdash; that were calculated to have been uprooted and relocated by the floodwaters.<p>In all, Hurricane Mitch caused at least 3,800 fatalities in Nicaragua, of which more than 2,000 were killed from the mudslide at the Casitas volcano. The mudslide buried at least four villages completely in several feet of mud. Throughout the entire country, the hurricane left between 500,000 and 800,000 homeless. In all, damage in Nicaragua is estimated at around $1 billion (1998 USD, $1.16 billion 2005 USD).<p><a id="Caribbean_Sea" name="Caribbean_Sea"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caribbean Sea</span></h3>
      <p>Mitch was also responsible for the loss of the <i>Fantome</i> <!--del_lnk--> windjammer sailing ship owned by <!--del_lnk--> Windjammer Barefoot Cruises; all 31 of the crew perished. The story was recorded in the book <i>The Ship and The Storm</i> by Jim Carrier (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-07-135526-X). The ship, which was sailing in the centre of the hurricane, experienced up to 50 foot (15&nbsp;m) waves and over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) winds, causing the <i>Fantome</i> to sink off the coast of Honduras.<p>On the south coast of <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the hurricane caused waves of up to 13 feet (4&nbsp;m) high and winds gusts peaking at 42&nbsp;mph (67&nbsp;km/h), causing numerous tourists and workers on the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Youth and <!--del_lnk--> Cayo Largo del Sur to leave for safer grounds.<p>In <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, where officials declared hurricane warnings 12 hours prior to its closest approach, Mitch caused moderate rainfall and gusty winds for days. Strong waves hit western Jamaica, with wave heights unofficially estimated at nearly 7 feet (2&nbsp;m) in height. The rainfall in outer rainbands, at times severe, flooded many roads across the island and left them covered with debris. One house in <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Town collapsed from the flooding, leaving four homeless. Many other homes and buildings were flooded, forcing many to evacuate. A river in northeastern Jamaica overflowed its banks, while heavy rainfall across the mountainous parts of the country caused numerous mudslides. In all, Mitch killed three people on Jamaica.<p>On the <a href="../../wp/c/Cayman_Islands.htm" title="Cayman Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, the hurricane caused strong waves, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall at times. Damage was relatively minimal, amounting to blown out windows and beach erosion. Strong waves damaged or destroyed many docks on the south shore of the islands, and also sank one dive ship near <!--del_lnk--> Grand Cayman. In addition, numerous incoming and outgoing flights were cancelled.<p><a id="Rest_of_Latin_and_Central_America" name="Rest_of_Latin_and_Central_America"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rest of Latin and Central America</span></h3>

      <p>Due to Mitch&#39;s large circulation, it dropped heavy precipitation as far south as <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a>, especially in the <!--del_lnk--> Dari&eacute;n and <!--del_lnk--> Chiriqu&iacute; provinces. The flooding washed away a few roads and bridges, and damaged numerous houses and schools, leaving thousands homeless. The hurricane left three casualties in Panama.<p>In <a href="../../wp/c/Costa_Rica.htm" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, Mitch dropped heavy rains, causing flash flooding and mudslides across the country, mostly in the northeastern part of the country. The storm impacted 2,135 homes to some degree, of which 242 were destroyed, leaving 4,000 homeless. Throughout the country, the rainfall and mudslides affected 126 bridges and 800 miles (1300 km) or roads, mostly on the <!--del_lnk--> Inter-American Highway which was affected by <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Cesar, two years prior. Mitch affected 115 sq. miles (300 km&sup2;) of crop lands, causing damage to both export and domestic crops. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $92 million in damage (1998 USD, $107 million 2005 USD) and seven deaths.<p>While drifting through <a href="../../wp/e/El_Salvador.htm" title="El Salvador">El Salvador</a>, the hurricane dropped immense amounts of precipitation, resulting in flash flooding and mudslides through the country. Multiple rivers, including the <!--del_lnk--> R&iacute;o Grande de San Miguel and the <!--del_lnk--> Lempa River overflowed, contributing to overall damage. The flooding damaged more than 10,000 houses, leaving around 59,000 homeless and forcing 500,000 to evacuate. Crop damage was severe, with serious flooding occurring on 386 sq. miles (1000&nbsp;km&sup2;) of pasture or crop land. The flooding destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% of the corn production, and 20% losses in sugar canes. There were heavy losses in livestock as well, including the deaths of 10,000 cattle. Total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to $154 million (1998 USD, $176 million 2005 USD). In addition, the flooding destroyed two bridges and damaged 1,200 miles (2000&nbsp;km) of unpaved roads. In all, Mitch caused nearly $400 million in damage (1998 USD, $464 million 2005 USD) and 240 deaths.<p>Similar to the rest of Central America, Mitch&#39;s heavy rains caused mudslides and severe flooding over <a href="../../wp/g/Guatemala.htm" title="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>. The flooding destroyed 6,000 houses and damaged 20,000 others, displacing over 730,000 and forcing over 100,000 to evacuate. In addition, the flooding destroyed 27 schools and damaged 286 others, 175 severely. Flooding caused major damage to crops, while landslides destroyed crop land across the country. The most severely affected crops for domestic consumption were tomatoes, bananas, corn, other vegetables, and beans, with damaged totaling to $48 million (1998 USD, $52 million 2005 USD). Export crops such as bananas or coffee were greatly damaged as well, with damage amounting to $325 million (1998 USD, $375 million 2005 USD). Damage to plantations and soil totaled to $121 million (1998 USD, $140 million 2005 USD). The flooding also caused severe damage to the transportation infrastructure, including the loss of 37 bridges. Across the country, flooding damaged or destroyed 840 miles (1350&nbsp;km) or roads, of which nearly 400 miles (640&nbsp;km) were sections of major highways. In all, Hurricane Mitch caused $748 million (1998 USD, $867 million 2005 USD) and 268 deaths in Guatemala. In addition, Mitch caused 11 indirect deaths when a plane crashed during the storm.<p>In <a href="../../wp/b/Belize.htm" title="Belize">Belize</a>, the hurricane was less severe than initially predicted, though Mitch still caused heavy rainfall across the country. Numerous rivers exceeded their crests, though the rainfall was benefical to trees in mountainous areas. The flooding caused extensive crop damage and destroyed many roads. Throughout the country, eleven people died because of the hurricane.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Then a tropical storm, Mitch caused a storm surge of up to four feet in the lower <!--del_lnk--> Florida Keys before making landfall on the <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> west coast. <!--del_lnk--> Key West International Airport reported peak wind gusts of 55 mph (89&nbsp;km/h) )and sustained winds of 40 mph (64&nbsp;km/h), the only report of tropical storm force in the state. In addition, Mitch caused moderate rainfall, peaking at seven inches (18&nbsp;cm) in <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter, though some estimates indicate localized totals of up to 10 inches (25&nbsp;cm). The storm spawned five tornadoes over the state, of which the strongest was an <!--del_lnk--> F2.<p>In the Florida Keys, multiple buildings that had been damaged by <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Georges.htm" title="Hurricane Georges">Hurricane Georges</a> were leveled by Mitch. Tornadoes from the storm damaged or destroyed 645 houses across the state, as well as injuring 65 people. Gusty winds left 100,000 without power during the storm&#39;s passage.

      <p>After the disaster caused by Hurricane Mitch, countries around the world donated significant aid, including $6.3 billion (1998 USD, $7.3 billion 2005 USD). Throughout <!--del_lnk--> Central America, which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996, many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy. In addition, after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes, the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring again.<p>Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structually improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.<p>Following the passage of Mitch, disease outbreaks occurred throughout Central America, including <a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">cholera</a>, <!--del_lnk--> leptospirosis, and <!--del_lnk--> dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34 people. Guatemala was most affected by the virus, where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>While stalling over the western Caribbean Sea, Mitch&#39;s strong winds produced strong waves, damaging local <!--del_lnk--> coral reefs. Later, the storm&#39;s immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water. This resulted in diseases occurring within the coral. However, the hurricane&#39;s upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures, preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reef.<p>Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them a few days after the storm. They also at first offered only $2 million (1998 USD, $2.3 million 2005 USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70 million (1998 USD, $81 million 2005 USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4 million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In <a href="../../wp/c/Costa_Rica.htm" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h3>
