      <p>The <b>history of saffron</b> cultivation and usage reaches back more than 3,000 years and spans many cultures, continents, and civilisations. <a href="../../wp/s/Saffron.htm" title="Saffron">Saffron</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> spice derived from the dried <!--del_lnk--> stigmas of the saffron crocus (<i>Crocus sativus</i>), has remained among the world&#39;s most costly substances throughout history. With its bitter taste, hay-like fragrance, and slight metallic notes, saffron has been used as a <!--del_lnk--> seasoning, <!--del_lnk--> fragrance, <!--del_lnk--> dye, and <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>. Saffron is native to <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Asia, but was first cultivated in <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>.<p>The wild precursor of domesticated saffron crocus is <i>Crocus cartwrightianus</i>. Human cultivators <!--del_lnk--> bred <i>C. cartwrightianus</i> specimens by selecting for plants with abnormally long stigmas. Thus, sometime in late <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> <!--del_lnk--> Crete, a mutant form of <i>C. cartwrightianus</i>, <i>C. sativus</i>, emerged. Saffron was first documented in a 7th-century BC <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> botanical reference compiled under <!--del_lnk--> Ashurbanipal. Since then, documentation of saffron&#39;s use over a span of 4,000 years in the treatment of some ninety illnesses has been uncovered. Saffron slowly spread throughout much of <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia, later reaching parts of <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, and <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>.<p>

      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Greco-Roman classical period (8th century BC to the 3rd century <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>), the saffron harvest is first portrayed in the palace <!--del_lnk--> frescoes of <!--del_lnk--> Minoan Crete, which depict the flowers being picked by young girls and monkeys. One of these fresco sites is located in the &quot;Xeste 3&quot; building at Akrotiri, on the Greek island of <a href="../../wp/s/Santorini.htm" title="Santorini">Santorini</a> (also known to ancient Greeks as <!--del_lnk--> Thera). The &quot;Xeste 3&quot; frescoes have been dated from 1600&ndash;1500 BC. Various other dates have been given, such as 3000&ndash;1100 BC and the 17th century BC. They portray a Greek goddess supervising the plucking of flowers and the picking of stigmas for use in the manufacture of a therapeutic drug. A fresco from the same site also depicts a woman who uses saffron to treat a bleeding foot. These Theran frescoes are the first botanically accurate pictorial representations of saffron&#39;s use as an herbal remedy. However, the two saffron-growing Minoan settlements of Thera and Acrotiri, both on Santorini, were ultimately destroyed by a powerful earthquake and subsequent volcanic eruption sometime between 1645 and 1500 BC. Much of the original island&#39;s central portion sank underwater, and saffron harvests there were severely curtailed. Yet the volcanic ash from the destruction entombed and helped preserve the saffron frescoes.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Ancient Greek legends told of brazen sailors embarking on long and perilous voyages to the remote land of <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia. There they hoped to procure what they believed was the world&#39;s most valuable saffron. The best-known Greek legend involving saffron was that detailing the tragedy of Crocus and Smilax: The handsome youth Crocus sets out on a pursuit of the <!--del_lnk--> nymph Smilax in the woods near <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>. They enjoy a brief period of idyllic love in which she is initially flattered by the amorous advances. Soon, however, Smilax tires of Crocus. After he continues to pursue her against her wishes, she resorts to bewitching him. He is thus transformed into a saffron crocus flower, with its radiant orange stigmas remaining as a faint symbol of Crocus&#39;s continuing passion for Smilax. The tragedy and the spice would be recalled later by <!--del_lnk--> Ovid:<dl>

      <p>For the peoples of the ancient Mediterranean, the saffron gathered in the Cilician coastal town of <!--del_lnk--> Soli was the most valued, particularly for use in perfumes and ointments.

She used it before encounters with men in belief that the saffron would make lovemaking more pleasurable. Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments. Indeed, when stomach pains progressed into internal haemorrhaging, an Egyptian treatment consisted of saffron crocus seeds mixed and crushed together with <i>aager</i>-tree remnants, ox fat, coriander, and myrrh. These together comprised an ointment or <!--del_lnk--> poultice that was to be applied to the body. The physicians expected this to then &quot;[expel] blood through the mouth or rectum which resembles hog&#39;s blood when it is cooked.&quot; Urinary tract conditions were also treated with an oil-based emulsion of premature saffron flowers mixed with roasted beans; this was used topically on men.

      <p>Saffron in Greco-Roman times was widely traded across the Mediterranean by the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians. Their customers ranged from perfumers in <!--del_lnk--> Rosetta, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to physicians in <!--del_lnk--> Gaza to townsfolk in <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes, who wore pouches of saffron in order to mask the presence of malodorous fellow citizens during outings to the theatre. For the Greeks saffron was widely associated with professional courtesans and retainers known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> hetaerae</i>. In addition, large dye works operating in <!--del_lnk--> Sidon and <!--del_lnk--> Tyre used saffron baths as a substitute. There, royal robes were triple-dipped in deep purple dyes; for the robes of royal pretenders and commoners, the last two dips were replaced with a saffron dip instead, which gave a less intense purple hue.<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans also prized saffron for its use as a perfume and deodoriser. They scattered about public spaces such as royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres. Upon Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Nero&#39;s entrance into <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, they even spread it along the streets. Indeed, wealthy Romans made daily use of saffron baths. They also used saffron as mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, used it in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the <!--del_lnk--> Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD.<p><a id="Middle_Eastern" name="Middle_Eastern"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Middle Eastern</span></h2>

      <p>Saffron-based pigments have been found in the prehistoric paints used to depict beasts in 50,000-year-old cave art in what is today <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Later, the Sumerians used saffron as an ingredient in their remedies and magical potions. However, Sumerians did not actively cultivate saffron. They instead chose to gather their stores from wild flowers only, because they felt that only divine intervention would enable saffron&#39;s medicinal properties. Such evidence indeed provides evidence that saffron was an article of long-distance trade before Crete&#39;s Minoan palace culture reached a peak in the 2nd millennium BC. Saffron was also honoured as a sweet-smelling spice over three millennia ago in the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> <!--del_lnk--> Tanakh:<dl>

      <p>In ancient Persia saffron (<i>Crocus sativus</i> &#39;Hausknechtii&#39;) was cultivated at Derbena and <!--del_lnk--> Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads have been found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshipers as a ritual offering to deities. It was also used as a brilliant yellow dye, a perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of <!--del_lnk--> melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and <!--del_lnk--> aphrodisiac. Such was the fear of this that travellers to Persia were forewarned about eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved along with <!--del_lnk--> sandalwood into water for use as a body wash for use after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and his forces during their Asian campaigns. There, they mixed saffron into their teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander himself used saffron sprinkled in warm water as a bath. He hoped that it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. Indeed, he recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron&#39;s perceived curative properties, indeed continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia. Saffron cultivation also reached what is now <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, with harvesting concentrated around the northern town of <!--del_lnk--> Safranbolu; the area still known for its annual saffron harvest festivals.<p><a id="Indian_and_Chinese" name="Indian_and_Chinese"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Indian and Chinese</span></h2>
      <p>Various conflicting accounts exist that describe saffron&#39;s first arrival in <!--del_lnk--> South and <!--del_lnk--> East Asia. The first of these rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers&#39; efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They accomplished this by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Another variant of this theory states that, after ancient Persia conquered <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, Persian saffron crocus corms were transplanted to Kashmiri soil. The first harvest then occurred sometime prior to 500 BC. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron was used in the treatment of <!--del_lnk--> melancholy and as a fabric dye.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>On the other hand, traditional Kashmiri legends state that saffron first arrived sometime during the 11th and 12th centuries AD, when two foreign and itinerant <!--del_lnk--> Sufi ascetics, Khwaja Masood Wali and Hazrat Sheikh Shariffudin, wandered into Kashmir. The foreigners, having fallen sick, beseeched a cure for illness from a local tribal chieftain. When the chieftain obliged, the two holy men reputedly gave them a saffron crocus bulb as payment and thanks. To this day, grateful prayers are offered to the two saints during the saffron harvesting season in late autumn. The saints, indeed, have a golden-domed shrine and tomb dedicated to them in the saffron-trading village of Pampore, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. However, the Kashmiri poet and scholar Mohammed Yusuf Teng disputes this. He states that Kashmiris had cultivated saffron for more than two millennia. Indeed, such ancient indigenous cultivation is alluded to in Kashmiri Tantric Hindu epics of that time.<p>Ancient Chinese Buddhist accounts from the <i>Mula-<!--del_lnk--> sarvastivadin</i> monastic order (or <i><a href="../../wp/v/Vinaya.htm" title="Vinaya">vinaya</a></i>) present yet another account of saffron&#39;s arrival in India. According to legend, an <i><!--del_lnk--> arhat</i> Indian Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> missionary by the name of Madhy&acirc;ntika (or Majjhantika) was sent to Kashmir in the 5th century BC. When he got there, he reportedly sowed Kashmir&#39;s first saffron crop. From there, saffron use spread throughout the Indian subcontinent. In addition to use in foods, saffron stigmas were also soaked in water to yield a golden-yellow solution that was used as a fabric dye. Such was the love of the resulting fabric that, immediately after the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha Siddhartha Guatama</a>&#39;s death, his attendant monks decreed saffron as the official colour for <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist robes and mantles.<p>Some historians believe that saffron first came to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> with Mongol invaders by way of Persia. Yet saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts, including the vast <i>Pun Tsao</i> (&quot;<i>Great Herbal</i>&quot;) pharmacopoeia (pp. 1552&ndash;78), a tome dating from around 1600 BC (and attributed to Emperor Shen-Ung) which documents thousands of phytochemical-based medical treatments for various disorders. Yet around the 3rd century AD, the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance. For example, Wan Zhen, a Chinese medical expert, reported that &quot;[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.&quot; Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time: &quot;The [saffron crocus] flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained. It is valued for its uniform yellow colour. It can be used to aromatise wine.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Saffron cultivation in Europe declined steeply following the fall of the Roman Empire. For several centuries thereafter, saffron cultivation was rare or non-existent throughout Europe. This was reversed when Moorish civilisation spread from North Africa to settle most of Spain as well as parts of France and southern Italy. One theory states that Moors reintroduced saffron corms to the region around <!--del_lnk--> Poitiers after they lost the famous battle there to <!--del_lnk--> Charles Martel in AD 732. Two centuries after their conquest of Spain, Moors would plant saffron throughout the southern provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Andalucia, <!--del_lnk--> Castile, <!--del_lnk--> La Mancha, and <!--del_lnk--> Valencia.<p>When the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1350, demand for saffron and its cultivation skyrocketed. It was coveted by plague victims for its medicinal properties, even though many European farmers capable of growing it died off. Large quantities of saffron imports thus came from non-European lands. Yet the finest saffron threads from Muslim lands were unavailable to Europeans because of hostilities beginning with the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>. Thus imports from places such as <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes supplied central and northern Europe. Saffron was one of the contested points of hostility that flared between the declining nobleman classes and increasingly wealthy merchants. For example, the fourteen-week-long &quot;Saffron War&quot; was ignited when an 800-pound shipment of saffron was hijacked and stolen by noblemen. The saffron load, which had been destined for the town of <a href="../../wp/b/Basel.htm" title="Basel">Basel</a>, would at today&#39;s market prices be valued at more than US$500,000. That shipment was eventually returned, but the saffron trade in the 13th century remained the subject of mass theft and piracy. Indeed, pirates plying Mediterranean waters would often ignore gold stores and instead steal Venetian- and Genoan-marketed saffron bound for Europe. The ordinary people of Basel, wary of such future piracy, thus planted their own corms. After several years of large and lucrative saffron harvests, Basel grew extremely prosperous compared to other European towns. Basel attempted to protect its status by outlawing the transportation of corms outside the town&#39;s borders; guards were posted to prevent thieves from picking flowers or digging up corms. Nevertheless, after ten years the saffron crop failed, and Basel abandoned cultivation.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The centre of central European saffron trade then moved to <!--del_lnk--> Nuremberg, while the merchants of <!--del_lnk--> Venice continued their dominance of the Mediterranean sea trade. There, saffron varieties from <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Crete, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> were sold. Also sold were many adulterated samples, including those soaked in honey, mixed with <!--del_lnk--> marigold petals, or kept in damp cellars in order to increase the saffron threads&#39; weight. This prompted Nuremberg authorities to pass the so-called <i>Safranschou</i> code, which sought to regulate saffron trading. Saffron adulterers were thereafter fined, imprisoned, and executed via <!--del_lnk--> immolation. Soon after, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> emerged as a major European saffron producer. Saffron, according to one theory, spread to the coastal regions of eastern England in the 14th century AD during the reign of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a>. In subsequent years saffron was fleetingly cultivated throughout England. <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk.htm" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk were especially heavily planted with corms. However, long-term saffron cultivation only survived in the light, well-drained, and chalk-based soils of the <!--del_lnk--> Essex countryside. Indeed, the Essex town of <!--del_lnk--> Saffron Walden got its name as a saffron trading centre. Yet as England transitioned out of the Middle Ages, rising puritanical sentiments and new conquests abroad endangered English saffron&#39;s usage and cultivation. Puritanical advocates favoured more austere, simple, and un-spiced foods. In addition, an influx of additional spices from Eastern lands due to the growing <!--del_lnk--> spice trade meant that the English, as well as other Europeans, had more seasonings to choose from.<p>This trend was documented by Reverend William Herbert, who was the Dean of <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. He collected samples and compiled information on many aspects of the saffron crocus. He was concerned about the steady decline in saffron cultivation over the 17th century and the dawn of the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. This was due to the introduction in Europe of such easily grown crops as <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a>, which steadily took over lands formerly dedicated to saffron corms. In addition, the elite who traditionally comprised the bulk of the saffron market were now growing increasingly interested in such exotic and new arrivals as <a href="../../wp/c/Chocolate.htm" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tea.htm" title="Tea">tea</a>, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vanilla.htm" title="Vanilla">vanilla</a>. Indeed, only in the south of France, Italy, and Spain, where saffron had been deeply incorporated into the local cultures, did significant cultivation remain.<p><a id="North_American" name="North_American"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">North American</span></h2>

      <p>Saffron made its way to the <!--del_lnk--> Americas when thousands of <!--del_lnk--> Alsacian, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a>, and Swiss <!--del_lnk--> Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania, in the <!--del_lnk--> Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to America in a trunk owned by German adherents of a Protestant sect known as the <!--del_lnk--> Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, were great lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Soon, Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodity exchange was set equal to that of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>.<p>However, the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 destroyed many of the merchant vessels that transported American saffron abroad. Pennsylvanian saffron growers were afterwards left with surplus inventory, and trade with the Caribbean markets never recovered. Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Dutch growers developed many uses for saffron in their own home cooking, including cakes, noodles, and chicken or trout dishes. Saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Citations</span></h2>
