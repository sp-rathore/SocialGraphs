      <p><b>Hampshire</b>, sometimes historically <b>Southamptonshire</b> or <b>Hamptonshire</b>, (abbr. <i>Hants</i>) is a <!--del_lnk--> county on the south coast of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The county borders <i>(clockwise from West)</i>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, <!--del_lnk--> Berkshire, <!--del_lnk--> Surrey and <!--del_lnk--> West Sussex. The county has an area of 1,455 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (3,769 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;) and at its widest points is approximately 55 miles (90 km) east-west and 40 miles (65 km) north-south. The <!--del_lnk--> county town is <!--del_lnk--> Winchester situated at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;03&prime;35&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&deg;18&prime;36&Prime;W</span></span>. The <!--del_lnk--> 2001 census gave the population of the administrative county as 1.24 million; the ceremonial county also includes the cities of <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, which are administratively independent, and has a total population of 1.6 million. <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch and <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth, within the <!--del_lnk--> historic borders of the county, were made part of the non-metropolitan county of <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> in 1974.<p>Hampshire is a popular holiday area, with tourist attractions including its many seaside resorts, the maritime area in Portsmouth, and the motor museum at <!--del_lnk--> Beaulieu. The <a href="../../wp/n/New_Forest.htm" title="New Forest">New Forest</a> <!--del_lnk--> National Park lies within the borders, as does a large area of the <!--del_lnk--> South Downs, which is also scheduled to become a National Park. Hampshire has a long maritime history and two of England&#39;s largest ports lie on its coast. The county is famed as home of the writers <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>.<p>

      <p>Hampshire&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> falls into two categories. In the south, along the <!--del_lnk--> coast is the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hampshire Basin&quot;, an area of relatively <!--del_lnk--> non-resistant <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clays</a> and <!--del_lnk--> gravels which are protected from <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a> <!--del_lnk--> erosion by the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. These low, flat lands support <!--del_lnk--> heathland and <!--del_lnk--> woodland <!--del_lnk--> habitats, a large area of which form part of the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Forest.htm" title="New Forest">New Forest</a>. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">diverse wildlife</a>. The forest is protected as a <a href="../../wp/n/National_parks_of_England_and_Wales.htm" title="National parks of England and Wales">national park</a>, limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland <!--del_lnk--> plagioclimax by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the weak rock and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large <!--del_lnk--> estuaries and <!--del_lnk--> rias, notably the 12 mile (19 km) long <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Water and the large convoluted <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth Harbour. The Isle of Wight lies off the coast of Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away forming the <!--del_lnk--> Solent.<p>In the north and centre of the county the substrate is the <!--del_lnk--> Southern England Chalk Formation of <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury Plain and the <!--del_lnk--> South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a <!--del_lnk--> scarp onto the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">Thames valley</a> to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is <!--del_lnk--> Pilot Hill, which reaches the height of 286 m (938 ft). The <!--del_lnk--> downland supports a <!--del_lnk--> calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> insects. In the past Hampshire had little <!--del_lnk--> arable agriculture, but in the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> the demand for food led to the establishment of farms on the downs. A large area of the downs are now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire <!--del_lnk--> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty The <!--del_lnk--> Itchen and <!--del_lnk--> Test are <a href="../../wp/t/Trout.htm" title="Trout">trout</a> rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Nestled in a valley on the downs is <!--del_lnk--> Selborne, and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert White&#39;s pioneering observations on <!--del_lnk--> natural history.<p>Hampshire has a milder <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> than most areas of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, being in the far south with the climate stabilising effect of the sea, but protected against the more extreme weather of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast. Hampshire has a higher average annual temperature than the UK average at 9.8 &deg;C to 12 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> C, average rainfall at 741&ndash;1060 <!--del_lnk--> mm per year, and higher than average sunshine at over 1541 <!--del_lnk--> hours per year.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the <!--del_lnk--> neolithic, and these settlers built <!--del_lnk--> hill forts such as <!--del_lnk--> Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an area named <i>Gwent</i> or <i>Y Went</i> by the Celts, which also covered areas of Somerset and Wiltshire. In the <!--del_lnk--> Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces. The county was occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Jutish tribes until <!--del_lnk--> Saxon times. Hampshire was one of the first Saxon <!--del_lnk--> shires, recorded in <!--del_lnk--> 755, but for two centuries represented the western end of Saxon England, as advances into <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Somerset were fought off by the Britons. After the Saxons advanced west Hampshire became the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful <!--del_lnk--> King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>.<p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Forest.htm" title="New Forest">New Forest</a> as a hunting forest. The county was recorded in the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> divided into 44 <!--del_lnk--> hundreds. From the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established.<p>Over several centuries a series of <!--del_lnk--> castles and <!--del_lnk--> forts were constructed along the coast of the <!--del_lnk--> Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Norman <!--del_lnk--> Portchester Castle which overlooks <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> including <!--del_lnk--> Hurst Castle, situated on a sand <!--del_lnk--> spit at the mouth of the Solent, <!--del_lnk--> Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and <!--del_lnk--> Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as <!--del_lnk--> Poole and <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mayflower</i> and the <i><a href="../../wp/r/RMS_Titanic.htm" title="RMS Titanic">Titanic</a></i>, the latter being staffed largely by Hampshire natives.<p>Hampshire played a large role in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> due to its large <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at <!--del_lnk--> Aldershot and the military <!--del_lnk--> Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on <!--del_lnk--> Salisbury Plain and <!--del_lnk--> Purbeck. <!--del_lnk--> Supermarine, the designers of the <a href="../../wp/s/Supermarine_Spitfire.htm" title="Supermarine Spitfire">Spitfire</a> and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army&#39;s main permanent camps.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The county has in the past been called &quot;Southamptonshire&quot; and appears as such on some <!--del_lnk--> Victorian maps. The name of the <!--del_lnk--> administrative county was changed from &#39;County of Southampton&#39; to &#39;County of Hampshire&#39; on <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1959. The short form of the name, often used in postal addresses, is <i>Hants</i>. Hampshire is often abbreviated in written form to Hants and which sometimes gives rise to puzzlement. The abbreviated form is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Old English Hantum plus Scir (meaning a district governed from the settlement now known as Southampton) and the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons called it Hamtunschire. At the time of the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> (1086) this was compressed to Hantescire.<p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a> has traditionally been treated as part of Hampshire for some purposes, but has been administratively independent for over a century, obtaining a <!--del_lnk--> county council of its own in <!--del_lnk--> 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial county in <!--del_lnk--> 1974. Apart from a shared police force and health authority there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, though many organisations still combine Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.<p>The towns of <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth and <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch also fall within the traditional county of Hampshire, but were ceded to <a href="../../wp/d/Dorset.htm" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> in the local government reorganisation of 1974.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Hampshire is a relatively affluent county, with a <!--del_lnk--> Gross domestic product (GDP) of <!--del_lnk--> &pound;22.9 billion (&pound;16.3 billion when excluding Southampton and Portsmouth). This makes it the sixth largest economy in England, and is equal in size to the economy of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, making up 2% each of the economy of the UK as a whole.<p>Portsmouth and Winchester have the highest job densities in the county, and there is therefore a high level of commuting into the cities. Southampton has the highest number of total jobs and commuting both into and out of the city is high. The county has a lower level of <!--del_lnk--> unemployment than the national average, at 1.9% when the national rate was 3.3%, and as of March 2005 has fallen to 1.1%. 39% are employed by large firms, compared to a national average of 42%. Hampshire has a considerably higher than national average employment in high-tech industries, but average levels in knowledge based industry. 25.21% of the population work in the <!--del_lnk--> public sector.<p>Many rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, though the county was less agricultural than most surrounding counties, and was mostly concentrated on <!--del_lnk--> dairy farming. The significance of agriculture as an employer and wealth creator has declined since the first half of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> and agriculture currently employs 1.32% of the population. The county has a long association with <!--del_lnk--> wild boar, and the domesticated <i><!--del_lnk--> Hampshire hog</i> breed of <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pig</a>, from which <!--del_lnk--> bacon is produced.<p>The <a href="../../wp/n/New_Forest.htm" title="New Forest">New Forest</a> area is a <!--del_lnk--> National Park, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5 million visitors in 1992. The <!--del_lnk--> South Downs and the cities of Southampton and Winchester also attract tourists to the county. <!--del_lnk--> Southampton Boat Show is one of the biggest annual events held in the county, and attracts visitors from throughout the country. In 2003 the county had a total of 31 million day visits, and 4.2 million longer stays.<p>The cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are both significant ports, with Southampton handling a large proportion of the national container freight and Portsmouth housing a large <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> base. The docks have traditionally been large employers in these cities, though again mechanisation has forced diversification of the economy.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

Austen lived most of her life in Hampshire, where her father was rector of <!--del_lnk--> Steventon, and wrote all of her novels in the county. Hampshire also has many <!--del_lnk--> visual art connections, claiming the painter <!--del_lnk--> John Everett Millais as a native, and the cities and countryside have been the subject of paintings by <a href="../../wp/l/L._S._Lowry.htm" title="L. S. Lowry">L. S. Lowry</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/J._M._W._Turner.htm" title="J. M. W. Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>. Hampshire is also the birthplace of explorer <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Oates, and entertainers <!--del_lnk--> Benny Hill and <!--del_lnk--> Craig David.<p>Hampshire&#39;s relatively safe waters have allowed the county to develop as one of the busiest <!--del_lnk--> sailing areas in the country, with many <!--del_lnk--> yacht clubs and several manufacturers on the Solent. The sport <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a> was largely developed in south-east England, with one of the first teams forming at <!--del_lnk--> Hambledon in <!--del_lnk--> 1750. <!--del_lnk--> Hampshire County Cricket Club today is a successful <!--del_lnk--> first-class team, captained by <!--del_lnk--> Shane Warne. Hampshire has several <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Association football">association football</a> teams, the most successful being <!--del_lnk--> Premier League side <!--del_lnk--> Portsmouth F.C. and <!--del_lnk--> Championship side <!--del_lnk--> Southampton F.C., which have traditionally been fierce rivals.<p>Hampshire&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> county flower is the <!--del_lnk--> Dog Rose according to the British charity <!--del_lnk--> Plantlife.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
