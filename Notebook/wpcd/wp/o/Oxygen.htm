      <p>Oxygen is a major component of air, produced by plants during <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, and is necessary for aerobic respiration in animals. The word <i>oxygen</i> derives from two roots in <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <i>&omicron;&xi;&upsilon;&sigmaf; (oxys)</i> (acid, sharp) and <i>-&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; (-gen&#x113;s)</i> (born of). In the early 18th century, <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> coined the name oxygen from the Greek roots mentioned above because he erroneously thought that it was a constituent of all acids. (The <!--del_lnk--> definition of acid has since been revised).<p>At <!--del_lnk--> standard temperature and pressure, oxygen exists as a diatomic molecule with the formula O<sub>2</sub>, in which the two oxygen atoms are doubly bonded to each other. In its most stable form, oxygen exists as a diradical (<!--del_lnk--> triplet oxygen) with two unpaired electrons in molecular orbitals of the O<sub>2</sub> molecule. Though unpaired electrons are commonly associated with high reactivity in chemical compounds, triplet oxygen is relatively (and fortunately) unreactive by comparison with most radicals.<p><!--del_lnk--> Singlet oxygen, a name given to several higher energy species of molecular oxygen in which all the electron spins are paired, is much more reactive towards common <!--del_lnk--> organic molecules. In nature, singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight. It is also produced by the immune system as a source of active oxygen. <!--del_lnk--> Carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms and possibly also in animals, play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state, before it can cause harm to tissues.<p><!--del_lnk--> Liquid O<sub>2</sub> and solid O<sub>2</sub> are clear substances with a light sky-blue colour. In normal triplet form they are <!--del_lnk--> paramagnetic due to the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule, and the negative exchange energy between neighbouring O<sub>2</sub> molecules. Liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet, in laboratory demonstrations. Liquid O<sub>2</sub> is usually obtained by the <!--del_lnk--> fractional distillation of liquid air.<p>Oxygen is slightly soluble in water, but naturally occuring disolved amounts support all ocean animal life (see below).<p>O<sub>2</sub> has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kJ/mol.<p><a id="Allotropes" name="Allotropes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Allotropes</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">Ozone</a>, the triatomic allotrope of oxygen, is a poisonous gas with a sharp odour. It functions in the upper atmosphere of the Earth as a shield against UV radiation, and has recently been found to be produced by the immune system as an antimicrobial (see below). Liquid and solid O<sub>3</sub> (<a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a>) have a deeper blue colour than ordinary oxygen, and they are unstable and explosive.<p>A recently discovered <!--del_lnk--> allotrope of oxygen, <!--del_lnk--> tetraoxygen (O<sub>4</sub>), is a deep red solid that is created by pressurizing O<sub>2</sub> to the order of 20 GPa. Its properties are being studied for use in <!--del_lnk--> rocket fuels and similar applications, as it is a much more powerful oxidizer than either O<sub>2</sub> or <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">O<sub>3</sub></a>.<p><a id="Applications" name="Applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>
      <p>Oxygen is essential to <!--del_lnk--> respiration, so oxygen supplementation has found use in <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> (as <!--del_lnk--> oxygen therapy). People who climb <!--del_lnk--> mountains or fly in non-pressurized <!--del_lnk--> aeroplanes sometimes have supplemental oxygen supplies; the reason is that increasing the proportion of oxygen in the breathing gas at low pressure acts to increase the inspired oxygen <!--del_lnk--> partial pressure nearer to that found at sea-level. A notable application of oxygen as a very low-pressure breathing gas, is in modern <!--del_lnk--> spacesuits, where use of nearly pure oxygen at a total pressure of about 1/3rd normal, results in normal blood <!--del_lnk--> partial pressures of oxygen. This trade-off of breathing gas content and needed pressure is important for space applications, because flexible spacesuits working at Earth sea-level pressures remains a technological challenge beyond today&#39;s capabilities.<p>Oxygen is used in <a href="../../wp/w/Welding.htm" title="Welding">welding</a> (such as the <!--del_lnk--> oxyacetylene torch), and in the making of <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> and <!--del_lnk--> methanol. Liquid oxygen finds use as a classic oxidizer in <!--del_lnk--> rocket propulsion.<p>Oxygen presents two <!--del_lnk--> absorption bands centered in the wavelengths 687 and 760 nanometers. Some scientists have proposed to use the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those oxygen bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform. This is because in those bands, it is possible to discriminate the vegetation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> reflectance from the vegetation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement presents several technical difficulties due to the low <!--del_lnk--> signal to noise ratio and due to the vegetation&#39;s architecture, but it has been proposed as a possibility to monitor the <!--del_lnk--> carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.<p>Oxygen, as a supposed mild euphoric, has a history of recreational use (see <!--del_lnk--> oxygen bar), however the reality of this effect is doubtful. Controlled tests of high oxygen mixtures in diving (see <!--del_lnk--> nitrox) and other activities, even at higher than normal pressures, show no particular effects on humans other than promotion of an increased tolerance to aerobic exercise.<p>In the 19th century, oxygen was often mixed with <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide to promote an <!--del_lnk--> analgesic effect; a stable 50% gaseous mixture (<!--del_lnk--> Entonox) is commonly used in medicine today as an analgesic, and 30% oxygen with 70% nitrous oxide is the common basic anaesthetic mixture. These effects, however, are due to the <!--del_lnk--> nitrous oxide.<p><a id="Scientific_history" name="Scientific_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Scientific history</span></h2>
      <p>Oxygen was first described by <!--del_lnk--> Micha&#x142; S&#x119;dziw&oacute;j, a Polish <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemist</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a> in the late 16th century. S&#x119;dziw&oacute;j thought of the gas given off by warm <!--del_lnk--> nitre (saltpeter) as &quot;the elixir of life&quot;.<p>Oxygen was more quantitatively discovered by the <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> pharmacist <!--del_lnk--> Carl Wilhelm Scheele some time before 1773, but the discovery was not published until after the independent discovery by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1774, who called the gas <i>dephlogisticated air</i> (see <!--del_lnk--> phlogiston theory). Priestley published discoveries in <!--del_lnk--> 1775 and Scheele in <!--del_lnk--> 1777; consequently Priestley is usually given the credit. Both Scheele and Priestley produced oxygen by heating mercuric oxide.<p>Scheele called the gas &#39;fire air&#39; because it was the only known supporter of combustion. It was later called &#39;vital air&#39; because it was and is vital for the existence of animal life.<p>The gas was named by <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Laurent Lavoisier</a>, after Priestley&#39;s publication in 1775, from <!--del_lnk--> Greek roots meaning &quot;<!--del_lnk--> acid-former&quot;. As noted, the name reflects the then-common incorrect belief that acids contain oxygen.<p><a id="Occurrence" name="Occurrence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Occurrence</span></h2>

      <p>Oxygen is the most common component of the <!--del_lnk--> Earth&#39;s crust (49% by mass), the second most common component of the Earth as a whole (28.2% by mass), and the second most common component of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">Earth&#39;s atmosphere</a> (20.947% by volume), second to <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>.<p>Oxygen occurs as solution in the world&#39;s water bodies. At 25&deg; C under 1 <!--del_lnk--> atm of air, a <!--del_lnk--> litre of water will dissolve about 6.04 <!--del_lnk--> cc (8.63 <!--del_lnk--> mg, 0.270 <!--del_lnk--> mmol) of oxygen, whereas <!--del_lnk--> sea water will dissolve about 4.9 cc (7.0 mg, 0.22 mmol). At 0&deg; C the solubilities increase to 10.29 cc (14.7 mg, 0.460 mmol) for water and 8.0 cc (11.4 mg, 0.36 mmol) for sea water. This difference has important implications for ocean life, as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their oxygen content. <p><a id="Compounds" name="Compounds"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Compounds</span></h2>
      <p>The most familiar of oxygen compounds is <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>.<p>Due to its <!--del_lnk--> electronegativity, oxygen forms <!--del_lnk--> chemical bonds with almost all other elements hence the origin of the original definition of <!--del_lnk--> oxidation. The only elements known to escape the possibility of oxidation are a few of the noble gases, and <a href="../../wp/f/Fluorine.htm" title="Fluorine">fluorine</a>. Other than <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> (H<sub>2</sub>O), well known examples include compounds of carbon and oxygen, such as <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>), <a href="../../wp/a/Alcohol.htm" title="Alcohol">alcohols</a> (R-OH), <!--del_lnk--> carbonyls, (R-CO-H or R-CO-R)), and <!--del_lnk--> carboxylic acids (R-COOH). Oxygenated <!--del_lnk--> radicals such as <!--del_lnk--> chlorates (ClO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>), <!--del_lnk--> perchlorates (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>), <!--del_lnk--> chromates (CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>), <!--del_lnk--> dichromates (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>), <!--del_lnk--> permanganates (MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>), and <!--del_lnk--> nitrates (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) are strong oxidizing agents in and of themselves. Many metals such as iron bond with oxygen atoms, <!--del_lnk--> iron(III) oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">Ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>) is formed by electrostatic discharge in the presence of molecular oxygen. A double oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is known and is found as a minor component of liquid oxygen. <!--del_lnk--> Epoxides are <!--del_lnk--> ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms.<p>One unexpected oxygen compound is <!--del_lnk--> dioxygen hexafluoroplatinate O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>PtF<sub>6</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>.

      <p>Oxygen can be <!--del_lnk--> toxic at elevated <!--del_lnk--> partial pressures. Since oxygen partial pressure is the fraction of oxygen times the total pressure, elevated partial pressures can occur either from high oxygen fraction in breathing gas, or from high breathing gas pressure, or a combination of both. Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 0.5 atmospheres, or 2.5 times the normal sea-level oxygen partial pressure of about 0.2 atmospheres or bars. This means that at sea-level pressures, mixtures containing less than 50% oxygen are essentially non-toxic. However in medical applications (such as in ventilation gas mixtures in hospital applications) mixtures containing more than 50% oxygen can be expected to show lung toxicity, causing slow damage to the lungs over periods of days, with the rate of damage rising rapidly from mixtures between 50% and 100% oxygen. On the other hand, breathing 100% oxygen in space applications (such as in some modern spacesuits, or in early spacecraft such as the <!--del_lnk--> Apollo spacecraft), causes no damage due to the low total pressures (30% to 33% sea-level) used <!--del_lnk--> . In the case of spacesuits, oxygen partial pressure in the breathing gas is typically about 0.30 bar (1.4 times normal), and oxygen partial pressure in the astronaut&#39;s blood (due to downward adjustments due to water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub> in the alveoli) is close to sea-level normal of 0.14 bar.<p>In deep <!--del_lnk--> scuba diving and <!--del_lnk--> surface supplied diving and when using equipment which can provide high partial pressures of oxygen, such as <!--del_lnk--> rebreathers, oxygen toxicity to the lungs can occur, just as in medical applications. Due to the higher total pressures in these applications, the fraction of oxygen which produces lung damage may be considerably less than 50%. More importantly, under pressures higher than normal sea-level, a far more serious form of oxygen toxicity in the <!--del_lnk--> central nervous system may lead to generalized seizures. This form of <!--del_lnk--> oxygen toxicity usually occurs after several hours exposure to oxygen <!--del_lnk--> partial pressures over about 1.4 atmospheres (bars) (i.e. 7 times normal), with the time decreasing for higher pressures above this, and with great variation from person to person. At over three bars of oxygen partial pressure (15 times normal), seizures typically occur within minutes.<p><a id="Toxicity_and_antibacterial_use_of_other_chemical_oxygen_forms" name="Toxicity_and_antibacterial_use_of_other_chemical_oxygen_forms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Toxicity and antibacterial use of other chemical oxygen forms</span></h3>
      <p>Certain derivatives of oxygen, such as <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a> (O<sub>3</sub>), <!--del_lnk--> singlet oxygen, <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen_peroxide.htm" title="Hydrogen peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hydroxyl radicals and <!--del_lnk--> superoxide, are also highly toxic. The body has developed mechanisms to protect against all of these toxic compounds. For instance, the naturally-occurring <!--del_lnk--> glutathione can act as an antioxidant, as can <!--del_lnk--> bilirubin which is normally a breakdown product of <!--del_lnk--> hemoglobin. To protect against the destructive nature of peroxides, nearly every organism on earth has developed some form of the enzyme <!--del_lnk--> catalase, which very quickly <!--del_lnk--> disproportionates <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen_peroxide.htm" title="Hydrogen peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> into water and dioxygen. Another nearly universally present enzyme in living organisms (except for a few species of bacteria which use Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions directly for the job) is <!--del_lnk--> superoxide dismutase. This family of enzymes <!--del_lnk--> disproportionates <!--del_lnk--> superoxide to oxygen and peroxide, which is then in turn dealt with, by <!--del_lnk--> catalase.<p>Immune systems of higher organisms have long made use of reactive forms of oxygen which they produce. Not only do antibodies catalyze production of peroxide from oxygen, it is now known that immune cells produce peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen in the course of an immune response. Recently, singlet oxygen has been found to be a source of biologically-produced <a href="../../wp/o/Ozone.htm" title="Ozone">ozone</a>: this reaction proceeds through an unusual compound <!--del_lnk--> dihydrogen trioxide, also known as <!--del_lnk--> trioxidane, (HOOOH) which is an antibody-catalyzed product of singlet oxygen and water. This compound in turn disproportionates to ozone and peroxide, providing two powerful antibacterials. The body&#39;s range of defense against all of these active oxidizing agents is hardly surprising, then, given their &quot;deliberate&quot; employment as antimicrobial agents in the immune response. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Oxygen derivatives are prone to form <!--del_lnk--> free radicals, especially in metabolic processes. Because they can cause severe damage to cells and their <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> before they are dealt with, they form part of many theories of carcinogenesis and aging.<p><a id="Combustion_hazard" name="Combustion_hazard"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Combustion hazard</span></h3>
      <p>Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid <!--del_lnk--> combustion and therefore are <a href="../../wp/f/Fire.htm" title="Fire">fire</a> and <!--del_lnk--> explosion hazards in the presence of <!--del_lnk--> fuels. The fire that killed the <!--del_lnk--> Apollo 1 crew on a test launchpad spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure oxygen as would be usual in an actual flight, but to maintain positive pressure in the capsule, this was at slightly more than atmospheric pressure instead of the &#x2153; normal pressure that would be used in flight. (See <!--del_lnk--> partial pressure.)<p>Similar hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative <i>potential</i>, such as high concentration peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, and dichromates; they also can often cause chemical <!--del_lnk--> burns.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen&quot;</div>
