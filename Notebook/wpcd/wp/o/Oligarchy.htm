      <p><b>Oligarchy</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F48;&lambda;&iota;&gamma;&alpha;&rho;&chi;&#x3AF;&alpha;</span>, <i>Oligarkh&iacute;a</i>) is a <!--del_lnk--> form of government where <!--del_lnk--> political power effectively rests with a small, <!--del_lnk--> elite segment of society (whether distinguished by wealth, family or military prowess). The word <i>oligarchy</i> is from the Greek words for &quot;few&quot; (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F40;&lambda;&#x3AF;&gamma;&omicron;&nu;</span> <i>&oacute;fligon</i>) and &quot;rule&quot; (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F04;&rho;&chi;&omega;</span> <i>arcgekho</i>).<p>

      <p>Historically, many oligarchies openly gave the political power to a minority group, sometimes arguing that this was an <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy (&quot;organization by the &#39;best&#39; and the &#39;brightest&#39;&quot;). Such states were often controlled by powerful families whose children were raised and mentored to be heirs of the power of the oligarchy. However, this power may also not be exercised openly, the oligarchs preferring to remain &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> power behind the throne&quot;, exerting control through <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economic</a> means. Although <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> pioneered the use of the term as a synonym for rule by the rich, for which the exact term is <!--del_lnk--> plutocracy, oligarchy is not always a rule by wealth, as oligarchs can simply be a privileged group.<p><a id="Oligarchy_vs._Monarchy" name="Oligarchy_vs._Monarchy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Oligarchy vs. Monarchy</span></h2>
      <p>Early <!--del_lnk--> societies may become oligarchies as an outgrowth of an alliance between rival tribal chieftains or as the result of a <!--del_lnk--> caste system. Oligarchies can often become instruments of transformation, by insisting that <!--del_lnk--> monarchs or <!--del_lnk--> dictators share power, thereby opening the door to power-sharing by other elements of society (while oligarchy means &quot;the rule of the few,&quot; monarchy means &quot;the rule of the one&quot;). One example of power-sharing from one person to a larger group of persons occurred when <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> nobles banded together in <!--del_lnk--> 1215 to force a reluctant <!--del_lnk--> King <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">John of England</a> to sign the <a href="../../wp/m/Magna_Carta.htm" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>, a tacit recognition both of King John&#39;s waning political power and of the existence of an incipient oligarchy (the noblility). As English society continued to grow and develop, the Magna Carta was repeatedly revised (<!--del_lnk--> 1216, <!--del_lnk--> 1217, and <!--del_lnk--> 1225), guaranteeing greater rights to greater numbers of people, thus setting the stage for <!--del_lnk--> English <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>.<p>Oligarchies may also evolve into more <!--del_lnk--> autocratic or <!--del_lnk--> monarchist forms of government, sometimes as the result of one family gaining ascendancy over the others. Many of the <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> monarchies established during the late <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> began in this way.<p><a id="Examples_of_oligarchies" name="Examples_of_oligarchies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Examples of oligarchies</span></h2>
      <p>Examples of a historical oligarchies are <!--del_lnk--> Sparta and the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. A modern example of oligarchy could be seen in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> during the 20th century. Here, the basic characteristics of oligarchy are particularly easy to observe, since the South African form of oligarchy was based on <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>. After the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a>, a tacit agreement was reached between English- and <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>-speaking whites. Together, they made up about twenty percent of the population, but this small percentage ruled the vast native population. Whites had access to virtually all the <!--del_lnk--> educational and <!--del_lnk--> trade opportunities, and they proceeded to deny this to the black majority even further than before. Although this process had been going on since the mid-18th century, after <!--del_lnk--> 1948 it became official government policy and became known worldwide as <!--del_lnk--> apartheid. This lasted until the arrival of <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> in South Africa in <!--del_lnk--> 1994, punctuated by the transition to a democratically-elected government dominated by the black majority.<p><a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> has been labeled an oligarchy because of the power of certain individuals, the oligarchs, who gained great wealth after the fall of <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a>. Critics have argued that this happened in illegitimate ways and due to <!--del_lnk--> corruption.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">Capitalism</a> as a social system, exemplified most notably by the United States, is sometimes described as an oligarchy. Critics argue that in a capitalist society, power - economic, cultural and political - rests in the hands of the capitalist class. Communist states have also been seen as oligarchies, being ruled by a class with special privileges, the <!--del_lnk--> nomenklatura.<p><a name=".22The_Iron_Law_of_Oligarchy.22"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;The Iron Law of Oligarchy&quot;</span></h2>
      <p>Some authors such as <!--del_lnk--> Vilfredo Pareto, <!--del_lnk--> Gaetano Mosca, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas R. Dye, and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Michels believe that any political system will eventually evolve into an oligarchy (the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Iron law of oligarchy&quot;). According to this school of thought, modern <!--del_lnk--> democracies should be considered as elected oligarchies. In these systems, actual differences between viable political rivals are relatively small and strict limits are imposed (by the oligarchic <!--del_lnk--> elite) on what constitutes &#39;acceptable&#39; and &#39;respectable&#39; political positions. Furthermore, politicians&#39; careers depend heavily on unelected economic and media elites.<p>The historian <!--del_lnk--> Spencer R. Weart in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Never at War</i> argues that oligarchies rarely make war with one another.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy&quot;</div>
