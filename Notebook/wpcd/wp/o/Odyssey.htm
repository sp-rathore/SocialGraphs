      <p>The <i><b>Odyssey</b></i> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek <b>&Omicron;&delta;&#x3CD;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</b> (Od&uacute;sseia) ) is one of the two major ancient <!--del_lnk--> Greek <!--del_lnk--> epic poems attributed to the Ionian poet <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>. The poem is commonly dated circa 800 to 600 BC. The poem is, in part, a sequel to Homer&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> and mainly centers on the Greek hero <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> (or <!--del_lnk--> Ulysses in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>) and his long journey home to <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, following the fall of <!--del_lnk--> Troy.<p>It takes Odysseus ten years to reach <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca after the ten-year <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a>. Due to his twenty-year absence, most people assume Odysseus is dead. His son <!--del_lnk--> Telemachus and his wife <!--del_lnk--> Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus&#39;s home, greedily consuming his goods, insulting him and his son, and competing for Penelope&#39;s hand in marriage.<p>The poem is fundamental to the <!--del_lnk--> Western canon and continues to be read in <!--del_lnk--> Homeric Greek and translations into modern languages around the world. The original poem was composed in an oral tradition by an <i><!--del_lnk--> aoidos</i> perhaps a <!--del_lnk--> rhapsode. The details of the ancient oral performance, and the story&#39;s conversion to a written work inspire continual debate among scholars. The <i>Odyssey</i> was written in a regionless poetic dialect of Greek and comprises 12,110 lines of <!--del_lnk--> dactylic hexameter. Among the most impressive elements of the text are its strikingly modern non-linear plot, and the fact that events are shown to depend as much on the choices made by women and serfs as on the actions of fighting men. In the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> as well as many others, the word <i>odyssey</i> has come to refer to an epic voyage.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Character_of_Odysseus" name="Character_of_Odysseus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Character of Odysseus</span></h2>
      <p>Odysseus&#39;s heroic trait is his <i><!--del_lnk--> m&#x113;tis</i>, or &quot;cunning intelligence&quot;; he is often described as the &quot;Peer of Zeus in Counsel&quot;. This intelligence is most often manifested by Odysseus&#39;s use of disguise and deceptive speech. His disguises take forms both physical (altering his appearance) and verbal, such as telling the <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclops.htm" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus) that his name is &quot;Nobody&quot;, then escaping after blinding Polyphemus. When queried by other Cyclopes about why he is screaming, Polyphemus replies that &quot;Nobody&quot; is hurting him. The most evident flaw, however, that Odysseus sports is that of his pride, or <!--del_lnk--> hubris. It is due to his stark pride that he taunts the blinded Polyphemus, allowing him to hurl stones in his direction by following the sound of his voice. Odysseus&#39;s hubris was also the initial cause of Poseidon&#39;s wrath, and continued to enrage the sea god the length of his voyage. Because Odysseus is intrigued with the reaction of Polyphemus, he tells the Cyclops he is a fool and that his real name is Odysseus.<p><a id="Structure" name="Structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Structure</span></h2>
      <p>The <i>Odyssey</i> begins <i><!--del_lnk--> in medias res</i>, meaning that the action begins in the middle of the plot, and that prior events are described through flashbacks or storytelling. In the first episodes we trace <!--del_lnk--> Telemachus&#39; efforts to assert control of the household, and then, at Athena&rsquo;s advice, to search for news of his long-lost father. Then the scene shifts: Odysseus has been a captive of the beautiful nymph <!--del_lnk--> Calypso, with whom he has spent 7 of his 10 lost years. Released by the intercession of his patroness <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a>, he departs, but his raft is destroyed by his divine enemy <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon, who is angry because <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> blinded his son, <!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus. When Odysseus washes up on <!--del_lnk--> Scherie, home to the <!--del_lnk--> Phaeacians, he is assisted by the young <!--del_lnk--> Nausicaa and is treated hospitably. In return he satisfies the Phaeacians&#39; curiosity, telling them - and the reader - of all his adventures since departing from Troy. This renowned, extended &quot;flashback&quot; leads Odysseus back to where he stands, his tale told. The shipbuilding Phaeacians finally loan him a ship to return to <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, where he is aided by the swineherd <!--del_lnk--> Eumaeus, meets <!--del_lnk--> Telemachus, regains his household, kills the suitors, and is reunited with his faithful wife <!--del_lnk--> Penelope.<p>In nearly all modern editions and translations the <i>Odyssey</i> (like the <i>Iliad</i>) is divided into 24 books. This division is handy but it is not original; it was developed by <!--del_lnk--> Alexandrian editors of the 3rd century BC. Aside from this, the first four books, focusing on Telemachus, are sometimes known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Telemachy&quot;. Within Odysseus&#39;s narrative, the section describing his meeting with the spirits of the dead is known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Nekuia&quot;.<p>The last 550 lines of the <i>Odyssey</i>, corresponding to book 24, are believed by many scholars to have been added by a slightly later poet. Several passages in earlier books seem to be setting up the events of book 24, so if it is indeed a later addition, the offending editor would seem to have changed earlier text as well. For more about varying views on the origin, authorship and unity of the poem see <!--del_lnk--> Homeric scholarship.<p><a id="Outline_of_the_plot" name="Outline_of_the_plot"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Outline of the plot</span></h2>

      <p>Telemachus, Odysseus&rsquo;s son, was a baby when Odysseus set out for Troy. At the point where the Odyssey begins, ten years after the <a href="../../wp/t/Trojan_War.htm" title="Trojan War">Trojan War</a> ended, <!--del_lnk--> Telemachus is about twenty and is sharing his missing father&rsquo;s house on the island of Ithaca with his mother <!--del_lnk--> Penelope and with a crowd of 108 boisterous young men, &quot;the Suitors&quot;, whose aim is to persuade Penelope to accept her husband&rsquo;s disappearance as final and to marry one of them.<p>The goddess <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a> (who is Odysseus&rsquo;s protector) discusses his fate with <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, king of the gods, at a moment when Odysseus&#39;s enemy, the God of the Sea <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon, is absent from <!--del_lnk--> Mount Olympus. Then, disguised as a Taphian chieftain named <!--del_lnk--> Mentes, she visits Telemachus to urge him to search for news of his father. He offers her hospitality; they observe the Suitors dining rowdily, and the bard <!--del_lnk--> Phemius performing a narrative poem for them. Penelope objects to Phemius&#39;s theme, the &quot;Return from Troy&quot; because it reminds her of her missing husband, but Telemachus rebuts her objections.<p>Next morning Telemachus calls an assembly of citizens of Ithaca and demands a ship and crew. Accompanied by Athena (now disguised as his friend <!--del_lnk--> Mentor) he departs for the Greek mainland and the household of <!--del_lnk--> Nestor, most venerable of the Greek warriors at Troy, now at home in <!--del_lnk--> Pylos. From there Telemachus rides overland, accompanied by Nestor&#39;s son, to <!--del_lnk--> Sparta, where he finds <!--del_lnk--> Menelaus and <a href="../../wp/h/Helen.htm" title="Helen">Helen</a>, now reconciled. He is told that they returned to <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> after a long voyage by way of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>; there, on the magical island of <!--del_lnk--> Pharos, Menelaus encountered the old sea-god <!--del_lnk--> Proteus, who told him that Odysseus is a captive of the mysterious goddess <!--del_lnk--> Calypso. Incidentally Telemachus learns the fate of Menelaus&rsquo; brother <a href="../../wp/a/Agamemnon.htm" title="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, king of <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae and leader of the Greeks at Troy, murdered on his return home by his wife <!--del_lnk--> Clytemnestra and her lover <!--del_lnk--> Aegisthus.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Meanwhile Odysseus, after wanderings about which we are still to learn, has spent seven years in captivity on the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Calypso&#39;s distant island. She is now persuaded by the messenger god <!--del_lnk--> Hermes to release him. Odysseus builds a raft. It is wrecked (the sea-god <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon is his enemy) but he swims ashore on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Scherie, where, naked and exhausted, he falls asleep. Next morning, awakened by the laughter of girls, he sees the young <!--del_lnk--> Nausicaa, who has gone to the seashore with her maids to wash clothes. He appeals to her for help. She encourages him to seek the hospitality of her parents <!--del_lnk--> Arete and <!--del_lnk--> Alcinous. Odysseus is welcomed and is not at first asked for his name. He remains several days with Alcinous, takes part in an athletic competition, and hears the blind singer <!--del_lnk--> Demodocus perform two narrative poems. The first is an otherwise obscure incident of the Trojan War, the &quot;Quarrel of Odysseus and <a href="../../wp/a/Achilles.htm" title="Achilles">Achilles</a>&quot;; the second is the amusing tale of a love affair between two Olympian gods, <!--del_lnk--> Ares and <!--del_lnk--> Aphrodite. Finally Odysseus asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan Horse, a stratagem in which Odysseus had played a leading role. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, Odysseus at last reveals his identity. He then begins to tell the amazing story of his return from Troy.<dl>
       <dd>After a piratical raid on <!--del_lnk--> Ismarus in the land of the <!--del_lnk--> Cicones, he and his twelve ships were driven off course by storms. They visited the lazy <!--del_lnk--> Lotus-Eaters and were captured by the <a href="../../wp/c/Cyclops.htm" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> <!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus, escaping by blinding him with a wooden stake. They stayed with <!--del_lnk--> Aeolus the master of the winds; he gave Odysseus a leather bag containing all the winds, a gift that should have ensured a safe return home, had not the sailors foolishly opened the bag while Odysseus slept. All the winds flew out and the resulting storm drove the ships back the way they had come.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>After pleading in vain with Aeolus to help them again, they re-embarked and encountered the cannibal <!--del_lnk--> Laestrygones. Odysseus&rsquo;s own ship was the only one to escape. He sailed on and visited the witch-goddess <!--del_lnk--> Circe, whose magic potions turned most of his sailors into swine. Hermes met with Odysseus and gave him a drug called <!--del_lnk--> moly, a resistance to Circe&rsquo;s potion. Circe, being attracted to Odysseus&#39;s resistance, fell in love with him. Circe released his men. Odysseus and his crew remained with her on the island for the next year. Finally, Odysseus&#39;s men convinced Odysseus that it was time to leave. Guided by Circe&#39;s instructions, Odysseus and his crew crossed the ocean and reached a harbour at the western edge of the world, where Odysseus sacrificed to the dead and summoned the spirit of the old prophet <!--del_lnk--> Tiresias to advise him. Next Odysseus met the spirit of his own mother, who had died of grief at his long absence; from her he learned for the first time news of his own household, threatened by the greed of the suitors. Here, too, he met the spirits of famous women and famous men; notably he encountered the spirit of Agamemnon, of whose murder he now learned (for Odysseus&#39;s encounter with the dead see also <i><!--del_lnk--> Nekuia</i>).</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>Returning to Circe&rsquo;s island, they were advised by her on the remaining stages of the journey. They skirted the land of the <!--del_lnk--> Sirens, passed between the many-headed monster <!--del_lnk--> Scylla and the whirlpool <!--del_lnk--> Charybdis, and landed on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Thrinacia. There Odysseus&rsquo; men &ndash; ignoring the warnings of Tiresias and Circe &ndash; hunted down the sacred cattle of the sun god <!--del_lnk--> Helios. This sacrilege was punished by a shipwreck in which all but Odysseus himself were drowned. He was washed ashore on the island of Calypso, where she compelled him to remain as her lover for seven years, and he had only now escaped.</dl>
      <p>Having listened with rapt attention to his story, the <!--del_lnk--> Phaeacians, who are skilled mariners, agree to help Odysseus on his way home. They deliver him at night, while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbour on Ithaca. He finds his way to the hut of one of his own former slaves, the swineherd <!--del_lnk--> Eumaeus. Odysseus now plays the part of a wandering beggar in order to learn how things stand in his household. After dinner he tells the farm laborers a fictitious tale of himself: he was born in <!--del_lnk--> Crete, had led a party of Cretans to fight alongside other Greeks in the Trojan War, and had then spent seven years at the court of the king of Egypt; finally he had been shipwrecked in <!--del_lnk--> Thesprotia and crossed from there to Ithaca.<p>Meanwhile Telemachus, whom we left at Sparta, sails home, evading an ambush set by the suitors. He disembarks on the coast of Ithaca and makes for Eumaeus&rsquo;s hut. Father and son meet; Odysseus identifies himself to Telemachus (but still not to Eumaeus) and they determine that the suitors must be killed. Telemachus gets home first. Accompanied by Eumaeus, Odysseus now returns to his own house, still disguised as a beggar. He experiences the suitors&rsquo; rowdy behaviour and plans their death. He meets Penelope: he tests her intentions with an invented story of his birth in Crete, where, he says, he once met Odysseus. Closely questioned, he adds that he had recently been in Thesprotia and had learned something there of Odysseus&rsquo;s recent wanderings.<p>Odysseus&rsquo;s identity is discovered by the housekeeper, <!--del_lnk--> Eurycleia, when he undresses for a bath and reveals an old thigh wound; he swears her to secrecy. Next day, at Athena&rsquo;s prompting, Penelope maneuvers the suitors into competing for her hand with an archery competition using Odysseus&rsquo;s bow. Odysseus takes part in the competition himself; he alone is strong enough to string the bow and therefore wins. Immediately he turns his arrows on the suitors, and all are killed. Odysseus and Telemachus kill (by hanging) twelve of their household maids, who had slept with the suitors; they mutilate and kill the goatherd <!--del_lnk--> Melanthius, who had mocked and abused Odysseus. Now at last Odysseus identifies himself to Penelope. She is hesitant, but accepts him when he correctly describes to her the bed he built for her when they married.<p>The next day he and Telemachus visit the country farm of his old father <!--del_lnk--> Laertes, who likewise accepts his identity only when Odysseus correctly describes the orchard that Laertes once gave him.<p>The citizens of Ithaca have followed Odysseus on the road, planning to avenge the killing of the Suitors, their sons. Their leader points out that Odysseus has now caused the deaths of two generations of the men of Ithaca &ndash; his sailors, not one of whom survived, and the suitors, whom he has now executed. The goddess Athena intervenes and persuades both sides to give up the vendetta.<p><a id="The_geography_of_the_Odyssey" name="The_geography_of_the_Odyssey"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The geography of the <i>Odyssey</i></span></h2>

      <p>Events in the main sequence of the <i>Odyssey</i> (excluding the narrative of Odysseus) take place in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese and in what are now called the <!--del_lnk--> Ionian Islands. There are difficulties in the identification of Ithaca, the homeland of Odysseus, which may or may not be the same island that is now called Ithake. The wanderings of Odysseus as told to the Phaeacians, and the location of the Phaeacians&#39; own island of <!--del_lnk--> Scherie, pose more fundamental geographical problems: scholars both ancient and modern are divided as to whether or not any of the places visited by Odysseus (after <!--del_lnk--> Ismarus and before his return to <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca) were real.<p><a id="Near_Eastern_influences" name="Near_Eastern_influences"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Near Eastern influences</span></h2>
      <p>Scholars have seen strong influences from Near Eastern mythology and literature in the <i>Odyssey</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Martin West has noted substantial parallels between the <a href="../../wp/e/Epic_of_Gilgamesh.htm" title="Epic of Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a> and the <i>Odyssey</i>. Both Odysseus and <!--del_lnk--> Gilgamesh are known for traveling to the ends of the earth, and on their journeys go to the land of the dead. On his voyage to the underworld Odysseus follows instructions given to him by <!--del_lnk--> Circe, a goddess who is the daughter of the sun-god <!--del_lnk--> Helios. Her island, <!--del_lnk--> Aiaia, is located at the edges of the world, and seems to have close associations with the sun. Like Odysseus, <!--del_lnk--> Gilgamesh gets directions on how to reach the land of the dead from a divine helper: in this case she is the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Siduri, who, like Circe, dwells by the sea at the ends of the earth. Her home is also associated with the sun: Gilgamesh reaches Siduri&#39;s house by passing through a tunnel underneath Mt. <!--del_lnk--> Mashu, the high mountain from which the sun comes into the sky. West argues that the similarity of Odysseus&#39;s and Gilgamesh&#39;s journeys to the edges of the earth are the result of the influence of the Gilgamesh epic upon the <i>Odyssey</i>.<p>There are also some parallels between the Odyssey and the story of <!--del_lnk--> Sindbad, whose misfortune on the ocean is rival to that of Odysseus. He also has an encounter with a monster similar to Polyphemus, and escapes using similar tactics.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey&quot;</div>
