      <p>Oliver is an orphan born in a workhouse, who has no idea of his parents&#39; identity, his mother Agnes <!--del_lnk--> having died in childbirth. The starving workhouse boys draw straws to decide who will ask for an extra helping at mealtime and Oliver is chosen. (&quot;Please, sir, I want some more.&quot;) As a result of this breach of <!--del_lnk--> etiquette, he is &quot;sold&quot; by the workhouse to be an <!--del_lnk--> undertaker&#39;s apprentice. The <!--del_lnk--> cruelty he suffers at the hands of an older apprentice named Noah Claypole causes him to run away.<p>He makes his way to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, where he is taken under the wing of <!--del_lnk--> the Artful Dodger, a boy <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">criminal</a>. The Dodger introduces Oliver to his circle of friends, who include the <!--del_lnk--> Fagin, a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> criminal mastermind, and his brutal ally, <!--del_lnk--> Bill Sikes. Oliver is trained to be a criminal, learning such skills as <!--del_lnk--> pickpocketing, but never actually commits a crime. He is shown kindness by Bill&#39;s 17-year-old mistress, <!--del_lnk--> Nancy.<p>After a <!--del_lnk--> robbery that goes wrong, in which Oliver played the part of an unwitting lookout, he is taken into the home of a wealthy man, Mr Brownlow. Unknown to them, Oliver&#39;s half-brother, Monks, is trying to find him, in order to prevent him from obtaining his <!--del_lnk--> inheritance, but Mr Brownlow soon begins to suspect that Oliver is the illegitimate son of his deceased best friend. Sikes and Nancy snatch Oliver back, and Sikes takes him on a <!--del_lnk--> burglary, planning to get him a criminal record as a favour to Monks. But Oliver is left behind when the burglary goes wrong, and is taken in and cared for by <!--del_lnk--> Rose Maylie and her family, who realize that Oliver was forced to take part in the robbery.<p>Meanwhile, Monks and Fagin are plotting to try to go after Oliver again and either kidnap or kill him. Nancy, fearing their intentions, goes to Rose Maylie and Mr Brownlow to reveal their plot. She manages to keep her meetings secret until Noah Claypole (he had fallen out with the undertaker and moved to London to seek his fortune) agrees to spy on Nancy and then tells Fagin. Angry at the notion of his plot being foiled, Fagin passes it on to Sikes, twisting the story just enough to make it sound as if Nancy had informed on him. (In actuality, she had shielded Sikes, whom she loves despite his occasional ill-treatment, as much as possible.) Believing that she has betrayed him, Sikes <!--del_lnk--> murders Nancy in a fit of rage, and is himself killed when he accidentally hangs himself while being pursued by an angry mob. Monks is forced to divulge his secrets and give half of his inheritance to Oliver. Then Monks moves to <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">America</a>, where he quickly spends his money, reverts to crime, and ultimately dies in <!--del_lnk--> prison. Fagin is arrested and <!--del_lnk--> hanged for his misdeeds. Rose Maylie turns out to be the long-lost sister of Oliver&#39;s mother Agnes; she is therefore Oliver&#39;s aunt. She marries her long-time sweetheart Harry, and Oliver lives happily with his saviour, Mr Brownlow.<p><a id="Characters_in_.22Oliver_Twist.22" name="Characters_in_.22Oliver_Twist.22"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Characters in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;</span></h2>

      <p>The novel is characterized by the use of various motifs.<p>Charity and love are motifs because even though Oliver is treated horribly by most people, he is shown love by a few good people &ndash; Mr. Brownlow, Mrs. Maylie, and even Nancy.<p>Greed and corruption are also motifs because of how people take advantage of Oliver. He is taken advantage of by Mr. Bumble at the workhouse and the thieves. Mr. Fagin tries to control Oliver, to use him for his own wealth. Monks tries to steal his identity and his inheritance.<div class="notice spoiler endspoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>

       <li>The earliest <!--del_lnk--> film adaptation is a <a href="../../wp/s/Silent_film.htm" title="Silent film">silent film</a> made in <!--del_lnk--> 1909.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver Twist</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> feature film from <!--del_lnk--> 1948 by <!--del_lnk--> David Lean, starring <!--del_lnk--> Alec Guinness in one of his most defining roles as <!--del_lnk--> Fagin and is still considered the classic film version.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> 1960, <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Bart&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> musical play <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver!</i> opened to rave reviews in London. It became the longest-running musical there up to that time, playing six years. Producer <!--del_lnk--> David Merrick brought the show to the United States. The show toured nationally in cities including <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a> before opening at the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Theatre on <!--del_lnk--> Broadway on <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1963, where it received less ecstatic reviews and did not run nearly as long as it did in London.<li>Lionel Bart&#39;s musical was adapted for the big screen in <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver!</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1968), and won the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for Best Picture in <!--del_lnk--> 1969, featuring <!--del_lnk--> Mark Lester as Oliver. It received better reviews than the show had. The film also won an Oscar for its director, Sir <!--del_lnk--> Carol Reed.<li>A <!--del_lnk--> 1985 <a href="../../wp/b/BBC_television_drama.htm" title="BBC television drama">BBC television drama</a> adaptation in their <i>Classic Serial</i> strand, produced by <!--del_lnk--> Terrance Dicks and starring <!--del_lnk--> Eric Porter as Fagin.<li>An <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animated</a> interpretation by <!--del_lnk--> Disney called <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver &amp; Company</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1988), loosely based on Dickens, about an orphaned <a href="../../wp/c/Cat.htm" title="Cat">cat</a> named Oliver who meets a <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dog</a> called Dodger.<li>A <!--del_lnk--> television movie, <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver Twist</i>, was released in <!--del_lnk--> 1997.<li>An <!--del_lnk--> ITV/<!--del_lnk--> PBS production, <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver Twist</i>, from <!--del_lnk--> 1999, adapted by <!--del_lnk--> Alan Bleasdale and starring <!--del_lnk--> Robert Lindsay as Fagin, and <!--del_lnk--> Andy Serkis as Bill Sikes.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> 2003 movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Twist</i> by director <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Tierney is loosely based on the novel but set in modern-day <a href="../../wp/t/Toronto.htm" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> with male <!--del_lnk--> prostitution and <!--del_lnk--> drugs, rather than <!--del_lnk--> pickpocketing.<li><i><!--del_lnk--> Boy called Twist</i> by director <!--del_lnk--> Timothy Greene (<!--del_lnk--> 2004) is set in <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, in the street-kid scene. With its unglamorous but sympathetic account of city <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, the film is true to Dickens&#39; story.<li>In 2005 director <!--del_lnk--> Roman Polanski released a new big-budget version of <i><!--del_lnk--> Oliver Twist</i>.</ul>
      <p>Adaptations of the novel tend to simplify the original story. The way the book is normally interpreted on screen causes modern readers to focus on Bill Sikes as the villain. They thus fail to recognise how Fagin has trained Sikes and made him what he is; part of Dickens&#39; message is that he might have done the same with Oliver had chance not intervened.<p>The renowned <!--del_lnk--> comic book creator, <!--del_lnk--> Will Eisner, disturbed by the <!--del_lnk--> anti-semitism in the typical depiction of Fagin, created a <a href="../../wp/g/Graphic_novel.htm" title="Graphic novel">graphic novel</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2003 titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Fagin the Jew</i>. In this book, the <!--del_lnk--> back story of the character and events of <i>Oliver Twist</i> are depicted from his point of view.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist&quot;</div>
