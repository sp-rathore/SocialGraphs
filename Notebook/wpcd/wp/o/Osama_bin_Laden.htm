      <p>Osama bin Laden was born in <a href="../../wp/r/Riyadh.htm" title="Riyadh">Riyadh</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> . In a 1998 interview, later televised on <a href="../../wp/a/Al_Jazeera.htm" title="Al Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a>, he gave his birth date as <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1957. His father was the late <!--del_lnk--> Muhammed Awad bin Laden, a wealthy businessman involved in construction and with close ties to the <!--del_lnk--> Saudi royal family . Before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Muhammed, poor and uneducated, emigrated from <!--del_lnk--> Hadhramaut, on the south coast of <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, to the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> port of <!--del_lnk--> Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he began to work as a porter. Starting his own business in 1930, Muhammed built his fortune as a building contractor for the <!--del_lnk--> Saudi royal family during the 1950s.<p>In 1994 bin Laden&#39;s family publicly disowned him, shortly before the <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabian</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> revoked his <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> for anti-government activity. He attended his son&#39;s wedding in January 2001, but since September 11 of that year he is believed only to have had contact with his mother on one occasion. .<p>There is no definitive account of the number of children born to Muhammed bin Laden, but the number is generally put at 55. Various accounts place Osama as his seventeenth son. Muhammed bin Laden was married 22 times, although to no more than four women at a time per <!--del_lnk--> Sharia law. Osama was born the only son of Muhammed bin Laden&#39;s tenth wife, <!--del_lnk--> Hamida al-Attas, nee <!--del_lnk--> Alia Ghanem, who was born in <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. <p><a id="Al-Attas.27_step_family_in_Jeddah" name="Al-Attas.27_step_family_in_Jeddah"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Al-Attas&#39; step family in Jeddah</span></h3>
      <p>Osama&#39;s parents divorced soon after he was born, according to <!--del_lnk--> Khaled M. Batarfi, a senior editor at the <!--del_lnk--> Al Madina newspaper in Jeddah who knew Osama during the 1970s. Osama&#39;s mother then married a man named <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad al-Attas, who worked at the bin Laden company. The couple had four children, and Osama lived in the new household with three stepbrothers and one stepsister. <p><a id="Education_and_politicization" name="Education_and_politicization"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Education and politicization</span></h3>

      <p>Bin Laden was raised as a devout <!--del_lnk--> Sunni <!--del_lnk--> Muslim. But from 1968 to 1976, he attended the relatively secular <!--del_lnk--> Al-Thager Model School, the most prestigious high school in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, called &quot;<i>the</i> school of the &eacute;lite.&quot;  However, during the 1960s, <!--del_lnk--> King Faisal had welcomed exiled teachers from <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, so that around 1971 or 1972, at Saudi high schools and universities, it was common to find many of whom had become involved with dissident members of the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Brotherhood. During that time, bin Laden was exposed to those educators&#39; banned political teachings during after-school Islamic study groups.<p>
       <br /> As a college student at <!--del_lnk--> King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, bin Laden studied <!--del_lnk--> civil engineering and <!--del_lnk--> business administration. He earned a <!--del_lnk--> degree in civil engineering in 1979 and also one in <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> public administration, in 1981.<p>Osama bin Laden is an expert in <!--del_lnk--> Islamic jurisprudence and completed a portion of his Islamic education under the guidance of <!--del_lnk--> Musa al-Qarni.<p>
       <br /> At the university, bin Laden was influenced by several professors with strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Among them was <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Qutb, an Egyptian, whose brother, the late <!--del_lnk--> Sayyid Qutb, had written one of the Brotherhood&rsquo;s most important tracts about anti-Western jihad, <i>Signposts on the Road.</i> The university at Jeddah is also where bin Laden met Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Abdullah Yusuf Azzam. Azzam was a teacher there while bin Laden was in attendance, and he would later play a crucial role working with bin Laden in the Afghanistan resistance against the Soviets.<p><a id="Married_life_in_Jeddah" name="Married_life_in_Jeddah"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Married life in Jeddah</span></h3>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 0 10%;">
      </div>
      <p>In 1974, at the age of 17, bin Laden married his first wife, <!--del_lnk--> Najwa Ghanem, his mother&#39;s niece, and a first cousin, who was from Syria. The marriage ceremony took place in Najwa&#39;s native land, at <!--del_lnk--> Latakia, in northwestern Syria.  After the birth of his first son, Abdallah, they moved from his mother&#39;s house to a building in the Al-Aziziyah district of Jeddah.<p>Although bin Laden reportedly married four other women, he <!--del_lnk--> divorced one, <!--del_lnk--> Umm Ali bin Laden (i.e., the mother of Ali), a University lecturer who studied in Saudi Arabia, and spent holidays in Khartoum, Sudan, where Osama later settled during his exile in the years 1991 to 1996. According to <!--del_lnk--> Wisal al Turabi, the wife of Sudan&#39;s ruler Hassan Turabi, Umm Ali taught Islam to some families in Riyadh, an upscale neighbourhood in Khartoum. The three latter wives of Osama bin Laden were all university lecturers, highly educated, and from distinguished families. According to Wisal al Turabi, he married the other three because they were &quot;spinsters,&quot; who &quot;were going to go without marrying in this world. So he married them for the Word of God.&quot; According to <!--del_lnk--> Abu Jandal, bin Laden&#39;s former chief bodyguard, Osama&#39;s wife Umm Ali asked Osama for a divorce when they still lived in Sudan, because she said that she &quot;could not continue to live in an austere way and in hardship.&quot; <p><a id="Children" name="Children"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Children</span></h3>
      <p>Bin Laden has fathered anywhere between 12 to 24 children. His wife, Najwa, reportedly had 11 children by bin Laden, including Abdallah (born c. 1976), Omar, <!--del_lnk--> Saad and Muhammad. Muhammad bin Laden (born c. 1983) married the daughter of the late alleged al-Qaeda military chief <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Atef in January 2001, at <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar, Afghanistan.<p><a id="Appearance_and_manner" name="Appearance_and_manner"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Appearance and manner</span></h2>
      <p>Bin Laden is often described as lanky; the <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="FBI">FBI</a> describes him as tall and thin, being 6&#39; 4&quot; (193 cm) to 6&#39; 5&quot; (195 cm) tall and weighing about 165 pounds (75 kg). He has an olive complexion, is left-handed, and usually walks with a <!--del_lnk--> cane. He wears a plain white <!--del_lnk--> turban and no longer dons the traditional Saudi male headdress, generally white. <p>In terms of personality, bin Laden is described as a soft-spoken, mild mannered man, ; and despite his rhetoric, he is said to be charming, polite, and respectful. According to CNN&#39;s <i>In The Footsteps of bin Laden</i> television program, he is near-fluent in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>.<p><a id="Usage_variations_of_Osama.27s_name" name="Usage_variations_of_Osama.27s_name"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Usage variations of Osama&#39;s name</span></h2>
      <p>Because there is no universally accepted standard in the West for <!--del_lnk--> transliterating Arabic words and names into English, Osama&#39;s name is transliterated in many ways. The version often used by most <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English-language</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">mass media</a> is <i>Osama bin Laden</i>. Most American government agencies, including the <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> and <!--del_lnk--> CIA, use either <b>Usama bin Laden</b> or <b>Usama bin Ladin</b>, both of which are often abbreviated to <i>UBL</i>. Less common renderings include <b>Ussamah Bin Ladin</b> and <b>Oussama Ben Laden</b> (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French-language</a> mass media). The latter part of the name can also be found as <b>Binladen</b> or <b>Binladin</b>. Strictly speaking, under <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> linguistic conventions, it is incorrect to use &quot;bin Laden&quot; in a similar manner as a Western surname. His full name means &quot;Osama, son of Mohammed, son of &#39;Awad, son of Laden&quot;. However, the bin Laden family (or &quot;Binladin,&quot; as they prefer to be known) generally use the name as a surname in the Western style. Although Arabic conventions dictate that he be referred to as &quot;Osama&quot; or &quot;Osama bin Laden&quot;, using &quot;bin Laden&quot; is in accordance with the family&#39;s own usage of the name and is the near-universal convention in Western references to him.<p>Bin Laden also has several commonly used <!--del_lnk--> aliases and <!--del_lnk--> nicknames, including <b>the Prince</b>, <b>the <!--del_lnk--> Sheikh</b>, <b>Al-Amir</b>, <b>Abu Abdallah</b>, <b>Sheikh Al-Mujahid</b>, <b>the Director</b>, and <b>Samaritan</b>..<p><a id="Military_and_militant_activity" name="Military_and_militant_activity"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Military and militant activity</span></h2>

      <p>Bin Laden&#39;s wealth and connections assisted his interest in supporting the <!--del_lnk--> mujahideen, Muslim <!--del_lnk--> guerrillas fighting the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in Afghanistan following the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. His old teacher from the university in Jeddah, Abdullah Azzam, had relocated to <!--del_lnk--> Peshawar, a major border city of a million people in the <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province of <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only 15 km east of the historic <!--del_lnk--> Khyber Pass, through the <!--del_lnk--> Safed Koh mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Kush range. This route became the major avenue of inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> for the resistance against the Soviets, and also in later years.<p>After bin Laden graduated from the university in Jeddah, he went to fight the Soviet Invasion in 1979 . He lived for a time in Peshawar. According to Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of the English-language daily <!--del_lnk--> The News International in 2001 &quot;Azam prevailed on him to come and use his money&quot; for training recruits, reported Yusufzai.  In the early 1980s, bin Laden lived at several addresses in and around Arbab Road, a narrow street in the <!--del_lnk--> University Town neighborhood in western Peshawar, Yusufzai said. Nearby in Gulshan Iqbal Road is the Arab mosque that Abdullah Azzam used as the jihad centre, according to a <!--del_lnk--> Reuters inquiry in the neighbourhood. Years later, in 1989, Azzam was blown up in a massive car bombing outside the mosque. Bin Laden is thought by some to be a suspect in that assassination, because of a rift in the direction of the jihad at that time. Others doubt this claim; Ahmad Zaidan, for instance, author of the Arabic-language book <i>Bin Laden Unmasked</i>, told Peter L. Bergen in an interview, &quot;I rule out totally that bin Laden would indulge himself in such things, after all, Osama bin Laden, he&#39;s not type of person to kill Abdullah Azzam. Otherwise, if he be exposed, he would be finished, totally.&quot; Bergen also cites Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who speculates that there were more likely candidates than bin Laden: &quot;It could be <!--del_lnk--> Hekmatyar, it could be <!--del_lnk--> KHAD, it could be the <!--del_lnk--> Mossad, the Egyptians [around Ayman al Zawahiri].... I met with Hekmatyar, an arrogant, self-centered person. I think Hekmatyar had a secret organization to eliminate his enemies.&quot;<p>By 1984, with Azzam, bin Laden had established an organization named <!--del_lnk--> Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK, <i>Office of Order</i> in English), which funneled money, arms and <!--del_lnk--> Muslim fighters from around the world into the Afghan war. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden&#39;s inherited family fortune paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. In running al-Khadamat, bin Laden set up a network of couriers traveling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which continued to remain active after 2001, according to Yusufzai.<p><!--del_lnk--> Robin Cook, former leader of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> and Foreign Secretary from 1997-2001, wrote in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Guardian</i> on Friday, July 8, 2005,<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>It is more likely that the CIA was concerned and watching Osama bin Laden at least by early 1995 due to the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> Oplan Bojinka plot which in part involved a suicide airplane attack on CIA Headquarters.<p>For a while Osama worked at the Services Office working with Abdullah Azzam on Jihad Magazine, a magazine that gave information about the war with the soviets and interviewed mujahideen. As time passed, Aymen Al Zawahiri encouraged Osama to split away from Abdullah Azzam. Osama formed his own army of mujahideen and fought the Soviets. One of his most significant battles was the battle of Jaji, which was not a major fight, but it earned him a reputation as a fighter.<p><a id="Formation_of_al-Qaeda" name="Formation_of_al-Qaeda"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Formation of al-Qaeda</span></h3>
      <p>By 1988, bin Laden had split from the <!--del_lnk--> MAK because of strategic differences. While Azzam and his MAK organization acted as support for the Afghan fighters and provided relief to refugees and injured, bin Laden wanted a more military role in which the Arab fighters would not only be trained and equipped by the organization but also be commanded on the battlefield by Arabic. One of the main leading point to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was the insistence of Azzam that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming their separate fighting force. <p>After <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> invaded <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> in 1990, bin Laden offered to help defend Saudi Arabia (with 12,000 armed men) but was rebuffed by the Saudi government. Bin Laden publicly denounced his government&#39;s dependence on the U.S. military and demanded an end to the presence of foreign military bases in the country. According to reports (by the BBC and others), the 1990/91 deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia in connection with the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War upset Muslims because the Saudi government claims legitimacy based on their role as guardians of the sacred Muslim cities of <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Medina. After the Gulf War cease-fire agreement left <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein remaining in power in Iraq, the ongoing presence of long-term bases for non-Muslim U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia continued to undermine the Saudi rulers&#39; perceived legitimacy and inflamed anti-government Islamist militants, including bin Laden.<p>Bin Laden&#39;s increasingly strident criticisms of the Saudi monarchy led the government to attempt to silence him. According to the <!--del_lnk--> 9/11 Commission Report, &quot;with help from a dissident member of the royal family, he managed to get out of the country under the pretext of attending an Islamic gathering in Pakistan in April 1991.&quot;<!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> Hassan al-Turabi, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> National Islamic Front, had invited bin Laden to &quot;transplant his whole organization to Sudan&quot; in 1989. Bin Laden&#39;s agents had begun purchasing property in Sudan in 1990. When the Saudi government began putting pressure on him in 1991, bin Laden moved to Sudan. The Saudi government revoked his citizenship in 1994.<p>Assisted by donations funneled through business and charitable fronts such as <!--del_lnk--> Benevolence International, established by his brother-in-law, <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in <a href="../../wp/k/Khartoum.htm" title="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>, Sudan to disseminate Islamist philosophy and recruit operatives in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Bin Laden also invested in business ventures, such as al-Hajira, a construction company that built roads throughout Sudan, and Wadi al-Aqiq, an agricultural corporation that farmed hundreds of thousands of acres of <a href="../../wp/s/Sorghum.htm" title="Sorghum">sorghum</a>, <!--del_lnk--> gum Arabic, <a href="../../wp/s/Sesame.htm" title="Sesame">sesame</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sunflower.htm" title="Sunflower">sunflowers</a> in Sudan&#39;s central <!--del_lnk--> Gezira province. Bin Laden&#39;s operations in Sudan were protected by the powerful Sudanese NIF government figure <!--del_lnk--> Hassan al Turabi. While in Sudan, bin Laden married one of Turabi&#39;s nieces. <p><a id="Refuge_in_Afghanistan" name="Refuge_in_Afghanistan"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Refuge in Afghanistan</span></h3>
      <p>Sudanese officials, whose government was under international sanctions, offered to expel Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1990s provided that the Saudis pardon him. The Saudis refused because they had already revoked his citizenship and would not accept him in their country. Consequently, in May 1996, under increasing pressure from Saudi Arabia, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and the United States, Sudan asked bin Laden to leave and he returned to Afghanistan. He chartered a plane and flew to <!--del_lnk--> Kabul before settling in Jalalabad after being invited by <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Afghan Northern Alliance. After spending a few months in the border region hosted by local leaders, bin Laden forged a close relationship with some of the leaders of Afghanistan&#39;s new <!--del_lnk--> Taliban government, notably Mullah <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Omar. Bin Laden supported the Taliban regime with financial and paramilitary assistance and, in 1997, he moved to <!--del_lnk--> Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold. <p>Bin Laden is suspected of funding the <!--del_lnk--> November 1997 Luxor massacre in Egypt conducted by Al-Gama&#39;a al-Islamiyya, the largest Egyptian militant Islamist group. The Egyptian government convicted bin Laden&#39;s colleague, one of the leaders of Al-Gama&#39;a al-Islamiyya, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Ayman al-Zawahiri, and <!--del_lnk--> sentenced him to death <!--del_lnk--> in absentia for the massacre.<p><a id="Attacks_on_United_States_targets" name="Attacks_on_United_States_targets"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Attacks on United States targets</span></h3>
      <p>It is believed that bin Laden was involved with the <!--del_lnk--> December 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in <!--del_lnk--> Aden, <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, which killed a Yemeni hotel employee and an Austrian national and seriously injured the Austrian&#39;s wife.<p>In 1998, Osama bin Laden and <!--del_lnk--> Ayman al-Zawahiri, (a leader of <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Islamic Jihad), co-signed a <i><!--del_lnk--> fatwa</i> (religious edict) in the name of the <!--del_lnk--> World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, declaring:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">
