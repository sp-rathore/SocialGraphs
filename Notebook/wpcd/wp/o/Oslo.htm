      <p>The meaning of the name Oslo has been the subject of much debate. It is certainly derived from <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse, and was in all probability the name of a large farm at the site of the first settlements in Bj&oslash;rvika.<p>The last component has been positively identified as the Old Norse word &#39;l&oacute;&#39;, meaning &#39;level meadow&#39; or &#39;plain&#39;. During the Middle Ages the name was initially spelled &#39;&Aacute;sl&oacute;&#39;, later &#39;&Oacute;sl&oacute;&#39;. The earlier spelling suggests that the first component &#39;&aacute;s&#39; refers either to the <i>Ekeberg</i> ridge southeast of the town (&#39;&aring;s&#39; in modern Norwegian), or to the Norse homonym meaning &#39;god&#39; or &#39;divinity&#39;. The most likely interpretations would therefore be &#39;the meadow beneath the ridge&#39; or &#39;the meadow of the gods&#39;. Both are equally plausible.<p>A fire in 1624 destroyed much of the medieval city (the section now known as <i>Gamlebyen</i>), and the city was relocated nearer to the <!--del_lnk--> Akershus Fortress. King <!--del_lnk--> Christian IV of Norway renamed the reborn city <i><!--del_lnk--> Christiania</i> (later, 1878-1924, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kristiania</i>). The original name of Oslo <!--del_lnk--> was restored on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1925.<dl>
       <dd><i>When I was young, the capital of Norway was not called Oslo. It was called Christiania. But somewhere along the line, the Norwegians decided to do away with that pretty name and call it Oslo instead.</i> -- <!--del_lnk--> Roald Dahl, <i><!--del_lnk--> Boy</i>.</dl>
      <p>The city was once referred to as <i>Tigerstaden</i> (City of tigers) by the author <!--del_lnk--> Bj&oslash;rnstjerne Bj&oslash;rnson around <!--del_lnk--> 1870. This name has over the years achieved an almost official status, to the extent the 1000 year jubilee was celebrated by a row of tiger sculptures around the City Hall. (A derogatory <!--del_lnk--> pun is <i>Tiggerstaden</i> (City of beggars), referring to the notable presence of beggars in the city centre). A harsh picture of the city was drawn by <!--del_lnk--> Knut Hamsun in his novel <i>Sult</i> (Hunger) from <!--del_lnk--> 1890 (cinematised in 1966 by Henning Carlsen).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>According to the Norse sagas, Oslo was founded around <!--del_lnk--> 1049 by king <!--del_lnk--> Harald Hardr&aring;de. Recent archaeological research has uncovered Christian burials from before <!--del_lnk--> 1000, evidence of a preceding urban settlement. This called for the celebration of Oslo&#39;s millennium in <!--del_lnk--> 2000.<br />
      <p>It has been regarded as the capital city since the reign of <!--del_lnk--> H&aring;kon V (<!--del_lnk--> 1299-<!--del_lnk--> 1319), who was the first king to reside permanently in the city. He also started the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Akershus Fortress. A century later Norway was the weaker part in a <!--del_lnk--> personal union with <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and Oslo&#39;s role was reduced to that of provincial administrative centre, with the kings residing in <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>. The fact that the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oslo was founded as late as <!--del_lnk--> 1811 had an adverse effect on the development of the nation.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Oslo was destroyed several times by fire, and after the fourteenth calamity, in <!--del_lnk--> 1624, King <!--del_lnk--> Christian IV of Norway ordered it rebuilt at a new site across the bay, near Akershus Fortress and given the name <i><!--del_lnk--> Christiania</i> (later, 1878-1924, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kristiania</i>). The original name of Oslo <!--del_lnk--> was restored in <!--del_lnk--> 1925. But long before this, Christiania had started to regain its stature as a <!--del_lnk--> centre of commerce and culture in Norway. In <!--del_lnk--> 1814 Christiania once more became a real capital when the union with Denmark was dissolved. Many landmarks were built in the 19th century, including the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Palace (1825-1848), <!--del_lnk--> Stortinget (the Parliament) (1861-1866), the <!--del_lnk--> University, <!--del_lnk--> Nationaltheatret and the <!--del_lnk--> Stock Exchange. Among the world-famous artists who lived here during this period were <a href="../../wp/h/Henrik_Ibsen.htm" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Edvard Munch, <!--del_lnk--> Knut Hamsun and <!--del_lnk--> Sigrid Undset (the latter two were awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize for literature). In <!--del_lnk--> 1850, Oslo also overtook <!--del_lnk--> Bergen and became the most populous city in the country.<p>Oslo&#39;s centrality in the political, cultural and economical life of Norway continues to be a source of considerable controversy and friction. Numerous attempts at decentralisation have not appreciably changed this during the last century. While continuing to be the main cause of the depopulation of the Norwegian countryside, any form of development is almost always opposed by neighbors, and as a consequence the growth of a modern urban landscape has all but stopped. Specifically, the construction of <!--del_lnk--> highrises in the city centre has been met with skepticism. It is projected, however, that the city will need some 20,000 additional apartments before 2020, forcing the difficult decision of whether to build tall or the equally unpopular option of sprawling out.<div class="thumb tleft">
       <div style="width:252px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/89/8915.jpg.htm" title="View from Ekeberg toward Grefsen"><img alt="View from Ekeberg toward Grefsen" height="188" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Oslo_mot_Grefsentoppen_fra_Ekeberg.jpg" src="../../images/89/8915.jpg" width="250" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>A marked reluctance to encourage the growth of the city for fear of causing further depletion of the traditional farming and fishing communities has led to several successive bursts of construction both in infrastructure and building mass, as the authorities kept waiting in vain for the stream of people to diminish. Neoclassical city apartments built in the 1850s to 1900s dotted with remnants of &quot;Christian Quart&quot;&#39;s renaissance grid dominate the architecture around the city centre, except where slums were demolished in the 1960s to construct modernist concrete and glass low-rises, now generally regarded as embarrassing eyesores. The variety in Oslos architectural cityscape does however provide for some striking, and often hauntingly beautiful sights. While most of the forests and lakes surrounding Oslo are in private hands, there is great public support for not developing it. Parts of Oslo suffer from congestion, yet it is the only European capital where people live with the wilderness literally in their back yard, or with access to a suburban train line that allows the city&#39;s many hikers and long-distance skiers to simply step off the train and start walking or skiing.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>
      <p>Oslo occupies an arc of land at the northernmost end of the <!--del_lnk--> Oslofjord. The <!--del_lnk--> fjord, which is nearly bisected by the <!--del_lnk--> Nesodden peninsula opposite Oslo, lies to the south; in all other directions Oslo is surrounded by green hills and mountains. There are 40 islands within the city limits, the largest being <!--del_lnk--> Malm&oslash;ya (0.56 km&sup2;), and scores more around the Oslofjord. Oslo has 343 lakes, the largest being Maridalsvannet (3.91 km&sup2;). This is also a main source of drinking water for large parts of Oslo. The highest point is Kirkeberget, at 629 m. Although the city&#39;s population is small compared to most European capitals, it occupies an unusually large land area, of which two thirds are protected areas of forests, hills and lakes. Its boundaries encompass many parks and open areas, giving it an airy and often very green appearance. It is not uncommon to encounter wild moose in relatively urban areas of Oslo, especially during wintertime.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Oslo has a <!--del_lnk--> hemiboreal/<!--del_lnk--> humid continental climate (Dfb according to the <!--del_lnk--> K&ouml;ppen climate classification system). Summers are mild or even warm, with daily high temperatures averaging between 20.1&deg;C and 21.5&deg;C during the summer months (June-August). September is often as warm, with colder temperatures arriving at the end of October and into November. The highest temperature ever recorded was 35&deg;C on <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1901.<p>Winters are long and fairly cold. Temperatures below zero may be experienced from November until March, the coldest month being January with a mean temperature of -4.3&deg;C, and both January and February may have daily minimum temperatures of around -7&deg;C. The coldest temperature recorded is -27.9&deg;C in February 1871. Snowfall is spread evenly throughout the winter months and on average more than 25 cm of snow cover is experienced 30 days per year. Temperatures have tended to be higher in recent years [(<!--del_lnk--> 1)].<p>The annual average precipitation is 763 mm, with winter being somewhat drier than summer.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Oslo is the capital of Norway, and as such is the seat of Norway&#39;s national government. Most government offices, including that of the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, are gathered at <i>Regjeringskvartalet</i>, a cluster of buildings close to the national <!--del_lnk--> Parliament - the <!--del_lnk--> Storting.<p>Constituting both a municipality and a county of Norway, the city of Oslo is represented in the Storting by seventeen <!--del_lnk--> Members of Parliament. Six MPs are from the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party; the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Progress Party have three each, the <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Left Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Liberals have two each, and one is from the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Democrats.<p>Oslo has had a <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> of government since 1986. The supreme authority of the city is the City Council (<i>Bystyret</i>), which currently has 59 seats. Representatives are popularly elected every four years. The City Council has five standing committees, each with their own areas of responsibility. These are: Health and Social Welfare, Education and Cultural Affairs, Urban Development, Transport and Environmental Affairs, and Finance. The council&#39;s executive branch (<i>Byr&aring;det</i>) consists of a head of government (<i>byr&aring;dsleder</i>) and six commissioners (<i>byr&aring;der</i>, sing. <i>byr&aring;d</i>) holding ministerial positions. Each of the commissioners needs the confidence of the City Council and each of them can be voted out of office.<p>Since the local elections of 2003, the city government has been a coalition of the Conservative Party and the Progress Party. Based mostly on support from the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, the coalition maintains a majority in the City Council. The largest political parties are the Conservatives and the Labour Party, with fifteen representatives each in the City Council.<p>The Mayor of Oslo is the head of the City Council and the highest ranking representative of the city. It used to be the most powerful political position in Oslo, but after the implementation of parliamentarism the Mayor has had more of a ceremonial role, similar to that of the President of the Storting at the national level. The current Mayor of Oslo is <!--del_lnk--> Per Ditlev-Simonsen, who is in his third term of office. Though a member of the Conservative Party, he maintains a neutral political stance, asserting that the Mayor of Oslo should be a representative of all its citizens and political parties.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>
      <p>Following the latest reform of <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the city is divided into fifteen <!--del_lnk--> boroughs (<i>bydeler</i>) that are to a considerable extent self governed. Each borough is responsible for local services not overseen by the City Council, such as <!--del_lnk--> social services, basic <!--del_lnk--> healthcare, and <!--del_lnk--> kindergartens.<br />

      <p>Oslo is an important centre of maritime knowledge in Europe and is home to approximately 980 companies and 8,500 employees within the maritime sector, among which are some of the world&#39;s largest shipping companies, shipbrokers, and insurance brokers<!--del_lnk--> . <!--del_lnk--> Det Norske Veritas, headquartered at <!--del_lnk--> H&oslash;vik outside Oslo, is one of the three major maritime <!--del_lnk--> classification societies in the world, with 16.5% of the world fleet to class in its register<!--del_lnk--> . The city&#39;s port is the largest general cargo port in the country and its leading passenger gateway. Close to 6,000 ships dock at the Port of Oslo annually with a total of 6 million tonnes of cargo and over five million passengers.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product of Oslo totaled NOK268.047 billion (&euro;33.876 billion) in 2003, which amounted to 17% of the national GDP<!--del_lnk--> . This compares with NOK165.915 billion (&euro;20.968 billion) in 1995. The metropolitan area, bar <!--del_lnk--> Moss and <!--del_lnk--> Drammen, contributed 25% of the national GDP in 2003 and was also responsible for more than one quarter of tax revenues. In comparison, total tax revenues from the oil and gas industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf amounted to about 16%<!--del_lnk--> . The region has one of the highest <!--del_lnk--> per capita GDPs in Europe, at NOK391,399 (&euro;49,465) in 2003. If Norway were a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, the capital region would have the fourth strongest GDP per capita, behind <!--del_lnk--> Inner London, <!--del_lnk--> Brussels-Capital and <a href="../../wp/l/Luxembourg.htm" title="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>.<p>Oslo is one of the <!--del_lnk--> most expensive cities in the world. <!--del_lnk--> As of 2006, it is ranked tenth according to the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey provided by Mercer Human Resource Consulting<!--del_lnk-->  and first according to the <!--del_lnk--> Economist Intelligence Unit<!--del_lnk--> . The reason for this discrepancy is that the EIU omits certain factors from its final index calculation, most notably housing. Although Oslo does have the most expensive housing market in Norway it is comparably cheaper to other cities on the list in that regard. Meanwhile, prices on goods and services remain some of the highest of any city. According to a report compiled by Swiss bank UBS in the month of August 2006, <!--del_lnk-->  Oslo and London were the world&#39;s most expensive cities. Total pay packets were the biggest in Oslo along with Copenhagen and Zurich -- but residents of the Nordic cities lose out when tax is taken into account.<p><a id="Institutions_of_higher_learning" name="Institutions_of_higher_learning"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Institutions of higher learning</span></h2>

      <p>The public transportation system in Oslo is managed by the municipal transport company <!--del_lnk--> Oslo Sporveier. This includes <!--del_lnk--> metro, <!--del_lnk--> tram, <!--del_lnk--> bus and <!--del_lnk--> ferry, but not the local train lines, which are run by the state railway company <!--del_lnk--> NSB. All public transport in Oslo operates on a common ticket system, allowing free transfer within a period of one hour with a regular ticket. Tickets also transfer to the local and inter-city trains, unless you intend to cross the city border. In 2004, 160 million journeys were made using public transport, of which 85% was handled by Oslo Sporveier&#39;s own subsidiaries and 15% by private bus and ferry operators under cost-based contracts. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Oslo&#39;s tram- and metro system is the largest in Europe compared to the number of inhabitants, and Oslo is the smallest city in the world with a comprehensive metro system. The tram system, <!--del_lnk--> Oslotrikken, is made up of six lines that criss-cross the inner parts of the city and extend out towards the suburbs. The metro system, known as the <!--del_lnk--> T-bane, connects the eastern and western suburbs and comprises six lines which all converge in a tunnel beneath downtown Oslo. The metro lines are identified by numbers from 1 to 6, with two lines running into the municipality of <!--del_lnk--> B&aelig;rum in the west. The tramway lines are numbered 11 to 13 and 17 to 19.<p>A new, partially underground <!--del_lnk--> loop line was opened in August 2006, connecting <!--del_lnk--> Ullev&aring;l in the north-west and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Berners plass in the east. Two new stations, Nydalen and Storo, have been operational for a couple of years already, the third station, Sinsen, opened <!--del_lnk--> August 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. This completed the loop. In conjunction with the opening of the circle line, there will be a major upgrade of the rolling stock, with delivery taking place between 2007 and 2010. An <!--del_lnk--> RFID ticketing system with automatic turnstile barriers will also be introduced.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>

Holmenkollen has been selected to once again host the <!--del_lnk--> FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, in 2011.<p>During the summer months, the harbour becomes a venue for various maritime events, including the start of a large <!--del_lnk--> sailing regatta that attracts around 1,000 contesting boats each year, and one race of the international Class 1 <!--del_lnk--> offshore powerboat racing circuit.<p>Two <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> clubs from Oslo, <!--del_lnk--> V&aring;lerenga and <!--del_lnk--> Lyn, play in the <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Premier League.
