      <p>In general religious use, <!--del_lnk--> ordination is the process by which one is <!--del_lnk--> consecrated (set apart for the undivided administration of various religious rites). The <b>ordination of women</b> is a controversial issue in religions where either the office of ordination, or the role that an ordained person fulfills, has traditionally been restricted to men because of cultural or theological prohibitions.<p>In historical Christianity, such as <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholicism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Orthodoxy and <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>, ordination is distinguished from religious or <!--del_lnk--> consecrated life and is the means by which one is included in one of the priestly orders: bishop, priest, or deacon. Roman Catholic and Orthodox priesthood is limited to men.<p>In Protestant Christian denominations that do not have a <!--del_lnk--> priesthood, ordination is understood more generally as the acceptance of one for pastoral work. Most other Protestant denominations ordain women for pastoral ministries except some very conservative denominations such as the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Baptist Convention, <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran Church&mdash;Missouri Synod, and fundamentalist groups.<p>Orthodox <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> does not permit women to become <!--del_lnk--> rabbis (instead, the women in leadership positions are often <!--del_lnk--> Rebbetzin, wives of a rabbi), but female rabbis have begun to appear in recent years among more liberal Jewish movements, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Reconstructionist, <!--del_lnk--> Renewal, <!--del_lnk--> Reform, and <!--del_lnk--> Humanistic denominations.<p><!--del_lnk--> Muslims do not formally ordain religious leaders. The <!--del_lnk--> imam serves as a spiritual leader and religious authority. Most strands of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> permit women to lead female-only congregations in prayer (one of the meanings of the word <i>imam</i>), but restrict their roles in mixed sex congregations. There is a recent movement to extend women&#39;s roles in spiritual leadership.<p>Within <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, the legitimacy of ordaining women as <!--del_lnk--> bhikkhuni (nuns) has become a significant topic of discussion in some areas in recent years. It is widely accepted that the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> created an order of bhikkhuni, but the tradition of ordaining women has died out in some Buddhist traditions such as <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhism, while remaining strong in others such as <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Buddhism.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Doctrinal_Position" name="Doctrinal_Position"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Doctrinal Position</span></h4>
      <p>The official position of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, as expressed in the current <!--del_lnk--> canon law and the <!--del_lnk--> Catechism of the Catholic Church, is that: &quot;Only a baptized man (<i>vir</i>) validly receives sacred ordination.&quot; Insofar as priestly and episcopal ordination are concerned, the Church teaches that this requirement is a matter of divine law, and thus doctrinal. The requirement that only males can receive ordination to the permanent diaconate has not been promulgated as doctrinal by the Church&#39;s magisterium, though it is clearly at least a requirement according to canon law. In asserting this position, the Church cites her own doctrinal tradition, and scriptural texts. In recent years, responding to questions about the matter, the Church has issued a number of documents repeating the same position. In 1994, <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> declared the question closed in his letter <i><!--del_lnk--> Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, stating: &quot;Wherefore, in order that all doubt may be removed regarding a matter of great importance&hellip;I declare that the Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church&#39;s faithful.&quot;<p>In 1995, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued what it considered a clarification, explaining that <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, though &quot;itself not infallible, witnesses to the infallibility of the teaching of a doctrine already possessed by the Church.... This doctrine belongs to the deposit of the faith of the Church. It should be emphasized that the definitive and <!--del_lnk--> infallible nature of this teaching of the Church did not arise with the publication of the Letter <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>.&quot; Instead, it was &quot;founded on the written Word of God, and from the beginning constantly preserved and applied in the tradition of the Church, it has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium,&quot; and for these reasons it &quot;requires definitive assent.&quot;<p>The Church teaching on the restriction of its ordination to men that <a href="../../wp/g/Gender.htm" title="Gender">masculinity</a> was integral to the personhood of both <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and the men he called as <!--del_lnk--> apostles. The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> sees maleness and femaleness as two different ways of expressing common humanity. Contrary to the common phrase &quot;<!--del_lnk--> gender roles,&quot; which implies that the phenomenon of the sexes is a mere surface <!--del_lnk--> phenomenon, an <!--del_lnk--> accident, the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> teaches that there is an ontological (<!--del_lnk--> essential) difference between humanity expressed as male humanity and humanity expressed as female humanity. While many functions are interchangeable between men and women, some are not, because maleness and femaleness are not interchangeable. Just as <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> is necessary for a valid <!--del_lnk--> baptism, and <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheaten</a> <a href="../../wp/b/Bread.htm" title="Bread">bread</a> and <!--del_lnk--> grape <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a> are necessary for a valid <!--del_lnk--> Eucharist (not because of their superiority over other materials, but because they are what Jesus used or authorized), only men can be validly ordained, regardless of any issues of equality.<p><a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a>, in <i><!--del_lnk--> Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, explained the Roman Catholic understanding that the priesthood is a special role specially set out by <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> when he chose twelve men out of his group of male and female followers. John Paul notes that Jesus chose the Twelve (cf. Mk 3:13&ndash;14; Jn 6:70) after a night in prayer (cf. Lk 6:12) and that the <!--del_lnk--> Apostles themselves were careful in the choice of their successors. The priesthood is &quot;specifically and intimately associated in the mission of the Incarnate Word himself (cf. Mt 10:1, 7&ndash;8; 28:16&ndash;20; Mk 3:13&ndash;16; 16:14&ndash;15).&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Pope Paul VI, quoted by <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> in <i><!--del_lnk--> Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, wrote, &quot;[The Church] holds that it is not admissible to ordain women to the priesthood, for very fundamental reasons. These reasons include: the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of <!--del_lnk--> Christ choosing his Apostles only from among men; the constant practice of the Church, which has imitated Christ in choosing only men; and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with God&#39;s plan for his Church.&quot;<p>Concerning the &quot;constant practice of the Church,&quot; in antiquity the Church Fathers Irenaeus, Tertullian, Hippolytus, Epiphanius, John Chrysostom, and Augustine all wrote that the ordination of women was impossible. The Synod of Laodicea prohibited ordaining women to the Presbyterate.<p><a id="Deaconesses_and_Female_Deacons" name="Deaconesses_and_Female_Deacons"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Deaconesses and Female Deacons</span></h4>
      <p>The ordination of females to the diaconate is a matter of some controversy among Roman Catholic historians and theologians. At issue are two distinct but interrelated questions: whether some deaconesses in the early Church received true sacramental ordination, or whether all were merely so called for functional or honorific purposes; and, whether the prohibition against ordaining women to the diaconate is also a matter of unchangeable divine law, or potentially changeable ecclesiastical law. If some deaconesses did receive true sacramental ordination, then the current prohibition would be ecclesiastical rather than divine law. If not, then it could be either ecclesiastical or divine.<p>It can be verified that the term <!--del_lnk--> deaconesses was employed in antiquity; the word, like &quot;deacon,&quot; comes from the Greek word <i>diakonos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>&delta;&iota;&#x3AC;&kappa;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</i></span>), meaning &quot;one who serves.&quot; Deaconesses mainly assisted the priest in receiving women into the Church for baptism by full immersion (which is still practiced by the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Catholic Churches and by some parishes in the Western or <!--del_lnk--> Latin rite as well), and did not perform any of the duties associated with male deacons. In this sense &quot;deaconess&quot; implied a title of honour and respect. Whether or not &quot;deaconess&quot; in some instances implied sacramental ordination is disputed.<p>The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wrote in 1977 that the historical nature of deaconesses was &quot;a question that must be taken up fully by direct study of the texts, without preconceived ideas.&quot; The position that deaconesses received true sacramental ordination (in certain times and places) is given by Roger Gryson, and the position that deaconesses never received true sacramental ordination is given by Aim&eacute; Georges Martimort. Both Gryson and Martimort argued from the same historical evidence, which is mixed. For example, the ecumenical First Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325) stated that deaconesses: &quot;do not receive any imposition of hands, so that they are in all respects to be numbered among the laity.&quot; However, 126 years later, the ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451) decreed: &quot;A woman shall not receive the laying on of hands as a deaconess under forty years of age, and then only after searching examination.&quot; Martimort argues that the &quot;laying on of hands&quot; in the latter case referred only to a special blessing. Against this, &quot;Gryson argues that the use of the verb <i>cheirotonein</i> and of the substantive <i>cheirothesia</i> clearly indicate that deaconesses were ordained by the laying on of hands.&quot;<p>Until rather recently, the theologians and canonists who addressed the question almost unanimously considered the exclusion of women from ordination, including to the diaconate, as having a divine origin and therefore remaining absolute. Only in recent decades have any theologians or canonists entertained the theory that the prohibition of women from the ordained diaconate was a matter of merely ecclesiastical, rather than divine law. This renewed theological assessment was spurred on by the <!--del_lnk--> Second Vatican Council&#39;s revival of the permanent diaconate, which lifted the question from a purely theoretical matter to one with immensely practical consequences. Based on the theory that some deaconesses received the sacrament of Holy Orders, and based on the fact that some writers in the Middle Ages exhibited a certain hesitancy concerning the ordination of women stemming from knowledge that there had been deaconesses in antiquity, there have been modern-day proposals to ordain female permanent deacons, who would perform the same functions as male deacons.<p><a id="Ordination_and_Equality" name="Ordination_and_Equality"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Ordination and Equality</span></h4>
      <p>The Roman Catholic Church states that the <!--del_lnk--> hierarchical structure that includes the ordained ministerial priesthood is ordered to benefit the holiness of the entire body of the faithful, and not to ensure the salvation of the ordained minister. There is no additional benefit in terms of automatic holiness that comes about through ordination. Ordination is not required for <!--del_lnk--> salvation, nor does it effect salvation in the one ordained. In other words, a priest can go to <!--del_lnk--> Hell just as easily as a layperson. Likewise, <!--del_lnk--> sainthood is equally open to men and women, lay or ordained. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Blessed Virgin Mary is venerated as the Queen of all Saints. Furthermore, there are female <!--del_lnk--> Doctors of the Church.<p>Pope John Paul II wrote, in <i>Mulieris Dignitatem</i>: &quot;In calling only men as his Apostles, Christ acted in a completely free and sovereign manner. In doing so, he exercised the same freedom with which, in all his behaviour, he emphasized the dignity and the vocation of women, without conforming to the prevailing customs and to the traditions sanctioned by the legislation of the time.&quot;<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, John Paul wrote: &quot;the fact that the <!--del_lnk--> Blessed Virgin Mary, <!--del_lnk--> Mother of God and Mother of the Church, received neither the mission proper to the Apostles nor the ministerial priesthood clearly shows that the non-admission of women to priestly ordination cannot mean that women are of lesser dignity, nor can it be construed as discrimination against them. Rather, it is to be seen as the faithful observance of a plan to be ascribed to the wisdom of the Lord of the universe.&quot;<p>The Roman Catholic Church does not regard the priest as the only possible <!--del_lnk--> prayer leader, and prayer may be led by a woman. For example, outside the context of a <!--del_lnk--> Mass and in the absence of a priest or deacon, laypersons (both men and women) &quot;are to be entrusted with the care of these [Sunday] celebrations.&quot; This includes leading the prayers, ministry of the word, and the giving of <!--del_lnk--> holy communion (previously consecrated by a priest). Also during these assemblies, in the absence of an ordained minister, a layperson may request God&#39;s blessing on the congregation, provided that the layperson does not use words proper to a priest or deacon, and omits rites that are too readily associated with the Mass.<p>Women are also able to live the <!--del_lnk--> Consecrated Life as a <!--del_lnk--> nun or <!--del_lnk--> abbess, and throughout the history of the Church it has not been uncommon for an abbess to head a dual monastery, i.e. a community of men and women.<p><a id="Positions_dissenting_against_the_official_view" name="Positions_dissenting_against_the_official_view"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Positions dissenting against the official view</span></h4>
      <p>Arguments for the Catholic ordination of women are manifold. One argument is based on equality. Some sacramental theologians have argued that ordaining men but not women creates two classes of <!--del_lnk--> baptism, contradicting <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">Saint Paul</a>&#39;s statement that all are equal in <!--del_lnk--> Christ. This argument does not give credence to the distinction between equal dignity and different services within the Church.<p>Another argument is based on the theological position that there is a fundamental unity between the different levels (deacon, priest, and bishop) of the sacrament of Holy Orders, as taught by the Second Vatican Council. So, if history shows that the deaconesses known to have existed in the Early Church had actually received the sacrament of ordination, then because of the fundamental unity of Holy Orders, women can also be ordained as priests and bishops. (This same argument is sometimes used in reverse, against the historical possibility that deaconesses received sacramental ordination.)<p>Whatever argument is used in favour of the priestly ordination of women, there is the problem of reconciling this position with <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>. Based on the clarifications from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the official point of view is that <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i>, without itself being <i>ex cathedra</i>, authoritatively and bindingly teaches that: (1) the Church cannot ordain women as priests due to divine law; and that (2) this doctrine has been set forth infallibly by the ordinary and universal magisterium.<p>Since the encyclical <i>Humani Generis</i>, it is well known that the Roman Pontiff can, by his own authority, settle a theological question via a fallible papal teaching that is nonetheless sufficiently authoritative to end all debate on the matter, at least under Church law. This is clearly what has occurred with <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i> in regard to point (1). Thus, theological debate on whether women can be ordained as priests is no longer permitted for Catholics, and the arguments in favour of ordaining women to the priesthood in this section are properly termed a &quot;dissenting position.&quot; However, several noted dogmatic theologians have questioned how this same debate-ending authority can apply to point (2), which is a matter not of faith or morals, but a factual matter relative to teachings promulgated by all the bishops of the Catholic Church over her two thousand year history. These dogmatic theologians find it especially problematic that, concerning this point, <i>Ordinatio Sacerdotalis</i> gives no indication of what historical facts are sufficient to ensure infallibility by the ordinary and universal Magisterium, nor any indication of how those historical facts were verified. Because of these issues it is argued that, if it were indeed possible for the Church to ordain women to the priesthood, this would not contradict the Church&#39;s dogma regarding infallible teachings.<p>Some supporters of women&#39;s ordination have claimed that there have been ordained <!--del_lnk--> priests and <!--del_lnk--> bishops in antiquity. The official Church position on this is that &quot;a few heretical sects in the first centuries, especially Gnostic ones, entrusted the exercise of the priestly ministry to women: this innovation was immediately noted and condemned by the Fathers who considered it as unacceptable in the Church.&quot; In response to that position, some supporters of women&#39;s ordination take the position that those sects weren&#39;t heretical, but, rather, orthodox. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Some arguable evidence that not all ordinations in the Catholic tradition have been those of males exists. For example, the Pope Gelasius I apparently condemned the practice of women officiating at altars; inscriptions near Tropea in Calabria refer to &quot;presbytera,&quot; which could be interpreted as a woman priest or as a wife of a male priest <!--del_lnk--> . Furthermore, a sarcophagus from Dalmatia is inscribed with the date 425 and records that a grave in the Salona burial-ground was bought from presbytera Flavia Vitalia: selling burial plots was at one time a duty of presbyters <!--del_lnk--> . There have been some 15 records so far found of women being ordained in antiquity by Christians; while the Vatican insists those are ordinations by heretical groups, the <!--del_lnk--> Women&#39;s Ordination Conference contends that those were orthodox Christian groups. <!--del_lnk-->  There is also the church of Santa Praxedis, where Theodora Episcopa&mdash;Bishop Theodora, with the word for &quot;bishop&quot; in feminine form&mdash;appears in an image with two female saints and Mary. That church&#39;s pastor alleges that the church was built in honour of Pope Pascal I&#39;s mother by her son, who graced her with the title &quot;Episcopa&quot; due to her being the mother of a Pope. However, Theodora wears a coif in the image, suggesting that she is an unmarried woman. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Setting aside these theological considerations, advocates for the ordination of women have pointed to <!--del_lnk--> vocations declining in Europe and North America and have made the <!--del_lnk--> utilitarian argument that women must be ordained in order to have enough priests to administer the <!--del_lnk--> Sacraments in those areas. Supporting this argument, they made public the story of a Czech woman <!--del_lnk--> Ludmila Javorov&aacute;, who in the 1990s came forward to say that she and four or five other women had been ordained by the late Bishop <!--del_lnk--> Felix Maria Dav&iacute;dek in the 1970s, to serve as priests in the underground Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia. Javorov&aacute; ceased to practice as a priest.   <p>There is at least one organization that calls itself &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; that ordains women at the present time, Roman Catholic Womenpriests <!--del_lnk--> even though several <!--del_lnk--> independent Catholic jurisidctions have been ordaining women in the United States since approximately the late 1990s. There are several others calling for the Roman Catholic Church to ordain women, such as Circles <!--del_lnk--> , Brothers and Sisters in Christ <!--del_lnk--> , Catholic Women&#39;s Ordination <!--del_lnk--> , and Corpus <!--del_lnk--> , along with others. While there have been excommunications connected to Roman Catholic Womenpriests, that has not deterred that organization from continuing to ordain women. Official Roman Catholic Church sources claim that the Roman Catholic Womenpriests organization has freely decided to separate from the Roman Catholic Church. However, the RC Womenpriests organization sources say they still associate with the Roman Catholic Church and are working to change it.<p><a id="Eastern_Orthodox" name="Eastern_Orthodox"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Eastern Orthodox</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox churches follows a similar line of reasoning as the Roman Catholic Church with respect to ordination of priests.<p>Regarding deaconesses, Professor Evangelos Theodorou argued that female deacons were actually ordained in antiquity <!--del_lnk--> . Bishop Kallistos Ware wrote:<blockquote>
       <p>The order of deaconesses seems definitely to have been considered an &quot;ordained&quot; ministry during early centuries in at any rate the Christian East. ... Some Orthodox writers regard deaconesses as having been a &quot;lay&quot; ministry. There are strong reasons for rejecting this view. In the Byzantine rite the liturgical office for the laying-on of hands for the deaconess is exactly parallel to that for the deacon; and so on the principle <i><!--del_lnk--> lex orandi, lex credendi</i>&mdash;the Church&#39;s worshipping practice is a sure indication of its faith&mdash;it follows that the deaconesses receives, as does the deacon, a genuine sacramental ordination: not just a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&theta;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&alpha;</i></span> but a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><i>&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;&nu;&iota;&alpha;</i></span>.</blockquote>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church of Greece voted <!--del_lnk-->  to restore the female diaconate.<p>There is a strong monastic tradition, pursued by both men and women in the Orthodox churches, where monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives. Unlike Roman Catholic religious life, which has myriad traditions, both contemplative and active (see <!--del_lnk--> Benedictine monks, <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan friars, <!--del_lnk--> Jesuits), that of Eastern Orthodoxy has remained exclusively <!--del_lnk--> ascetic and <!--del_lnk--> monastic.<p><a id="Anglican_Communion" name="Anglican_Communion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anglican Communion</span></h3>
      <p>The Anglican hierarchy disagrees with the Roman Catholic hierarchy on whether women can be ordained as priests. The majority of Anglican provinces ordain women as both deacons and priests; however, only a few provinces have consecrated women as bishops (although the number of provinces where women bishops are canonically possible is much greater). U.S. Episcopal churches ordain women as both priests and bishops.

It was thirty years before the practice became widespread.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1974, eleven women were ordained to the priesthood in <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by three retired ECUSA bishops. These ordinations were ruled &quot;irregular&quot; because they had been done without the authorization of ECUSA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> General Convention. Two years later, General Convention authorized the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate. The first woman bishop in the Communion was <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Clementine Harris, who was ordained bishop <!--del_lnk--> suffragan of <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts in <!--del_lnk--> 1989. The first woman to head a diocese was <!--del_lnk--> Penny Jamieson of the diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Dunedin in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church of New Zealand. The first female <!--del_lnk--> primate (or senior bishop of a <!--del_lnk--> national church) is <!--del_lnk--> Katharine Jefferts Schori, who was elected presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church USA at its 2006 General Convention, and began her nine year term as Presiding Bishop and Primate on November 1, 2006.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> authorized the ordination of woman priests in <!--del_lnk--> 1992 and began ordaining them in <!--del_lnk--> 1994. This was the premise of the <!--del_lnk--> television programme <i><!--del_lnk--> The Vicar of Dibley</i>. The nearly simultaneous publication by the Vatican of the Encyclical <i><!--del_lnk--> Veritatis Splendor</i>, which argued that truth was immutable however unpalatable, was a coincidence which was not lost on many traditionalist Anglicans, who converted to Catholicism in droves. On <!--del_lnk--> 11 July <!--del_lnk--> 2005 the <!--del_lnk--> General Synod of the Church of England, in <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>, voted to &quot;set in train&quot; the process of removing the legal obstacles preventing women from becoming bishops; debate on formal legislation was scheduled for <!--del_lnk--> February 2006 the process is currently underway but is not progressing swiftly due to problems in providing appropriate mechanisms for the protection of those who cannot accept this development&mdash;it is unlikely that there will be women-bishops in the Church of England for several years.<p>Ordination of women has been a controversial issue throughout the Communion. The <!--del_lnk--> Continuing Anglican Movement was started in <!--del_lnk--> 1977 after women began to be ordained in ECUSA.<p>Within provinces which permit the ordination of women, there are some dioceses which do not, or which ordain women only to the diaconate (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Sydney in the <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Church_of_Australia.htm" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican Church of Australia</a>, and the dioceses of <!--del_lnk--> Quincy, <!--del_lnk--> Illinois and <!--del_lnk--> Fort Worth, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, in the USA). The Church of England has instituted &quot;<!--del_lnk--> flying bishops&quot; to cater to parishes who do not wish to be under the supervision of bishops who have participated in the ordination of women.<p><a id="Protestant_churches" name="Protestant_churches"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Protestant churches</span></h3>
      <p>A key <!--del_lnk--> theological doctrine for most Protestants is the <!--del_lnk--> priesthood of all believers. The notion of a priesthood reserved to a select few is seen as an <!--del_lnk--> Old Testament concept, inappropriate for Christians. Prayer belongs equally to all believing women and men.<p>However, most (although not all) Protestant denominations still ordain church leaders, who have the task of equipping all believers in their Christian service (Ephesians 4:11&ndash;13). These leaders (variously styled <i>elders</i>, <i>pastors</i> or <i>ministers</i>) are seen to have a distinct role in teaching, pastoral leadership and the administration of <!--del_lnk--> sacraments. Traditionally these roles were male preserves, but over the last century, an increasing number of denominations have begun ordaining women.<p>The debate over women&#39;s eligibility for such offices normally centers around interpretation of certain Biblical passages relating to teaching and leadership roles. This is because Protestant churches usually view the Bible as the primary authority in church debates, even over established traditions (the doctrine of <i><!--del_lnk--> sola scriptura</i>). Thus the Church is free to change her stance, if the change is deemed in accordance with the Bible. The main passages in this debate include <!--del_lnk--> Galatians 3.28, <!--del_lnk--> 1st Corinthians 11.2&ndash;16, 14.34&ndash;35 and <!--del_lnk--> 1st Timothy 2.11&ndash;14. Increasingly, supporters of women in ministry also make appeals to evidence from the New Testament that is taken to suggest that women did exercise ministries in the apostolic Church (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Acts 21:9,18:18; <!--del_lnk--> Romans 16:3&ndash;4,16:1&ndash;2, Romans 16:7; 1st Corinthians 16:19, and <!--del_lnk--> Philippians 4:2&ndash;3).<p><a id="Examples_of_specific_churches.27_ordination_practices" name="Examples_of_specific_churches.27_ordination_practices"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Examples of specific churches&#39; ordination practices</span></h3>

      <p>Jewish tradition and law does not presume that women have more or less of an aptitude or moral standing required of <!--del_lnk--> rabbis. However, it has been the longstanding practice that only men become rabbis. This practice continues to this day within the <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox and Hasidic communities but has been revised within non-Orthodox organizations. <!--del_lnk--> Reform Judaism created its first woman rabbi in <!--del_lnk--> 1972, <!--del_lnk--> Reconstructionist Judaism in <!--del_lnk--> 1974, and <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Judaism in <!--del_lnk--> 1985, and women in these movements are now routinely granted <!--del_lnk--> semicha on an equal basis with men.<p>The issue of allowing women to become rabbis is not under active debate within the Orthodox community, though there is widespread agreement that women may often be consulted on matters of Jewish religious law. There are reports that a small number of Orthodox <!--del_lnk--> yeshivas have unofficially granted <i>semicha</i> to women, but the prevailing consensus among Orthodox leaders (as well as a small number of Conservative Jewish communities) is that it is not appropriate for women to become rabbis.<p>The idea that women could eventually be ordained as rabbis sparks widespread opposition among the Orthodox rabbinate. Norman Lamm, one of the leaders of Modern Orthodoxy and Rosh Yeshiva of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological <!--del_lnk--> Seminary, totally opposes giving semicha to women. &quot;It shakes the boundaries of tradition, and I would never allow it.&quot; (Helmreich, 1997) Writing in an article in the <i>Jewish Observer</i>, Moshe Y&#39;chiail Friedman states that Orthodox Judaism prohibits women from being given semicha and serving as rabbis.

      <p>Formal discrimination against women in positions of authority has been gradually eliminated in Western societies except in many conservative religious institutions. A partial list with the approximate dates of either the approval of female ordination in principle or the ordination of their first women clergy by Christian and Jewish faith groups appears below:<ul>
       <li><b>Early 1800s:</b> A fundamental belief of the [<i>Society of Friends-<!--del_lnk--> http://www.religioustolerance.org/quaker.htm]</i> (Quakers) has always been the existence of an element of God&#39;s spirit in every human soul. Thus all persons are considered to have inherent and equal worth, independent of their gender. This led naturally to an opposition to sexism, and an acceptance of female ministers. In 1660, Margaret Fell (1614&ndash;1702) published a famous pamphlet to justify equal roles for men and women in the denomination. It was titled: <i>&quot;Women&#39;s Speaking Justified, Proved and Allowed of by the Scriptures, All Such as Speak by the Spirit and Power of the Lord Jesus And How Women Were the First That Preached the Tidings of the Resurrection of Jesus, and Were Sent by Christ&#39;s Own Command Before He Ascended to the Father (John 20:17)</i>. In the U.S., in contrast with almost every other organized religion, the Society of Friends (Quakers) has allowed women to serve as ministers since the early 1800s.<li><b>1853:</b> Antoinette Brown was ordained by the <i>Congregationalist Church.</i> However, her ordination was not recognized by the denomination. She quit the church and later became a Unitarian. The Congregationalists later merged with others to create the <i>United Church of Christ</i>.<li><b>1863:</b> Olympia Brown was ordained by the <i>Universalist</i> denomination in 1863, in spite of a last-moment case of cold feet by her seminary which feared adverse publicity. She later became a Unitarian. After a decade and a half of service as a full-time minister, she became a part-time minister in order to devote more time to the fight for women&#39;s rights and universal suffrage. In 1961, the Universalists and Unitarians joined to form the [<i>Unitarian Universalist Association-<!--del_lnk--> http://www.religioustolerance.org/u-u.htm]</i> (UUA).

      <p>Although Muslims do not formally ordain religious leaders, the <!--del_lnk--> imam serves as a spiritual leader and religious authority.

The stories, sayings and deeds of some of the distinguished Bhikkhuni of early Buddhism are recorded in many places in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pali_Canon.htm" title="Pali Canon">Pali Canon</a>, most notably in the <!--del_lnk--> Therigatha. However, not only did the Buddha lay down more rules of discipline for the bhikkhuni (311 compared to the bhikkhu&#39;s 227), he also made it more difficult for them to be ordained.<p>The tradition flourished for centuries throughout South and East Asia, but appears to have died out in the <!--del_lnk--> Theravada traditions of India and Sri Lanka in the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">11th century</a> C.E. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana tradition, particularly in <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, has retained the practice, where nuns are called &#39;Bhik&#x1E63;u&#x1E47;&#x12B;&#39; (the <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> equivalent of the <!--del_lnk--> Pali &#39;Bhikkhuni&#39;). Nuns are also found in <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.<p>There have been some attempts in recent years to revive the tradition of women in the sangha within Theravada Buddhism in <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, with many women ordained in Sri Lanka since the late <!--del_lnk--> 1990s. The <!--del_lnk--> International Congress on Buddhist Women&#39;s Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages, taking place in Germany, on <i>July 18&ndash;20, 2007,</i> is a turning point in reviving the Bhikkhuni lineage.<p><a id="Thailand" name="Thailand"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Thailand</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1928, the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, responding to the attempted ordination of two women, issued an edict that monks must not ordain women. The two women were reportedly arrested and jailed briefly. In a more recent challenge to the Thai sangha&#39;s ban on women, <!--del_lnk--> Dhammananda <!--del_lnk--> Bhikkhuni, previously a professor of Buddhist philosophy known as Dr <!--del_lnk--> Chatsumarn Kabilsingh, was controversially ordained as a nun in <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2003. Despite some support inside the religious hierarchy, the <!--del_lnk--> sangha remains fiercely opposed to the ordination of women.<p><a id="Tibetan_Tradition" name="Tibetan_Tradition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tibetan Tradition</span></h3>
      <p>The 2007 <!--del_lnk--> International Congress on Buddhist Women&#39;s Role in the Sangha, with the support of H. H. <a href="../../wp/t/Tenzin_Gyatso%252C_14th_Dalai_Lama.htm" title="Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama">XIVth Dalai Lama</a>, is expected to reinstate the <!--del_lnk--> Gelongma (skt. Bikshuni, tib. Gelongma) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. It is currently only possible for women to take <!--del_lnk--> Rabjungma (&#39;entering&#39;) and <!--del_lnk--> Getsh&uuml;lma (&#39;novice&#39;) ordinations in Tibetan tradition. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping the exact same vows (men&#39;s and women&#39;s vows differ slightly). Because 10 Gelongmas are required in order to ordain a new Gelongma, the effort to reinstate the Gelongma tradition has taken a long time.<p>It is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive Bikshuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g. in Vietnam. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like <!--del_lnk--> Venerable Thubten Chodron, took full ordination in another tradition, in order to revive &#39;Gelongma&#39; ordination. The same socio-cultural reasons that make it difficult for women to be nuns will still present challenges to the first Tibetan Gelongmas.<p><a id="Tenrikyo" name="Tenrikyo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tenrikyo</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tenrikyo was founded by a woman.<p><a id="Shinto" name="Shinto"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Shinto</span></h2>
      <p>While the priesthood was traditionally male in Shinto, ordination of women as Shinto priests has arisen after the abolition of <!--del_lnk--> State Shinto in the aftermath of WWII. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Neopaganism" name="Neopaganism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Neopaganism</span></h2>
      <p>Several <!--del_lnk--> Neopagan traditions have a liberal attitude towards the idea of clergy, and of females serving as clergy. Whether ordination is necessary to serve as clergy may differ from tradition to tradition.<!--
