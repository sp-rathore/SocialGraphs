      <p>An <b>ocean</b> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Omega;&kappa;&epsilon;&alpha;&nu;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;</span>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Okeanos</i> (Oceanus) in <!--del_lnk--> Greek) is a principal component of the <!--del_lnk--> hydrosphere: a major body of <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">saline water</a> that, in totality, covers about 71% of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> surface (or an area of some 361 million <!--del_lnk--> square kilometers). Nearly half of the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> marine (oceanic) waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. Average oceanic <!--del_lnk--> salinity is around 35 <!--del_lnk--> parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 31 to 38 ppt.<p>Though somewhat arbitrarily divided into several &#39;separate&#39; oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> World Ocean or global ocean. The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a>, various <!--del_lnk--> archipelagos, and a number of other criteria; these divisions are (in descending order of size) the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Ocean.htm" title="Southern Ocean">Southern Ocean</a> (which is sometimes reckoned instead as just the southern portions of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans), and the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Ocean.htm" title="Arctic Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> (which is sometimes considered a <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">sea</a> of the Atlantic). Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, <!--del_lnk--> gulfs, <!--del_lnk--> bays and other names.<p>There are also some smaller bodies of salt water that are inland and <i>not</i> interconnected with the World Ocean: e.g., the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Aral_Sea.htm" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a>, the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Salt_Lake.htm" title="Great Salt Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>. These are not considered to be oceans or parts of oceans, though some are called &#39;seas&#39;.<p>Geologically, an ocean is an area of oceanic crust covered by water. Oceanic crust is the thin layer of solidified volcanic <!--del_lnk--> basalt that covers the Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> mantle where there are no continents. From this point of view, there are three oceans today: the World Ocean, the Caspian and the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Seas</a>, the latter two of which were formed by the collision of <!--del_lnk--> Cimmeria with <!--del_lnk--> Laurasia. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> is very nearly a discrete ocean, being connected to the World Ocean through the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Gibraltar, and indeed several times over the last few million years <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">movement</a> of the <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African continent</a> has closed the strait off entirely. The Black Sea is connected to the Mediterranean through the <!--del_lnk--> Bosporus, but this is in effect a natural <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> cut through continental rock some 7,000 years ago, rather than a piece of oceanic sea floor like the Strait of Gibraltar.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The area of the World Ocean is 361 million square kilometers (139 million sq mi), its volume is over 1,340 million cubic kilometers (319 million cu mi), and its average depth is 3,711 meters (12,175 ft). Nearly half of the world&#39;s marine waters are over 3,000 meters (9,800 ft) deep. The vast abyssal plains of the deep ocean cover about 40% of the Earth&#39;s surface.

      <p>Travel on the surface of the ocean through the use of boats dates back to prehistoric times, but only in modern times has extensive underwater travel become possible.<p>The deepest point in the ocean is the <!--del_lnk--> Marianas Trench located in the Pacific Ocean near the <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Mariana_Islands.htm" title="Northern Mariana Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>. It has a maximum depth of <!--del_lnk--> 10,923&nbsp;meters (35,838 ft) . It was fully surveyed in <!--del_lnk--> 1951 by the British naval vessel, &quot;Challenger II&quot; which gave its name to the deepest part of the trench, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Challenger Deep&quot;. In 1960, the <!--del_lnk--> Trieste successfully reached the bottom of the trench, manned by a crew of two men.<p>Much of the bottom of the world&#39;s oceans are unexplored and unmapped.

      <p>Oceans are divided into numerous regions depending on the physical and biological conditions of these areas. The <a href="../../wp/p/Pelagic_zone.htm" title="Pelagic zone">pelagic zone</a> includes all open ocean regions, and can be subdivided into further regions categorised by depth and light abundance. The <!--del_lnk--> photic zone covers the oceans from surface level to 200 metres down. This is the region where the photosynthesis most commonly occurs and therefore contains the largest biodiversity in the ocean. Since plants can only survive with photosynthesis any life found lower than this must either rely on material floating down from above (see <!--del_lnk--> marine snow) or find another primary source; this often comes in the form of <!--del_lnk--> hydrothermal vents in what is known as the <!--del_lnk--> aphotic zone (all depths exceeding 200m). The pelagic part of the photic zone is known as the <!--del_lnk--> epipelagic. The pelagic part of the aphotic zone can be further divided into regions that succeed each other vertically. The <!--del_lnk--> mesopelagic is the uppermost region, with its lowermost boundary at a <!--del_lnk--> thermocline of 10&deg;C, which, in the tropics generally lies between 700 and 1,000m. After that is the <!--del_lnk--> bathypelagic lying between 10&deg;C and 4&deg;C, or between 700 or 1,000m and 2,000 or 4,000m. Lying along the top of the abyssal plain is the <!--del_lnk--> abyssalpelagic, whose lower boundary lies at about 6,000m. The final zone falls into the oceanic trenches, and is known as the <!--del_lnk--> hadalpelagic. This lies between 6,000m and 10,000m and is the deepest oceanic zone.<p>Along with pelagic aphotic zones there are also <!--del_lnk--> benthic aphotic zones, these correspond to the three deepest zones. The <!--del_lnk--> bathyal zone covers the continental slope and the rise down to about 4,000m. The <!--del_lnk--> abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000m. Lastly, the <!--del_lnk--> hadal zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone which is found in the oceanic trenches. The pelagic zone can also be split into two subregions, the <!--del_lnk--> neritic zone and the <!--del_lnk--> oceanic zone. The neritic encompasses the water mass directly above the continental shelves, while the oceanic zone includes all the completely open water. In contrast, the <!--del_lnk--> littoral zone covers the region between low and high tide and represents the transitional area between marine and terrestrial conditions. It is also known as the <!--del_lnk--> intertidal zone because it is the area where tide level affects the conditions of the region.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>One of the most dramatic forms of <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> occurs over the oceans: <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclones</a> (also called &quot;typhoons&quot; and &quot;hurricanes&quot; depending upon where the system forms). <!--del_lnk--> Ocean currents greatly affect Earth&#39;s climate by transferring warm or cold air and precipitation to coastal regions, where they may be carried inland by winds. The <!--del_lnk--> Antarctic Circumpolar Current encircles that continent, influencing the area&#39;s climate and connecting currents in several oceans.<p><a id="Ecology" name="Ecology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Ecology</span></h2>

      <p>Earth is the only known <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a> with liquid water on its surface and is certainly the only one in our own <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>. However, liquid water is thought to be present under the surface of several <!--del_lnk--> natural satellites, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Galilean moons of <!--del_lnk--> Europa, and, with less certainty, <!--del_lnk--> Callisto and <!--del_lnk--> Ganymede. <!--del_lnk--> Geysers have been found on <a href="../../wp/e/Enceladus_%2528moon%2529.htm" title="Enceladus (moon)">Enceladus</a>. Other icy moons may have once had internal oceans that have now frozen, such as <!--del_lnk--> Triton. The planets <!--del_lnk--> Uranus and <!--del_lnk--> Neptune may also possess large oceans of liquid water under their thick atmospheres, though their internal structure is not well understood at this time.<p>There is currently much debate over whether <!--del_lnk--> Mars once had an ocean of water in its northern hemisphere, and over what happened to it if it did; recent findings by the <a href="../../wp/m/Mars_Exploration_Rover.htm" title="Mars Exploration Rover">Mars Exploration Rover</a> mission indicate it had some long-term standing water in at least one location, but its extent is not known.<p>Liquid hydrocarbons are thought to be present on the surface of <!--del_lnk--> Titan, though it may be more accurate to describe them as &quot;lakes&quot; rather than an &quot;ocean&quot;. The <a href="../../wp/c/Cassini-Huygens.htm" title="Cassini-Huygens">Cassini-Huygens</a> space mission initially discovered only what appeared to be dry lakebeds and empty river channels, suggesting that Titan had lost what surface liquids it might have had. A more recent fly-by of Titan made by Cassini has produced radar images that strongly suggest hydrocarbon lakes near the polar regions where it is colder. Titan is also thought likely to have a subterranean water ocean under the mix of ice and hydrocarbons that forms its outer crust.<p><a id="Mythology" name="Mythology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Mythology</span></h2>
      <p>The original concept of &quot;ocean&quot; goes back to notions of <!--del_lnk--> Mesopotamian and <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European mythology, imagining the world to be encircled by a great river. <i><!--del_lnk--> Okeanos</i>, &quot;&Omega;&kappa;&epsilon;&alpha;&nu;&#x3CC;&sigmaf;&quot; in <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek</a>, reflects the ancient Greek observation that a strong current flowed off <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and their subsequent assumption that it was a great river. (Compare also <i><!--del_lnk--> Samudra</i> from <!--del_lnk--> Hindu mythology and <!--del_lnk--> J&ouml;rmungandr from <a href="../../wp/n/Norse_mythology.htm" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a>). The world was imagined to be enclosed by a <!--del_lnk--> celestial ocean above the heavens, and an ocean of the underworld below (compare <!--del_lnk--> Ras&#x101;, <!--del_lnk--> Varuna). This is evidenced for example in the account of <!--del_lnk--> Noah&#39;s flood in <!--del_lnk--> Genesis 7:11, where<dl>
       <dd><i>all the fountains of the great deep [were] broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened</i> (<!--del_lnk--> KJV),</dl>
      <p>inundating the world with the waters of the celestial ocean (see also <a href="../../wp/d/Deluge_%2528mythology%2529.htm" title="Deluge (mythology)">deluge (mythology)</a>).<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
      <p>One common misconception today is that the oceans are blue primarily because the sky is blue. In fact, water has a very slight blue colour that can only be seen in large volumes. While the sky&#39;s reflection does contribute to the blue appearance of the surface, it is not the primary cause. The primary cause is the absorption by the water molecules&#39; nuclei of red photons from the incoming light, the only known example of colour in nature resulting from nuclear, rather than electronic, dynamics.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean&quot;</div>
