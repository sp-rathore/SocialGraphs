      <p><b>Old English</b> (also called <b>Anglo-Saxon</b>) is an early form of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> that was spoken in parts of what is now <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and southern <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> between the <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">mid-fifth century</a> and the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">mid-twelfth century</a>. It is a <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic language and therefore is closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Old Frisian and <!--del_lnk--> Old Saxon. It also experienced heavy influence from <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse, a member of the related <!--del_lnk--> North Germanic group of languages.<p>

      <p>Old English was not static, and its usage covered a period of approximately 700 years &ndash; from the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon migrations that created England in the fifth century to some time after the <!--del_lnk--> Norman invasion of <!--del_lnk--> 1066, when the language underwent a major and dramatic transition. During this early period it assimilated some aspects of the languages with which it came in contact, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages and the two dialects of Old Norse from the invading <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Vikings</a>, who were occupying and controlling large tracts of land in northern and eastern England, which came to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw.<p><a id="Germanic_origins" name="Germanic_origins"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Germanic origins</span></h3>
      <p>The most important force in shaping Old English was its Germanic heritage in its vocabulary, sentence structure and grammar which it shared with its sister languages in continental Europe. Some of these features were specific to the <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic language family to which Old English belongs, while some other features were inherited from the <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Germanic language from which all <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages are believed to have been derived.<p>Like other West Germanic languages of the period, Old English was fully <!--del_lnk--> inflected with five <!--del_lnk--> grammatical cases, which had <!--del_lnk--> dual plural forms for referring to groups of two objects (but only in the personal pronouns) in addition to the usual singular and plural forms. It also assigned <!--del_lnk--> gender to all <!--del_lnk--> nouns, including those that describe inanimate objects: for example, <i>s&#x113;o sunne</i> (the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>) was feminine, while <i>se m&#x14D;na</i> (the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">Moon</a>) was masculine (cf. modern German <i>die Sonne</i> vs. <i>der Mond</i>).<p><a id="Latin_influence" name="Latin_influence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Latin influence</span></h3>
      <p>A large percentage of the educated and literate population (<!--del_lnk--> monks, <!--del_lnk--> clerics, etc.) were competent in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, which was the <i><!--del_lnk--> lingua franca</i> of Europe at the time. It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the entry of individual Latin words into Old English based on which patterns of linguistic change they have undergone. There were at least three notable periods of Latin influence. The first occurred before the ancestral <!--del_lnk--> Saxons left continental Europe for England. The second began when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became widespread. The third and largest single transfer of Latin-based words occurred following the <!--del_lnk--> Norman invasion of <!--del_lnk--> 1066, after which an enormous number of <!--del_lnk--> Norman words entered the language. Most of these <!--del_lnk--> O&iuml;l language words were themselves derived ultimately from classical Latin, although a notable stock of Norse words were introduced, or re-introduced in Norman form. The Norman Conquest approximately marks the end of Old English and the advent of <!--del_lnk--> Middle English.<p>The language was further altered by the transition away from the <!--del_lnk--> runic alphabet (also known as <i><!--del_lnk--> futhorc</i> or fu&thorn;orc) to the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>, which was also a significant factor in the developmental pressures brought to bear on the language. Old English words were spelt as they were pronounced; the &quot;silent&quot; letters in many Modern English words, such as the &quot;k&quot; in &quot;knight&quot;, were in fact pronounced in Old English. For example, the &#39;hard-c&#39; sound in <i>cniht</i>, the Old English equivalent of &#39;knight&#39;, was pronounced. Another side-effect of spelling words phonetically was that spelling was extremely variable &ndash; the spelling of a word would reflect differences in the phonetics of the writer&#39;s regional dialect, and also idiosyncratic spelling choices which varied from author to author, and even from work to work by the same author. Thus, for example, the word &quot;and&quot; could be spelt either <i>and</i> or <i>ond</i>.<p>Old English spelling can therefore be regarded as even more jumbled than <!--del_lnk--> modern English spelling, although it can at least claim to reflect <i>some</i> existing pronunciation, while modern English in many cases cannot. Most present day students of Old English learn the language using normalised versions and are only introduced to variant spellings after they have mastered the basics of the language.<p><a id="Viking_influence" name="Viking_influence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Viking influence</span></h3>

      <p>The second major source of loanwords to Old English were the Scandinavian words introduced during the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> invasions of the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">ninth</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">tenth</a> <!--del_lnk--> centuries. In addition to a great many <!--del_lnk--> place names, these consist mainly of items of basic vocabulary, and words concerned with particular administrative aspects of the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw (that is, the area of land under Viking control, which included extensive holdings all along the eastern coast of England and Scotland). The Vikings spoke <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse, a language related to Old English in that both derived from the same ancestral <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Germanic language. It is very common for the intermixing of speakers of different dialects, such as those that occur during times of political unrest, to result in a <!--del_lnk--> mixed language, and one theory holds that exactly such a mixture of Old Norse and Old English helped accelerate the decline of case endings in Old English. Apparent confirmation of this is the fact that simplification of the case endings occurred earliest in the North and latest in the Southwest, the area farthest away from Viking influence. Regardless of the truth of this theory, the influence of Old Norse on the English language has been profound: responsible for such basic vocabulary items as <i>sky</i>, <i>leg</i> and the modern <!--del_lnk--> pronoun <i>they</i>.<p><a id="Celtic_influence" name="Celtic_influence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Celtic influence</span></h3>
      <p>It has traditionally been maintained that the influence of Celtic on English has been small, citing the small number of Celtic loanwords taken into the language. The number of Celtic <!--del_lnk--> loanwords is of a remarkably lower order than either Latin or Scandinavian.<p>Since the 1980s, a growing number of authors, including Hildegard Tristram, have argued that the effects of Celtic language contact have historically been underplayed. In recent years Celtic etymologies have been proposed for an increasing number of English dialect words. Tristram, <!--del_lnk--> Theo Vennemann and others have argued that distinctive Celtic traits are clearly discernable from the post-Old English period in the area of syntax.<p><a id="Dialects" name="Dialects"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dialects</span></h3>
      <p>To further complicate matters, Old English had many dialects. The four main <!--del_lnk--> dialect forms of Old English were <!--del_lnk--> Mercian, <!--del_lnk--> Northumbrian (known collectively as <!--del_lnk--> Anglian), <!--del_lnk--> Kentish, and <!--del_lnk--> West Saxon. Each of these dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, all of <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria and most of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a> were overrun by the Vikings during the 9th century. The portion of Mercia and all of <!--del_lnk--> Kent that were successfully defended were then integrated into <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>.<p>After the process of unification of the diverse Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in <!--del_lnk--> 878 by <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, there is a marked decline in the importance of regional dialects. This is not because they stopped existing; regional dialects continued even after that time to this day, as evidenced both by the existence of middle and modern English dialects later on, and by common sense &ndash; people do not spontaneously develop new accents when there is a sudden change of political power.<p>However, the bulk of the surviving documents from the Anglo-Saxon period are written in the dialect of Wessex, Alfred&#39;s kingdom. It seems likely that with consolidation of power, it became necessary to standardise the language of government to reduce the difficulty of administering the more remote areas of the kingdom. As a result, paperwork was written in the West Saxon dialect. Not only this, but Alfred was passionate about the spread of the <!--del_lnk--> vernacular and brought many scribes to his region from Mercia in order that previously unwritten texts be recorded. The <!--del_lnk--> Church was likewise affected, especially since Alfred initiated an ambitious programme to translate religious materials into English. In order to retain his patronage and ensure the widest circulation of the translated materials, the monks and priests engaged in the programme worked in his dialect. Alfred himself seems to have translated books out of Latin and into English, notably <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory I&#39;s treatise on administration, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Pastoral Care&quot;.<p>Because of the centralisation of power and to the Viking invasions, there is little or no written evidence for the development of non-Wessex dialects after Alfred&#39;s unification.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Old English literature, though more abundant than literature of the continent before 1000 <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">A.D.</a>, is, nonetheless, scanty. In his supplementary article to the 1935 posthumous edition of Bright&#39;s <i>Anglo-Saxon Reader</i>, Dr. James Hulbert writes:<blockquote>
       <p>In such historical conditions, an incalculable amount of the writings of the Anglo-Saxon period perished. What they contained, how important they were for an understanding of literature before the Conquest, we have no means of knowing: the scant catalogs of monastic libraries do not help us, and there are no references in extant works to other compositions....How incomplete our materials are can be illustrated by the well-known fact that, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, all extant Anglo-Saxon poetry is preserved in four manuscripts.</blockquote>
      <p>Jorge Luis Borges, in &#39;An Autobiographical Essay&#39;, The Aleph &amp; Other Stories, says:<blockquote>
       <p>I knew that at home, on a certain top shelf, I had copies of Sweet&rsquo;s Anglo-Saxon Reader and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. When the students came the next Saturday morning, we began reading these two books. We skipped grammar as much as we could and pronounced the words like German. All at once, we fell in love with a sentence in which Rome (Romeburh) was mentioned. We got drunk on these words and rushed down Peru Street shouting them at the top of our voices. And so we set out on a long adventure. I had always thought of English literature as the richest in the world; the discovery now of a secret chamber at the very threshold of that literature came to me as an additional gift. Personally, I knew that the adventure would be an endless one, and that I could go on studying Old English for the rest of my days.</blockquote>

The letter <!--del_lnk--> yogh, for example, was adopted from <!--del_lnk--> Irish; the letter <!--del_lnk--> eth was an alteration of Latin &quot;d&quot;, and the runic letters <!--del_lnk--> thorn and <!--del_lnk--> wynn are borrowings from futhorc. Also used was a symbol for the <!--del_lnk--> conjunction &#39;and&#39;, a character similar to the number seven (<span class="Unicode">&#x204A;</span>, called a <!--del_lnk--> Tironian note), and a symbol for the <!--del_lnk--> relative pronoun &#39;&thorn;&aelig;t&#39;, a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender (&#39;<a class="image" href="../../images/206/20687.png.htm" title=" "><img alt=" " height="20" longdesc="/wiki/Image:OE_thaet.png" src="../../images/206/20687.png" width="9" /></a>&#39;).

      <p><i>Old English</i> is often erroneously used to refer to any form of English other than <!--del_lnk--> Modern English.
