      <p><b>Opera</b> is a form of <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a> in which the drama is conveyed wholly or predominantly through music and singing. Opera emerged in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> around the year <!--del_lnk--> 1600 and is generally associated with the Western <!--del_lnk--> classical music tradition. Opera uses many of the elements of spoken <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre.htm" title="Theatre">theatre</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> scenery, <!--del_lnk--> costumes, and <!--del_lnk--> acting. Generally, however, opera is distinguished from other dramatic forms by the importance of song. The <!--del_lnk--> singers are accompanied by a <!--del_lnk--> musical ensemble ranging from a small instrumental ensemble to a full symphonic <!--del_lnk--> orchestra. Opera may also incorporate dance; this was especially true of <!--del_lnk--> French opera for much of its history.<p>Comparable art forms from various other parts of the world, many of them ancient in origin, exist and are also sometimes called &quot;opera&quot; by analogy, usually prefaced with an adjective indicating the region (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese opera). However, other than superficial similarities, these other art forms developed independently from and are unrelated to opera but are distinct art forms in their own right rather than mere derivatives of opera. Opera is not the only type of Western musical theatre: in the ancient world, <!--del_lnk--> Greek drama featured singing and instrumental accompaniment; and in modern times, other forms such as the <!--del_lnk--> musical have appeared.<p>

      <p>The words of an opera are known as the <!--del_lnk--> libretto (literally &quot;little book&quot;). Some composers, notably <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, have written their own libretti; others have worked in close collaboration with their librettists, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Mozart with <!--del_lnk--> Lorenzo da Ponte. Traditional opera consists of two modes of singing: <!--del_lnk--> recitative, the plot-driving passages often sung in a non-melodic style characteristic of opera, and <!--del_lnk--> aria (an &quot;air&quot; or formal song) in which the characters express their emotions in a more structured melodic style. Duets, trios and other ensembles often occur, and choruses are used to comment on the action. In some forms of opera, such as <!--del_lnk--> Singspiel, <!--del_lnk--> op&eacute;ra comique, <!--del_lnk--> operetta, and <!--del_lnk--> semi-opera, the recitative is mostly replaced by spoken dialogue. Melodic or semi-melodic passages occurring in the midst of, or instead of, recitative, are also referred to as <!--del_lnk--> arioso. During the Baroque and Classical periods, recitative could appear in two basic forms: <i>secco</i> (dry) recitative, accompanied only by &quot;<!--del_lnk--> continuo&quot;, which was often no more than a <!--del_lnk--> harpsichord; or <i>accompagnato</i> (also known as &quot;stromentato&quot;) in which the orchestra provided accompaniment. By the 19th century, <i>accompagnato</i> had gained the upper hand, the orchestra played a much bigger role, and <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> revolutionised opera by abolishing almost all distinction between aria and recitative in his quest for what he termed &quot;endless melody&quot;. Subsequent composers have tended to follow Wagner&#39;s example, though some, such as <!--del_lnk--> Stravinsky in his <i>The Rake&#39;s Progress</i> have bucked the trend. The terminology of the various kinds of operatic voices is described in Section 3 below.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The word <i>opera</i> means &quot;works&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Italian (from the plural of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>opus</i> meaning &quot;work&quot; or &quot;labour&quot;) suggesting that it combines the arts of solo and choral singing, declamation, acting and dancing in a staged spectacle. <i>Dafne</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jacopo Peri was the earliest composition considered opera, as understood today. It was written around 1597, largely under the inspiration of an elite circle of literate <!--del_lnk--> Florentine <!--del_lnk--> humanists who gathered as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Camerata&quot;. Significantly, <i>Dafne</i> was an attempt to revive the classical <!--del_lnk--> Greek drama, part of the wider revival of antiquity characteristic of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. The members of the Camerata considered that the &quot;chorus&quot; parts of Greek dramas were originally sung, and possibly even the entire text of all roles; opera was thus conceived as a way of &quot;restoring&quot; this situation. <i>Dafne</i> is unfortunately lost. A later work by Peri, <i><!--del_lnk--> Euridice</i>, dating from 1600, is the first opera score to have survived to the present day. The honour of being the first opera still to be regularly performed, however, goes to <!--del_lnk--> Claudio Monteverdi&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Orfeo</i>, composed for the court of <!--del_lnk--> Mantua in <!--del_lnk--> 1607.<p><a id="Italian_opera" name="Italian_opera"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Italian opera</span></h3>

      <p>Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long; in 1637 the idea of a &quot;season&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Carnival) of publicly-attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the city from Mantua and composed his last operas, <i><!--del_lnk--> Il ritorno d&#39;Ulisse in patria</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;incoronazione di Poppea</i>, for the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated sensibilities, sparking the first of opera&#39;s many reform movements, sponsored by Venice&#39;s Arcadian Academy which came to be associated with the poet <!--del_lnk--> Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of <!--del_lnk--> opera seria, which became the leading form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called <!--del_lnk--> opera buffa.<p><i>Opera seria</i> was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, usually consisting of <i>secco</i> recitative interspersed with long <i>da capo</i> arias. These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden age of <i>opera seria</i> the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually written for the <!--del_lnk--> castrato voice; castrati such as <!--del_lnk--> Farinelli and <!--del_lnk--> Senesino, as well as female <!--del_lnk--> sopranos such as <!--del_lnk--> Faustina Bordoni, became in great demand throughout Europe as <i>opera seria</i> ruled the stage in every country except France. Italian opera set the Baroque standard. Italian <!--del_lnk--> libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like <!--del_lnk--> Handel found himself writing for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the <!--del_lnk--> classical period as well, for example in the operas of <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>, who wrote in Vienna near the century&#39;s close. Leading Italian-born composers of <!--del_lnk--> opera seria include <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Scarlatti, <!--del_lnk--> Vivaldi and <!--del_lnk--> Porpora.<p><a id="Reform:_Gluck.2C_the_attack_on_the_Metastasian_ideal.2C_and_Mozart" name="Reform:_Gluck.2C_the_attack_on_the_Metastasian_ideal.2C_and_Mozart"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Reform: Gluck, the attack on the Metastasian ideal, and Mozart</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Opera seria had its weaknesses and critics, and the taste for embellishment on behalf of the superbly trained singers, and the use of spectacle as a replacement for dramatic purity and unity drew attacks. <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Algarotti&#39;s <i>Essay on the Opera</i> (1755) proved to be an inspiration for <!--del_lnk--> Christoph Willibald Gluck&#39;s reforms. He advocated that <i>opera seria</i> had to return to basics and that all the various elements -- music (both instrumental and vocal), ballet, and staging -- must be subservient to the overriding drama. Several composers of the period, including <!--del_lnk--> Niccol&ograve; Jommelli and <!--del_lnk--> Tommaso Traetta, attempted to put these ideals into practice. The first to really succeed and to leave a permanent imprint upon the history of opera, however, was Gluck. Gluck tried to achieve a &quot;beautiful simplicity&quot;. This is illustrated in the first of his &quot;reform&quot; operas, <i><!--del_lnk--> Orfeo ed Euridice</i>, where vocal lines lacking in the virtuosity of (say) Handel&#39;s works are supported by simple harmonies and a notably richer-than-usual orchestral presence throughout.<p>Gluck&#39;s reforms have had resonance throughout operatic history. Weber, Mozart and Wagner, in particular, were influenced by his ideals. Mozart, in many ways Gluck&#39;s successor, combined a superb sense of drama, harmony, melody, and counterpoint to write a series of comedies, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> Cos&igrave; fan tutte</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Marriage_of_Figaro.htm" title="The Marriage of Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a></i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Don Giovanni</i> (in collaboration with <!--del_lnk--> Lorenzo Da Ponte) which remain among the most-loved, popular and well-known operas today. But Mozart&#39;s contribution to <i>opera seria</i> was more mixed; by his time it was dying away, and in spite of such fine works as <i><!--del_lnk--> Idomeneo</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> La Clemenza di Tito</i>, he would not succeed in bringing the art form back to life again. <div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> bel canto opera movement flourished in the early 19th century and is exemplified by the operas of <!--del_lnk--> Rossini, <!--del_lnk--> Bellini, <!--del_lnk--> Donizetti, <!--del_lnk--> Pacini, <!--del_lnk--> Mercadante and many others. Literally &quot;beautiful singing&quot;, <i>bel canto</i> opera derives from the Italian stylistic singing school of the same name. Bel canto lines are typically florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control.<p>Following the bel canto era, a more direct, forceful style was rapidly popularized by <a href="../../wp/g/Giuseppe_Verdi.htm" title="Giuseppe Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, beginning with his biblical opera <i><!--del_lnk--> Nabucco</i>. Verdi&#39;s operas resonated with the growing spirit of Italian nationalism in the post-<a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleonic</a> era, and he quickly became an icon of the patriotic movement (although his own politics were perhaps not quite so radical). In the early 1850s, Verdi produced his three most popular operas: <i><!--del_lnk--> Rigoletto</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Il trovatore</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> La traviata</i>. But he continued to develop his style, composing perhaps the greatest French <!--del_lnk--> Grand opera, <i><!--del_lnk--> Don Carlos</i>, and ending his career with two <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare-inspired</a> works, <i><!--del_lnk--> Otello</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Falstaff</i>, which reveal how far Italian opera had grown in sophistication since the early 19th century.<p>After Verdi, the sentimental &quot;realistic&quot; melodrama of <!--del_lnk--> verismo appeared in Italy. This was a style introduced by <!--del_lnk--> Pietro Mascagni&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Cavalleria Rusticana</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Ruggiero Leoncavallo&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Pagliacci</i> that came virtually to dominate the world&#39;s opera stages with such popular works as <!--del_lnk--> Giacomo Puccini&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> La Boheme</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tosca</i>, and <i><a href="../../wp/m/Madama_Butterfly.htm" title="Madama Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a></i>. Later Italian composers, such as <!--del_lnk--> Berio and <!--del_lnk--> Nono, have experimented with <!--del_lnk--> modernism.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>In rivalry with imported Italian opera productions, a separate French tradition was founded by the Italian <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of <!--del_lnk--> King Louis XIV. Despite his foreign origin, Lully established an <!--del_lnk--> Academy of Music and monopolised French opera from 1672. Starting with <i><!--del_lnk--> Cadmus et Hermione</i>, Lully and his librettist <!--del_lnk--> Quinault created <i><!--del_lnk--> trag&eacute;die en musique</i>,a form in which dance music and choral writing were particularly prominent. Lully&#39;s operas also show a concern for expressive <!--del_lnk--> recitative which matched the contours of the French language. In the 18th century, Lully&#39;s most important successor was <!--del_lnk--> Rameau, who composed five <i><!--del_lnk--> trag&eacute;dies en musique</i> as well as numerous works in other genres such as <!--del_lnk--> opera-ballet, all notable for their rich orchestration and harmonic daring. After Rameau&#39;s death, the German <!--del_lnk--> Gluck was persuaded to produce six operas for the <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Parisian stage</a> in the 1770s. They show the influence of Rameau, but simplified and with greater focus on the drama. At the same time, by the middle of the 18th century another genre was gaining popularity in France: <i><!--del_lnk--> op&eacute;ra comique</i>. This was the equivalent of the German <!--del_lnk--> singspiel, where arias alternated with spoken dialogue. Notable examples in this style were produced by <!--del_lnk--> Monsigny, <!--del_lnk--> Philidor and, above all, <!--del_lnk--> Gr&eacute;try. During the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">Revolutionary</a> period, composers such as <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;hul and <!--del_lnk--> Cherubini, who were followers of Gluck, brought a new seriousness to the genre, which had never been wholly &quot;comic&quot; in any case.<p>By the 1820s, Gluckian influence in France had given way to a taste for Italian <!--del_lnk--> bel canto, especially after the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> Rossini in Paris. Rossini&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Guillaume Tell</i> helped found the new genre of <!--del_lnk--> Grand opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, <!--del_lnk--> Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer&#39;s works, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Les Huguenots</i> emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter <i>op&eacute;ra comique</i> also enjoyed tremendous success in the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Bo&iuml;eldieu, <!--del_lnk--> Auber, <!--del_lnk--> H&eacute;rold and <!--del_lnk--> Adolphe Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer <!--del_lnk--> Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz&#39;s epic masterpiece <i><!--del_lnk--> Les Troyens</i>, the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.<p>In the second half of the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach created <!--del_lnk--> operetta with witty and cynical works such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Orph&eacute;e aux enfers</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Charles Gounod scored a massive success with <i><!--del_lnk--> Faust</i>; and <!--del_lnk--> Bizet composed <i><!--del_lnk--> Carmen</i>, which, once audiences learned to accept its blend of <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and realism, became the most popular of all op&eacute;ra comiques. <!--del_lnk--> Massenet, <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Sa&euml;ns and <!--del_lnk--> Delibes all composed works which are still part of the standard repertory. At the same time, the influence of <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> was felt as a challenge to the French tradition. Many French critics angrily rejected Wagner&#39;s music dramas while many French composers closely imitated them with variable success. Perhaps the most interesting response came from <!--del_lnk--> Claude Debussy. As in Wagner&#39;s works, the orchestra plays a leading role in Debussy&#39;s unique opera <i><!--del_lnk--> Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1902) and there are no real arias, only recitative. But the drama is understated, enigmatic and completely unWagnerian.<p>Other notable 20th century names include <!--del_lnk--> Ravel, <!--del_lnk--> Dukas, <!--del_lnk--> Roussel and <!--del_lnk--> Milhaud. <!--del_lnk--> Francis Poulenc is one of the very few post-war composers of any nationality whose operas (which include <i><!--del_lnk--> Dialogues des carm&eacute;lites)</i>) have gained a foothold in the international repertory. <!--del_lnk--> Olivier Messiaen&#39;s lengthy sacred drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d&#39;Assise</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1983) has also attracted widespread attention.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>The first German opera was <i>Dafne</i>, composed by <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Sch&uuml;tz in <!--del_lnk--> 1627 (the music has not survived). Italian opera held a great sway over German-speaking countries until the late 18th century. Nevertheless, native forms developed too. In <!--del_lnk--> 1644 <!--del_lnk--> Sigmund Staden produced the first <i><!--del_lnk--> Singspiel</i>, a popular form of German-language opera in which singing alternates with spoken dialogue. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Theatre am G&auml;nsemarkt in <a href="../../wp/h/Hamburg.htm" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> presented German operas by <!--del_lnk--> Keiser, <!--del_lnk--> Telemann and <!--del_lnk--> Handel. Yet many of the major German composers of the time, including Handel himself, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Graun, <!--del_lnk--> Hasse and later <!--del_lnk--> Gluck, chose to write most of their operas in foreign languages, especially Italian.<p><a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>&#39;s <i>Singspiele</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Die Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1782) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Die Zauberfl&ouml;te</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1791) were an important breakthrough in achieving international recognition for German opera. The tradition was developed in the 19th century by <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a> with his <i><!--del_lnk--> Fidelio</i>, inspired by the climate of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Carl Maria von Weber established <!--del_lnk--> German Romantic opera in opposition to the dominance of Italian <!--del_lnk--> bel canto. His <i>Der Freisch&uuml;tz</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1821) shows his genius for creating supernatural atmosphere.

      <p>Wagner was one of the most revolutionary and controversial composers in musical history. Starting under the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Weber and <!--del_lnk--> Meyerbeer, he gradually evolved a new concept of opera as a <i>Gesamtkunstwerk</i> (a &quot;complete work of art&quot;), a fusion of music, poetry and painting. In his mature music dramas,<i><!--del_lnk--> Tristan und Isolde, <!--del_lnk--> Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg, <!--del_lnk--> Der Ring des Nibelungen</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Parsifal</i>, he abolished the distinction between aria and recitative in favour of a seamless flow of &quot;endless melody&quot;.He greatly increased the role and power of the orchestra, creating scores with a complex web of <!--del_lnk--> leitmotivs, recurring themes often associated with the characters and concepts of the drama; and he was prepared to violate accepted musical conventions, such as <!--del_lnk--> tonality, in his quest for greater expressivity. Wagner also brought a new philosophical dimension to opera in his works, which were usually based on stories from <!--del_lnk--> Germanic or <!--del_lnk--> Arthurian legend. Finally, Wagner built his own opera house at <!--del_lnk--> Bayreuth, exclusively dedicated to performing his own works in the style he wanted.<p>Opera would never be the same after Wagner and for many composers his legacy proved a heavy burden. On the other hand, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Strauss accepted Wagnerian ideas but took them in wholly new directions. He first won fame with the scandalous <i><!--del_lnk--> Salome</i> and the dark tragedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Elektra</i>, in which tonality was pushed to the limits. Then Strauss changed tack in his greatest success, <i><!--del_lnk--> Der Rosenkavalier</i>, where <!--del_lnk--> Mozart and <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Viennese</a> <!--del_lnk--> waltzes became as important an influence as Wagner. Strauss continued to produce a highly varied body of operatic works, often with libretti by the poet <!--del_lnk--> Hugo von Hofmannsthal, right up until <i><!--del_lnk--> Capriccio</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1942. Other composers who made individual contributions to German opera in the early 20th century include <!--del_lnk--> Zemlinsky, <!--del_lnk--> Hindemith, <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Weill and the Italian-born <!--del_lnk--> Ferruccio Busoni. The operatic innovations of <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Schoenberg and his successors are discussed in the section on modernism.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>England&#39;s first notable composer working in operatic formats was <!--del_lnk--> John Blow, the composer of <i><a href="../../wp/v/Venus_and_Adonis_%2528opera%2529.htm" title="Venus and Adonis (opera)">Venus and Adonis</a></i>, often thought of as the first true English-language opera. Blow&#39;s immediate successor was the far more well-known <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Purcell.htm" title="Henry Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>. Despite the success of his masterwork <i><a href="../../wp/d/Dido_and_Aeneas.htm" title="Dido and Aeneas">Dido and Aeneas</a></i>, in which the action is furthered by the use of Italian-style recitative, much of Purcell&#39;s best work was not involved in the composing of typical opera but instead he usually worked within the constraints of the <!--del_lnk--> semi-opera format, where isolated scenes and <!--del_lnk--> masques are contained within the structure of a spoken play. The main characters of the play tend not to be involved in the musical scenes, which means that Purcell was rarely able to develop his characters through song. Despite these hindrances, his aim (and that of his collaborator <!--del_lnk--> John Dryden) was to establish serious opera in England, but these hopes ended with Purcell&#39;s early death at the age of 36.<p>Following Purcell, for many years Great Britain was essentially an outpost of Italianate opera. Handel&#39;s <i>opera serias</i> dominated the London operatic stages for decades, and even home-grown composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Arne wrote using Italian models. This situation continued throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, including <!--del_lnk--> Michael Balfe, except for <!--del_lnk--> ballad operas, such as <!--del_lnk--> John Gay&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Beggar&#39;s Opera</i>, which spoofed operatic conventions, and late <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era <!--del_lnk--> light operas, notably <a href="../../wp/a/Arthur_Sullivan.htm" title="Arthur Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Savoy Operas. French operetta was also frequently heard in London through the 1870s.<p>However, in the 20th century, English opera began to assert more independence with works of <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Vaughn Williams and in particular <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Britten.htm" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, who in a series of fine works that remain in standard repertory today revealed an excellent flair for the dramatic and superb musicality. Today composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Ad&egrave;s continue to export English opera abroad.<div class="medialist listenlist">

      <p>Opera was brought to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> in the 1730s by the <!--del_lnk--> Italian operatic <!--del_lnk--> troupes and soon it became an important part of entertainment for the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Court and <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy. Many foreign composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Baldassare Galuppi, <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Paisiello, <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Sarti, and <!--del_lnk--> Domenico Cimarosa (as well as various others) were invited to Russia to compose new operas, mostly in the <!--del_lnk--> Italian language. Simultaneously some domestic musicians like <!--del_lnk--> Maksym Berezovsky and <!--del_lnk--> Dmytro Bortniansky were sent abroad to learn to write operas. The first opera written in <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a> was <i><!--del_lnk--> Tsefal i Prokris</i> by the Italian composer <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Araja (1755). The development of Russian-language opera was supported by the Russian composers <!--del_lnk--> Vasily Pashkevich, <!--del_lnk--> Yevstigney Fomin and <!--del_lnk--> Alexey Verstovsky.<p>However, the real birth of <!--del_lnk--> Russian opera came with <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Glinka and his two great operas <i><!--del_lnk--> A Life for the Tsar</i>, (1836) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Ruslan and Lyudmila</i> (1842). After him in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> in Russia there were written such operatic masterpieces as <i><!--del_lnk--> Rusalka</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Stone Guest</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Dargomyzhsky, <i><!--del_lnk--> Boris Godunov</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Khovanshchina</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Modest Mussorgsky, <i><!--del_lnk--> Prince Igor</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Borodin, <i><!--del_lnk--> Eugene Onegin</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Queen of Spades</i> by <a href="../../wp/p/Pyotr_Ilyich_Tchaikovsky.htm" title="Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Tchaikovsky</a>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Snow Maiden</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Sadko</i> by <a href="../../wp/n/Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov.htm" title="Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>. These developments mirrored the growth of Russian <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> across the artistic spectrum, as part of the more general <!--del_lnk--> Slavophilism movement.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> the <!--del_lnk--> traditions of Russian opera were developed by many composers including <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Rachmaninov in his works <i><!--del_lnk--> The Miserly Knight</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Franchesca da Rimini</i>, <a href="../../wp/i/Igor_Stravinsky.htm" title="Igor Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> in <i><!--del_lnk--> Le rossignol</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Mavra</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Oedipus rex</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rake&#39;s Progress</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Prokofiev in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gambler</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Love for Three Oranges</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Fiery Angel</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Betrothal in a Monastery</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> War and Peace</i>; as well as <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Shostakovich in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Nose</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Edison Denisov in <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;&eacute;cume des jours</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Schnittke in <i><!--del_lnk--> Life With an Idiot</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia von D.

      <p><a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> also produced its own distinctive form of opera, known as <!--del_lnk--> zarzuela, which had two separate flowerings: one in the 17th century, and another beginning in the mid-19th century. During the 18th century, Italian opera was immensely popular in Spain, supplanting the native form.<p>Czech composers also developed a thriving national opera movement of their own in the 19th century, starting with <!--del_lnk--> Bed&#x159;ich Smetana who wrote eight operas including the internationally popular <i><!--del_lnk--> The Bartered Bride</i>. <a href="../../wp/a/Anton%25C3%25ADn_Dvo%25C5%2599%25C3%25A1k.htm" title="Anton&iacute;n Dvo&#x159;&aacute;k">Anton&iacute;n Dvo&#x159;&aacute;k</a>, most famous for <i><!--del_lnk--> Rusalka</i>, wrote 13 operas; and <!--del_lnk--> Leo&scaron; Jan&aacute;&#x10D;ek gained international recognition in the 20th century for his innovative works including <i><!--del_lnk--> Jen&#x16F;fa</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cunning Little Vixen</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> K&aacute;&#x165;a Kabanov&aacute;</i>.<p>The key figure of Hungarian national opera in the 19th century was <!--del_lnk--> Ferenc Erkel, whose works mostly dealt with historical themes.

The most famous modern Hungarian opera is <!--del_lnk--> B&eacute;la Bart&oacute;k&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Duke Bluebeard&#39;s Castle</i>.

      <p><a id="Modernism" name="Modernism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Modernism</span></h4>
      <p>Perhaps the most obvious stylistic manifestation of modernism in opera is the development of <a href="../../wp/a/Atonality.htm" title="Atonality">atonality</a>. The move away from traditional tonality in opera had begun with <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Wagner.htm" title="Richard Wagner">Wagner</a>, and in particular the <!--del_lnk--> Tristan chord, but after his death no further innovations in style were introduced for a considerable length of time. Composers such as <!--del_lnk--> Richard Strauss, <!--del_lnk--> Giacomo Puccini, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Hindemith and <!--del_lnk--> Hans Pfitzner adapted and worked within Wagnerian parameters but did not go very far beyond them.<p>Operatic Modernism truly began in the operas of two Viennese composers, <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Schoenberg and his acolyte <!--del_lnk--> Alban Berg, both composers and advocates of atonality and its later development (as worked out by Schoenberg), <!--del_lnk--> dodecaphony. Schoenberg&#39;s early musico-dramatic works, <i><!--del_lnk--> Erwartung</i> (1909, premiered in 1924) and <i>Die Gluckliche Hand</i> display heavy use of chromatic harmony and dissonance in general. Schoenberg also occasionally used <!--del_lnk--> Sprechstimme, which he described as: &quot;The voice rising and falling relative to the indicated intervals, and everything being bound together with the time and rhythm of the music except where a pause is indicated&quot;.<p>The two operas of Schoenberg&#39;s pupil Alban Berg, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wozzeck</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Lulu</i> (left incomplete at his death) share many of the same characteristics as described above, though Berg combined his highly personal interpretation of Schoenberg&#39;s twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg&#39;s theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques. Composers thus influenced include the Englishman <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Britten.htm" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, the German <!--del_lnk--> Hans Werner Henze, and the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Shostakovich. (<!--del_lnk--> Philip Glass also makes use of atonality, though his style is generally described as <!--del_lnk--> minimalist, usually thought of as another 20th century development.)<p>However, operatic modernism&#39;s use of dodecaphony sparked a backlash among several leading composers. Prominent among the vanguard of these was the Russian <a href="../../wp/i/Igor_Stravinsky.htm" title="Igor Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>. After composing obviously Modernist music for the <!--del_lnk--> Diaghilev-produced ballets <i><!--del_lnk--> Petrushka</i> and <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Rite_of_Spring.htm" title="The Rite of Spring">The Rite of Spring</a></i>, in the 1920s Stravinsky turned to <!--del_lnk--> Neoclassicism, culminating in his opera-oratorio <i><!--del_lnk--> Oedipus Rex</i>. When he did compose a full-length opera that was without doubt an opera (after his Rimsky-Korsakov-inspired works <i>The Nightingale</i> (1914), and <i>Mavra</i> (1922)), in the <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rake&#39;s Progress</i> he continued to ignore serialist techniques and wrote an 18th century-style &quot;number&quot; opera, using diatonicism. His resistance to <!--del_lnk--> serialism proved to be an inspiration for many other composers.<p><a id="Other_trends" name="Other_trends"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other trends</span></h4>
      <p>A common trend throughout the 20th Century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, is the downsizing of orchestral forces. As patronage of the arts decreases, new works are commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and one act operas. Many of <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Britten.htm" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>&#39;s operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; <!--del_lnk--> Mark Adamo&#39;s two-act realization of <i><!--del_lnk--> Little Women</i> is scored for 18 instrumentalists.<p>Another feature of 20th Century opera is the emergence of contemporary historical operas. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Death of Klinghoffer</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Nixon in China</i> by <!--del_lnk--> John Adams, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Dead Man Walking</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jake Heggie exemplify the dramatisation on stage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive at the time of the premiere performance. Earlier models of opera generally stuck to more distant history, re-telling contemporary fictional stories (reworkings of popular plays), or mythical/legendary stories.<p>The Metropolitan Opera reports that the average age of its patrons is now 60. Many opera companies, have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for <!--del_lnk--> classical music since the last decades of the 20th century.<p><a id="From_musicals_back_towards_opera" name="From_musicals_back_towards_opera"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">From musicals back towards opera</span></h4>
      <p>Also by the late 1930s, some <!--del_lnk--> musicals began to be written with a more operatic structure. These works include complex polyphonic ensembles and reflect musical developments of their times. <i><a href="../../wp/p/Porgy_and_Bess.htm" title="Porgy and Bess">Porgy and Bess</a></i>, influenced by jazz styles, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Candide</i>, with its sweeping, lyrical passages and farcical parodies of opera, both opened on <!--del_lnk--> Broadway but became accepted as part of the opera repertory. <i><!--del_lnk--> Show Boat</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> West Side Story</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Brigadoon</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sweeney Todd</i>, <i><a href="../../wp/e/Eva_Per%25C3%25B3n.htm" title="Evita">Evita</a></i> and others tell dramatic stories through complex music and are now sometimes seen in opera houses. Some musicals, beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> Tommy</i> (1969) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Jesus Christ Superstar</i> (1971), are through-composed, written with recitative instead of dialogue, telling their emotional stories predominantly through the music, and are styled <!--del_lnk--> rock operas.<p><a id="Operatic_voices" name="Operatic_voices"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Operatic voices</span></h2>
      <p>Singers and the roles they play are initially classified according to their vocal ranges. Male singers are classified by <!--del_lnk--> vocal range as <!--del_lnk--> bass, <!--del_lnk--> bass-baritone, <!--del_lnk--> baritone, <!--del_lnk--> tenor and <!--del_lnk--> countertenor. Female singers are classified by vocal range as <!--del_lnk--> contralto, <!--del_lnk--> mezzo-soprano and <!--del_lnk--> soprano. Additionally, singers&#39; voices are loosely identified by characteristics other than range, such as timbre or colour, vocal quality, agility, power, and <!--del_lnk--> tessitura. Thus a soprano may be termed a lyric soprano, <!--del_lnk--> coloratura, <i>soubrette</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> spinto</i>, or dramatic soprano; these terms, although not fully describing a singing voice, associate the singer&#39;s voice with the roles most suitable to the singer&#39;s vocal characteristics. The German <!--del_lnk--> Fach system is an especially organized system of vocal classification. A particular singer&#39;s voice may change drastically over his or her lifetime, rarely reaching vocal maturity until the third decade, and sometimes not until middle age.<p><a id="Histories" name="Histories"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Histories</span></h3>
      <p>The soprano voice has typically been used throughout operatic history as the voice of choice for the female protagonist of the opera in question. The current emphasis on a wide vocal range was primarily an invention of the <!--del_lnk--> Classical period. Before that, the vocal virtuosity, not range, was the priority, with soprano parts rarely extending above a high A (<!--del_lnk--> Handel, for example, only wrote one role extending to a high C), though the castrato <!--del_lnk--> Farinelli was alleged to possess a top F. The contralto register enjoys only a limited operatic repertoire; hence the saying that contraltos only sing &quot;Witches, bitches, and <!--del_lnk--> britches&quot;, and in recent years many of the trouser roles from the Baroque era have been assigned to countertenors.<p>The tenor voice, from the Classical era onwards, has traditionally been assigned the role of male protagonist. Many of the most challenging tenor roles in the repertory were written during the <i>bel canto</i> era, such as <!--del_lnk--> Donizetti&#39;s sequence of 9 Cs above middle C during <i><!--del_lnk--> La fille du r&eacute;giment</i>. With Wagner came an emphasis on vocal weight for his protagonist roles, the vocal category of which is described by the term <i>heldentenor</i>. Bass roles have a long history in opera, having been used in <i>opera seria</i> for comic relief (and as a contrast to the preponderance of high voices in this genre). The bass repertoire is wide and varied, stretching from the <i>buffo</i> comedy of Leporello in <i><!--del_lnk--> Don Giovanni</i> to the nobility of Wotan in <!--del_lnk--> Wagner&#39;s Ring Cycle. In between the bass and the tenor is the baritone.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera&quot;</div>
