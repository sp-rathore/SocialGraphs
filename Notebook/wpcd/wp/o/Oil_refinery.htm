      <p>Raw oil or unprocessed (&quot;crude&quot;) oil is not very useful in the form it comes in out of the ground. Although &quot;light, sweet&quot; (low viscosity, low sulfur) oil has been used directly as a burner fuel for steam vessel propulsion, the lighter elements form explosive vapors in the fuel tanks and so it is quite dangerous, especially so in <!--del_lnk--> warships. For this and many other uses, the oil needs to be separated into parts and refined before use in <!--del_lnk--> fuels and <!--del_lnk--> lubricants, and before some of the byproducts could be used in petrochemical processes to form materials such as <!--del_lnk--> plastics, and <!--del_lnk--> foams. <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">Petroleum</a> <!--del_lnk--> fossil fuels are used in <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ship</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobile</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft.htm" title="Aircraft">aircraft</a> <!--del_lnk--> engines. These different <!--del_lnk--> hydrocarbons have different <!--del_lnk--> boiling points, which means they can be separated by <!--del_lnk--> distillation. Since the lighter liquid elements are in great demand for use in internal combustion engines, a modern refinery will convert heavy <!--del_lnk--> hydrocarbons and lighter gaseous elements into these higher value products using complex and energy intensive processes.<p>Oil can be used in so many various ways because it contains hydrocarbons of varying <!--del_lnk--> molecular masses, forms and lengths such as <!--del_lnk--> paraffins, <!--del_lnk--> aromatics, <!--del_lnk--> naphthenes (or <!--del_lnk--> cycloalkanes), <!--del_lnk--> alkenes, <!--del_lnk--> dienes, and <!--del_lnk--> alkynes. Hydrocarbons are molecules of varying length and complexity made of only <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a>. Their various structures give them their differing properties and thereby uses. The trick in the oil refinement process is separating and purifying these.<p>Once separated and purified of any contaminants and impurities, the fuel or lubricant can be sold without any further processing. Smaller molecules such as <!--del_lnk--> isobutane and <!--del_lnk--> propylene or <!--del_lnk--> butylenes can be recombined to meet specific <!--del_lnk--> octane requirements of fuels by processes such as <!--del_lnk--> alkylation or less commonly, <!--del_lnk--> dimerization. Octane grade of gasoline can also be improved by <!--del_lnk--> catalytic reforming, which strips hydrogen out of hydrocarbons to produce <!--del_lnk--> aromatics, which have much higher <!--del_lnk--> octane ratings. Intermediate products such as <!--del_lnk--> gasoils can even be reprocessed to break a heavy, long-chained oil into a lighter short-chained one, by various forms of <!--del_lnk--> cracking such as Fluid Catalytic Cracking, Thermal Cracking, and Hydrocracking. The final step in gasoline production is the blending of fuels with different octane ratings, <!--del_lnk--> vapor pressures, and other properties to meet product specifications.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>Oil refineries are typically large sprawling <a href="../../wp/i/Industry.htm" title="Industry">industrial</a> complexes with extensive <!--del_lnk--> piping running throughout. The refining process releases numerous different chemicals into the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>; consequently, there are substantial <!--del_lnk--> air pollution emissions and a notable <!--del_lnk--> odour normally accompanies the presence of a refinery. Aside from air pollution impacts there are also wastewater concerns, upset risks of fire and explosion, and both <!--del_lnk--> occupational noise and environmental <!--del_lnk--> noise health effects.<p>The public has demanded that many governments place restrictions on contaminants that refineries release, and most refineries have installed the equipment needed to comply with the requirements of the pertinent environmental protection regulatory agencies. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, there is strong pressure to prevent the development of new refineries, and no major refinery has been built in the country since <!--del_lnk--> Marathon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Garyville facility in <!--del_lnk--> 1976. However, many existing refineries have been expanded during that time. Environmental restrictions and pressure to prevent construction of new refineries have also contributed to rising fuel prices in the United States.<p>Environmental and safety concerns mean that oil refineries are sometimes located some distance away from major urban areas. Nevertheless, there are many instances where refinery operations are close to populated areas and pose health risks such as in <!--del_lnk--> Tenerife, Spain , which is sited in a densely-populated city centre and next to the only two major evacuation routes in and out of the city. In <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> Contra Costa County and <!--del_lnk--> Solano County, a shoreline necklace of refineries and associated chemical plants are adjacent to urban areas in <!--del_lnk--> Richmond, <!--del_lnk--> Martinez, California, <!--del_lnk--> Pacheco, <!--del_lnk--> Concord, <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburg, <!--del_lnk--> Vallejo and <!--del_lnk--> Benicia, with occasional accidental events that require &quot;shelter in place&quot; orders to the adjacent populations.<p><a id="Common_process_units_found_in_a_refinery" name="Common_process_units_found_in_a_refinery"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Common process units found in a refinery</span></h2>

      <p>Frequently a <!--del_lnk--> chemical plant will be sited adjacent to a refinery, utilizing intermediate products as feedstocks for the production of specialized materials such as <!--del_lnk--> plastics or <!--del_lnk--> agrichemicals.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The world&#39;s first oil refinery opened at <!--del_lnk--> Ploie&#x15F;ti, <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1856 . Several other refineries were built at that location with investment from <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> companies before being taken over by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Most of these refineries were bombarded by the <!--del_lnk--> US Air Force in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Tidal Wave, <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1943. Since then they have been rebuilt, and currently pose somewhat of an environmental concern.<p>Another early example is <!--del_lnk--> Olje&ouml;n, now preserved as a museum at the <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO <!--del_lnk--> world heritage site <!--del_lnk--> Engelsberg. It started operation in 1875 and is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Ecomuseum Bergslagen.<p>It is difficult to exactly state which is largest oil refinery in the world. At one time this was claimed to be <!--del_lnk--> Ras Tanura, <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, owned by <!--del_lnk--> Saudi Aramco. For most of the 20th century, the largest refinery of the world was that of <a href="../../wp/a/Abadan.htm" title="Abadan">Abadan</a> in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. This refinery suffered extensive damage in the IRAN/IRAQ war. The Guinness Book of World Records now (October 2006) records the BP Amoco refinery in Texas City, USA, as the refinery with the largest capacity (433,000 barrels/day which is approximately 15,143,482 Imperial <!--del_lnk--> Gallon).<p>Early US refineries processed crude oil to recover the <!--del_lnk--> kerosene. Other products (like gasoline) were considered wastes and were often dumped directly into the nearest river. The invention of the automobile shifted the demand to gasoline and diesel, which remain the primary refined products today. Refineries pre-dating the EPA were very toxic to the environment. Strict legislation has mandated that refineries meet modern air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, obtaining a permit to build even a modern refinery with minimal impact on the environment (other than CO2 emmissions) is so difficult and costly that no new refineries have been built in the United States since 1976. As a result, the US is becoming more and more dependent on the imports of finished gasoline, as opposed to incremental crude oil.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery&quot;</div>
