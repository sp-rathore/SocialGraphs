      <p>Ouagadougou is the capital of <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>. Burkina Faso was called the Republic of Upper Volta when it gained independence from France in <!--del_lnk--> 1960. It was renamed Burkina Faso by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Sankara in <!--del_lnk--> 1984. The name <i>Ouagadougou</i> goes back to the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>. At that time, two different tribes, the <!--del_lnk--> Yonyonse and the <!--del_lnk--> Ninsi, inhabited the area. They were in constant conflict. This ended in <!--del_lnk--> 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a>&rsquo;s history, led his tribe to victory. He then renamed the area from &ldquo;Kumbee-Tenga&rdquo;, as the Ninsi had called it, to &ldquo;Wogodogo&rdquo;, meaning &quot;where people get honour and respect.&quot; <i>Ouagadougou</i> is a corruption of Wogodogo. The spelling of the name <i>Ouagadougou</i> is derived from the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> orthography common in former French African colonies. If English orthography were used (as in Ghana or Nigeria), the spelling would be <i>Wagadugu</i>.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Ouagadougou, situated on the central plateau (12.4&deg; N 1.5&deg; W), grew around the imperial palace of the <!--del_lnk--> Mogho Naaba. Being an administrative center of colonial rule, it became an important urban center in the postcolonial era. Simultaneously the capital of the Mossi Empire and of Burkina Faso since 1947, Ouagadougou became a veritable communal centre in 1995.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
      <p>The first municipal elections were held in 1956. Ouagadougou is governed by a mayor, who is elected for a five year term, two senior councilors, and ninety councilors.<p>The city is divided into 5 districts, consisting of 30 sectors. Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, and Peuloghin and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about 219.3 km&sup2;. The population of this metropolitan area is estimated to be 1,200,000 inhabitants, consisting of 48% men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,249 inhabitants per square kilometer, according to 1997 statistics.<p>Concerning city management, the communes of Ouagadougou have made the decision to invest in huge projects. This is largely due to the fact that Ouagadougou constitutes a &#39;cultural centre&#39; by merit of holding the <!--del_lnk--> SIAO (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the <!--del_lnk--> FESPACO (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the growing affluence of the villages allow for such investment, and the fact that the population is growing rapidly necessitates it.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> climate of Ouagadougou is rather hot. The town is part of the Soudano-Sahelian area with a rainfall of 750 mm per year. The rainy season stretches from May to October with an average temperature of 30 &deg;C. The cold season stretches from December to January, with a minimum temperature of 19 &deg;C. The maximum temperature during the hot season, which runs from April to May, is 40 &deg;C. The <!--del_lnk--> Harmattan (a dry wind) and the <!--del_lnk--> Monsoon represent the two main factors which determine the climate of Ouagadougou.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h2>
      <p>Ouagadougou and its neighborhoods are very attractive places. There are a number of great places worth visiting.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="Parks" name="Parks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parks</span></h3>
      <p>A well-known site in Ouagadougou is the <!--del_lnk--> Bangr-Weoogo urban park (area: 2.63 km&sup2;). Before colonialism, it belonged to the Mosse chiefs. Considering it as a sacred forest, many went there for traditional initiations or for refuge. The French colonists, disregarding its local significance and history, established it as a park in the 1930s. In 1985, the park was started its renovations. In January 2001 the forest was renamed &ldquo;Parc Urbain Bangr-Weoogo&rdquo;, meaning &quot;the urban park of the forest of knowledge.&quot; Because of the many changes, new regulations have been put in place along with a new set of objectives for the park.<p>Another notable park in the capital city is the &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> L&rsquo;Unite Pedagogique&rdquo; which shelters animals in a semi-freedom state. This botanic garden/biosphere system stretches out over 80,000 m&sup2;, and also serves as a museum for the country&rsquo;s history.<p><a id="Other_sites" name="Other_sites"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other sites</span></h3>

       <li>&ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Jardin de l&rsquo;amitie Ouaga-Loudun&rdquo; (Garden of Ouaga-Loudun Friendship), with a green space that was renovated in 1996, is a symbol of the twin city relationship between Ouagadougou and Loudun in France. It is situated in the centre of the town, near the &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Nation Unies&rsquo;crossroads&rdquo;.</ul>

      <p>The citizens of Ouagadougou prefer their own motorcycles and bicycles (and more recently, cars) to public transportation. The city&#39;s automobiles are generally small and inexpensively made, using a small <!--del_lnk--> two-stroke cycle engine. Ouagadougou&#39;s citizens also travel in readily available green <!--del_lnk--> cabs, which will take their passengers anywhere in town for about 1,000 <!--del_lnk--> CFA. The downside is that they are slow and crowded, preferring to shuttle groups of people rather than individuals.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ouagadougou Airport serves the area with flights all over West Africa and to Europe.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>
