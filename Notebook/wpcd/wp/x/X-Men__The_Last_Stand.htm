      <p><i><b>X-Men: The Last Stand</b></i> is the third <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> adaptation of the <!--del_lnk--> Marvel Comics&#39; <!--del_lnk--> X-Men <!--del_lnk--> superhero <!--del_lnk--> comic books. It was directed by <!--del_lnk--> Brett Ratner and written by <!--del_lnk--> Simon Kinberg and <!--del_lnk--> Zak Penn. The previous two movies were <i><!--del_lnk--> X-Men</i> (2000) and <i><!--del_lnk--> X2</i> (2003). The movie revolves around a &quot;mutant cure&quot; that causes serious repercussions among <!--del_lnk--> mutants and humans, and on the mysterious resurrection of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Grey, who appeared to have died in <i>X2</i>. The film is based on two X-Men comic book story arcs: writer <!--del_lnk--> Chris Claremont&#39;s and artist <!--del_lnk--> John Byrne&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Uncanny X-Men</i> (1980), and writer <!--del_lnk--> Joss Whedon&#39;s six-issue &quot;Gifted&quot; arc in <i><!--del_lnk--> Astonishing X-Men</i> (2004).<p>The film was released <!--del_lnk--> May 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and one or two days earlier in approximately 22 other countries. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film has done extremely well at the <!--del_lnk--> box office. Its opening-day gross of $45.5 million is the third-highest on record while its opening weekend gross of $102.75 million is the fifth highest ever. Currently it holds the record for highest grossing movie during Memorial Day weekend totaling nearly $122.9 million in its first four days. It is the highest-grossing of the series, earning over $458.7 million worldwide.<p>The film is sometimes <!--del_lnk--> colloquially referred to as <i><b>X3</b></i> or <i><b>X-Men 3</b></i>.<p>

      <p>A pharmaceutical company called Worthington Labs announces that it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives mutants their powers and makes them different from humans, offering the &quot;cure&quot; to any mutant who wants it. While some mutants are interested in the &quot;cure&quot;, including the X-Men&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Rogue, many others are horrified by the announcement. In response to the news, the X-Men&#39;s adversary <!--del_lnk--> Magneto raises an army, warning his followers that the &quot;cure&quot; will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race.<p><!--del_lnk--> Cyclops, still depressed about the loss of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Grey, returns to Alkali Lake, where Jean sacrificed herself to save the X-Men. Jean appears to Cyclops, and as the two kiss, Jean changes and appears to kill Cyclops. Sensing trouble, <!--del_lnk--> Professor Charles Xavier sends <!--del_lnk--> Wolverine and <!--del_lnk--> Storm to investigate. When they arrive, the two X-Men encounter telekinetically floating rocks, Cyclops&#39; glasses, and an unconscious Jean.<p>Xavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself, she unleashed the powerful alternate personality she calls &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Phoenix&quot;. Wolverine is disgusted to learn that Xavier has kept Jean in check telepathically, but when Jean awakens, he realizes she is not the Jean Grey he knew. Jean pleads with Wolverine to kill her, but when he refuses, the Phoenix surfaces and telekinetically slams Wolverine into a wall. She then escapes to her childhood home.<p>Magneto, also aware that Jean is now a <!--del_lnk--> powerful mutant, meets Xavier at Jean&#39;s house. The two men vie for Jean&#39;s loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces, unleashing her devastating power. She destroys her family&#39;s house, disintegrates Xavier, and leaves with an uneasy Magneto.<p>Following the loss of Xavier, the X-Men regroup and confront Magneto&#39;s army, which is attacking the pharmaceutical company&#39;s laboratory on Alcatraz Island. During the fight, <!--del_lnk--> Beast injects Magneto with the &quot;cure&quot;, nullifying his mutant powers. After the battle, the Phoenix emerges and begins to destroy everything and everyone around her. Momentarily gaining control, Jean begs Wolverine to save her. Telling Jean he loves her, Wolverine reluctantly kills her with his claws.<p>Despite the X-Men&#39;s losses, life goes on. Magneto, now an ordinary man, sits at a chessboard and reaches out toward a metal chess piece that trembles slightly, hinting that the &quot;cure&quot; may not be as permanent as thought. <!--del_lnk--> Following the end credits, <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier&#39;s voice. Startled, she replies, &quot;Charles?&quot;<p><a id="Cast" name="Cast"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cast</span></h2>

The part for Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Bryan Singer, the director of the first two X-Men films, left the project during preproduction in order to direct the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman Returns</i>. He was joined by <i>X2</i> screenwriters <!--del_lnk--> Dan Harris and <!--del_lnk--> Michael Dougherty and composer / editor <!--del_lnk--> John Ottman. Though Singer, Harris and Dougherty had yet to complete a script, the director has revealed that at the time of his departure they had partially completed a story treatment for the film which would have focused exclusively on Jean Grey&#39;s resurrection with the new villain <!--del_lnk--> Emma Frost, a role intended for <!--del_lnk--> Sigourney Weaver.<p><!--del_lnk--> Simon Kinberg was hired as writer soon after Singer&#39;s departure, and speculation arose to Joss Whedon directing the film. <!--del_lnk--> Rob Bowman and <!--del_lnk--> Alex Proyas were also rumoured, though the latter personally turned it down. Despite the controversy over Singer&#39;s departure, the cast and producers were still clearly keen to return.<p><!--del_lnk--> Matthew Vaughn was hired as the new director for the project. He cast <!--del_lnk--> Kelsey Grammer as Beast and <!--del_lnk--> Vinnie Jones as <!--del_lnk--> Juggernaut, but family issues reportedly led him to withdraw before shooting began. Vaughn was replaced by Singer&#39;s friend Brett Ratner, who was among those originally considered to direct the first film &mdash; and coincidentally was considered by Warner Brothers to direct the 2006 <i>Superman</i> project before it evolved into <i><!--del_lnk--> Superman Returns</i>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, a review of an incomplete early draft of the <!--del_lnk--> screenplay posted by <!--del_lnk--> Drew McWeeny from <!--del_lnk--> Ain&#39;t It Cool News sparked controversy from fans, due to certain main characters&#39; storylines; however, that draft was the very first of over two-dozen drafts the film went through and has had numerous changes happen to the storylines. Most notably the Golden Gate Bridge was originally in the middle of the film, but Ratner decided it would create a more dramatic climax if moved to the end., where the climax was originally to take place at <!--del_lnk--> Washington D.C..<p><i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> began shooting in August 2005 and ended in January 2006. Much of X-Men: The Last Stand was filmed in <a href="../../wp/v/Vancouver.htm" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. According to associate producer Dave Gordon, &quot;This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada. It used to be <i>X2</i>, now it&#39;s <i>X3</i>.&quot;<p>Senior actors <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Stewart and <!--del_lnk--> Ian McKellen had their faces completely &quot;de-aged&quot; by complex <!--del_lnk--> keyframing, in which no <!--del_lnk--> CGI elements were used. A technique called &quot;digital skin-grafting&quot; was employed to make them look 20 years younger in the first-scene flashback.<p>The film has extensive wirework, where many of the actors performed some of their own stunts. The whirlwind wire-stunt performed by <!--del_lnk--> Halle Berry during one fight scene reportedly caused Berry to become so nauseated that she vomited. The crew actually had to bring in buckets for her before shooting her scenes. Angel&#39;s wings were initially too heavy for <!--del_lnk--> Ben Foster, and were remade from foam. Despite his fear of heights, Foster performed a single second unit stunt where he escapes Worthington&#39;s facility.<p><a id="Reception" name="Reception"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reception</span></h2>
      <p><i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> grossed $45.5 million domestically for the third-highest opening day after <i><!--del_lnk--> Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#39;s Chest</i> ($55 million) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i> ($50 million). It is ranked fourth among film debuts having generated an estimated $122.9 million domestically during its four-day <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Day opening weekend and the number one Memorial Day movie of all time. The website <i>The Numbers</i> notes that the film&#39;s weekend gross &quot;equals the record for the fewest number of days taken to earn $100 million, joining four other movies that achieved the feat in three days.&quot; However, the film suffered a significant drop of 66.9% in its second weekend, when its box office take fell to $34.0 million. Nevertheless, the film has grossed over $234 million in North America (third-highest of 2006) and over $458.7 million globally (fourth-highest of 2006). It is the fifth-highest-grossing comic book adaptation, and the highest grossing of the X-Men series. It became the first film of 2006, and the 67th film on record, to pass the $200 million mark at the North American box office, which it accomplished on the weekend of <!--del_lnk--> June 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. It is the first X-Men movie to surpass $200 million outside the United States. <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> is one of the few third installments in a series to outgross its predecessors, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Return of the King</i> being another example.<p>Reviews of the film have generally been mixed, with the film-review website <!--del_lnk--> Rotten Tomatoes giving the film a 57% approval rating. The film review aggregate site <!--del_lnk--> Metacritic also reported mixed reviews with a score of 58/100. It holds a 7.0/10 in the movie site IMDb. <i><!--del_lnk--> Ebert &amp; Roeper</i> gave the film two thumbs up, with Ebert stating &quot;I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I especially liked the way it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight it out with the special effects.&quot; Some film critics, however, considered the third film to be of lesser quality than the previous two. Justin Chang from <i><!--del_lnk--> Variety</i> said the film is &quot;a wham-bam <!--del_lnk--> sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas, moody atmospherics and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Frank Lovece of <i>Film Journal International</i> said, &quot;A risk-taking script with genuine consequences elevates this ... above the lackluster direction of Brett Ratner, whose competent mechanics move the story efficiently but with very little soul.&quot; Lawrence Toppman of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Charlotte Observer</i>, said, &quot;Director Brett Ratner can&#39;t make chicken a la king out of chicken droppings, and that&#39;s what writers Simon Kinberg (<i><!--del_lnk--> XXX: State of the Union</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</i>) and Zak Penn (<i><!--del_lnk--> Elektra</i>) supply.&quot;<p><a id="Possible_sequels_and_spin-offs" name="Possible_sequels_and_spin-offs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Possible sequels and spin-offs</span></h2>
      <p>Fox Films Entertainment Chairman Tom Rothman stated <i>The Last Stand</i> is the end of a trilogy, but not necessarily the end of the <i>X-Men</i> film series: &quot;These three movies work as a trilogy. These characters in this relationship, it&#39;s the culmination of that saga. It&#39;s the culmination and the resolution of those relationships laid out in the first two movies&quot;. Earlier, in a <!--del_lnk--> February 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 interview, Ratner said, &quot;We wanted to make sure the audiences knew that this was a trilogy. Even though they weren&#39;t made together like <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy.htm" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy">Lord of the Rings</a></i>, this is really closure for the X-Men series...This is the last stand for sure&quot;. In the same interview, a 20th Century Fox spokesperson confirmed <i>The Last Stand</i> is the final foreseeable installment for the X-Men team, but there are possibilites for <i>X-Men 4</i>. Brett Ratner has stated he would like to return for a sequel. <p>Executive producer <!--del_lnk--> Avi Arad stated in an interview that Marvel would take its time to decide what to do with future <i>X-Men</i> films, but is focusing on the spin-offs. A <!--del_lnk--> Wolverine spin-off and a <!--del_lnk--> Magneto spin-off have been announced and are in the scripting stages. Another possible movie based on the character of <!--del_lnk--> Emma Frost is also being developed. <i><!--del_lnk--> Three Kings</i> director <!--del_lnk--> David O. Russell was contacted about creating a story for the character. A possible film based on the students at the school has also been mentioned.<p>In an in early <!--del_lnk--> November 2006 interview, <!--del_lnk--> Bryan Singer, the director who started the franchise, confirmed that two more direct sequels are in development, and though he had been approached to direct one or both of the films, he would not be able to do so until after completing production on a sequel to <!--del_lnk--> Superman Returns.  Singer also confirmed production on the <!--del_lnk--> Wolverine spin-off, expressing interest in directing the film. Actor <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Jackman confirmed that Singer was also the first choice to direct, barring any major scheduling conflicts with the Superman sequel. <p><a id="Comparison_with_other_depictions" name="Comparison_with_other_depictions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Comparison with other depictions</span></h2>

      <p><i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> draws much of its plot and characters from the source comic books; however, while some of the X-Men characters and details remain similar, a number of comic book elements are altered for the adaptation.<p>The film&#39;s plot concerning the emergence of the Phoenix draws from Chris Claremont&#39;s 1980 &quot;Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; in <i>The Uncanny X-Men</i>. In both the film and Claremont&#39;s original story, the Phoenix is Jean Grey&#39;s evil &quot;split personality&quot;, a being of unrestrained emotion which Jean eventually allows herself to be killed to stop. The comic story was later <!--del_lnk--> retconned, however, recasting the Phoenix as a fiery, <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix-like alien entity and force of nature that bonds with Jean. However, the focus on Wolverine and Magneto means the story is more similiar to the 2003 <!--del_lnk--> Planet X story.<p>The &quot;cure&quot; for mutant powers, its creator <!--del_lnk--> Kavita Rao and the ethical problems associated with it appear in comic book form in Joss Whedon&#39;s 2004 &quot;Gifted&quot; story arc in <i>Astonishing X-Men</i>. A 1993 episode of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>X-Men</i> animated series entitled &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Cure&quot;, written by Mark Edward Edens, features a similar story, which resembles that of the movie more closely than &quot;Gifted&quot; in some respects, particularly regarding its use of Rogue and Warren Worthington. In the 2005 &quot;Decimation&quot; X-Men storyline, a vast majority of the mutants, including Magneto, lose their powers, the result of <!--del_lnk--> Scarlet Witch&#39;s actions, but that storyline was being published while the movie was being shot. Since the X-Men first appeared, there have been many stories dealing with mutant cures of various types, as Joss Whedon himself acknowledged in a published discussion with Mark Millar.<p><i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> is the first X-Men adaptation to feature the five original X-Men -- Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, Angel and Jean Grey; however, the characters&#39; backstories and positions within the team are altered. The mutants <!--del_lnk--> Siryn, <!--del_lnk--> Jubilee and the <!--del_lnk--> Stepford Cuckoos have cameo roles in the film and are correctly portrayed as students at the school. Other characters are translated more loosely. For instance, many of the Brotherhood shown in the film, including <!--del_lnk--> Spike, <!--del_lnk--> Phat, <!--del_lnk--> Psylocke and Multiple Man, are not villains in the comics. The mutant <!--del_lnk--> Arclight is depicted more faithfully as a super villain, but her power to create shockwaves is more focused. The filmmakers chose to use the name <!--del_lnk--> Kid Omega for a mutant similar to the comics&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Quill. <!--del_lnk--> Psylocke has a red dagger tattooed above her left eye, and she is able to hide in shadows; this is a reference to a period during which Psylocke was connected to a substance called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Crimson Dawn&quot;, which gives her powers beyond her innate <!--del_lnk--> mutant abilities of <!--del_lnk--> telepathy and <!--del_lnk--> telekinesis that manifests as a <!--del_lnk--> psionic <!--del_lnk--> knife / <a href="../../wp/k/Katana.htm" title="Katana">katana</a>. Brotherhood member Callisto is depicted with superhuman speed and the ability to sense mutants&#39; power levels. In the comics, Callisto is the leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Morlocks and has neither ability, instead possessing acute senses. Her ability to sense other mutants&#39; powers was based on the comic book character <!--del_lnk--> Caliban. In the comics, Juggernaut is Xavier&#39;s human step-brother who acquires power when he finds a <!--del_lnk--> mystical stone; in <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i>, however, Juggernaut is a mutant, and there is no mention of a relationship with the professor. Whereas he is usually gruff and violent in the comics, his line &quot;Don&#39;t you know who I am? I&#39;m the Juggernaut, bitch!&quot; alludes not to the comics, but to a parody video (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Juggernaut Bitch!!</i>) in which the video&#39;s creators dubbed over footage from the <!--del_lnk--> <i>X-Men</i> animated series.<p>Familiar details from the X-Men mythos permeate the film. The X-Men are shown training in the trademark <!--del_lnk--> Danger Room, a training complex within the <!--del_lnk--> X-Mansion. A giant, mutant-hunting <!--del_lnk--> Sentinel robot appears as a hologram inside the Danger Room. The <!--del_lnk--> fastball special, in which Colossus throws Wolverine toward an opponent, appears in the film twice, the targets being Magneto and a Sentinel. Beast&#39;s line &quot;Oh my stars and garters!&quot; appears frequently in the comics. One of the president&#39;s advisers is named Trask, an allusion to <!--del_lnk--> Bolivar Trask, creator of the Sentinels. Iceman transforms his body into ice, just as he does in the comic books. Kitty Pryde&#39;s run through the pharmaceutical complex while being chased by the Juggernaut mirrors the character&#39;s similar flight from an alien in <i>Uncanny X-Men</i> #143. Finally, Wolverine&#39;s killing Jean Grey bears some similarity to his killing love interest <!--del_lnk--> Mariko Yashida to spare her a painful death from poison in <i>Wolverine</i> #57, as well as a scene in the <i>New X-Men</i> story arc &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Planet X&quot; in which he kills Jean to spare her from a more painful death burning up in the Sun.<p>During the post-credits scene, the mind of Professor X is shown to be inhabiting the body of a formerly <!--del_lnk--> brain dead patient under the care of Moira MacTaggert. On the DVD commentary it is explained that this patient is in fact Charles Xavier&#39;s twin brother, whose mind was erased by his brother&#39;s considerable psychic powers when they were still in the womb together. In the comics Professor X never had a twin brother and this story arc never happened. However, according to the film&#39;s creators, there is at least some precedent for the idea since Professor X in the comics had a twin sister, Cassandra Nova.<p><a id="Adaptations" name="Adaptations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Adaptations</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Novelization" name="Novelization"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Novelization</span></h3>
      <p>The novelization of the film, written by comic book writer Chris Claremont, was released on <!--del_lnk--> May 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p>The novelization of the movie differs significantly from the film. In the novel, young Jean Grey discovers her powers after an accident that takes her best friend&#39;s life. Angel officially joins the X-Men and travels with them to Alcatraz Island instead of going on his own. Storm spares Callisto&#39;s life, which is more in line with Professor Xavier&#39;s views on violence. Rogue decides to keep her powers in the end, and Beast stays at the school as a teacher. Iceman takes an unconscious Pyro away from Alcatraz. The attack on Alcatraz is referred to as M-Day, a reference to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Decimation of mutantkind&quot; storyline in the comic books. Moira MacTaggert visits Magneto in the park, presumably offering an antidote to the &quot;cure&quot;, which he refuses because as the book says: &quot;He couldn&#39;t go back. That path had brought nothing but grief, to those he cared for, those who trusted him, to himself. This was better.&quot; This suggests that in the novel Magneto turns over a new leaf before discovering a slight return of his powers. Unlike the film, the novel does not allude to Xavier&#39;s resurrection. In the end of the novel Wolverine is in the basement of the Institute training the new X-Men, which includes <!--del_lnk--> Gambit, <!--del_lnk--> Sage, <!--del_lnk--> Danielle Moonstar and <!--del_lnk--> Cannonball.<p>The novel also makes a reference to X3 scriptwriter Zak Penn, whose name is given to a sergeant in the middle of the novel, and possibly to X-Men writer Stan Lee as Mr. Lee, one of Jean&#39;s neighbours portrayed by Stan Lee in the film. The president&#39;s name in the novelization is David Cockrum, a reference to comics writer Dave Cockrum. McCoy asks the president about his wife Paty, who in real life is David Cockrum&#39;s wife who used to work at Marvel. Two other references are made towards the end of the book, the first is Hollywood planning a film about the Battle of Alcatraz (a possible reference to the actual movie) along with a British Shakespearean actor, who is also a Knight playing Magneto (a possible reference to Sir Ian McKellen who played Magneto in all three films).<div class="notice metadata spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>

      <p><i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> was released in the United States and Canada on DVD in both standard and collector&#39;s edition formats on <!--del_lnk--> October 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The single-disc standard DVD, in either widescreen or fullscreen, features two menu settings: &quot;Join The Brotherhood&quot; and &quot;Take A Stand&quot;. The choice of either simply changes the menu&#39;s design, it doesn&#39;t alter the movie content. The DVD also features commentaries featuring the director, writers, and producers; 10 deleted scenes; three alternate endings; and two easter eggs. On the first day of its release errors were reported with the DVD. About 60% of the DVD currently have errors in them. Some DVD&#39;s come with only 10 deleted scenes while others come with 21, amongst other errors.<p>The &quot;Stan Lee Collector&#39;s Edition&quot; DVD is a widescreen standard DVD that was packaged in a slipcase with a 100-page booklet featuring a completely new <i>X-Men</i> comic by Stan Lee. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Hollywood Reporter</i> announced that 20th Century Fox will make films available to buy online the same day as the DVD, through <!--del_lnk--> Direct2Drive, with <i>X-Men: The Last Stand</i> among the first such available. Also, <!--del_lnk--> Wal-Mart stores included a special exclusive DVD titled &quot;X-Men Revealed&quot; with 50 minutes of behind-the-scenes look at the evolution of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> X-Men&quot; franchise. The Wal-Mart exclusive DVD disc is not what it seems however. From the information of the exclusive DVD front and back cover, it is supposed to be a behind-the-scenes look of the X-Men movie franchise but instead it is a brief history of the X-Men comics. Target also has an exclusive that comes in a tin case with the one disc dvd plus a reprint of X-men annual #1 and four collectible cards from the movie.<p>The DVD sold 5 million copies in its first week in stores. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, the DVD package has a bonus disc containing three documentaries (<i>Brett Ratner&#39;s Production Diary</i> (40 minutes), <i>X-Men: Evolution Of A Trilogy</i> (40 minutes), and <i>X-Men: The Excitement Continues</i> (20 minutes)) as well as various featurettes, character guides and pre-visualisation sequences.
