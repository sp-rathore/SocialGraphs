      <p><b>Quantum chemistry</b> is a branch of <!--del_lnk--> theoretical chemistry, which applies <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and <!--del_lnk--> quantum field theory to address issues and problems in <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. The description of the <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electronic</a> behaviour of <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> and <!--del_lnk--> molecules as pertaining to their <!--del_lnk--> reactivity is one of the applications of quantum chemistry. Quantum chemistry lies on the border between <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, and significant contributions have been made by scientists from both fields. It has a strong and active overlap with the field of <!--del_lnk--> atomic physics and <!--del_lnk--> molecular physics, as well as <!--del_lnk--> physical chemistry.<p>

      <p>The first step in solving a quantum chemical problem is usually solving the <a href="../../wp/s/Schr%25C3%25B6dinger_equation.htm" title="Schr&ouml;dinger equation">Schr&ouml;dinger equation</a> (or <!--del_lnk--> Dirac equation in <!--del_lnk--> relativistic quantum chemistry) with the <!--del_lnk--> electronic molecular Hamiltonian. This is called determining the <b>electronic structure</b> of the molecule. It can be said that the electronic structure of a molecule or crystal implies essentially its chemical properties.<p><a id="Wave_model" name="Wave_model"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Wave model</span></h3>
      <p>The foundation of quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry is the <b>wave model</b>, in which the atom is a small, dense, positively charged <!--del_lnk--> nucleus surrounded by electrons. Unlike the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Bohr model of the atom, however, the wave model describes electrons as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> clouds&quot; moving in <!--del_lnk--> orbitals, and their positions are represented by <!--del_lnk--> probability distributions rather than discrete points. The strength of this model lies in its <!--del_lnk--> predictive power. Specifically, it predicts the pattern of chemically similar elements found in the <!--del_lnk--> periodic table. The wave model is so named because electrons exhibit properties (such as interference) traditionally associated with waves. See <!--del_lnk--> wave-particle duality.<p><a id="Valence_bond" name="Valence_bond"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Valence bond</span></h3>

      <p>Although the mathematical basis of quantum chemistry had been laid by <!--del_lnk--> Schr&ouml;dinger in <!--del_lnk--> 1926, it is generally accepted that the first true calculation in quantum chemistry was that of the German physicists <!--del_lnk--> Walter Heitler and <!--del_lnk--> Fritz London on the hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) molecule in <!--del_lnk--> 1927. Heitler and London&#39;s method was extended by the American theoretical physicist <!--del_lnk--> John C. Slater and the American theoretical chemist <a href="../../wp/l/Linus_Pauling.htm" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> to become the <b>Valence-Bond (VB)</b> [or <b>Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP)</b>] method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists&#39; drawings of <!--del_lnk--> bonds.<p><a id="Molecular_orbital" name="Molecular_orbital"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Molecular orbital</span></h3>

      <p>An alternative approach was developed in <!--del_lnk--> 1929 by <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Hund and <!--del_lnk--> Robert S. Mulliken, in which <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electrons</a> are described by mathematical functions delocalized over an entire <!--del_lnk--> molecule. The <b>Hund-Mulliken</b> approach or <b>molecular orbital (MO) method</b> is less intuitive to chemists, but has turned out capable of predicting <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic properties better than the VB method. This approach is the conceptional basis of the <b><!--del_lnk--> Hartree-Fock method</b> and further <!--del_lnk--> post Hartree-Fock methods.<p><a id="Density_functional_theory" name="Density_functional_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Density functional theory</span></h3>

      <p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Thomas-Fermi model</b> was developed independently by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas and <!--del_lnk--> Fermi in <!--del_lnk--> 1927. This was the first attempt to describe many-electron systems on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> electronic density instead of <!--del_lnk--> wave functions, although it was not very successful in the treatment of entire molecules. The method did provide the basis for what is now known as <b>density functional theory</b>. Though this method is less developed than post Hartree-Fock methods, its lower computational requirements allow it to tackle larger <!--del_lnk--> polyatomic molecules and even <!--del_lnk--> macromolecules, which has made it the most used method in <a href="../../wp/c/Computational_chemistry.htm" title="Computational chemistry">computational chemistry</a> at present.<p><a id="Chemical_dynamics" name="Chemical_dynamics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical dynamics</span></h2>
      <p>A further step can consist of solving the <a href="../../wp/s/Schr%25C3%25B6dinger_equation.htm" title="Schr&ouml;dinger equation">Schr&ouml;dinger equation</a> with the total <!--del_lnk--> molecular Hamiltonian in order to study the motion of molecules. Direct solution of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation is called <i>quantum molecular dynamics</i>, within the <!--del_lnk--> semiclassical approximation <i>semiclassical molecular dynamics</i>, and within the <!--del_lnk--> classical mechanics framework <i><!--del_lnk--> molecular dynamics (MD)</i>. Statistical approaches, using for example <!--del_lnk--> Monte Carlo methods, are also possible.<p><a id="Adiabatic_chemical_dynamics" name="Adiabatic_chemical_dynamics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Adiabatic chemical dynamics</span></h3>

      <p>In <b>adiabatic dynamics</b>, interatomic interactions are represented by single <!--del_lnk--> scalar <!--del_lnk--> potentials called <!--del_lnk--> potential energy surfaces. This is the <!--del_lnk--> Born-Oppenheimer approximation introduced by <!--del_lnk--> Born and <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Oppenheimer.htm" title="Robert Oppenheimer">Oppenheimer</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1927. Pioneering applications of this in chemistry were performed by <!--del_lnk--> Rice and <!--del_lnk--> Ramsperger in 1927 and <!--del_lnk--> Kassel in <!--del_lnk--> 1928, and generalized into the <!--del_lnk--> RRKM theory in <!--del_lnk--> 1952 by <!--del_lnk--> Marcus who took the <!--del_lnk--> transition state theory developed by <!--del_lnk--> Eyring in <!--del_lnk--> 1935 into account. These methods enable simple estimates of unimolecular <!--del_lnk--> reaction rates from a few characteristics of the potential surface.<p><a id="Non-adiabatic_chemical_dynamics" name="Non-adiabatic_chemical_dynamics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Non-adiabatic chemical dynamics</span></h3>

      <p><b>Non-adiabatic dynamics</b> consists of taking the interaction between several coupled potential energy surface (corresponding to different electronic <!--del_lnk--> quantum states of the molecule). The coupling terms are called <b>vibronic couplings</b>. The pioneering work in this field was done by <!--del_lnk--> Stueckelberg, <!--del_lnk--> Landau, and <!--del_lnk--> Zener in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s, in their work on what is now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Landau-Zener transition. Their formula allows the transition probability between two <!--del_lnk--> diabatic potential curves in the neighbourhood of an <!--del_lnk--> avoided crossing to be calculated.<p><a id="Quantum_chemistry_and_quantum_field_theory" name="Quantum_chemistry_and_quantum_field_theory"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Quantum chemistry and quantum field theory</span></h2>
      <p>The application of <!--del_lnk--> quantum field theory (QFT) to chemical systems and theories has become increasingly common in the modern physical sciences. One of the first and most fundamentally explicit appearances of this is seen in the theory of the <!--del_lnk--> photomagneton. In this system, <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasmas</a>, which are ubiquitous in both physics and chemistry, are studied in order to determine the basic <!--del_lnk--> quantization of the underlying <!--del_lnk--> bosonic field. However, quantum field theory is of interest in many fields of chemistry, including: <!--del_lnk--> nuclear chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> astrochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> sonochemistry, and <!--del_lnk--> quantum hydrodynamics. Field theoretic methods have also been critical in developing the ab initio Effective Hamiltonian theory of semi-empirical pi-electron methods.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry&quot;</div>
