      <p><b>Quito</b> (official name: <b>San Francisco de Quito</b>) is the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> city of <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> in northwestern <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. It is located in northern Ecuador (see <!--del_lnk--> NG MapMachine satellite map) in the <!--del_lnk--> Guayllabamba <!--del_lnk--> river basin on the eastern slopes of the <!--del_lnk--> Pichincha <!--del_lnk-->  ( 15,728&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft; 4,794 m), an active <!--del_lnk--> stratovolcano in the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> mountains. The city&#39;s elevation is 9,300 <!--del_lnk--> ft (2,850&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m) above sea level (measured at the <i>Plaza de la Independencia</i>), making Quito the second highest capital city in the world. The city&#39;s population according to the most recent census (<!--del_lnk--> 2001) was 1,399,378. In 2005, however, the estimated population was 1,865,541 (canton). The area of Quito is approximately 112 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (290&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;).<p>There is some confusion about Quito&#39;s position as the second highest (elevation) capital in the world, but <!--del_lnk--> La Paz, <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, which is where the Bolivian government functions, is the governmental capital of Bolivia. <a href="../../wp/s/Sucre.htm" title="Sucre">Sucre</a> is the legal capital of Bolivia.<p>Quito is located about 15 <!--del_lnk--> miles (25&nbsp;km) south of the equator. A monument marking the equator is known locally as <!--del_lnk--> la mitad del mundo (the middle of the world).<p>Due to its altitude and location, the climate in Quito is mild to cool, fairly constant all year round, with a high temperature typically around 67 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Fahrenheit (20&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) on any given day, and a low around 49 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Fahrenheit (10&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) at night. The city experiences only two seasons: summer (the dry season) and winter (the rainy season).<p>Quito is the second most populous city in <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> after <!--del_lnk--> Guayaquil.<p>

      <p><a id="Pre-Hispanic" name="Pre-Hispanic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-Hispanic</span></h3>
      <p>Quito&#39;s origins date back to the first millennium, when <!--del_lnk--> nomadic tribes roamed the area and ultimately formed a commercial centre where Quito is currently located. Early in the 16th century, the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Incas</a> conquered the city, hoping to further the reach of their kingdom, but upon the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1533, those plans were abandoned. <!--del_lnk--> Rumi&ntilde;ahui, an Inca war general, burned the city to prevent the Spanish from taking it, thereby destroying any traces of the prehispanic city.<p><a id="Colony" name="Colony"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colony</span></h3>
      <p>Indigenous resistance to the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish conquest continued during <!--del_lnk--> 1534, with <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro founding San Francisco de Quito on <!--del_lnk--> August 15 of that year. On <!--del_lnk--> December 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1534 <!--del_lnk--> , the city was officially founded by 204 settlers and <!--del_lnk--> Sebasti&aacute;n de Benalc&aacute;zar, who captured Rumi&ntilde;ahui and effectively ended organized resistance. Rumi&ntilde;ahui was then executed on <!--del_lnk--> January 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1535. On <!--del_lnk--> March 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1541, Quito was named a city, and on <!--del_lnk--> February 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1556, was given the title &quot;Muy Noble y Muy Leal ciudad de San Francisco de Quito&quot; (&quot;Very Noble and Loyal City of San Francisco of Quito&quot;).<p>The Spanish promptly established the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic religion in Quito, with the first temple (El Bel&eacute;n) built even before the city had been officially founded. On January of 1535, the San Francisco Convent was constructed, the first of about 20 more churches and convents built during the colonial period. The Spanish heavily evangelized the indigenous people and also used them as free labor for construction, especially in the initial stages. The Diocese of Quito was established in <!--del_lnk--> 1545 and was elevated to the Archdiocese of Quito in <!--del_lnk--> 1849.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1809, after nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, and on <!--del_lnk--> August 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1809, it was there where the first proclamation of independence was heard. The movement was ultimately defeated on <!--del_lnk--> August 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1810, when Spanish forces came from <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and killed the leaders of the uprising and about 200 inhabitants of the city. A chain of conflicts concluded on <!--del_lnk--> May 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1822 when <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Jos&eacute; de Sucre, under the command of <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a>, led troops into the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Pichincha. Their victory marked the independence of Quito and the surrounding areas.<p><a id="Gran_Colombia" name="Gran_Colombia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gran Colombia</span></h3>
      <p>Just days after the Battle of Pichincha, on <!--del_lnk--> May 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1822, the leaders of the city proclaimed their independence and allowed the city to be annexed to the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Gran Colombia. Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var went to Quito on <!--del_lnk--> June 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1822, and was present at the signing of the Colombian Constitution on <!--del_lnk--> June 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1822.<p><a id="Capital_of_Ecuador" name="Capital_of_Ecuador"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capital of Ecuador</span></h3>
      <p>This lasted until <!--del_lnk--> May 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1830, when Gran Colombia dissolved and the nation took the name <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Ecuador, becoming an independent nation. Quito was named the country&#39;s capital for being the original home of numerous prehispanic cultures, for its role in the independence of Ecuador, and because it was an important administrative seat.<p>Quito has been the scenario for demonstrations and political violence since the early years of the republic. In 1833, members of the Society of Free Inhabitants of Quito were assassinated by the government after they conspired against it, and on <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1845, the <!--del_lnk--> Marcist Revolution began. Later, in 1875, the country&#39;s president, <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Moreno, was assassinated in Quito. Two years later, in 1877, archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Ignacio Checa y Barba was killed by poisoning.<p>In 1882, insurgents arose against the regime of dictator <!--del_lnk--> Ignacio de Veintemilla. Their victory did not end the violence that was occurring throughout the country. On <!--del_lnk--> July 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1883, the liberal commander <!--del_lnk--> Eloy Alfaro participated in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Guayaquil, and later, after more conflict, became the president of Ecuador on <!--del_lnk--> September 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1895. Upon completing his second term in 1911, he moved to <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, but upon his return to Ecuador in 1912 and attempted return to power, he was arrested on <!--del_lnk--> January 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1912, thrown in prison, and assassinated by a mob that had stormed the prison. His body was dragged through the streets of Quito to a city park, where it was burned.<p>In 1932, the <!--del_lnk--> Four Days&#39; War broke out, a civil war that followed the election of <!--del_lnk--> Neptal&iacute; Bonifaz and the subsequent realization that he carried a Peruvian passport. Workers at a major textile factory went on strike in <!--del_lnk--> 1934, and similar unrest continues to the present day. On <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, a realistic broadcast of <!--del_lnk--> H. G. Wells&#39; novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The War of the Worlds</i> led to citywide panic and the deaths of six people who died in fires set by mobs <!--del_lnk--> .<p>In recent years, Quito has been the focal point of large demonstrations that led to the ousting of presidents <!--del_lnk--> Abdal&aacute; Bucaram (<!--del_lnk--> February 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1997), <!--del_lnk--> Jamil Mahuad (<!--del_lnk--> January 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2000) and <!--del_lnk--> Lucio Guti&eacute;rrez (<!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2005).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Quito is located in the northern <!--del_lnk--> sierra of <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Guayllabamba river basin. The eastern part of the basin is sorrounded by a number of volcanoes: <a href="../../wp/c/Cotopaxi.htm" title="Cotopaxi">Cotopaxi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Antisana, Sincholagua and <!--del_lnk--> Cayambe (volcano) to the east; Illiniza, Atacazo, <!--del_lnk--> Pichincha and Pululagua to the west.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Guagua Pichincha, located only 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) west of Quito, presents some ongoing volcanic activity and it undergoes constant monitoring. Its last major eruptive activity was recorded on October 5 and October 7, 1999, when a large amount of ash deposited on the city caused significant disruption, including closing of the international airport. The worst event occurred in 1660 when over 10 <!--del_lnk--> inches (25&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> cm) of ash covered the city. Quito is the only capital in the world to be directly menaced by an active volcano. Activity in other nearby volcanoes can also affect the city; in November 2002, after an eruption in the volcano <!--del_lnk--> Reventador, the city was showered with ash (more than in 1999) for a few days. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The region is also vulnerable to <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>. The worst known earthquake to have hit Quito occurred in 1797 and killed around 40,000 people. The most recent major seismic event, with a magnitude of 7 on the Richter scale, occurred on 1987 with an epicenter about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) from the city, and it killed an estimated 1,000 in Ecuador. Quito buildings suffered minor damage.<p>
       <br /> On October 16, 2006, the city felt a quake measuring 4.1 on the Richter scale. No major damage was reported.<p>A list of main volcanoes, natural parks and natural attractions near Quito are listed here:<ul>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> El Panecillo is a hill located in the middle of the city with an altitude of about 9,895 feet (3,016 m) above sea level. The monument to Virgin Mary located on top of El Panecillo is visible from most of the city of Quito. This monument is based on a sculpture made by <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de Legarda in the Spanish Colony time known as &#39;La Virgen de Quito&#39;.<p>In 1976, the Spanish artist Agust&iacute;n de la Herr&aacute;n Matorras was commissioned by the religious order of the <!--del_lnk--> Oblates to build a 134&frac12;&nbsp;foot (41&nbsp;m)-tall aluminium monument of a <!--del_lnk--> madonna which was assembled on a high pedestal on the top of Panecillo. It is made of seven thousand pieces of aluminium. The monument was inaugurated on March 28, 1976, by the 11th <!--del_lnk--> archbishop of Quito, <!--del_lnk--> Pablo Mu&ntilde;oz Vega.<p>The virgin stands on top of a globe and stepping on a snake, which of course is classic madonna <!--del_lnk--> iconography. What is not so traditional is that she has wings. The people of Quito proudly claim that she is the only one in the world with wings like an angel. The monument, was inspired on the famous &quot;Virgen de Quito&quot; (Quito&#39;s Madonna) also known as &quot;the dancer&quot; sculpted by <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo de Legarda in <!--del_lnk--> 1734, which now decorates the main altar at the Church of St. Francisco. This madonna represents a turning point of the Quito School of Art (one of the most renowned of the Americas) because it shows a virgin with great movement that is practically dancing as a contrast with the traditional static madonnas that were produced during the 18th century.<p><a id="Aerial_tramway_to_Cruz_Loma" name="Aerial_tramway_to_Cruz_Loma"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aerial tramway to Cruz Loma</span></h3>

      <p>Since July 2005, Quito has an <!--del_lnk--> aerial tramway, known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Telef&eacute;riqo,&quot; from the city centre to the hill known as Cruz Loma on the east side of the Pichincha volcano. The ride takes visitors to an altitude of about 12,000 feet (over 4,100 m) where they find a number of restaurants, coffee shops and stores of different kinds. The temperature there is many degrees cooler than in Quito itself. There are also trails for hiking.<p>Besides the aerial tramway to Cruz Loma, the <!--del_lnk--> Telef&eacute;riqo as a whole is a visitor centre that includes an amusement park (<!--del_lnk--> Vulqano Park), fine dining restaurants, Go Karts, Paint Ball, shopping malls, extensive food court, and other attractions.<ul>
