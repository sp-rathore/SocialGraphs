      <p><b>John Locke</b> (<!--del_lnk--> August 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1632 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> October 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1704) was an influential <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosopher">philosopher</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> epistemology, Locke has often been classified as a British <a href="../../wp/e/Empiricism.htm" title="Empiricism">Empiricist</a>, along with <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> and <!--del_lnk--> George Berkeley. He is equally important as a <!--del_lnk--> social contract theorist, as he developed an alternative to the <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Hobbes.htm" title="Thomas Hobbes">Hobbesian</a> <!--del_lnk--> state of nature and argued a government could only be <!--del_lnk--> legitimate if it received the <!--del_lnk--> consent of the governed through a <!--del_lnk--> social contract and protected the <!--del_lnk--> natural rights of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a>, <!--del_lnk--> liberty, and <!--del_lnk--> estate. If such consent was not given, argued Locke, citizens had a <!--del_lnk--> right of rebellion. Locke is one of the few major philosophers who became a minister of government.<p>Locke&#39;s ideas had an enormous influence on the development of <a href="../../wp/p/Political_philosophy.htm" title="Political philosophy">political philosophy</a>, and he is widely regarded as one of the most influential <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment thinkers and <!--del_lnk--> contributors to liberal theory. His writings, along with those of many <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, influenced the <!--del_lnk--> American revolutionaries as reflected in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of Independence.<p>

      <p>Locke&#39;s father, also named John Locke, was a country lawyer and clerk to the Justices of the Peace in <a href="../../wp/c/Chew_Magna.htm" title="Chew Magna">Chew Magna</a>, who had served as a captain of cavalry for the <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentarian forces during the early part of the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War. His mother, Agnes Keene, was a tanner&#39;s daughter who was reputed to be very beautiful. Both parents were Puritans.<p>Locke was born on <!--del_lnk--> August 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1632, in a small thatched cottage by the church in <!--del_lnk--> Wrington, <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, about twelve miles from <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>. He was <!--del_lnk--> baptised the same day. Soon after Locke&#39;s birth, the family moved to the <!--del_lnk--> market town of <!--del_lnk--> Pensford, about seven miles south of Bristol, where Locke grew up in a rural <!--del_lnk--> Tudor house in <!--del_lnk--> Belluton.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1647, Locke was sent to the prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Westminster School in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> under the sponsorship of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Popham, a <!--del_lnk--> member of Parliament and former commander of the younger Locke&#39;s father. After completing his studies there, he was admitted to <!--del_lnk--> Christ Church college at <!--del_lnk--> Oxford University. The dean of the college at the time was <!--del_lnk--> John Owen, vice-chancellor of the university. Although a capable student, Locke was irritated by the undergraduate curriculum of the time. He found reading modern philosophers, such as <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Ren&eacute; Descartes</a>, more interesting than the <!--del_lnk--> classical material taught at the university. Through his friend Richard Lower whom he knew from the Westminster School, Locke was introduced to medicine and the experimental philosophy being pursued at other universities and in the English <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society, of which he eventually became a member.<p>Locke was awarded a <!--del_lnk--> bachelor&#39;s degree in <!--del_lnk--> 1656 and a master&#39;s degree in <!--del_lnk--> 1658. He obtained a <!--del_lnk--> bachelor of medicine in <!--del_lnk--> 1674, having studied <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> extensively during his time at <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and worked with such noted scientists and thinkers as <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Willis, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Hooke and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Lower. In <!--del_lnk--> 1666, he met <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, who had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a <!--del_lnk--> liver infection. Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue.<p>Locke had been looking for a career and in <!--del_lnk--> 1667 moved into Shaftesbury&#39;s home at Exeter House in London, to serve as Lord Ashley&#39;s personal physician. In <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, Locke resumed his medical studies under the tutelage of <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Sydenham. Sydenham had a major impact on Locke&#39;s natural philosophical thinking &mdash; an impact that would become evident in the <i><!--del_lnk--> An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.</i><p>Locke&#39;s medical knowledge was soon put to the test, since Shaftesbury&#39;s liver <!--del_lnk--> infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo an operation (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.<p>It was in Shaftesbury&#39;s household, during <!--del_lnk--> 1671, that the meeting took place, described in the Epistle to the reader of the Essay, which was the genesis of what would later become Essay. Two extant Drafts still survive from this period. It was also during this time that Locke served as Secretary of the Board of Trade and Plantations and Secretary to the Lords and Proprietors of the Carolinas, helping to shape his ideas on international trade and economics.<p>Shaftesbury, as a founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Whig movement, exerted great influence on Locke&#39;s political ideas. Locke became involved in politics when Shaftesbury became <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chancellor in <!--del_lnk--> 1672. Following Shaftesbury&#39;s fall from favour in <!--del_lnk--> 1675, Locke spent some time travelling across <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. He returned to England in <!--del_lnk--> 1679 when Shaftesbury&#39;s political fortunes took a brief positive turn. It was around this time, most likely at Shaftesbury&#39;s prompting, that Locke composed the bulk of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Two Treatises on Government</i>. Locke wrote the Treatises to defend the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution of 1688">Glorious Revolution of 1688</a>, but also to counter the absolutist political philosophy of Sir Robert Filmer and Thomas Hobbes. Though Locke was associated with the influential Whigs, his ideas about natural rights and government are today considered quite revolutionary for that period in English history.<p>However, Locke fled to the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1683, under strong suspicion of involvement in the <!--del_lnk--> Rye House Plot (though there is little evidence to suggest that he was directly involved in the scheme). In the Netherlands Locke had time to return to his writing, spending a great deal of time re-working the Essay and composing the Letter on Toleration. Locke did not return home until after the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. Locke accompanied <a href="../../wp/w/William_III_of_England.htm" title="William III of England">William of Orange</a>&#39;s wife back to England in 1688. The bulk of Locke&#39;s publishing took place after his arrival back in England - the Essay, the Two Treatises and <!--del_lnk--> A Letter Concerning Toleration all appearing in quick succession upon his return from exile.<p>His close friend, Lady Masham invited Locke to join her at the Masham&#39;s country house in Essex. He spent his time there in variable health owing to <a href="../../wp/a/Asthma.htm" title="Asthma">asthma</a> attacks, nevertheless becoming an intellectual hero of the <!--del_lnk--> Whigs. During this period he discussed matters with such figures as <!--del_lnk--> John Dryden and <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>.<p>He died in <!--del_lnk--> 1704 after a prolonged decline in health, and is buried in the churchyard of the village of <!--del_lnk--> High Laver, east of <!--del_lnk--> Harlow in <!--del_lnk--> Essex, where he had lived in the household of <!--del_lnk--> Sir Francis Masham since <!--del_lnk--> 1691. Locke never married nor had any children.<p>Events that happened during Locke&#39;s lifetime include the <!--del_lnk--> English Restoration, the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague of London and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of London. He did not quite see the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union of <!--del_lnk--> 1707, though the thrones of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> were held by the same monarch throughout his lifetime. <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">Constitutional monarchy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary democracy were in their infancy during Locke&#39;s time.<p><a id="Influence" name="Influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Influence</span></h2>
      <p>Locke exercised a profound influence on subsequent philosophy and politics, in particular on <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>. He was a strong influence on <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, while his arguments concerning <!--del_lnk--> liberty and the <!--del_lnk--> social contract later influenced the written works of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_Hamilton.htm" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> James Madison, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, and other <!--del_lnk--> Founding Fathers of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.<p>Appraisals of Locke have often been tied to appraisals of <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a> in general, and also to appraisals of the United States. Detractors note that he was a major investor in the English slave-trade through the Royal Africa Company, as well as through his participation in drafting the <i>Fundamental Constitution of the Carolinas</i> while <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> secretary, which established a feudal aristocracy and gave a master absolute power over his slaves. Some see his statements on <!--del_lnk--> unenclosed <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> as having justified the displacement of the <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans. Because of his opposition to aristocracy and slavery in his major writings, he is accused of hypocrisy, or of caring only for the liberty of <!--del_lnk--> English <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalists</a>. Most American liberal scholars reject these criticisms, however, questioning the extent of his impact upon the <i>Fundamental Constitution</i> and his detractors&#39; interpretations of his work in general.<p><a id="Theory_of_property" name="Theory_of_property"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Theory of property</span></h3>
      <p>Locke uses the word property in both broad and narrow senses. In a broad sense, it covers a wide range of human interests and aspirations; more narrowly, it refers to material goods. He argues property is a natural right and it is derived from labour.<p><!--del_lnk--> Scholars believe that <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> later adapted Locke&#39;s theory on property in his philosophies. He also had an influence on the <!--del_lnk--> US Constitution in the <!--del_lnk--> Preamble. John Locke had the thought that all men had the natural rights of life, <!--del_lnk--> liberty, and <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> (the latter was replaced by &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; during negotiations of the drafting of the US <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.htm" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>, as a way to negate slaves&#39; right to property). He also developed the Lockeian <!--del_lnk--> social contract which included the state of nature, government with the consent of the governed and all the natural instincts.<p><a id="Political_theory" name="Political_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Political theory</span></h3>
      <p>Unlike <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Hobbes.htm" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, Locke believed that <!--del_lnk--> human nature is characterized by reason and tolerance. Like Hobbes, Locke believed that human nature allowed men to be selfish and lustful. This is apparent with the introduction of currency. In a natural state all people were equal and independent, and none had a right to harm another&rsquo;s &ldquo;life, health, liberty, or possessions.&rdquo; Locke never refers to Hobbes by name, however, and may instead have been responding to other writers of the day. Locke also advocated governmental <!--del_lnk--> checks and balances and believed that revolution is not only a right but an obligation in some circumstances. These ideas would come to have profound influence on the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of the United States and its <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence.htm" title="United States Declaration of Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>.<p><a id="The_Labour_theory_of_property" name="The_Labour_theory_of_property"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Labour theory of property</span></h4>
      <p>Locke believed that the natural right of [property] is created by the application of [labor] on it. According to his theory, humans make objects into property by applying labor. In this view, the labor involved provides the natural right of ownership if the object labored upon was formerly common property available to all. In addition, property precedes government and government cannot &quot;dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily.&quot;<p><a id="Limits_to_accumulation" name="Limits_to_accumulation"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Limits to accumulation</span></h4>
      <p>&bull; Labour creates property, but it also contains limits to its accumulation: man&rsquo;s capacity to produce and man&rsquo;s capacity to consume. These limits are considered to prevent goods from being spoiled, or wasted.<p>&bull; Goods of greater durability are introduced, those exposed to quick spoilage can be exchanged for something that lasts longer, for example: plums for nuts, nuts for a piece of metal&hellip;<p>&bull; The introduction of money marks the culmination of this process. Money makes possible the unlimited accumulation of property without causing waste through spoilage. He also includes gold or silver as money because they may be &ldquo;hoarded up without injury to anyone,&rdquo; since they do not spoil or decay in the hands of the possessor.<p>&bull; The introduction of money eliminates the limits of accumulation and inequality. Locke stresses that inequality has come about by tacit agreement on the use of money, not by the social contract establishing civil society or the law of land regulating property.<p>&bull; He is aware of a problem posed by unlimited accumulation but does not consider it his task. He just implies that government would function to moderate the conflict between the unlimited accumulation of property and a more nearly equal distribution of wealth and does not say which principles that government should apply to solve this problem.<p>&bull; However, not all elements of his thought form a consistent whole. For example, labour theory of value of the <!--del_lnk--> Two Treatises of Government stands side by side with the demand-and-supply theory developed in the <!--del_lnk--> Considerations. Moreover, Locke anchors property in labour but in the end upholds the unlimited accumulation of wealth.<p><a id="Locke_on_value_and_price_theory" name="Locke_on_value_and_price_theory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Locke on value and price theory</span></h3>
      <p>&bull; Locke&rsquo;s general theory of value and price is a supply and demand theory.<p>&bull; Supply is quantity and demand is rent.<p>&bull; &ldquo;The price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers.&rdquo; and &ldquo;that which regulates the price... [of goods] is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent.&rdquo;<p>&bull; The quantity theory of money forms a special case of this general theory. His idea is based on &ldquo;money answers all things&rdquo; (Ecclesiastes) or &ldquo;rent of money is always sufficient, or more than enough,&rdquo; and &ldquo;varies very little&hellip;&rdquo;<p>&bull; Regardless of whether the demand for money is unlimited or constant, Locke concludes that as far as money is concerned, the demand is exclusively regulated by its quantity.<p>&bull; He also investigates the determinants of demand and supply. For supply, goods in general are considered valuable because they can be exchanged, consumed and they must be scarce. For demand, goods are in demand because they yield a flow of income.<p>&bull; Locke develops an early theory of capitalization, such as land, which has value because &ldquo;by its constant production of saleable commodities it brings in a certain yearly income.&rdquo;<p>&bull; Demand for money is almost the same as demand for goods or land; it depends on whether money is wanted as medium of exchange or as loanable funds. For medium of exchange &ldquo;money is capable by exchange to procure us the necessaries or conveniences of life.&rdquo; For loanable funds, &ldquo;it comes to be of the same nature with land by yielding a certain yearly income &hellip; or interest.&rdquo;<p><a id="Monetary_thoughts" name="Monetary_thoughts"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Monetary thoughts</span></h4>
      <p>Locke distinguishes two functions of <a href="../../wp/m/Money.htm" title="Money">money</a>, as a &quot;counter&quot; to measure value, and as a &quot;pledge&quot; to lay claim to <!--del_lnk--> goods. He believes that silver and gold, as opposed to paper money, are the appropriate currency for international transactions. Silver and gold, he says, are treated to have equal value by all of humanity and can thus be treated as a pledge by anyone, while the value of paper money is only valid under the government which issues it.<p>Locke argues that a country should seek a favorable <!--del_lnk--> balance of trade, lest it fall behind other countries and suffer a loss in its trade. Since the world money stock grows constantly, a country must constantly seek to enlarge its own stock.<p>He does not consider low prices a welcome stimulus to <!--del_lnk--> exports. If M is rising, P could only remain stable if T is to increase.<p>Locke develops his theory of foreign exchanges, in addition to commodity movements, there are also movements in country stock of money, and movements of capital determine exchange rates. The latter is less significant and less volatile than commodity movements. As for a country&rsquo;s money stock, if it is large relative to that of other countries, it will cause the country&rsquo;s exchange to rise above par, as an export balance would do.<p>He also prepares estimates of the cash requirements for different economic groups (landholders, labourers and brokers). In each group the cash requirements are closely related to the length of the pay period. He argues the brokers &ndash; middlemen &ndash; whose activities enlarge the monetary circuit and whose profits eat into the earnings of labourers and landholders.<p><a id="List_of_major_works" name="List_of_major_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">List of major works</span></h2>

       <p>&quot;Stop, Traveller! Near this place lieth John Locke. If you ask what kind of a man he was, he answers that he lived content with his own small fortune. Bred a scholar, he made his learning subservient only to the cause of truth. This thou will learn from his writings, which will show thee everything else concerning him, with greater truth, than the suspect praises of an epitaph. His virtues, indeed, if he had any, were too little for him to propose as matter of praise to himself, or as an example to thee. Let his vices be buried together. As to an example of manners, if you seek that, you have it in the Gospels; of vices, to wish you have one nowhere; if mortality, certainly, (and may it profit thee), thou hast one here and everywhere.&quot;</blockquote>
