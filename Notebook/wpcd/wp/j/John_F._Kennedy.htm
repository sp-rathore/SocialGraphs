He served from 1961 until <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy_assassination.htm" title="John F. Kennedy assassination">his assassination</a> in 1963. His leadership during the ramming of his USS <!--del_lnk--> PT-109 during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> led to being cited for bravery and heroism in the <!--del_lnk--> South Pacific. Kennedy represented <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts during 1947&ndash;1960, as both a member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a>. He was <!--del_lnk--> elected President in 1960 in one of the closest elections in American history. He is, to date, the only <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic to be elected President of the United States.<p>Major events during his presidency included the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Pigs invasion, the <!--del_lnk--> Cuban Missile Crisis, the building of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, the <a href="../../wp/s/Space_Race.htm" title="Space Race">Space Race</a>, early events of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> American Civil Rights Movement.<p>John F.

The <!--del_lnk--> Warren Commission concluded that <!--del_lnk--> Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing the president, although later the <!--del_lnk--> House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that a <!--del_lnk--> conspiracy may have been involved in the assassination <!--del_lnk--> , and the subject remains <!--del_lnk--> controversial. Kennedy&#39;s assassination is considered to be a defining moment in <!--del_lnk--> U.S. history due to its traumatic impact on the nation as well as on the political history of the ensuing decades, his subsequent branding as an icon for a new generation of Americans and American aspirations, and for the mystery and conspiracy allegations which surround it.<p>

      <p>Kennedy was born in <!--del_lnk--> Brookline, Massachusetts, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. and <!--del_lnk--> Rose Fitzgerald; Rose, in turn, was the eldest child of <!--del_lnk--> John &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, a prominent figure in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a> politics who was the city&#39;s mayor and a three-term member of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Congress.htm" title="United States Congress">Congress</a>.<p>Kennedy attended <!--del_lnk--> Edward Devotion School for four years (<!--del_lnk--> kindergarten in 1922 to third grade), <!--del_lnk--> Riverdale Country School in the Bronx, the <!--del_lnk--> Dexter School in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a>, a year at <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury School, and then <!--del_lnk--> The Choate School in <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford, Connecticut, one of the country&#39;s most elite private boarding schools for boys, from which he graduated in 1935. On <!--del_lnk--> September 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1935, he sailed to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> with his parents and his sister <!--del_lnk--> Kathleen. There he enrolled at the <!--del_lnk--> London School of Economics with the intention of studying <a href="../../wp/p/Political_economy.htm" title="Political economy">political economy</a> for a year under the tutelage of Professor <!--del_lnk--> Harold Laski, but an illness hospitalized him shortly after his enrollment. His father insisted he return to the US. Later during the autumn of 1935, he enrolled in <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, but was forced to leave after developing <!--del_lnk--> jaundice. The next autumn, he began attending <!--del_lnk--> Harvard College, where he resided in <!--del_lnk--> Winthrop House. Kennedy traveled to Europe twice during his Harvard years, visiting Britain, where his father was serving as ambassador to the <!--del_lnk--> Court of St. James. In 1937, Kennedy was prescribed <!--del_lnk--> steroids to control his <!--del_lnk--> colitis, which only increased his medical problems, causing him to develop <!--del_lnk--> osteoporosis of the lower <!--del_lnk--> lumbar spine <!--del_lnk--> . After graduating from Harvard, he attended <!--del_lnk--> Stanford University&rsquo;s business school for a few months and then traveled to <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>.<p>In 1940, Kennedy wrote his honours thesis, entitled &quot;Appeasement in Munich&quot; about the British dealings concerning the <!--del_lnk--> Munich Agreement. He initially intended for his thesis to be only for college use, but his father encouraged him to publish it in a book. He graduated <i><!--del_lnk--> cum laude</i> from Harvard with a degree in <!--del_lnk--> international affairs in June 1940. His thesis was published in 1940 as a book entitled, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Why England Slept,&quot; and became a <!--del_lnk--> bestseller. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Years later, it was revealed that, as a young man, Kennedy had been diagnosed with <!--del_lnk--> Addison&#39;s disease, a rare endocrine disorder. This and other medical disorders were kept from the press and public throughout Kennedy&#39;s lifetime.<p><a id="Military_service" name="Military_service"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Military service</span></h3>

      <p>In the spring of 1941, Kennedy volunteered for the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army but was rejected, mainly because of his troublesome back. Nevertheless, in September of that year, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Navy accepted him, due to the influence of the director of the <!--del_lnk--> Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), a former naval <!--del_lnk--> attach&eacute; to Ambassador Joseph Kennedy. As an <!--del_lnk--> ensign, he served in the office which supplied bulletins and briefing information for the <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of the Navy. It was during this assignment that the <a href="../../wp/a/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor.htm" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbour</a> occurred. He attended the Naval Reserve Officers Training School and Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Training Centre before being assigned for duty in <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> and eventually the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific theatre. He participated in various commands in the Pacific theatre and earned the rank of <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant, commanding a <!--del_lnk--> patrol torpedo (PT) boat.<!--del_lnk--> <div class="thumb tright">

Kennedy was thrown across the deck, injuring his already-troubled back. Still, Kennedy towed a wounded man three miles (5 km) in the ocean, arriving at an island where his crew was subsequently rescued. Kennedy said that he blacked out for periods of time during the life-threatening ordeal. For these actions, Kennedy received the <!--del_lnk--> Navy and Marine Corps Medal under the following citation:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Kennedy&#39;s other decorations in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> included the <!--del_lnk--> Purple Heart, <!--del_lnk--> Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the <!--del_lnk--> World War II Victory Medal. He was honorably discharged in early 1945, just a few months before <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> surrendered. The incident was popularized when he became president, and would be the subject of several magazine articles, books, comic books, TV specials and a feature length movie, making the <i>PT-109</i> one of the most famous U.S. Navy ships of the war. Scale models and even <!--del_lnk--> G.I. Joe figures based on the incident were still being produced in the 2000s. The coconut which was used to scrawl a rescue message given to <!--del_lnk--> Solomon Islander scouts who found him was kept on his presidential desk and is still at the John F. Kennedy library.<p>In May 2002, a <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic expedition found what is believed to be the wreckage of the <i>PT-109</i> in the Solomon Islands. One of the Kennedy family also returned to the islands to give a gift to the scouts who are still alive today, but were turned away when they traveled to the inauguration because of communication problems. The Australian <!--del_lnk--> coastwatcher who dispatched the natives was also invited to the White House.<p><a id="Early_political_career" name="Early_political_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early political career</span></h3>
      <p>After World War II, John thought about being a journalist for a while before he decided to run for political office. Prior to the war, he hadn&#39;t really thought about being a politician primarily because his older brother, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. had been tabbed by the family as the future politician, and hopefully, the future President. Tragically, Joe was killed in World War II, making Jack next in line to fulfill his father&#39;s political ambitions. In 1946, Representative <!--del_lnk--> James Michael Curley vacated his seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district to become mayor of <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, and Kennedy ran for that seat, beating his Republican opponent by a large margin. He was a congressman for six years but had a mixed voting record, often diverging from President <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_S._Truman.htm" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> and the rest of the Democratic Party. In 1952, he defeated incumbent Republican <!--del_lnk--> Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. for the U.S. Senate. Kennedy married <!--del_lnk--> Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1953. He underwent several spinal operations in the two following years, nearly dying (receiving the Catholic faith&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> &quot;last rites&quot; four times during his life), and was often absent from the Senate. During this period, he published <i><!--del_lnk--> Profiles in Courage</i>, highlighting eight instances in which U.S. Senators risked their careers by standing by their personal beliefs. The book was awarded the 1957 <!--del_lnk--> Pulitzer Prize for Biography.<p>John F. Kennedy voted for final passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act of 1957, after having earlier voted for the &quot;Jury Trial Amendment&quot;, which effectively rendered the Act toothless, because convictions for violations could not be obtained. Staunch <!--del_lnk--> segregationists such as <!--del_lnk--> James Eastland, <!--del_lnk--> John McClellan, and <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi Governor <!--del_lnk--> James Coleman were early supporters in Kennedy&#39;s presidential campaign. [T. Reeves, &quot;A Question of Character&#39;, p. 140]<p>Sen. <!--del_lnk--> Joseph McCarthy was a friend of the Kennedy family; <!--del_lnk--> Robert F. Kennedy worked on the staff of McCarthy&#39;s committee, and McCarthy dated <!--del_lnk--> Patricia Kennedy. In 1954, when the Senate was poised to condemn McCarthy, John Kennedy had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy but he never delivered it. When the Senate rendered its highly publicized decision to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in hospital and never indicated then or later how he would have voted. The episode seriously hurt Kennedy in the liberal community, especially with <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Roosevelt, as late as the 1960 election.

      <p>In 1960, Kennedy declared his intent to run for President of the United States. In the Democratic <!--del_lnk--> primary election, he faced challenges from Senator <!--del_lnk--> Hubert H. Humphrey of <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, Senator <a href="../../wp/l/Lyndon_B._Johnson.htm" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Texas, and <!--del_lnk--> Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956, who was not officially running but was a favorite <!--del_lnk--> write-in candidate. Kennedy won key primaries like <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin and <a href="../../wp/w/West_Virginia.htm" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>. In the latter state, Kennedy made a visit to a <!--del_lnk--> coal mine, and talked to the mine workers to win their support; most people in that <!--del_lnk--> conservative, mostly <!--del_lnk--> Protestant state were deeply suspicious about Kennedy being a Catholic. Kennedy emerged as a universally acceptable candidate for the party after that victory. On <!--del_lnk--> July 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1960, the Democratic Party nominated Kennedy as its candidate for President. Kennedy asked Johnson to be his Vice-Presidential candidate, despite clashes between the two during the primary elections. He needed Johnson&#39;s strength in the <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_United_States.htm" title="Southern United States">South</a> to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since <!--del_lnk--> 1916. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy&#39;s Catholicism, <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and whether both the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U.S. To allay fears that his Catholicism would impact his decision-making, he said in a famous speech in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a> (to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association), on <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1960, &quot;I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party&#39;s candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters&mdash;and the Church does not speak for me.&quot; <!--del_lnk-->  Kennedy also brought up the point of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic.<p>In September and October, Kennedy debated Republican candidate Vice President <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in the first televised <!--del_lnk--> U.S. presidential debates. During the debates, Nixon looked tense and uncomfortable, while Kennedy was composed, which led the television audience to deem Kennedy the winner, although radio listeners in general thought Nixon had won or the debate was a draw. <!--del_lnk-->  Nixon did not wear make-up during the debate unlike Kennedy. The debates are considered a political landmark: the point at which the medium of <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> played an important role in politics.<p><a id="Presidency" name="Presidency"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Presidency</span></h3>
      <p>John Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th <!--del_lnk--> President on <!--del_lnk--> January 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1961. In his <!--del_lnk--> inaugural address he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens. &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country&quot;, he said. He also asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the &quot;common enemies of man: <!--del_lnk--> tyranny, <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a>, <!--del_lnk--> disease, and <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a> itself.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Foreign_policies" name="Foreign_policies"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign policies</span></h4>

      <p>In hopes of overthrowing the leftist Castro regime, Kennedy and his young cabinet drew the Bay of Pigs operation. U.S. trained Cuban insurgents would invade Cuba and instigate the Cuban people in hopes of achieving their goal. On <!--del_lnk--> April 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1961, Kennedy gave orders allowing the previously planned invasion of Cuba to proceed. With support from the <!--del_lnk--> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in what is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Pigs Invasion, 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exiles, called &quot;Brigade 2506&quot;, returned to the island in the hope of deposing <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>. However, the CIA proceeded to allow the troops to go even though Kennedy did not authorize air support. By <!--del_lnk--> April 19, Castro&#39;s government had captured or killed most of the invading exiles and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After 20 months, <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> released the captured exiles in exchange for $53 million worth of food and medicine. The incident was a major embarrassment for Kennedy, but he took full personal responsibility for the debacle. Furthermore, the incidient made Castro wary of the U.S. and untrusting, leading him to believe that another invasion such as that one would occur. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Cuban_Missile_Crisis" name="Cuban_Missile_Crisis"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Cuban Missile Crisis</span></h5>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cuban Missile Crisis began on <!--del_lnk--> October 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1962, when American <!--del_lnk--> U-2 <!--del_lnk--> spy planes took photographs of a <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> intermediate-range ballistic missile site under construction in Cuba. America would soon be posed with a serious nuclear threat. Here Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites it might lead to <!--del_lnk--> nuclear war with the <!--del_lnk--> U.S.S.R. If the U.S. did nothing, it would endure the perpetual threat of nuclear weapons within its region&mdash;in such close proximity that if the weapons were launched pre-emptively, the U.S. may have been unable to retaliate. Another fear was that the U.S. would appear to the world as weak in its own hemisphere. Many military officials and cabinet members pressed for an air assault on the missile sites, but Kennedy ordered a naval <!--del_lnk--> blockade in which the U.S. Navy inspected all ships. He began negotiations with the Soviets. He ordered the Soviets to remove all &quot;defensive&quot; material that is being built off the Cuban island. Without doing so, the Soviet people would face a naval blockade, as well as Cuba. A week later, he and Soviet Premier <!--del_lnk--> Nikita Khrushchev reached an agreement. Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles while the U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and also secretly promised to remove U.S. ballistic missiles from <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> within six months. Following this incident, which brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since, Kennedy was more cautious in confronting the Soviet Union.<p><a id="Latin_America_and_Communism" name="Latin_America_and_Communism"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Latin America and Communism</span></h5>
      <p>Arguing that &quot;those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable,&quot; Kennedy sought to contain <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> by establishing the <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for Progress, which sent <!--del_lnk--> foreign aid to troubled countries in the region and sought greater <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> standards in the region. He worked closely with <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rican <!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Luis Mu&ntilde;oz Mar&iacute;n for the development of the Alliance of Progress, as well as developments on the autonomy of the Commonwealth of <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>.<p><a id="Peace_Corps" name="Peace_Corps"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Peace Corps</span></h5>
      <p>As one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy created the <!--del_lnk--> Peace Corps. Through this program, Americans volunteered to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, <!--del_lnk--> farming, <!--del_lnk--> health care and <!--del_lnk--> construction.<p><a id="Vietnam" name="Vietnam"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnam</span></h5>
      <p>Kennedy used limited military action to contain the spread of communism. Determined to stand firm against the spread of communism, Kennedy&#39;s policy included political, economic, and military support for the unstable <!--del_lnk--> South Vietnamese government, which included sending 18,000 military advisors and U.S. Special Forces to the area. Kennedy also agreed to the use of <!--del_lnk--> napalm, <!--del_lnk--> defoliants, <!--del_lnk--> free-fire zones and <!--del_lnk--> jet planes. U.S. involvement in the area continually escalated until regular U.S. forces were directly fighting the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> in the next administration. The Kennedy Administration increased military support, but it was not working. By July 1963 Kennedy faced a crisis in Vietnam. The Administration&#39;s response was to assist in the <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;&eacute;tat of the President of South Vietnam, <!--del_lnk--> Ngo Dinh Diem (LeFeber, &quot;America, Russia and the Cold War&quot;, p. 233). In 1963, South Vietnamese generals overthrew the Diem government, by assassinating Diem. Kennedy sanctioned Diem&#39;s overthrow. One reason for the support was a fear that Diem might negotiate a neutralist coalition government which included Communists, as had occurred in <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> in 1962. <!--del_lnk--> Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, remarked &quot;<i>This kind of neutralism...is tantamount to surrender</i>.&quot;<p>It remains a point of controversy among historians whether or not Vietnam would have escalated to the point it did had Kennedy served out his full term and possibly been re-elected in 1964.<p><a id="West_Berlin_Speech" name="West_Berlin_Speech"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">West Berlin Speech</span></h5>

      <p>Under simultaneous and opposing pressures from the Allies and the Soviets, Germany was divided. The Berlin Wall separated the West and East Berlin, the latter being in control of the Soviets. On <!--del_lnk--> June 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1963, Kennedy visited <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin and gave a public speech criticizing communism. Kennedy used the construction of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a> as an example of the failures of communism: &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Freedom has many difficulties and <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> is not perfect, but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in.&quot; The speech is known for its famous phrase <i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;</i>. Nearly 5/6th of the population were on the street when Kennedy said that famous phrase. He remarked to aides afterwards: &quot;We&#39;ll never have another day like this one.&quot; {(trueman,C.).

      <p>Troubled by the long-term dangers of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive contamination and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear weapons proliferation, Kennedy pushed for the adoption of a Limited or <!--del_lnk--> Partial Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but did not prohibit testing underground. The United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to the treaty. Kennedy signed the treaty into law in August 1963.<p><a id="Ireland" name="Ireland"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Ireland</span></h5>

      <p>On the occasion of his visit to <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> in 1963, President Kennedy joined with Irish President <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;amon de Valera to form The American Irish Foundation. The mission of this organization was to foster connections between Americans of Irish descent and the country of their ancestry. Kennedy furthered these connections of cultural solidarity by accepting a grant of <!--del_lnk--> armorial bearings from the <!--del_lnk--> Chief Herald of Ireland.<p>He also visited the original cottage where previous Kennedys had lived before emigrating to America, and said, &quot;This is where it all began....&quot;<p><a id="Domestic_policies" name="Domestic_policies"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Domestic policies</span></h4>
      <p>Kennedy called his domestic program the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> New Frontier&quot;. It ambitiously promised federal funding for <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, <!--del_lnk--> medical care for the elderly, and government intervention to halt the recession. Kennedy also promised an end to <!--del_lnk--> racial discrimination. In 1963, he proposed a <!--del_lnk--> tax reform which included income <!--del_lnk--> tax cuts, but this was not passed by Congress until 1964, after his death. Few of Kennedy&#39;s major programs passed Congress during his lifetime, although, under his successor Lyndon Johnson, Congress did vote them through in 1964-65.<p>As President Kennedy oversaw the last pre-Furman federal execution, and last, to date, military execution. In both cases he refused ask for commutation the death sentences (<!--del_lnk--> Iowa <!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Harold Hughes personally contacted Kennedy to request clemency for <!--del_lnk--> Victor Feguer who was sentenced to death under federal law in Iowa and executed on <!--del_lnk--> March 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1963).<p><a id="Civil_rights" name="Civil_rights"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">Civil rights</span></h5>

      <p>The turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of Kennedy&#39;s era. The <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1954 that <!--del_lnk--> racial segregation in public schools would no longer be permitted. However, many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court&#39;s injunction. Segregation on buses, in restaurants, movie theaters, bathrooms, and other public places remained. Kennedy supported <!--del_lnk--> racial integration and civil rights, and during the 1960 campaign he telephoned <!--del_lnk--> Coretta Scott King; wife of the jailed Reverend <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther_King%252C_Jr..htm" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, which perhaps drew some additional black support to his candidacy.<p>In 1962, <!--del_lnk--> James Meredith tried to enroll at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Mississippi, but he was prevented from doing so by white students. Kennedy responded by sending some 400 <!--del_lnk--> federal marshals and 3,000 troops to ensure that Meredith could enroll in his first class. Kennedy also assigned federal marshals to protect <!--del_lnk--> Freedom Riders.<p>As President, Kennedy initially believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress, which was dominated by Southern Democrats, and he distanced himself from it. As a result, many civil rights leaders viewed Kennedy as unsupportive of their efforts.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1963, President Kennedy intervened when <!--del_lnk--> Alabama Governor <!--del_lnk--> George Wallace blocked the doorway to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Alabama to stop two black students, <!--del_lnk--> Vivian Malone and <!--del_lnk--> James Hood, from enrolling. George Wallace moved aside after being confronted by federal marshals, Deputy Attorney General <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Katzenbach, and the Alabama <!--del_lnk--> National Guard. That evening Kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio. <!--del_lnk-->  Kennedy proposed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Space_program" name="Space_program"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Space program</span></h4>

      <p>Kennedy was eager for the United States to lead the way in the <!--del_lnk--> space race. Sergei Khrushchev says JFK approached his father, Nikita, twice about a &quot;joint venture&quot; in space exploration&mdash;in June 1961 and Autumn 1963. On the first occasion, Russia was far ahead of America in terms of space technology. JFK later made a speech at <!--del_lnk--> Rice University in September 1962, in which he said, &quot;No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space&quot; and, &quot;We choose to go to the <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">moon</a> in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.&quot;<!--del_lnk--> . On the second approach to Khrushchev, the Russian was persuaded that cost-sharing was beneficial and American space technology was forging ahead. The U.S. had launched a <!--del_lnk--> geostationary satellite and Kennedy had asked Congress to approve more than $22 billion for the <!--del_lnk--> Apollo Project, which had the goal of landing an American man on the moon before the end of the decade. Khrushchev agreed to a joint venture in Autumn 1963, but JFK died in November before the agreement could be formalized. On <!--del_lnk--> July 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, almost six years after Kennedy&#39;s death, the Project Apollo&#39;s goal was realized when <a href="../../wp/n/Neil_Armstrong.htm" title="Neil Armstrong">Neil Armstrong</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Buzz Aldrin became the first men to land on the moon.<p><a id="Cabinet" name="Cabinet"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Cabinet</span></h4>

      <p>Kennedy and his wife &quot;Jackie&quot; were very young in comparison to earlier Presidents and first ladies, and were both extraordinarily popular in ways more common to <!--del_lnk--> pop singers and <!--del_lnk--> movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines.<p>The Kennedys brought new life and vigor &mdash; a favorite word of Kennedy &mdash; to the atmosphere of the <!--del_lnk--> White House. They believed that the White House should be a place to celebrate American history, culture, and achievement, and they invited artists, writers, scientists, poets, musicians, actors, <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize winners and athletes to visit, notwithstanding Kennedy&#39;s own well-known middle-brow intellectual and aesthetic tastes. <!--del_lnk--> Jacqueline Kennedy also bought new <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and <!--del_lnk--> furniture and eventually restored all the rooms in the White House.<p>The White House also seemed like a more fun, youthful place, because of the Kennedys&#39; two young children, <!--del_lnk--> Caroline and <!--del_lnk--> John Jr. (who came to be known in the popular press as &quot;John-John&quot; though years later Jacqueline Kennedy denied that the family called him by that name). Outside the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a preschool, swimming pool, and tree house. Jackie did not like the children to be photographed, and during her frequent absences, Kennedy asked photographers to come and photograph the children in the Oval Office. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Jackie&#39;s not here, so you&#39;d better come over right away.&quot; The resulting photos are probably the most famous of the children, and especially John Jr., after he was photographed playing underneath the President&rsquo;s desk.<p>The President was closely tied to popular culture. Things such as &quot;Twisting at the White House&quot; and &quot;Camelot&quot; (the popular Broadway play) were part of the JFK culture. <!--del_lnk--> Vaughn Meader&#39;s &quot;First Family&quot; comedy album&mdash;an album parodying the President, First Lady, their family and administration&mdash;sold about 4 million copies. On <!--del_lnk--> May 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1962 <!--del_lnk--> Marilyn Monroe <!--del_lnk--> sang for the president at a large birthday party in <!--del_lnk--> Madison Square Garden.<p>Behind the glamorous facade, the Kennedys also suffered many personal tragedies. Jacqueline suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and gave birth to a stillborn daughter in 1956. The death of their newborn son in August 1963, <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, was a great loss. In the years following the Kennedy presidency it came to be known that Kennedy carried on numerous <!--del_lnk--> extramarital <!--del_lnk--> dalliances throughout his presidency, all connived at by those members of the presidential staff.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> charisma of Kennedy and his family led to the figurative designation of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Camelot&quot; for his administration, credited by his widow to his affection for the contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Broadway <!--del_lnk--> musical of the same name. She gave an interview to <!--del_lnk--> Theodore H. White, where she mentioned Camelot (the musical), and White later said that he had &quot;found the headline&quot;.<p><a id="Assassination" name="Assassination"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Assassination</span></h3>

      <p>President Kennedy was assassinated in <a href="../../wp/d/Dallas%252C_Texas.htm" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, at 12:30 p.m. <!--del_lnk--> CST on <!--del_lnk--> November 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1963, while on a political trip through <!--del_lnk--> Texas. He was struck by at least two bullets. Texas Governor <!--del_lnk--> John Connally, seated ahead of Kennedy, was also struck by a bullet, but survived.<p><!--del_lnk--> Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested in a theatre about 80 minutes after the assassination and charged at 7:00 p.m. for killing a Dallas policeman by &quot;murder with malice&quot;, and also charged at 11:30 p.m. for the murder of Kennedy (there being no charge for &quot;assassination&quot; of a president at that time). Oswald denied shooting anyone; he claimed that he was being set up as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> patsy&quot;, and that photographs of him holding the alleged murder weapon were fabrications. Oswald was fatally shot less than two days later in a Dallas police station by <!--del_lnk--> Jack Ruby, in front of live TV cameras. Consequently, Oswald&#39;s guilt or innocence was never determined in a court of law, and some critics (such as New Orleans District Attorney <!--del_lnk--> Jim Garrison, and conspiracy researchers <!--del_lnk--> Mark Lane and David Lifton) contend that Oswald was not involved at all and that he was framed.<p>Five days after Oswald was killed, President <a href="../../wp/l/Lyndon_B._Johnson.htm" title="Lyndon B. Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> created the <!--del_lnk--> Warren Commission&mdash;chaired by Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> Earl Warren&mdash;to investigate the assassination. It concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin. A later investigation in the 1970s by the <!--del_lnk--> House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) also concluded that Oswald was the assassin, but that there was a &quot;probable conspiracy&quot; as well. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The assassination was captured on <!--del_lnk--> Super 8 mm film by Dallas dress manufacturer <!--del_lnk--> Abraham Zapruder. The film shows President Kennedy clutching his throat after a bullet struck him. Shortly after, it shows the effect of the second, fatal blow to the head. There is visible blood spatter, and then the president slumps to his left onto the seat.<p><a id="Legacy_and_memorials" name="Legacy_and_memorials"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy and memorials</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">Television</a> became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding John F. Kennedy&#39;s assassination. Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information. U.S. networks switched to 24-hour news coverage for the first time ever. <!--del_lnk--> Kennedy&#39;s state funeral procession and the murder of <!--del_lnk--> Lee Harvey Oswald were all broadcast live in America and in other places around the world.<p>The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the U.S., but also among the world population. Many vividly remember where they were when first learning of the news that Kennedy was assassinated. U.N. Ambassador <!--del_lnk--> Adlai Stevenson said of the assassination, &quot;all of us... will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours.&quot;<p>Ultimately, the death of President Kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment &mdash; a point made by commentators from <!--del_lnk--> Gore Vidal to <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.<p>Coupled with the murder of his own brother, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and that of Martin Luther King, Jr., the five tumultuous years from 1963 to 1968 signaled a growing disillusionment within the well of hope for political and social change which so defined the lives of those who lived through the 1960s. Kennedy&#39;s introduction of the U.S. to the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> preceded President Johnson&#39;s escalation of a conflict which contributed to a decade of national difficulties and disappointment on the political landscape. The <!--del_lnk--> Watergate scandal of President <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&#39;s administration is widely recognized as being the final stroke in this process of diminishing trust in government.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, Kennedy&#39;s body was moved to a permanent burial place and memorial at <!--del_lnk--> Arlington National Cemetery. Kennedy is buried with his wife and their deceased minor children; his brother Robert is also buried nearby. His grave is lit with an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Eternal Flame&quot;. Kennedy and <a href="../../wp/w/William_Howard_Taft.htm" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a> are the only two U.S. Presidents buried at Arlington.<p>Many of Kennedy&#39;s speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office and lack of major legislative changes during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best Presidents, in the same league as <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D.

Some excerpts of Kennedy&#39;s inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington.<p>Kennedy is also sometimes credited with giving American Catholics the full recognition they deserved as American citizens.

      <p>A number of critics argue that his reputation is undeserved. His immense popularity, according to some critics, was the result of the optimistic beginnings of many programs declared to be of great benefit to the United States, its people, and various global issues, and the national trauma of his assassination. The <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act which he sent to Congress in June 1963 was, in large part, conceived by his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and it was signed into law by his successor, Lyndon Johnson, in 1964.<p>Other critics point out that Kennedy started the process which led to the U.S. getting involved in a complete <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">war in Vietnam</a>. They point to Kennedy sending over 18,000 military advisers and introducing <!--del_lnk--> napalm, <!--del_lnk--> defoliants, strategic hamlet, <!--del_lnk--> free-fire zones and <!--del_lnk--> jet planes to the Vietnam conflict, which the previous administration was not willing to do.<p>According to the US Senate <!--del_lnk--> Church Committee, Kennedy had an affair with <!--del_lnk--> Judith Campbell Exner, who was simultaneously having an affair with <!--del_lnk--> Sam Giancana, the boss of the Chicago <!--del_lnk--> Mafia, while Giancana was conspiring with the <!--del_lnk--> CIA to assassinate <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>.<p>It is suggested by Kennedy&#39;s critics that his failure to disclose the severity of his health concerns represented something of a failure of professional integrity. Seymour Hersh&#39;s <i>The Dark Side of Camelot</i> (1998) presents one such critical analysis of the Kennedy administration, stating that Kennedy &quot;was probably one of the unhealthiest men ever to sit in the Oval Office,&quot; because of Addison&#39;s Disease and a bad back, as well as recurring childhood illnesses and venereal infections. Robert Dallek&#39;s <i>An Unfinished Life</i> (2003) is a more traditional biography but contains a lot of detail about Kennedy&#39;s health issues.<p>Thomas Reeves&#39; <i>A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy</i> is a sharply critical analysis of Kennedy&#39;s &quot;revisionism&quot;. <a href="../../wp/n/Noam_Chomsky.htm" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, in his book <i>Rethinking Camelot: JFK, the Vietnam War, and US Political Culture</i> (1993), presents a thesis on the Kennedy administration in opposition to the one that lingers in the memory of many Americans.<p>Source:<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
