      <p>Owens was born in <!--del_lnk--> Oakville, <!--del_lnk--> Alabama and moved to <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a> when he was nine years old as the seventh of the eleven children of Henry and Emma Owens. Owens was the grandson of a slave and the son of a sharecropper. He was often sick with what his mother reportedly called &quot;<i>devil&#39;s cold</i>&quot;. He was given the name <i>Jesse</i> by a teacher in Cleveland who did not understand his accent when the young boy said he was called <i>J.C.</i><p>Throughout his life Owens attributed the success of his athletic career to the encouragement of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Riley, his junior-high track coach at Fairview Junior High, who had picked him off the playground and put him on the track team (see also <!--del_lnk--> Harrison Dillard, a Cleveland athlete inspired by Owens). Since Jesse worked in a shoe repair shop after school, Riley allowed Jesse to practice before school instead.<p>Owens first came to national attention when, as a student of <!--del_lnk--> East Technical High School in <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ohio, he tied the world record of 9.4 seconds in the 100-yard dash and long-jumped 24 feet 9 1/2 inches at the 1933 National High School Championship meet in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>.<p><a id="NCAA" name="NCAA"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">NCAA</span></h2>
      <p>Owens attended <!--del_lnk--> Ohio State University only after employment was found for his father, ensuring the family could be supported. He was affectionately known as the &quot;Buckeye Bullet&quot; and won a record eight individual NCAA championships, four each in 1935 and 1936. The record of four golds at the NCAA has only been equaled by <!--del_lnk--> Xavier Carter, in 2006, although his titles included relay medals too.meatspin.com<p>Owens&#39; greatest achievement came in a span of 45 minutes on <!--del_lnk--> May 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1935 at the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten meet in <a href="../../wp/a/Ann_Arbor%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Ann Arbor, Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, where he set four world records. He tied the world record for the 100 yard (91 m) dash (9.4 seconds) and set world records in the <!--del_lnk--> long jump (26-8&frac14;, a world record that would last 25 years), 220 yard (201 m) dash (20.3 seconds), and the 220 yard low hurdles (22.6 seconds to become the first person to break 23 seconds). This incredible feat is widely considered one of the most amazing athletic achievements of all time. In fact, both <!--del_lnk--> NBC sports announcer, <!--del_lnk--> Bob Costas, and University of Central Florida Professor of Sports History, Richard C. Crepeau chose this as the most impressive athletic achievement since 1850.<p><a id="Berlin_Olympics" name="Berlin_Olympics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Berlin Olympics</span></h2>
      <p>In 1936 Owens arrived in Berlin to compete for the United States in the <!--del_lnk--> Summer Olympics. <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was using the games to show the world a resurgent <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> Germany. He and other government officials had high hopes German athletes would dominate the games with victories. Meanwhile, Nazi <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> promoted concepts of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Aryan racial superiority&quot; and depicted ethnic Africans (e.g. the <!--del_lnk--> Rhineland Bastards) as inferior.<p>Owens surprised many by winning four gold medals: On <!--del_lnk--> August 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1936 the <!--del_lnk--> 100m dash, defeating <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Metcalfe; on <!--del_lnk--> August 4, the <!--del_lnk--> long jump, after friendly and helpful advice from German competitor <!--del_lnk--> Lutz Long; on <!--del_lnk--> August 5, the <!--del_lnk--> 200m dash; and, after he was added to the 4 x 100m relay team, his fourth on <!--del_lnk--> August 9 (his performance wasn&#39;t duplicated until <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Lewis.htm" title="Carl Lewis">Carl Lewis</a> won gold medals in the same events at the <!--del_lnk--> 1984 Summer Olympics).<p>On the first day, Hitler shook hands only with the German victors and then left the stadium (some claim this was to avoid having to shake hands with <!--del_lnk--> Cornelius Johnson, who was African-American, but according to a spokesman Hitler&#39;s exit had been pre-scheduled). Olympic committee officials then insisted Hitler greet each and every medalist or none at all. Hitler opted for the latter and skipped all further medal presentations. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p>Owens was cheered enthusiastically by 110,000 people in Berlin&#39;s Olympic Stadium and later ordinary Germans sought his autograph when they saw him in the streets. Although had he lived in Germany, he would have been barred from citizenship under the <!--del_lnk--> Reich Citizenship Law of September 15, 1935 &quot;&sect;2 1. A Reich citizen is a subject of the State who is of German or related blood, who proves by his conduct that he is willing and fit faithfully to serve the German people and Reich.&quot; Nevertheless, Owens was allowed to travel with and stay in the same hotels as whites, an irony at the time, since <!--del_lnk--> Negroes in the United States were denied equal rights. After a New York ticker-tape parade in his honour, Owens had to ride the freight elevator to attend a reception for him at the <!--del_lnk--> Waldorf-Astoria. He later recounted:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>After the games he had difficulty making a living and became a sports promoter, essentially an entertainer. He would give local sprinters a ten or twenty yard start and beat them in the 100 yd (91 m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses although as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung thoroughbred horse that would be frightened by the starter&#39;s pistol and give him a good jump.
