      <p>John Sentamu was born in <!--del_lnk--> 1949 in a village near <!--del_lnk--> Kampala, <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, the sixth of thirteen children. He was educated for the law at <!--del_lnk--> Makerere University, <!--del_lnk--> Kampala, and practised as an <!--del_lnk--> advocate of the High Court of Uganda. Sentamu was appointed a High Court <!--del_lnk--> judge in <!--del_lnk--> 1973 at the age of 24 by the newly-ascendent <!--del_lnk--> Idi Amin; his judicial independence earned the dictator&#39;s ire, however, and he suffered threats and physical violence before fleeing to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1974.<p>He read theology at <!--del_lnk--> Selwyn College, Cambridge (<!--del_lnk--> BA <!--del_lnk--> 1976, <!--del_lnk--> MA <!--del_lnk--> MPhil <!--del_lnk--> 1979, <!--del_lnk--> PhD <!--del_lnk--> 1984), and trained for the priesthood at <!--del_lnk--> Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained a priest in <!--del_lnk--> 1979. He worked as assistant <!--del_lnk--> chaplain at Selwyn College, as chaplain at a remand centre, and as <!--del_lnk--> curate, priest and <!--del_lnk--> vicar in a series of parish appointments before his <!--del_lnk--> consecration in <!--del_lnk--> 1996 as <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Stepney (a <!--del_lnk--> suffragan bishop in the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of London). It was during this time that he served as advisor to the <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Lawrence Judicial Enquiry. In <!--del_lnk--> 2002 he chaired the <!--del_lnk--> Damilola Taylor review. That same year he was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Birmingham, where his ministry, according to the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Rowan_Williams.htm" title="Rowan Williams">Rowan Williams</a>, was praised by &quot;Christians of all backgrounds&quot;.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 17 June <!--del_lnk--> 2005 the <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister&#39;s</a> office announced his translation to <!--del_lnk--> York as the 97th Archbishop . He was formally elected by the Canons of <!--del_lnk--> York Minster on <!--del_lnk--> 21 June, legally installed as Archbishop in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 5 October, and enthroned at York Minster on <!--del_lnk--> 30 November <!--del_lnk--> 2005 (the feast of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Andrew), at a ceremony with African singing and dancing and contemporary music, with the Archbishop himself playing African drums during the service .<p><a id="Views" name="Views"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Views</span></h2>
      <p>In an interview a week before his enthronement he, among other things, called for a rediscovery of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> pride and cultural identity, warning that zeal for <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> had sometimes &quot;seemed to imply, wrongly for me, &#39;let other cultures be allowed to express themselves but do not let the majority culture at all tell us its glories, its struggles, its joys, its pains&#39;.&quot;  (The Times amongst others) Just as at <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, Sentamu has expressed a desire to be known informally as Archbishop <i>for</i> York (rather than <i>of</i>).<p>Early in 2006, Archbishop Sentamu was featured prominently in the British press for his comments on what he saw as injustices over the treatment of alleged <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war in Guantanamo Bay.<p>For a week, starting <!--del_lnk--> August 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Archbishop Sentamu camped in York Minster, foregoing food in solidarity with those impacted by the Middle East conflict.<p>One of Sentamu&#39;s favourite references is to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chocolate Trinity&quot; of God-fearing <!--del_lnk--> Quaker <!--del_lnk--> capitalists who were involved in developing the <a href="../../wp/c/Chocolate.htm" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> industry:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> George Cadbury: &quot;More than just a sweet man&quot;</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Joseph Rowntree: <i>&hellip; an adventurer to the end of life, forever peering forward, never content with what had been achieved</i>&quot;</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Joseph Storrs Fry II (J.S.Fry): &quot; <i>&hellip; the very model of the pre-1860 Quaker, with his plain dress a relic of the past and a reflection of his narrow conservative approach to both religion and business.</i>&quot;</ul>
