      <p><b>Jack Kerouac</b> (<!--del_lnk--> pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[d&#x292;&aelig;k &#x2C8;k&#x25B;&#x279;&#x259;w&aelig;k]</span>) (<!--del_lnk--> March 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1922 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> October 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1969) was an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> novelist, <!--del_lnk--> writer, <!--del_lnk--> poet, <!--del_lnk--> artist, and part of the <!--del_lnk--> Beat Generation.<p>While enjoying popular but little critical success during his own lifetime, Kerouac is now considered one of America&#39;s most important authors. The spontaneous, confessional prose style inspired other writers, including <!--del_lnk--> Tom Robbins, <!--del_lnk--> Lester Bangs, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Brautigan, <!--del_lnk--> Hunter S. Thompson, <!--del_lnk--> Ken Kesey, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Waits and <a href="../../wp/b/Bob_Dylan.htm" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. Kerouac&#39;s best known works are <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Road</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Dharma Bums</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Big Sur</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Visions of Cody</i>.<p>He divided most of his adult life between roaming the vast American landscape and living with his mother. Faced with a changing country, Kerouac sought to find his place, eventually rejecting the values of the <!--del_lnk--> Fifties. His writing often reflects a desire to break free from society&#39;s strictures and to find meaning in life.<p>This search led him to experiment with drugs and to embark on trips around the world. His books are often credited as the <!--del_lnk--> catalyst for the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s <!--del_lnk--> counterculture. Kerouac died in <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg, Florida, at the age of forty-seven from an <!--del_lnk--> internal hemorrhage caused by his chronic <!--del_lnk--> alcoholism.<p>

      <p>Kerouac was born <b>Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac</b>, in <!--del_lnk--> Lowell, Massachusetts, to a family of <!--del_lnk--> French-Americans. His parents, Leo-Alcide Kerouac and Gabrielle-Ange L&eacute;vesque, were natives of <!--del_lnk--> the province of Qu&eacute;bec in <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. Like many other <!--del_lnk--> Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois of their generation, the L&eacute;vesques and Kerouacs were part of the <!--del_lnk--> Quebec emigration to <!--del_lnk--> New England to find employment.<p>Jack didn&#39;t start to learn <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> until the age of six and at home, he and his family spoke <!--del_lnk--> Quebec French. At an early age, he was profoundly marked by the death of his elder brother G&eacute;rard, an event that later prompted him to write the book <i><!--del_lnk--> Visions of Gerard</i>. Kerouac wrote some poems in French and in his letters to <!--del_lnk--> Ginsberg, towards the end of his life, he expressed the desire to speak his mother tongue again.<p>Kerouac&#39;s athletic prowess led him to become a star on his local football team, and this achievement earned him scholarships to <!--del_lnk--> Boston College and <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University. He entered <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University after spending the scholarship&#39;s required year at <!--del_lnk--> Horace Mann School. Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman year, and argued constantly with his coach, who kept him benched.<p>During Kerouac&#39;s time at <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University, Burroughs and Kerouac got into trouble with the law for failing to report a <!--del_lnk--> murder committed by a friend, <!--del_lnk--> Lucien Carr; this incident formed the basis of a mystery novel the two collaborated on in 1945 entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks</i> (the novel was never published, although an excerpt from the manuscript would be included in the Burroughs compilation <i><!--del_lnk--> Word Virus</i>).<p>His football scholarship did not pan out and he went to live with an old girlfriend, Edie Parker, in New York. It was in New York that Kerouac met the people with whom he was to journey around the world, the subjects of many of his novels: the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Beat Generation, including <!--del_lnk--> Allen Ginsberg, <!--del_lnk--> Neal Cassady, <!--del_lnk--> John Clellon Holmes, <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Huncke, and <!--del_lnk--> William S. Burroughs. Kerouac joined the <!--del_lnk--> Merchant Marine in <!--del_lnk--> 1942 and in <!--del_lnk--> 1943 joined the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy, but was discharged during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> on psychiatric grounds (he was of &quot;indifferent disposition&quot;).<p>In between his sea voyages, Kerouac stayed in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> with friends from <!--del_lnk--> Fordham University in <!--del_lnk--> The Bronx. He lived with his parents in the <!--del_lnk--> Ozone Park neighbourhood of the New York City borough of <!--del_lnk--> Queens after he was discharged from the U.S. Navy in 1943. He wrote his first novel, <i>The Town and the City</i>, as well as the quintessential <i><!--del_lnk--> On The Road</i> while living there. His friends jokingly called him &quot;The Wizard of Ozone Park&quot; as a play on words referring to the film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wizard of Oz.<!--del_lnk--> </i><p>&quot;The Town and the City&quot; was published in <!--del_lnk--> 1950 under the name &quot;John Kerouac&quot; and earned him some respect as a writer. Unlike Kerouac&#39;s later work, which established his Beat style, it is heavily influenced by Kerouac&#39;s reading of <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Wolfe.<p>Kerouac wrote constantly but could not find a publisher for his next novel for six years. Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled &quot;The Beat Generation&quot; and &quot;Gone On The Road&quot;, Kerouac wrote what is now known as <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Road</i> in April, 1951 (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0-312-20677-1).<p>Part of the Kerouac myth is that fueled by <!--del_lnk--> Benzedrine and <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, he completed the first version of the novel during a three week extended session of spontaneous confessional prose. This session produced the now famous scroll of <i>On The Road</i>. In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor <!--del_lnk--> Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over several years. His technique was heavily influenced by <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a>, especially <!--del_lnk--> Bebop, and later, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, as well as the famous <b>Joan Anderson letter</b>, authored by <!--del_lnk--> Neal Cassady. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Publishers rejected the book due to its experimental writing style and its sympathetic tone towards minorities and marginalized social groups of the <!--del_lnk--> United States in the 1950s. In 1957, <!--del_lnk--> Viking Press purchased the novel, demanding major revisions (<!--del_lnk--> ).<p>In 2007, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of <i>On The Road&#39;</i>s publishing (<!--del_lnk--> ), an uncensored version of <i>On The Road</i>] will be released by Viking Press, containing text that was removed from the released version because it was deemed too explicit for 1957 audiences. It will be drawn solely from the (<!--del_lnk--> ) original scroll and the only things not included will be things that Kerouac himself crossed out.<p>The book was largely autobiographical, narrated from the point of view of the character <!--del_lnk--> Sal Paradise, describing Kerouac&#39;s roadtrip adventures across the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> with <!--del_lnk--> Neal Cassady, the model for the character of <!--del_lnk--> Dean Moriarty. Kerouac&#39;s novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II <!--del_lnk--> Beat Generation and Kerouac came to be called &quot;the king of the beat generation,&quot; a term that he never felt comfortable with, and once observed (<!--del_lnk--> ), <i>I&#39;m not a beatnik, I&#39;m a Catholic.</i><p>Kerouac&#39;s friendship with <!--del_lnk--> Allen Ginsberg, <!--del_lnk--> William S. Burroughs and <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Corso, among others, defined a generation. Kerouac also wrote and narrated a &quot;Beat&quot; movie entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Pull My Daisy</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1958. In <!--del_lnk--> 1954, Kerouac discovered <!--del_lnk--> Dwight Goddard&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> A Buddhist Bible</i> at the <a href="../../wp/s/San_Jose%252C_California.htm" title="San Jose, California">San Jose</a> Library, which marked the beginning of Kerouac&#39;s immersion into <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.<p>He chronicled parts of this, as well as some of his adventures with <!--del_lnk--> Gary Snyder and other <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco-area poets, in the book <i><!--del_lnk--> The Dharma Bums</i>, set in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> and published in <!--del_lnk--> 1958. <i>The Dharma Bums</i>, which some have called the sequel to <i>On the Road</i>, was written in <!--del_lnk--> Orlando, Florida during late <!--del_lnk--> 1957 through early <!--del_lnk--> 1958.<p>Kerouac developed something of a friendship with the scholar <!--del_lnk--> Alan Watts (cryptically named <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Wayne in Kerouac&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Big Sur</i>, and Alex Aums in <i><!--del_lnk--> Desolation Angels</i>). He also met and had discussions with the famous <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <!--del_lnk--> Zen Buddhist authority <!--del_lnk--> D.T. Suzuki.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house on Clouser Ave. in the College Park section of Orlando, Florida to await the release of <i>On the Road</i>. A few weeks later, the review appears in the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i> proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation. Kerouac was hailed as a major American writer, and reluctantly as the voice of the Beat Generation. His fame would come as an unmanageable surge that would ultimately be his undoing.<p>John Antonelli&#39;s 1985 documentary <i>Kerouac, the Movie</i> begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from <i>On the Road</i> and &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; from <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tonight Show</i> with <!--del_lnk--> Steve Allen in 1957. Kerouac appears intelligent but shy. &quot;Are you nervous?&quot; asks Steve Allen. &quot;Naw&quot;, says Kerouac, sweating and fiddling.<p>In 1955 Kerouac wrote a biography of <!--del_lnk--> Siddhartha Gautama, entitled <i>Wake Up</i>, which was unpublished during his lifetime but eventually serialised in <i>Tricycle</i> magazine, 1993-95. Shortly before his death Kerouac told interviewer <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Lelyveld of the <i>New York Times</i>, &quot;I&#39;m not a beatnik. I&#39;m a Catholic.&quot; After pointing to a painting of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Paul VI, Kerouac noted, &quot;You know who painted that? Me.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> ).<p>He died on <!--del_lnk--> October 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1969 at St. Anthony&#39;s Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg, <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, one day after being rushed, in severe abdominal pain, from his St. Petersburg home by ambulance. His death, at the age of 47, resulted from an internal hemorrhage caused by <!--del_lnk--> cirrhosis of the liver, the result of a life of heavy drinking. He was living at the time with his third wife Stella, and his mother Gabrielle. He is buried in his home town of <!--del_lnk--> Lowell.<p><a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>
      <p>Kerouac realized he wanted to be a writer before the age of ten; his father was a <!--del_lnk--> linotypist and ran a print shop, publishing <i>The Lowell Spotlight</i> (<!--del_lnk--> ). He tended to write constantly, carrying a notebook with him everywhere. Letters to friends and family members tended to be long and rambling, including great detail about his daily life and thoughts.<p>Prior to becoming a writer, he tried a varied list of careers. He was a sports reporter for <i>The Lowell Sun</i>; a temporary worker in construction and food service; a <!--del_lnk--> Merchant Marine and he joined the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy twice. Throughout all of this he led a nomadic lifestyle, never having a home of his own. Alternatively, he lived with his mother, stayed with friends or camped out.<p><a id="Style" name="Style"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Style</span></h2>
      <p>Kerouac is considered by some as the <b>King of the <!--del_lnk--> Beats</b> as well as the <b>Father of the <!--del_lnk--> Hippies</b>, although it must be said that he actively disliked such labels, and, in particular, regarded the <!--del_lnk--> Hippie movement with some disdain. Kerouac&#39;s method was heavily influenced by the prolific explosion of <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a>, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Bebop genre established by <!--del_lnk--> Charlie Parker, <!--del_lnk--> Dizzy Gillespie, <!--del_lnk--> Thelonious Monk, and others. Later, Kerouac would include ideas he developed in his <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> studies, beginning with <!--del_lnk--> Gary Snyder. He called this style <!--del_lnk--> Spontaneous Prose, a literary technique akin to <!--del_lnk--> stream of consciousness.<p>Kerouac&#39;s motto was &quot;first-thought=best thought&quot;, and many of his books exemplified this approach including <i>On the Road</i>, <i>Visions of Cody</i>, <i>Visions of Gerard</i>, <i>Big Sur</i>, and <i>The Subterraneans</i>. The central features of this writing method was the idea of breath (borrowed from Jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and not editing a single word (much of his work was edited by Donald Merriam Allen, a major figure in Beat Generation poetry who also edited some of Ginsberg&#39;s work as well). Connected with his idea of breath was the elimination of the <!--del_lnk--> period, preferring to use a long, connecting dash instead. As such, the phrases occurring between dashes might resemble <!--del_lnk--> improvisational jazz licks. When spoken, the words might take on a certain kind of rhythm, though none of it pre-meditated.<p><!--del_lnk--> Gary Snyder was greatly admired by Kerouac, and many of his ideas influenced Kerouac. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Dharma Bums</i> contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder. Kerouac took a job as a <!--del_lnk--> fire lookout in the North Cascade Mountains (Washington State) one summer on Snyder&#39;s recommendation, which was a difficult but ultimately rewarding experience. Kerouac described the experience in his novel <i>Desolation Angels</i>.<p>He would go on for hours to friends and strangers about his method, often drunk, which at first wasn&#39;t well received by Ginsberg. He had an acute awareness of the need to sell literature (to publishers) as much as write it, though Ginsberg would later be one of its great proponents, and indeed was apparently influenced by Kerouac&#39;s free flowing prose method of writing in the composition of his masterpiece &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Howl&quot;. It was at about the time that Kerouac wrote <i>The Subterraneans</i> that he was approached by Ginsberg and others to formally explicate exactly how he wrote it, how he did Spontaneous Prose. Among the writings he set down specifically about his Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise would be <i><!--del_lnk--> Belief and Technique for Modern Prose</i>, a list of thirty &quot;essentials.&quot;<ol>

       <br /> Some believed that at times Kerouac&#39;s writing technique did not produce lively or energetic prose. <!--del_lnk--> Truman Capote famously said about Kerouac&#39;s work, &quot;That&#39;s not writing, it&#39;s typing.&quot; Despite such criticism, it should be kept in mind that what Kerouac said about writing and how he wrote are sometimes seen to be separate. According to <!--del_lnk--> Carolyn Cassady and other people who knew him he rewrote and rewrote. Some claim his own style was in no way spontaneous. However it should be taken into account that throughout most of the 50&#39;s, Kerouac was constantly trying to have his work published, and consequently he often revised and re-arranged manuscripts in an often futile attempt to interest publishers, as is clearly documented in his collected letters (which are in themselves wonderful examples of his style). <i>The Subterraneans</i> and <i>Visions of Cody</i> are possibly the best examples of Kerouac&#39;s free-flowing spontaneous prose method of writing.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
