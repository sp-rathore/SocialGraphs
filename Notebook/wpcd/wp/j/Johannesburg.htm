      <p><b>Johannesburg</b>, also known as <b>eGoli</b>, is the most populous <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. The city is affectionately known as &quot;Jo&#39;burg&quot;, &quot;Jozi&quot; and &quot;JHB&quot; by South Africans. Johannesburg is the <!--del_lnk--> provincial <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Gauteng Province, the wealthiest province in South Africa, and the site of the <!--del_lnk--> South African Constitutional Court. The city is one of the 40 largest metropolitan areas in the world, and one of Africa&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> global cities (classified as a gamma world city). Whilst sometimes mistakenly assumed to be South Africa&#39;s capital city, Johannesburg is not even one of South Africa&#39;s three official capital cities (although <a href="../../wp/p/Pretoria.htm" title="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, which is in the same province, is).<p>Johannesburg is the site of a large-scale <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamond</a> <!--del_lnk--> trade due to its location on the <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a>-rich <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand range of hills. Johannesburg is also served by <!--del_lnk--> O.R. Tambo International Airport, the largest and busiest <!--del_lnk--> airport in Africa and a gateway for international air travel to and from the rest of <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">southern Africa</a>.<p>According to the 2001 <!--del_lnk--> Census, the population of the city is more than three million. Johannesburg&#39;s land area of <!--del_lnk--> 1,644 km&sup2; is very large when compared to other cities, resulting in a <!--del_lnk--> population density of only 1,962/km&sup2;. The population of the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Area is almost eight million. Johannesburg also encompasses <!--del_lnk--> Soweto to the south west, a <!--del_lnk--> township which the <!--del_lnk--> apartheid government established to accommodate the large number of <!--del_lnk--> migrant workers.<p>

      <p>The region surrounding Johannesburg has been inhabited for millions of years. The <!--del_lnk--> Sterkfontein Caves, to the north west, have produced the most complete skeleton of a 3.3 million-year old hominid as well as close to 700 specimens of a closely related species, Australopithecus africanus, among them <!--del_lnk--> Mrs Ples, which is between 2.8 and 2.3 million years old.<p>It is is theorised that the Johannesburg region was inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> nomadic <!--del_lnk--> Bushmen people around 100,000 years ago. The Bushmen is said to have lived in the area until the <!--del_lnk--> Bantu-speaking people <!--del_lnk--> migrated into the area around the year AD 1060. The Bantu people were <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> people who <!--del_lnk--> domesticated animals, farmed <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">crops</a>, worked <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a>, made <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, and lived in organised <!--del_lnk--> villages.<p>The region remained inhabited by both the Bushmen and the Bantu people. When Europeans arrived in the area, small numbers of <!--del_lnk--> Boers started farms, but there was no major European settlement until the 1880s, when <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> was discovered in the region, triggering a <!--del_lnk--> gold rush.<p>Gold was initially discovered slightly to the east of present-day Johannesburg, in <!--del_lnk--> Barberton. <!--del_lnk--> Gold prospectors soon discovered that there were even richer <!--del_lnk--> gold reefs in the <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand.<p>The town was initially much the same as any small prospecting settlement, but as word spread, people flocked to the area from all other regions of the country as well as from <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and the rest of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaners, who controlled the region during the nineteenth century, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, culminating in the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Anglo-Boer War</a>. The Boers lost the war and control of the area was ceded to the British.<p>When the <!--del_lnk--> Union of South Africa was declared in 1910, this paved the way for a more organised mining structure. Later the South African government instituted a harsh racial system whereby <!--del_lnk--> blacks and <!--del_lnk--> Indians were heavily taxed, barred from holding skilled jobs, and consequently forced to work as migrant labour on Johannesburg&#39;s growing crop of <!--del_lnk--> gold mines.<p>The South African government then instituted a <!--del_lnk--> system of forced removals, moving the population of non-European descent into specified areas. It is this system that created the sprawling shantytown of <!--del_lnk--> Soweto (<b>So</b>uth <b>We</b>stern <b>To</b>wnships), one of the areas where blacks were forced to live during the <!--del_lnk--> apartheid era. <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> spent many years living in Soweto and his Soweto home in Orlando is currently a major <!--del_lnk--> tourist attraction.<p>Large-scale <!--del_lnk--> violence broke out in 1976 when the <!--del_lnk--> Soweto Students&#39; Representative Council organised protests against the use of <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> as primary language of instruction, considered to be the language of the oppressors, in black schools. <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">Police</a> shot into a student march, and 1000 people died in the following 12 months protesting the apartheid system. One of the most famous victims of the massacre, <!--del_lnk--> Hector Pieterson, is commemorated with a large <!--del_lnk--> Museum dedicated to his memory in Soweto.<p>The regulations of apartheid were abandoned in February 1990, and since the 1994 elections, Johannesburg has been free of discriminatory laws. The black <!--del_lnk--> townships have been integrated into the municipal government system, and to some extent, the suburbs have become multiracial. However, there has been a large-scale migration of businesses and commerce away from the <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District and southern suburbs in favour of the northern suburbs. This was fueled by a rise in the crime rate, serious traffic congestion and inadequate public transport, and a more favourable tax environment for landlords in the northern suburbs prior to the integration of the city. Currently the Johannesburg Metropolitan Council is implementing a large scale Inner City Revival project leading to many business moving back to the inner city.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      <p>During the apartheid era, Johannesburg was divided into 11 local authorities, seven of which were white and four black or <!--del_lnk--> Coloured. The white authorities were 90 % self-sufficient from <!--del_lnk--> property tax and other local <!--del_lnk--> taxes, and spent <!--del_lnk--> Rand 600 (<!--del_lnk--> USD $93) per person, while the black authorities were only ten percent self-sufficient, spending Rand 100 (USD $15) per person.<p>The first post-apartheid <!--del_lnk--> City Council was created in 1995. The council adopted the slogan &quot;One City, One Taxpayer&quot; in order to highlight its primary goal of addressing unequal tax revenue distribution. To this end, revenue from wealthy, traditionally white areas would help pay for services needed in poorer, black areas. The City Council was divided into four regions, each with a <!--del_lnk--> substantially autonomous local regional authority that was to be overseen by a central metropolitan council. Furthermore, the municipal boundaries were expanded to include wealthy satellite towns like <!--del_lnk--> Sandton and <!--del_lnk--> Randburg, poorer neighbouring townships such as <!--del_lnk--> Soweto and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra, and informal settlements like <!--del_lnk--> Orange Farm.<p>In 1999, Johannesburg appointed a city manager in order to reshape the city&#39;s ailing financial situation. The manager, together with the Municipal Council, drew up a blueprint called &quot;Igoli 2002&quot;. This was a three-year plan that called upon the government to sell non-core assets, restructure certain utilities, and required that all others become self-sufficient. The plan took the city from near <!--del_lnk--> insolvency to an operating <!--del_lnk--> surplus of R153 million (USD $23.6 million).<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h2>
      <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Group Areas Act was scrapped in the early 1990s, Johannesburg was affected by <!--del_lnk--> urban blight. Thousands of poor, mostly black, people who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships such as <!--del_lnk--> Soweto. Crime levels in formerly white areas rose. Many buildings were abandoned by <!--del_lnk--> landlords, especially in the high-density areas such as <!--del_lnk--> Hillbrow. Many corporations and institutions, including the <!--del_lnk--> JSE Securities Exchange, moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs such as <!--del_lnk--> Sandton. By the late 1990s, Johannesburg was rated as one of the most dangerous cities in the world with well over 1000 murders every year.<p>Reviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include <!--del_lnk--> closed-circuit television on street corners. Statistics show that crime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow <!--del_lnk--> . In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 FIFA World Cup, local government has enlisted the help of former New York mayor <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Giuliani to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament will be played in the city <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>
      <p>Johannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Highveld, at an elevation of 1753 metres. The city is located on a small ridge called the <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand (White Water&#39;s Ridge: <a href="../../wp/a/Afrikaans.htm" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>) and the city&#39;s northern and western suburbs have undulating hills, while the eastern metro area is generally flat.<p>The city enjoys a dry, sunny climate with the exception of occasional late afternoon downpours in the summer months of October to April. Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild thanks to the city&#39;s high altitude, with the average maximum daytime temperature in January of 26&ordm;C, dropping to an average maximum of around 16&deg;C in June. During the winter, the temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at nightime, causing <!--del_lnk--> frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, although the city experienced snowfall in September 1982 and light snow in August 2006). The annual average rainfall is 713mm, which is mostly concentrated in the summer months.<p>Despite the relatively dry climate, Johannesburg contains about six million trees, and it is often claimed that the city has the largest man-made forest in the world. Many trees were originally planted in the northern areas of the city at the end of the 19th century, to provide wood for the mining industry. The areas were developed by a German immigrant, who called the forest estates Sachsenwald. The name was changed to Saxonwold, now the name of a suburb, during World War I. White residents who moved into the areas, now generally referred to as the Northern Suburbs, retained many of the original trees and planted new ones, with the encouragement of successive city councils. In recent years, however, a considerable number of trees have been felled, to make way for the Northern Suburbs&#39; speedy residential and commercial redevelopment. The city is therefore at risk of losing its forest coverage within a few decades.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>Johannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16 % of South Africa&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product, and accounts for 40 % of Gauteng&#39;s economic activity. <a href="../../wp/m/Mining.htm" title="Mining">Mining</a> is the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> Witwatersrand&#39;s economy, but its importance is gradually declining. While gold mining no longer takes place within the <!--del_lnk--> city limits, most mining companies have their <!--del_lnk--> headquarters in Johannesburg. The city has a great variety of manufacturing industries, including <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cement plants. Many banking and commercial companies are also located in Johannesburg. Johannesburg has Africa&#39;s largest stock exchange, the <!--del_lnk--> JSE Securities Exchange. Due to its commercial importance, this city is the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions that are usually found only in capital cities. There is also a very large informal economy consisting of cash-only street traders and vendors which are largely missed in official statistics. The Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of <a href="../../wp/l/Lesotho.htm" title="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.<p>The container terminal at City Deep is purported to be the largest &quot;dry port&quot; in the world, with some 60 % of cargo that arrives through the port of <!--del_lnk--> Durban arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Blue IQ Project.<p>Johannesburg&#39;s largest and most prestigious shopping centres are <!--del_lnk--> Sandton City and <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park respectively. Other centres include <!--del_lnk--> Rosebank, <!--del_lnk--> Eastgate, <!--del_lnk--> Westgate, <!--del_lnk--> Northgate, <!--del_lnk--> Southgate, and <!--del_lnk--> Cresta. There are also plans to build an extremely large shopping centre, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Zonk&#39;Izizwe Shopping Resort, in <!--del_lnk--> Midrand. &quot;Zonk&#39;Izizwe&quot; means &quot;All Nations&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> isiZulu, indicating that the centre will cater to the city&#39;s diverse mix of peoples and races.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Suburbs</span></h2>

      <p>The different suburbs of Johannesburg are generally categorised by compass direction, as different areas of the city have greatly different personalities. Since Johannesburg is such a large city, there is great variety in the suburbs that comprise it. While the <!--del_lnk--> Central Business District and the surrounding areas were formerly highly desired wealthy areas, they have lost their former reputation after migrants took over abandoned buildings, and the crime level rose accordingly. The suburbs to the south of the city are mainly lower-class residential suburbs along with some <!--del_lnk--> townships, although most suburbs in the South tend to be extremely large and undistinguished.<p>The northern and northwestern suburbs have become the centre for the wealthy, containing the high-end retail shops and well as several upper-class residential areas including <!--del_lnk--> Houghton, where <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> makes his home. The northwestern area in particular is vibrant and lively, with the mostly-black suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Sophiatown a hotbed of political activity and the Bohemian-flavoured <!--del_lnk--> Melville featuring lively gathering places and nightlife. <!--del_lnk--> Auckland Park is home to the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> South African Broadcasting Corporation and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Johannesburg.<p>To the southwest of the City Centre is <!--del_lnk--> Soweto, a mostly black urban area constructed during the apartheid regime specifically for housing African people who were then living in areas designated by the government for white settlement. Today, Soweto is among the poorest parts of Johannesburg. The eastern suburbs include <!--del_lnk--> Yeoville, a hot spot for black nightlife despite its otherwise poor reputation, and several residential areas that are slowly gaining respectability.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h2>
      <p>Johannesburg has not traditionally been known as a tourist destination, but the city is a transit point for connecting flights to <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Durban, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kruger National Park. Consequently, most international visitors to South Africa pass through Johannesburg at least once, which has led to the development of more attractions for tourists. Recent additions have centred around <a href="../../wp/h/History_of_South_Africa.htm" title="History of South Africa">history</a> <!--del_lnk--> museums, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Apartheid Museum and the <!--del_lnk--> Hector Pieterson Museum. <!--del_lnk--> Gold Reef City, a large <!--del_lnk--> amusement park to the south of the Central Business District, is also a large draw for tourists in the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg Zoo is also one of the largest in South Africa.<p>The city also has several <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> museums, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg Art Gallery, which featured South African and European landscape and figurative paintings. The <!--del_lnk--> Museum Africa covers the history of the city of Johannesburg, as well as housing a large collection of <!--del_lnk--> rock art. The <!--del_lnk--> Market Theatre complex attained notoriety in the 1970s and 1980s by staging anti-apartheid plays, and has now become a centre for modern South African playwriting.<p>There is also a large industry around visiting former <!--del_lnk--> townships, such as <!--del_lnk--> Soweto and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra. Most visitors to Soweto go to see the <!--del_lnk--> Mandela Museum, which is located in the former home of <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cradle of Humankind <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO World Heritage Site is 25 kilometres to the northwest of the city. The <!--del_lnk--> Sterkfontein <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossil</a> site is famous for being the world&#39;s richest hominid site and produced the first adult <i><!--del_lnk--> Australopithecus africanus</i> and the first near-complete skeleton of an early <i><!--del_lnk--> Australopithecine</i>.<p><a id="Sports_teams_and_stadiums" name="Sports_teams_and_stadiums"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports teams and stadiums</span></h2>

The railways transport huge numbers of workers every day. However, the railway infrastructure was built in Johannesburg&#39;s infancy and covers only the older areas in the city&#39;s south. In the past half century Johannesburg has grown largely northwards, and none of the northern areas, including the key business districts of <!--del_lnk--> Sandton, <!--del_lnk--> Midrand, <!--del_lnk--> Randburg, and <!--del_lnk--> Rosebank, have any rail infrastructure.<p>The Gauteng Provincial Government&#39;s Blue IQ Project, <!--del_lnk--> Gautrain, however, has made provisions for the creation of a rapid <!--del_lnk--> rail link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and east-west between Sandton and <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg International Airport. Slated to be ready in time for the <!--del_lnk--> 2010 FIFA World Cup, the rail system is being designed to alleviate traffic on the <!--del_lnk--> N1 freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 160,000 per day.<dl>
       <dt>Airports</dl>
      <p>Johannesburg is served by <!--del_lnk--> OR Tambo International Airport (formerly <b>Johannesburg International Airport</b>) for both domestic and international flights. Other airports include <!--del_lnk--> Rand Airport, <!--del_lnk--> Grand Central Airport, and <!--del_lnk--> Lanseria. Rand Airport, located in <!--del_lnk--> Germiston, is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of <!--del_lnk--> South African Airways&#39;s first <a href="../../wp/b/Boeing_747.htm" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747 Classic</a>, the Lebombo, which is now an <!--del_lnk--> aviation <!--del_lnk--> museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft. Lanseria Airport is used for commercial flights to <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Botswana.htm" title="Botswana">Botswana</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Sun City.<dl>
       <dt>Buses</dl>
      <p>Johannesburg is served by a <!--del_lnk--> bus fleet operated by <!--del_lnk--> Metrobus, a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by <!--del_lnk--> Volvo and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus&#39; fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. Metrobus also operates a number of open-top buses in the &quot;City Slicker&quot; role, using them to provide guided tours around the city. In addition there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups.<dl>
       <dt>Taxis</dl>
      <p>Johannesburg has two kinds of taxis, <!--del_lnk--> metered taxis and <!--del_lnk--> minibus taxis. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. Metered taxis are rare, in comparison to many other cities.<p>The minibus &quot;taxis&quot; are the <i>de facto</i> standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Although essential, these taxis are often of a poor standard in not only road-worthiness, but also in terms of driver quality with a majority of taxi drivers breaking traffic laws regularly (such as driving in the emergency lane while speeding on a highway). With the high demand for transport by the working class of South Africa, minibus taxis are often over-filled with passengers causing yet another hazard for road users. However, without subsidies from Government and a lack of other feasible public transport, minibus taxis will remain an essential form of transport for many of Joburg&#39;s working class.<dl>
       <dt>Freeways<dd><i>Main article: <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg freeways</i></dl>
      <p>The fact that Johannesburg is not built near a large navigable body of water has meant that from the very beginning of the city&#39;s history, ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa&#39;s most famous &quot;beltways&quot; or ring roads/orbitals is the <!--del_lnk--> Johannesburg Ring Road. The road is comprised of three <!--del_lnk--> freeways that converge on the city, forming an 80-kilometre loop around it: the <!--del_lnk--> N3 Eastern Bypass, which links Johannesburg with <!--del_lnk--> Durban; the <!--del_lnk--> N1 Western Bypass, which links Johannesburg with <a href="../../wp/p/Pretoria.htm" title="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cape_Town.htm" title="Cape Town">Cape Town</a>; and the <!--del_lnk--> N12 Southern Bypass, which links Johannesburg with <!--del_lnk--> Witbank and <!--del_lnk--> Kimberley. The <!--del_lnk--> N3 was built exclusively with <!--del_lnk--> asphalt, while the <!--del_lnk--> N12 and <!--del_lnk--> N1 sections were made with <!--del_lnk--> concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, &quot;The Concrete Highway&quot;. In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas (6 lanes in either direction), the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly&#39;s Interchange, built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the <!--del_lnk--> R24 Airport Freeway intersect, is purported to be the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere.<dl>
       <dt>Trains</dl>
      <p>Construction of the <!--del_lnk--> Gautrain Rapid Rail started construction in October 2006 and will be completed by 2010, in time for the FIFA World Cup. It will comprise of number of underground stations (in the built up areas) as well as above ground. It will run from Johannesburg&#39;s Park Station, through Rosebank, Sandton, Midrand and into Pretoria. There will also be a line from the <!--del_lnk--> OR Tambo International Airport traveling to Sandton. This will be the first new rail way that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.<p><a id="Universities_in_Johannesburg" name="Universities_in_Johannesburg"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Universities in Johannesburg</span></h2>
      <p>Johannesburg has a well-developed <!--del_lnk--> higher education system of both <!--del_lnk--> private and <!--del_lnk--> public universities. Johannesburg is served by the public universities <!--del_lnk--> University of the Witwatersrand and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Johannesburg.<p><!--del_lnk--> University of Johannesburg was formed on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2005 when three separate universities and campuses&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Rand Afrikaans University, <!--del_lnk--> Technikon Witwatersrand, and <!--del_lnk--> Vista University&mdash;were merged together.
