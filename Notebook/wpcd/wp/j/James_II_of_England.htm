      <p><b>James II of England</b> (VII of Scotland; <!--del_lnk--> 14 October <!--del_lnk--> 1633 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 16 September <!--del_lnk--> 1701) became <!--del_lnk--> King of England, <!--del_lnk--> King of Scots, and <!--del_lnk--> King of Ireland on <!--del_lnk--> 6 February <!--del_lnk--> 1685, and <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy on <!--del_lnk--> 31 December <!--del_lnk--> 1660. He was the last <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> monarch to reign over the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Scotland, <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England, and <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Ireland. Many of his subjects distrusted his religious policies and <a href="../../wp/d/Despotism.htm" title="Despotism">despotism</a>, leading a group of them to depose him in the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. He was replaced not by his Roman Catholic son, <!--del_lnk--> James Francis Edward, but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law, <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_II_of_England.htm" title="Mary II of England">Mary II</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/William_III_of_England.htm" title="William III of England">William III</a>, who became joint rulers in 1689.<p>The belief that James &mdash; not William III or Mary II &mdash; was the legitimate ruler became known as <!--del_lnk--> Jacobitism (from <i>Jacobus</i> or <i>Iacobus</i>, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> for James). James made one serious attempt to recover his throne, when he landed in Ireland in 1689. After his defeat at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690, he returned to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, living out the rest of his life under the protection of <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">King Louis XIV</a>.

      <p>James, the second surviving son of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Henrietta Maria of France, was born at <!--del_lnk--> St. James&#39;s Palace in 1633 and created <!--del_lnk--> Duke of York in 1644. During the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War he stayed in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, a Royalist stronghold. When the city surrendered in 1646, the Duke of York was confined in St James&#39;s Palace by parliamentary command. In 1648, he escaped from the Palace, from there he went to <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a> in disguise. When Charles I was executed by the rebels in 1649, monarchists proclaimed the Duke of York&#39;s elder brother, <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles</a>, as King Charles II. Charles II was recognised by the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland and the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Ireland, and was crowned <!--del_lnk--> King of Scots at <!--del_lnk--> Scone, in Scotland, in 1651. He was, however, unable to secure the <!--del_lnk--> Crown of England, and consequently fled to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>.<p>Like his brother, James sought refuge in France, serving in the French army under <!--del_lnk--> Turenne. In 1656, when his brother, Charles, entered into an alliance with <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>&mdash;an enemy of France&mdash;he joined the Spanish army under <!--del_lnk--> Louis, Prince of Cond&eacute;.<p>In 1660, with <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> dead, Charles II was restored to the English Throne. Though James was the heir-presumptive, it seemed unlikely that he would actually inherit the Crown, for Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children. In September 1660, James (who was also created <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Albany in Scotland) wed <!--del_lnk--> Lady Anne Hyde, the daughter of Charles&#39;s chief minister, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon.<p>James was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Lord High Admiral and commanded the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Second (1665&ndash;1667) and <!--del_lnk--> Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672&ndash;1674). Following its capture by the English in 1664, the Dutch territory of <!--del_lnk--> New Netherland was named New York in his honour. <!--del_lnk--> Fort Orange, 240 kilometres (150 miles) up the <!--del_lnk--> River Hudson, was renamed <!--del_lnk--> Albany in his honour as well. James also headed the <!--del_lnk--> Royal African Company, which participated in the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>James was admitted to the Roman Catholic Church in about 1668 or 1669, although this was kept secret for some time. However, growing fears of Catholic influence at court, led to the introduction by Parliament of a new <!--del_lnk--> Test Act in 1673. Under this Act, all civil and military officials were required to take an oath (in which they were required not only to disavow the doctrine of <!--del_lnk--> transubstantiation, but also denounce certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church as &quot;superstitious and idolatrous&quot;) and receive <!--del_lnk--> communion under the auspices of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. James refused to perform both actions, instead choosing to relinquish the post of Lord High Admiral. His conversion to Catholicism was now openly known.<p>Charles II opposed the conversion, ordering that James&#39; children be raised as Protestants. Nevertheless, in 1673, he allowed James (whose first wife had died in 1671) to marry the Catholic <!--del_lnk--> Mary of Modena. Many English people, distrustful of Catholicism, regarded the new Duchess of York as an agent of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a>.<p>In 1677, James attempted to appease Protestants by allowing his daughter, Mary, to marry the Protestant Prince of Orange, <a href="../../wp/w/William_III_of_England.htm" title="William III of England">William III</a> (who was also his nephew). Despite the concession, fears of a Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failed pregnancies of Charles II&#39;s wife, <!--del_lnk--> Catherine of Braganza. A defrocked Anglican clergyman, <!--del_lnk--> Titus Oates, falsely spoke of a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Popish Plot&quot; to kill Charles and put the Duke of York on the Throne. The fabricated plot caused a wave of anti-Catholic hysteria to sweep across the nation. On the orders of the King, the Duke of York left England for <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>. In 1680, he was appointed Lord High Commissioner of Scotland and took up his residence at the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of Holyroodhouse in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="background: #FFFFFF; border: 1px solid #8888AA; border-collapse: collapse; float: right; font-size: 95%; margin: 0px 0px 8px 8px; padding: none; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 240px;">

      <p>In England, attempts were made by Anthony Ashley Cooper, the <a href="../../wp/e/Earl_of_Shaftesbury.htm" title="Earl of Shaftesbury">Earl of Shaftesbury</a>, a former government minister, and now the leading enemy of James and a Catholic succession, to have him excluded from the line of succession. Some even proposed that the Crown go to Charles II&#39;s illegitimate son, <!--del_lnk--> James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. When, in 1679, the <!--del_lnk--> Exclusion Bill was in danger of passing, Charles II dissolved the English Parliament. (The Exclusion Bill crisis contributed to the development of the English two-party system; the <!--del_lnk--> Whigs were those who supported the Bill, whilst the <!--del_lnk--> Tories were those who opposed it.) Two further <!--del_lnk--> Parliaments were elected in 1680 and 1681, but were dissolved for the same reason.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Rye House Plot of 1683, a Protestant conspiracy to assassinate both Charles and the Duke of York, failed utterly; it increased popular sympathy for the King and his brother. James once again found himself influential in government, and his brother restored him to the office of Lord High Admiral in 1684.<p><a id="Reign" name="Reign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reign</span></h2>

      <p>Charles died <i>sine prole legitima</i> (without legitimate offspring) in 1685, converting to Roman Catholicism on his deathbed. He was succeeded by his brother, who reigned in England and Ireland as James II, and in Scotland as James VII. James was crowned at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on <!--del_lnk--> April 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1685. At first, there was little overt opposition to the new Sovereign. The new Parliament which assembled in May 1685 seemed favourable to James, agreeing to grant him a large income.<p>James, however, faced the <!--del_lnk--> Monmouth Rebellion (led by Charles II&#39;s illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth). <!--del_lnk--> James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth declared himself King on <!--del_lnk--> June 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1685, but was afterwards defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sedgemoor. Monmouth was executed at the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a> soon afterwards. The king&#39;s judges&mdash;most notably, <!--del_lnk--> George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys (the &quot;Hanging Judge&quot;)&mdash;punished the rebels brutally. Judge Jeffreys&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Bloody Assizes provoked little comment at the time and were seen by many as an appropriate response to an armed rebellion.<p>To protect himself from further rebellions, James sought to establish a large standing army. By putting Roman Catholics in charge of several regiments, the King was drawn into a conflict with Parliament. Parliament was prorogued in November 1685, never to meet again during James&#39;s brief reign.<p>Religious tension intensified from 1686. James controversially allowed Roman Catholics to occupy the highest offices of the Kingdom, and received at his court the <!--del_lnk--> papal nuncio, the first representative from Rome to London since the reign of <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_England.htm" title="Mary I of England">Mary I</a>. James&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit confessor, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Petre, was a particular object of Protestant ire and when James ordered the suspension of several Anglicans from political office, including <!--del_lnk--> Henry Compton, the anti-Catholic <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of London, he lost much of his previous support.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of Indulgence (1687), also known as the Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, James suspended laws punishing Roman Catholics and Protestant dissenters. (It is unclear if James issued the Declaration to gain the political support of the dissenters, or if he was truly committed to the principle of <!--del_lnk--> freedom of religion.) The King also provoked opposition by his policies relating to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oxford. He offended Anglicans by allowing Catholics to hold important positions in <!--del_lnk--> Christ Church and <!--del_lnk--> University College, two of Oxford&#39;s largest colleges. Even more unpopularly, he dismissed the Protestant Fellows of <!--del_lnk--> Magdalen College, appointing Roman Catholics including Bishop Parker in their place.<p><a id="Glorious_Revolution" name="Glorious_Revolution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Glorious Revolution</span></h2>

      <p>In April 1688, James re-issued the Declaration of Indulgence, subsequently ordering Anglican clergymen to read it in their churches. When the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> <!--del_lnk--> William Sancroft and six other bishops (known as the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Bishops) submitted a petition requesting the reconsideration of the King&#39;s religious policies, they were arrested and tried for <!--del_lnk--> seditious libel. Public alarm increased with the birth of a Catholic son and heir, James Francis Edward, to Queen Mary in June, 1688. (Some falsely charged that the son was &quot;suppositious&quot;, having been substituted for a stillborn child.) Threatened by a Catholic dynasty, several influential Protestants entered into negotiations with William, Prince of Orange, who was James&#39;s son-in-law and nephew.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1688, a group of Protestant nobles, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Immortal Seven, requested the Prince of Orange to come to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> with an army. By September, it had become clear that William sought to invade. James refused the assistance of Louis XIV, fearing that the English would oppose French intervention. Furthermore, he believed that his own army would be adequate. But the King was too complacent; when William arrived on <!--del_lnk--> November 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1688, many Protestant officers defected and joined William. His own daughter, <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a>, left the court, leading to considerable anguish on the part of the King. On <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1688, James attempted to flee to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, first throwing the <!--del_lnk--> Great Seal of the Realm into the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>. He was, however, caught in <!--del_lnk--> Kent. Having no desire to make James a martyr, the Prince of Orange let him escape on <!--del_lnk--> December 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1688. James was received by Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a generous pension.<p>William convened an irregular <!--del_lnk--> Convention Parliament. (The procedure of calling a Convention Parliament had been previously used when succession to the Throne was unclear; it was a Convention Parliament which restored Charles II to the Throne following the English Civil War and republican Commonwealth.) The Convention declared, on <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1689, that James&#39;s attempt to flee on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1688 constituted an abdication of the government, and that the Throne had then become vacant (instead of passing to James II&#39;s son, James Francis Edward). Essentially, this was a Deposition Parliament. James&#39;s daughter Mary was declared Queen; she was to rule jointly with her husband William III. The Scottish Estates followed suit on <!--del_lnk--> April 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1689.<p>William and Mary subsequently granted their assent to an Act commonly referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Bill of Rights. The Act confirmed the earlier Declaration of Right, in which the Convention Parliament had declared that James&#39;s flight constituted an abdication, and that William III and Mary II were to be King and Queen. The Bill of Rights also charged James II with abusing his power; amongst other things, it criticised the suspension of the Test Acts, the prosecution of the Seven Bishops for merely petitioning the Crown, the establishment of a standing army and the imposition of cruel punishments. The Bill also stipulated that no Catholic would henceforth be permitted to ascend to the English throne, nor could any English monarch marry a Catholic. The Act, furthermore, settled the question of succession to the Crown. First in the line of succession were the children of William and Mary (if any), to be followed by the Princess Anne and her children, and finally by the children of William by any subsequent marriage.<p><a id="Later_years" name="Later_years"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later years</span></h2>
      <p>With a French army on his side, James landed in Ireland in March 1689. The Irish Parliament did not follow the example of the English Parliament; it declared that James remained King. At James&#39; urging, the Irish Parliament passed an Act for Liberty of Conscience which granted religious freedom to all Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. The king was, however, defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Boyne by William III on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1690.<p>In <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, James was allowed to live in the royal ch&acirc;teau of <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Germain-en-Laye. An attempt was made to restore him to the Throne by assassinating William III in 1696, but the plot failed. Louis XIV&#39;s offer to have James elected <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">King of Poland</a> in the same year was rejected, for James feared that acceptance of the Polish Crown might (in the minds of the English People) render him incapable of being King of England. Thereafter, Louis ceased to offer assistance to James.<p>During his last years, James lived as an austere penitent. He died of a <!--del_lnk--> brain hemorrhage on <!--del_lnk--> 16 September 1701 at <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Germain-en-Laye. His body was laid in a coffin at the Chapel of Saint Edmund in the Church of the English Benedictines in the Rue St. Jacques, Paris. However, during the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, his body was desecrated and the remains were lost.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>James&#39;s younger daughter <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Anne of Great Britain">Anne</a> succeeded to the throne when William III died in 1702. (Mary II had died in 1694.) The <!--del_lnk--> Act of Settlement 1701 provided that, if the line of succession established in the Bill of Rights were to be extinguished, then the Crown would go to a German cousin, <!--del_lnk--> Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and to her Protestant heirs. Thus, when Anne died in 1714 (less than two months after the death of Sophia), the Crown was inherited by <a href="../../wp/g/George_I_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="George I of Great Britain">George I</a>, Sophia&#39;s son, the Elector of Hanover and Anne&#39;s second cousin.<p>The son of James II, <!--del_lnk--> James Francis Edward Stuart (known to his supporters as &quot;James III and VIII&quot; and to his opponents as the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;), took up the Jacobite cause. He led a rising in Scotland in 1715 shortly after George I&#39;s accession, but was defeated. Further risings were also defeated and since the rising of 1745 led by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Edward Stuart, no serious attempt to restore the Stuart heir has been made, although some individuals still adhere to the philosophy of Jacobitism.<p>James Francis Edward died in 1766, when he was succeeded by his eldest son, <!--del_lnk--> Charles Edward Stuart (known to his supporters as &quot;Charles III&quot; and to his opponents as the &quot;Young Pretender&quot;). Charles in turn was succeeded by his younger brother <!--del_lnk--> Henry Benedict Stuart, a <!--del_lnk--> cardinal of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>. Henry was the last of James II&#39;s legitimate descendants. At his death in 1807 the Jacobite claim devolved upon the senior descendant of King <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>, King <!--del_lnk--> Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. Presently, James II&#39;s heir is <!--del_lnk--> Franz, Duke of Bavaria. Although the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Bavaria has not claimed the throne, he is recognised by Jacobites as &quot;Francis II&quot;.<p><a id="Style_and_arms" name="Style_and_arms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Style and arms</span></h2>
      <p>The official style of James II was &quot;James the Second, by the Grace of God, <!--del_lnk--> King of England, <!--del_lnk--> Scotland, <!--del_lnk--> France and <!--del_lnk--> Ireland, <!--del_lnk--> Defender of the Faith, etc.&quot; (The <!--del_lnk--> claim to France was only nominal, and was asserted by every English King from <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III</a> to <a href="../../wp/g/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a>, regardless of the amount of French territory actually controlled.) His <a href="../../wp/h/Heraldry.htm" title="Heraldry">arms</a> as King were: <i>Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for <!--del_lnk--> England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for <!--del_lnk--> Ireland)</i>. James was created &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy&quot; by King Louis XIV of France, December 31, 1660. This was a few months after the restoration of his brother <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> to the English and Irish thrones (Charles II had been crowned King of Scotland in 1651), and was probably done as a political gesture of support for James - since his brother also would have claimed the title &quot;Duke of Normandy.&quot;<p><a id="Ancestors" name="Ancestors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ancestors</span></h2>
