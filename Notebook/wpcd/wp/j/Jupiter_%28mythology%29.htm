      <p>In <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman mythology</a>, <b>Jupiter</b> (<i>Iuppiter</i> in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>) held the same role as <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> in the Greek pantheon. He was called <b>Juppiter Optimus Maximus <!--del_lnk--> Soter</b> (Jupiter Best, Greatest, Saviour) as the patron deity of the <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Roman state</a>, in charge of laws and social order. He was the chief god of the <a href="../../wp/c/Capitoline_Triad.htm" title="Capitoline Triad">Capitoline Triad</a>, with <!--del_lnk--> Juno and <!--del_lnk--> Minerva.<p><i>Jupiter</i> is a vocative compound derived from archaic Latin <i>Iovis</i> and <i>pater</i> (Latin for <i>father</i>), this was also used as the nominative case. <b>Jove</b> is an English formation based on <i>Iov-</i>, the stem of oblique cases of the Latin name. Its <!--del_lnk--> Vedic equivalent is <!--del_lnk--> Dyaus Pita.<p>The name of the god was also adopted as the name of the planet <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter, and was the original namesake of the weekday that would come to be known in English as Thursday (the etymological root can be seen in various Romance languages, including (<!--del_lnk--> accusative <i>Iovem</i>, <!--del_lnk--> genitive <i>Iovis</i>, <!--del_lnk--> dative <i>Iovi</i> and <!--del_lnk--> ablative <i>Iove</i> - an irregular declension). Linguistic studies identify his name as deriving from the Indo-European compound *<i><!--del_lnk--> dy&#x113;us- p&#x259;ter-</i> (&quot;O Father God&quot;), the Indo-European deity from whom also derive the Germanic <!--del_lnk--> *Tiwaz (after whom Tuesday was named), the Greek <a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a>, and the French <i>jeudi</i>, Castilian <i>jueves</i>, Italian <i>gioved&igrave;</i> and Catalan <i>dijous</i>, all from Latin <i>Iovis Dies</i>, whereas English takes his Norse equivalent, <a href="../../wp/t/Thor.htm" title="Thor">Thor</a>).<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The largest <!--del_lnk--> temple in Rome was <!--del_lnk--> that of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the <!--del_lnk--> Capitoline Hill. Here he was worshipped alongside <!--del_lnk--> Juno and <!--del_lnk--> Minerva, forming the <b>Capitoline Triad</b>. Jupiter was also worshipped at Capitoline Hill in the form of a stone, known as <!--del_lnk--> Iuppiter Lapis or the <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter Stone, which was sworn upon as an oath stone. Temples to Juppiter Optimus Maximus or the Capitoline Triad as a whole were commonly built by the Romans at the centre of new cities in their colonies.<p>The building was begun by <!--del_lnk--> Tarquinius Priscus and completed by the last king of Rome, <!--del_lnk--> Tarquinius Superbus, although it was inaugurated, by a tradition recorded by the historians, on September 13, at the beginning of the Republican era (509 BC).<p>The temple building stands on a high podium with an entrance staircase to the front. On three of its sides it was probably surrounded by a colonnade, with another two rows of pillars drawn up in line with those on the fa&ccedil;ade of the deep <i><!--del_lnk--> pronaos</i> which precedes the three <!--del_lnk--> cellae, ranged side by side in the <!--del_lnk--> Etruscan manner, the central one being wider than the other two.<p>The surviving remains of the foundations and of the podium, most of which lie underneath <!--del_lnk--> Palazzo Caffarelli, are made up of enormous parallel sections of walling made in blocks of grey tufa-quadriga stone (<i>cappellaccio</i>) and bear witness to the sheer size of the surface area of the temple&#39;s base (about 55 x 60 m).<p>On the roof a terracotta auriga, made by the Etruscan artist Vulca of Veii in the 6th century BC, commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Tarquinius Superbus; it was replaced in 296 B.C., by a bronze one. The <!--del_lnk--> cult image, by Vulca, was of terracotta; its face was painted red on festival days (<!--del_lnk--> Ovid, <i><!--del_lnk--> Fasti</i>, 1.201f). Beneath the cella were the <i>favissae</i>, or underground passages, in which were stored the old statues that had fallen from the roof, and various dedicatory gifts.<p>The temple was rebuilt in marble after fires had worked total destruction in 83 BC, when the cult image was lost, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sibylline Books kept in a stone chest. Fires followed in 69 AD, when the Capitol was stormed by the supporters of <!--del_lnk--> Vitellius and in 80 AD.<p>In front of the steps was the altar of Jupiter (<i>ara Iovis</i>). The large square in front of the temple (the Area Capitolina) featured a number of temples dedicated to minor divinities, in addition to other religious buildings, statues and trophies.<p>Its dilapidation began in the fifth century, when <!--del_lnk--> Stilicho carried off the gold -plated doors and <!--del_lnk--> Narses removed many of the statues, in 571 AD.<p><a id="In_language" name="In_language"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In language</span></h2>
      <p>It was once believed that the Roman god Jupiter (<a href="../../wp/z/Zeus.htm" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> in <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>) was in charge of cosmic <!--del_lnk--> Justice, and in ancient Rome, people swore to Jove in their courts of law, which lead to the common expression &quot;By Jove!&quot;, still used as an <!--del_lnk--> archaism today. In addition, &quot;Jovial&quot; is a medium-common adjective still used to describe people who are jolly, optimistic, and buoyant in <!--del_lnk--> temperament.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_%28mythology%29&quot;</div>
