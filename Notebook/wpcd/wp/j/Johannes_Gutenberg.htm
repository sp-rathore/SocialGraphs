      <p><b>Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg</b> (c. <!--del_lnk--> 1398 &ndash; c. <!--del_lnk--> February 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1468) was a <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">German</a> goldsmith and <!--del_lnk--> inventor credited with inventing <!--del_lnk--> movable type <!--del_lnk--> printing in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> (ca. <!--del_lnk--> 1450). His major work, the <!--del_lnk--> Gutenberg Bible, also known as the 42-line bible, has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.<p>Although movable type was known in <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> in the 13th century, Gutenberg&#39;s printing technology was most likely an independent invention. Among Gutenberg&#39;s specific contributions were the design of movable type, the invention of a process for making such type, the use of oil-based ink, and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the screw olive and wine presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system. Gutenberg may have been familiar with printing, it is claimed that he had worked on copper <!--del_lnk--> engravings with an artist known as the <i>Master of the Playing Cards</i>. Gutenberg&#39;s method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a <!--del_lnk--> type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type.<p>The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the <!--del_lnk--> woodblock printing in use for two centuries and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg&#39;s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and is considered a key factor in the European <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. Gutenberg remains a towering figure in the popular image; in 1999, the <!--del_lnk--> A&amp;E Network ranked Gutenberg #1 on their &quot;People of the Millennium&quot; countdown.<p>

      <p>Gutenberg was born in the German city of <!--del_lnk--> Mainz, the youngest son of the upper-class merchant Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, and his second wife Else Wyrich, daughter of a shopkeeper. According to some accounts Friele was a goldsmith for the bishop at Mainz, but most likely he was involved in the cloth trade. Gutenberg&#39;s year of birth is not known; it was certainly between 1394 and 1404, most likely around 1400.<p>At the time, patricians in Mainz were often named after the houses they owned, and around 1427, the name <i>zu Gudenberg</i>, after the family house in Mainz, is documented for the first time. This house had previously been known as &quot;Judenberg,&quot; Jewish Hill. According to historian John Man, &quot;In the 1282 pogrom, fifty-four Jewish properties were abandoned and were grabbed by the rich and powerful. It seems that the Gutenberg house fell to the archbishop&#39;s treasurers... It was later acquired by the great-great-grandfather of our inventor and stayed in the family.&quot;<p>In 1411, there there was an uprising in Mainz against the patricians, and more than a hundred families were forced to leave. The Gutenbergs may have moved to <!--del_lnk--> Eltville am Rhein (Alta Villa), where his mother had an inherited estate. He may have studied at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Erfurt, where there is a record of a student in 1419 named Johannes de Alta villa. Following his father&#39;s death in <!--del_lnk--> 1419, he is mentioned in the inheritance proceedings.<p>Nothing is known of Gutenberg&#39;s life for the next fifteen years, but in March 1434, a letter by him indicates that he was living in <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg, where he had some relatives on his mother&#39;s side. He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg militia. In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown. In 1436/37 his name also comes up in court in connection with a broken promise of marriage to a woman from Strasbourg, Ennelin. Whether the marriage actually took place is not recorded.<p><a id="Printing_Press" name="Printing_Press"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Printing Press</span></h3>
      <p>Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a misadventure making mirrors for pilgrims to <a href="../../wp/a/Aachen.htm" title="Aachen">Aachen</a>, and when the question of repaying the money came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a &quot;secret&quot;. It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with movable type. Legend has it that the idea came to him &quot;like a ray of light&quot;.<p>At least up to 1444, he lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogust suburb. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, presumably for a printing press.<p>By 1450, the press was most likely in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender <!--del_lnk--> Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders. <!--del_lnk--> Peter Schoeffer, who became Fust&#39;s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Shoeffer had worked as a scribe in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and designed some of the first typefaces.<p>Gutenberg&#39;s workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profitmaking enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of <!--del_lnk--> indulgences for the church, documented from 1454-1455.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1455 Gutenberg brought out the <!--del_lnk--> 42-line Bible, of which about 180 were printed, on paper and <!--del_lnk--> vellum.<p><a id="Court_Case" name="Court_Case"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Court Case</span></h3>
      <p>Sometime in 1455, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of embezzling funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg&#39;s debt now exceeded 2000 guilders. Fust sued at the the archbishop&#39;s court. A November <!--del_lnk--> 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a &quot;project of the books&quot; the funds of which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favour of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.<p>Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupted, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a bible in <!--del_lnk--> Bamberg around 1459, for which he at least supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly literature. It is also possible that the large <!--del_lnk--> Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 744 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, may have been executed in his workshop.<p>Meanwhile, the Fust-Schoeffer shop were the first to bring out a book with the printer&#39;s name and date, the <!--del_lnk--> Mainz Psalter of August <!--del_lnk--> 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.<p><a id="Later_life" name="Later_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later life</span></h3>
      <p>In 1462, during a conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Adolf von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to Eltville where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechterm&uuml;nze.<p>In January 1465, Gutenberg&#39;s achievements were recognized and he was given the title <i>Hofmann</i> (gentleman of the court) by Adolf von Nassau. This honour included a stipend, an annual court outfit, as well as 2180 liters of grain and 2000 liters of wine tax-free. It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.<p>Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franziskanerkirche, Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg&#39;s grave is lost.<p>In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleons biography of famous Germans.<p><a id="Gutenberg.27s_printed_books" name="Gutenberg.27s_printed_books"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gutenberg&#39;s printed books</span></h2>
      <p>Between 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, but details are not known; his texts did not bear the printer&#39;s name or date, so attribution is possible only through external references. Certainly several church documents including a papal letter and two indulgences were printed. Some printed editions of <i>Ars Minor</i>, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by <!--del_lnk--> Aelius Donatus may have been printed by Gutenberg; these have been dated either 1451-1452 or 1455.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1455 (possibly starting 1454), Gutenberg brought out copies of a beautifully executed folio <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> (<i>Biblia Sacra</i>), with 42 lines on each page. The pages of the books were not bound, and the date 1455 is documented on the spine by the binder for a copy bound in Paris.<p>The Bible sold for 30 florins each, which was roughly three years&#39; wages for an average clerk. Nonetheless, it was significantly cheaper than a handwritten Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing the text portions, each book was hand illustrated to mimic the elegant work of scribes.<div class="thumb tright">

As of 2003, the Gutenberg Bible census includes 11 complete copies on <!--del_lnk--> vellum, 1 copy of the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament only on vellum, 48 substantially complete integral copies on <!--del_lnk--> paper, with another divided copy on paper, and an illuminated page (the Bagford fragment). The text lacks modern features such as pagination, word spacing, indentations, and paragraph breaks.<p>Another, 36-line edition of the Bible was also printed, most likely some years after the first edition, although there is speculation that this may have been an earlier work.<p><a id="Gutenberg.27s_method_of_printing_with_movable_type" name="Gutenberg.27s_method_of_printing_with_movable_type"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gutenberg&#39;s method of printing with movable type</span></h2>
      <p>Gutenberg&#39;s early printing process, and what tests he may have made with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed six pages at a time, and would have required 100,000 pieces of type&mdash;making the type alone would take two man years.  Setting each page would take at least half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, hanging up the sheets, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg&ndash;Fust shop might have employed about 25 craftsmen.<p>Gutenberg&#39;s technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.<p>In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into the soft metal copper, creating a mould or <i>matrix</i>. This is then placed into a holder, and cast by filling with hot type-metal, which cooled down to create a piece of type. The matrix can now be reused to create hundreds of identical letters, so that the same type appearing anywhere in the book will appear similar, giving rise to the growth of <!--del_lnk--> fonts. Subsequently, these letters are placed on a rack and inked; using a press, many hundred copies can be made. The letters can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of &#39;movable type&#39;. (For details, see <!--del_lnk--> Typography).<p><a id="Was_the_type_produced_by_punches_and_copper_matrices.3F" name="Was_the_type_produced_by_punches_and_copper_matrices.3F"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Was the type produced by punches and copper matrices?</span></h3>
      <p>Such is the process that has been widely attributed to have been Gutenberg&#39;s invention, but it appears from recent evidence that Gutenberg&#39;s actual process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been identical, within some variation possibly due to inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg&#39;s printed Bibles were quite irregular.<p>In 2001, the physicist Blaise Aguera y Arcas and <a href="../../wp/p/Princeton_University.htm" title="Princeton University">Princeton</a> librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of the Gutenberg Bible in the <!--del_lnk--> Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the Gutenberg 42-line Bible  . The irregularities in Gutenberg&#39;s type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, made it clear that the variations couldn&#39;t have come from either ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, made for only one conclusion: that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. They hypothesized that the method used involved using the punch to make a mould, but that the process of taking the type out would disturb the mould, resulting in non-identical type.<p>Thus, they feel that &quot;the decisive factor for the birth of typography&quot;, the use of reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a more progressive process than was previously thought (also see Adams 91  Chapter 4). They suggest that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until 20 years later, in the 1470s.<p><a id="Other_hypotheses" name="Other_hypotheses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other hypotheses</span></h3>
      <p>The 19th c. printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. However, this appears unlikely given the uniformity of the bulk of the type he used.<p>It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.<p><a id="Claims_of_other_European_inventors" name="Claims_of_other_European_inventors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Claims of other European inventors</span></h3>
      <p>A 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from <!--del_lnk--> Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and cast-able metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. There is even less evidence for other claimants such as <!--del_lnk--> Panfilo Castaldi.<p><a id="Was_Gutenberg_influenced_by_East_Asian_printing.3F" name="Was_Gutenberg_influenced_by_East_Asian_printing.3F"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Was Gutenberg influenced by East Asian printing?</span></h2>
      <dl>
       <dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Since the use of printing from movable type arose in East Asia well before it did in Europe, it is relevant to ask whether Gutenberg may have been influenced, directly or indirectly, by the Korean or Chinese discoveries of movable type printing, or their earlier discoveries of block printing.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Needham&#39;s <i>Science and Civilization in China</i> a chapter on <i>Paper and Printing</i> suggests that &quot;European block printers must not only have seen Chinese samples, but perhaps had been taught by missionaries or others who had learned these un-European methods from Chinese printers during their residence in China.&quot; <p>Movable types made from clay were introduced in China by <!--del_lnk--> Bi Sheng, between <!--del_lnk--> 1041 to <!--del_lnk--> 1048. Cast metal movable type was introduced during the <!--del_lnk--> Goryeo dynasty of Korea and is associated with Chae Yun-eui (around <!--del_lnk--> 1230). A set of ritual books, <i>Sangjong Gogeum Yemun</i> were printed with the movable metal type in 1234. The oldest surviving book printed with movable type is from Korea, dated 1377.<p>By the 1300s the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol Empire</a> stretched from Korea to Damascus and Kiev, and movable type printing radiated westward out of Korea. Among the people known to have used movable type are the <!--del_lnk--> Uighurs of Central Asia, whose written script was adopted for the Mongol script. There has been considerable conjecture whether some news of this technology, if not printed samples, had reached Europe, e.g. in this article by Tom Christensen&nbsp;:<blockquote>
       <p>What is certain, however, is that printing with movable wooden type is documented from the eleventh century; that printing with movable metal type had been an active enterprise in Korea since 1234; that other printing technologies had Asian origins and were subsequently transmitted to the West; that a single empire (the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol</a> khanates) stretched from Korea to Europe through much of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, facilitating cross-cultural exchange across a large region; that there was considerable <!--del_lnk--> East-West travel, contact, and exchange during this period; that the written record of such contacts records only a fraction of what actually occurred; and that there was awareness of Asian printing in Europe in the centuries before Gutenberg....[but] as Eva Hanebutt-Benz properly observes, &ldquo;We do not know if Johannes Gutenberg had any kind of knowledge of the fact that long before his invention printing with moveable type was done in East-Asia.&rdquo;</blockquote>
      <p>However, there were key differences between the European technologies and that in Korea. Gutenberg used a press, unlike in East Asia, and used matrices (type holding frames), oil-based inks, and other devices that were significantly different. Whatever the facts regarding Asian influences in this invention, there can be no doubt about Gutenberg&#39;s genius in putting together the technologies that eventually went on to fuel the European <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a>.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

      <p>Although Gutenberg was financially unsuccessful in his lifetime, the printing technologies spread quickly, and news and books began to travel across Europe much faster than before. It fed the growing <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later <!--del_lnk--> scientific revolution.<p>The capital of printing in Europe shifted to <!--del_lnk--> Venice, where visionary printers like <!--del_lnk--> Aldus Manutius ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing, but this may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade, and also the dispersal of Gutenberg&#39;s compositors and typefounders (like <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Jenson) after the sack of Mainz in 1462.<p>Printing was also a factor in the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation: <a href="../../wp/m/Martin_Luther.htm" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> found that the <!--del_lnk--> 95 Theses, which he posted on the door of his church, were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he also issued <!--del_lnk--> broadsheets outlining his anti-<!--del_lnk--> indulgences position (ironically, indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). The broadsheet evolved into <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> and defined the <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">mass media</a> we know today.<p>In the decades after Gutenberg, many conservative patrons looked down on cheap printed books; books produced by hand were considered more desirable. At one point the <!--del_lnk--> papal court debated a policy of requiring printing presses to obtain a license, but this could not be decreed.<p>Today there is a large <!--del_lnk--> antique market for the earliest printed objects. Books printed prior to 1500 are known as <i><!--del_lnk--> incunabulum</i>.<p>There are many statues of Gutenberg in Germany, including the famous one by <!--del_lnk--> Bertel Thorvaldsen (1837) in Mainz, home to the <!--del_lnk--> Gutenberg Museum and the eponymous <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz. The Gutenberg Galaxy and <!--del_lnk--> Project Gutenberg also commemorate Gutenberg&#39;s name.
