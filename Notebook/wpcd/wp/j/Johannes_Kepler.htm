      <p>Kepler was born on <!--del_lnk--> December 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1571 in the <!--del_lnk--> Free Imperial City of <!--del_lnk--> Weil der Stadt (now part of the <!--del_lnk--> Stuttgart Region in the German state of <!--del_lnk--> Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, 30 km west of Stuttgart&#39;s centre). His grandfather had been Lord Mayor of that town, but by the time Johannes was born, the Kepler family fortunes were in decline. His father earned a precarious living as a <!--del_lnk--> mercenary, and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the war in the Netherlands. His mother, an inn-keeper&#39;s daughter, was a healer and herbalist who was later tried for <!--del_lnk--> witchcraft. Whether Kepler was born prematurely is disputable. But it is indisputable that he was frequently ill. Despite his ill health, he was precociously brilliant. As a child, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather&#39;s inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.<p>He was introduced to astronomy/astrology at an early age, and he developed a love for it that would span his entire life. At age five, he observed the <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">Comet</a> of 1577, writing that he &quot;was taken by [his] mother to a high place to look at it.&quot; At age nine, he observed another astronomical event, the <a href="../../wp/l/Lunar_eclipse.htm" title="Lunar eclipse">Lunar eclipse</a> of 1580, recording that he remembered being &quot;called outdoors&quot; to see it and that the moon &quot;appeared quite red&quot;. However, childhood <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> left him with weak vision, limiting him to the mathematical rather than observational aspects of astronomy.<p>In 1589, after moving through grammar school, Latin school, and after passing the &quot;Landexamen&quot; (state-wide examination), Kepler attended the lower and higher seminary in the scholarship-based education system of the Duchy of <!--del_lnk--> W&uuml;rttemberg. Kepler enrolled in the <!--del_lnk--> University of T&uuml;bingen as a theology student, where he proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skillful <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrologer</a>. Under the instruction of <!--del_lnk--> Michael Maestlin, he learned both the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic system and the <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">Copernican system</a>; he became a Copernican at that time, defending <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentrism</a> from both a theoretical and theological perspective in student debates. Despite his desire to become a minister, near the end of his studies, Kepler was recommended for a position as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the Protestant school in <!--del_lnk--> Graz, <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>. He accepted the position in April 1594, at the age of 23.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In Graz, Kepler began developing an original theory of cosmology based on the Copernican system, which was published in 1596 as <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>&mdash;<i><!--del_lnk--> The Sacred Mystery of the Cosmos</i>.<p>In April 1597, Kepler married Barbara M&uuml;ller. She died in 1611 and was outlived by two of Johannes&#39;s children and one by an earlier marriage.<p>In December 1599, <a href="../../wp/t/Tycho_Brahe.htm" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> wrote to Kepler, inviting Kepler to assist him at <!--del_lnk--> Ben&aacute;tky nad Jizerou outside <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a>. Pressured to leave Graz by increasingly strict <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation policies restricting the religious practices and political rights of <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, Kepler joined Tycho in 1600. After Tycho&#39;s death in 1601, Kepler was appointed Imperial Mathematician in his place, a post he would retain through the reigns of three <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg Emperors (from November 1601 to 1630).<p><a id="Imperial_Mathematician_in_Prague_.281601.E2.80.931612.29" name="Imperial_Mathematician_in_Prague_.281601.E2.80.931612.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Imperial Mathematician in Prague (1601&ndash;1612)</span></h3>
      <p>As Imperial Mathematician, Kepler inherited Tycho&#39;s responsibility for the Emperor&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> horoscopes as well as the commission to produce the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rudolphine Tables</i>. Working with Tycho&#39;s extensive collection of highly accurate observational data, Kepler also set out to refine his earlier theories but was forced to abandon them. Instead, he began developing the first astronomical system to use non-circular orbits; it was completed in 1606 and published in 1609 as <i><!--del_lnk--> Astronomia Nova</i>&mdash;<i>New Astronomy</i>. <i>Astronomia Nova</i> contained what would become the first and second <!--del_lnk--> laws of planetary motion.<p>In October 1604, Kepler observed the <!--del_lnk--> supernova which was subsequently named <!--del_lnk--> Kepler&#39;s Star (a term which may also refer to the <!--del_lnk--> stellated octahedron). In 1611, Kepler published (as a letter to a friend) a monograph on the origins of <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snowflakes</a>, the first known work on the subject. He correctly theorized that their hexagonal nature was due to cold, but did not ascertain a physical cause for this. In January 1612, the Emperor died. To escape the growing religious tension in Prague, Kepler took the post of Provincial Mathematician in <!--del_lnk--> Linz.<p><a id="Teaching_in_Linz_and_final_years_.281612.E2.80.931630.29" name="Teaching_in_Linz_and_final_years_.281612.E2.80.931630.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Teaching in Linz and final years (1612&ndash;1630)</span></h3>
      <p>In 1615, Kepler married Susanna Ruettinger, with whom he would have several children.<p>In 1617, Kepler&#39;s mother Katharina was accused of being a witch in Leonberg. Beginning in August 1620 she was imprisoned for fourteen months. Thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler, she was released in October 1621 after failed attempts to convict her. However, she was subjected to <i>territio verbalis</i>, a graphic description of the <!--del_lnk--> torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess. Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work (on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Rudolphine Tables</i> and a multi-volume astronomy textbook) to focus on his &quot;harmonic theory&quot;. The result, published in 1619 as <i><!--del_lnk--> Harmonices Mundi</i> (&quot;Harmony of the Worlds&quot;) contained the third law of planetary motion.<p>Kepler completed the last of seven volumes of his textbook <i>Epitome of Copernican Astronomy</i> in 1621, which brought together and extended his previous work and would become very influential in the acceptance of the Copernican system over the next century. In 1627 he completed the <i>Rudolphine Tables</i>, which provided accurately calculated future positions of the planets and allowed the prediction of rare astronomical events.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1630 Kepler died of a fever in <!--del_lnk--> Regensburg. In 1632, only two years after his death, his grave was demolished by the <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> army in the <!--del_lnk--> Thirty Years&#39; War. Kepler had incidentally composed the epitaph for his own tombstone, which read:<dl>
       <dd>I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure,<br /> Sky-bound was the mind, earth-bound the body rests</dl>
      <p><a id="Work" name="Work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Work</span></h2>
      <p>Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, while there was a strong division between astronomy/astrology (a branch of <!--del_lnk--> mathematics within the <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts) and <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> (a branch of the more prestigious discipline of <!--del_lnk--> philosophy). He also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, such that the basis for many of his most important contributions was essentially theological (Barker &amp; Goldstein 2001).<p>For instance, Kepler was explicit about the intellectual safeguards that, in his view, the Christian faith provided for scientific speculation. In connection with the apriorism of the world view of antiquity (a good example is the Platonic dictum <i><!--del_lnk--> Ex nihilo nihil fit</i>&mdash;nothing is made from nothing), he wrote: &quot;Christian religion has put up some fences around false speculation in order that error may not rush headlong&quot; (Introduction to Book IV of <i>Epitome astronomae copernicanae</i>, c1620, in <i>Werke</i> Vol. VII p. 254).<p>Kepler was a <!--del_lnk--> Pythagorean mystic. He considered mathematical relationships to be at the base of all nature, and all creation to be an integrated whole. This was in contrast to the <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Platonic</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotelian</a> notion that the Earth was fundamentally different from the rest of the universe, being composed of different substances and with different natural laws applying. In his attempt to discover universal laws, Kepler applied terrestrial physics to celestial bodies; famously, his effort produced the three Laws of Planetary Motion. Kepler was also convinced that celestial bodies influence terrestrial events. One result of this belief was his correct assessment of the moon&#39;s role in generating the <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tides</a>, years before Galileo&#39;s incorrect formulation. Another was his belief that <i>someday</i> it would be possible to develop a &quot;scientific astrology&quot;, despite his general disdain for most of the astrology of his time.<p><a id="Scientific_work" name="Scientific_work"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Scientific work</span></h3>

      <p>Kepler inherited from <a href="../../wp/t/Tycho_Brahe.htm" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> a wealth of the most accurate raw data ever collected on the positions of the <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>. The difficulty was to make sense of it. The orbital motions of the other planets are viewed from the vantage point of the Earth, which is itself orbiting the sun. As shown in the example below, this can cause the other planets to appear to move in strange loops. Kepler concentrated on trying to understand the orbit of <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a>, but he had to know the orbit of the Earth accurately first. In order to do this, he needed a surveyor&#39;s baseline. In a stroke of pure genius, he used Mars and the Sun as his baseline, since without knowing the <i>actual orbit</i> of Mars, he knew that it would be in the same place in its orbit at times separated by its orbital period. Thus the orbital positions of the Earth could be computed, and from them the orbit of Mars. He was able to deduce his planetary laws without knowing the exact distances of the planets from the sun, since his geometrical analysis needed only the <i>ratios</i> of their solar distances.<p><a class="image" href="../../images/75/7515.png.htm" title="Image:Retrograde-motion-of-mars.png"><img alt="Image:Retrograde-motion-of-mars.png" height="467" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Retrograde-motion-of-mars.png" src="../../images/75/7515.png" width="580" /></a><p>Unlike Brahe, Kepler had accepted Copernicus&#39;s heliocentric model of the solar system. Starting from that framework, Kepler made twenty years of painstaking trial-and-error attempts at making some sense out of the data. He finally arrived at his <!--del_lnk--> three laws of planetary motion:<div class="thumb tright">

       <li><b>Kepler&#39;s elliptical orbit law</b>: The planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.<li><b>Kepler&#39;s equal-area law</b>: The line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time.<li><b>Kepler&#39;s law of periods</b>: The time required for a planet to orbit the sun, called its period, is proportional to the long axis of the ellipse raised to the 3/2 power. The constant of proportionality is the same for all the planets.</ol>
      <p>Using these laws, he was the first astronomer to successfully predict a <a href="../../wp/t/Transit_of_Venus.htm" title="Transit of Venus">transit of Venus</a> (for the year 1631). Kepler&#39;s laws were the first clear evidence in favour of the heliocentric model of the solar system, because they only came out to be so simple under the heliocentric assumption. Kepler, however, never discovered the deeper reasons for the laws, despite many years of what would now be considered non-scientific mystical speculation. <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a> eventually showed that the laws were a consequence of his <!--del_lnk--> laws of motion and <!--del_lnk--> law of universal gravitation.<p>Kepler first discovered his distance-cubed-over-time-squared (or &#39;third&#39;) law of planetary motion on March 8, 1618 but rejected the idea until May 15, 1618, when he verified his result. This result was published in his <i>Harmonices Mundi</i> (1619).<p><a id="Supernova_1604" name="Supernova_1604"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Supernova 1604</span></h4>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1604, Kepler observed that an exceptionally bright star had suddenly appeared in the constellation <!--del_lnk--> Ophiuchus. (It was first observed by several others on <!--del_lnk--> October 9.) The appearance of the star, which Kepler described in his book <i>De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii</i> (&quot;On the New Star in Ophiuchus&#39;s Foot&quot;), provided further evidence that the cosmos were not changeless; this was to influence Galileo Galilei in his argument. It has since been determined that the star was a <!--del_lnk--> supernova, the second in a generation, later called <!--del_lnk--> Kepler&#39;s Star or <!--del_lnk--> Supernova 1604. No further supernovae have been observed in the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>, though others outside our galaxy have been seen.<p><a id="Other_scientific_and_mathematical_work" name="Other_scientific_and_mathematical_work"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other scientific and mathematical work</span></h4>
      <p>Kepler also made fundamental investigations into <!--del_lnk--> combinatorics, geometrical optimization, and natural phenomena such as <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snowflakes</a>, always with an emphasis on form and design. He was also one of the founders of modern <!--del_lnk--> optics, defining for example <!--del_lnk--> antiprisms and the <!--del_lnk--> Keplerian telescope (see Kepler&#39;s books <i>Astronomiae Pars Optica</i>&mdash;i.a. theoretical explanation of the <!--del_lnk--> camera obscura&mdash;and <i>Dioptrice</i>). In addition, since he was the first to recognize the non-convex regular solids (such as the stellated dodecahedra), they are named <!--del_lnk--> Kepler solids in his honour.<p>Kepler also was in contact with <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Schickard, inventor of the first automatic <!--del_lnk--> calculator, whose letters to Kepler show how to use the machine for calculating astronomical tables.<p><a id="Mysticism_and_astrology" name="Mysticism_and_astrology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mysticism and astrology</span></h3>

      <p>Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion while trying to achieve the Pythagorean purpose of finding the harmony of the <!--del_lnk--> celestial spheres. In his cosmologic vision, it was not a coincidence that the number of <!--del_lnk--> perfect polyhedra was one less than the number of known <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>. Having embraced the Copernican system, he set out to prove that the distances from the planets to the sun were given by spheres inside perfect polyhedra, all of which were nested inside each other. The smallest orbit, that of Mercury, was the innermost sphere. He thereby identified the five <!--del_lnk--> Platonic solids with the five intervals between the six known planets (<a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Venus, <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth (planet)">Earth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mars, <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter, <!--del_lnk--> Saturn) and the five classical elements.<p>In 1596 Kepler published <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, or <i>The Sacred Mystery of the Cosmos</i>. Here is a selection explaining the relation between the planets and the Platonic solids:<dl>

Let us consider, therefore, the solids. We must first eliminate the irregular solids, because we are only concerned with orderly creation. There remain six bodies, the sphere and the five regular polyhedra. To the <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a> corresponds the heaven. On the other hand, the dynamic world is represented by the flat-faces solids. Of these there are five: when viewed as boundaries, however, these five determine six distinct things: hence the six planets that revolve about the sun. This is also the reason why there are but six planets&hellip;<i>MS</i></dl>

       <dd>I have further shown that the regular solids fall into two groups: three in one, and two in the other. To the larger group belongs, first of all, the <!--del_lnk--> Cube, then the <!--del_lnk--> Pyramid, and finally the <!--del_lnk--> Dodecahedron. To the second group belongs, first, the <!--del_lnk--> Octahedron, and second, the <!--del_lnk--> Icosahedron. That is why the most important portion of the universe, the Earth&mdash;where God&#39;s image is reflected in man&mdash;separates the two groups. For, as I have proved next, the solids of the first group must lie beyond the earth&#39;s orbit, and those of the second group within&hellip; Thus I was led to assign the Cube to Saturn, the Tetrahedron to Jupiter, the Dodecahedron to Mars, the Icosahedron to Venus, and the Octahedron to Mercury&hellip;</dl>
      <p>To emphasize his theory, Kepler envisaged an impressive model of the universe which shows a cube, inside a sphere, with a tetrahedron inscribed in it; another sphere inside it with a dodecahedron inscribed; a sphere with an icosahedron inscribed inside; and finally a sphere with an octahedron inscribed. Each of these celestial spheres had a planet embedded within them, and thus defined the planet&#39;s orbit.<p>In his 1619 book, <i><!--del_lnk--> Harmonice Mundi</i> or <i>Harmony of the Worlds</i>, as well as the aforementioned <i>Mysterium Cosmographicum</i>, he also made an association between the <!--del_lnk--> Platonic solids with the classical conception of the elements: the <!--del_lnk--> tetrahedron was the form of fire, the <!--del_lnk--> octahedron was that of air, the <!--del_lnk--> cube was earth, the <!--del_lnk--> icosahedron was water, and the <!--del_lnk--> dodecahedron was the cosmos as a whole or ether. There is some evidence this association was of ancient origin, as <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a> tells of one Timaeus of Locri who thought of the Universe as being enveloped by a gigantic dodecahedron while the other four solids represent the &quot;elements&quot; of fire, air, earth, and water.<p>His most significant achievements came from the realization that the planets moved in elliptical, not circular, orbits. This realization was a direct consequence of his failed attempt to fit the planetary orbits within polyhedra. Kepler&#39;s willingness to abandon his most cherished theory in the face of precise observational evidence also indicates that he had a very modern attitude to scientific research. Kepler also made great steps in trying to describe the motion of the planets by appealing to a force which resembled magnetism, which he believed emanated from the sun. Although he did not discover <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, he seems to have attempted to invoke the first empirical example of a <!--del_lnk--> universal law to explain the behaviour of both earthly and heavenly bodies.<p><a id="Astrology" name="Astrology"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Astrology</span></h4>
      <p>Kepler disdained astrologers who pandered to the tastes of the common man without knowledge of the <!--del_lnk--> abstract and general rules, but he saw compiling prognostications as a justified means of supplementing his meager income. Yet, it would be a mistake to take Kepler&#39;s astrological interests as merely pecuniary. As one historian, John North, put it, &quot;had he not been an astrologer he would very probably have failed to produce his planetary astronomy in the form we have it.&quot; However, Kepler&#39;s views on <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a> were quite unconventional for his time; he argued for a system of astrology based largely on <!--del_lnk--> harmonics, a type of &#39;planetary harmonics&#39; based almost entirely upon the <!--del_lnk--> astrological aspects and what has been traditionally been termed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> the music of the spheres.&quot; Information relating to his theories can be found in his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Harmonice Mundi</i>.<p>Kepler believed in astrology in the sense that he was convinced that astrological aspects physically and really affected <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> as well as the <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a> on Earth. He strove to unravel how and why that was the case and tried to put astrology on a surer footing, which resulted in the <i>On the More Certain Fundamentals of Astrology</i> (1601), in which, among other technical innovations, he was the first to propose a number of new aspects such as 18&deg;, 24&deg;, 30&deg; (semi-sextile), 36&deg;, 45&deg; (semi-square), 72&deg; (quintile), 108&deg;, 135&deg; (sesquiquadrate), 144&deg; (bi-quintile), and 150&deg; (<!--del_lnk--> quincunx). In <i>The Intervening Third Man</i>, or a warning to <!--del_lnk--> theologians, <!--del_lnk--> physicians and <!--del_lnk--> philosophers (1610), posing as a third man between the two extreme positions for and against astrology, Kepler advocated that a definite relationship between heavenly phenomena and earthly events could be established.<p>At least 800 horoscopes and <!--del_lnk--> natal charts drawn up by Kepler are still extant, several of himself and his family, accompanied by some unflattering remarks. As part of his duties as district mathematician to Graz, Kepler issued a prognostication for 1595 in which he forecast a <!--del_lnk--> peasant uprising, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> invasion and bitter cold, all of which happened and brought him renown. Kepler is known to have compiled prognostications for 1595 to 1606, and from 1617 to 1624. As court mathematician, Kepler explained to <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf II the horoscopes of the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Augustus and the Prophet <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, and Kepler gave astrological prognosis for the outcome of a war between the Republic of <!--del_lnk--> Venice and <!--del_lnk--> Paul V. In the <i>On the new star</i> (1606) Kepler explicated the meaning of the new <!--del_lnk--> star of 1604 as the conversion of <!--del_lnk--> America, downfall of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and return of <!--del_lnk--> Christ. The <i>De cometis libelli tres</i> (1619) is also replete with astrological predictions.<p><a id="Writings_by_Kepler" name="Writings_by_Kepler"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Writings by Kepler</span></h2>
