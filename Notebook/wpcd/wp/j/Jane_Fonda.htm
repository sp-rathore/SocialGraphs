      <p>Jane Fonda was born in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> to actor <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Fonda.htm" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> and <!--del_lnk--> socialite <!--del_lnk--> Frances Ford Seymour, and named <i>Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda</i>. When Jane was twelve years old, her mother committed <!--del_lnk--> suicide after voluntarily seeking treatment at a <!--del_lnk--> psychiatric hospital.<p>Henry Fonda had distant <!--del_lnk--> Dutch ancestry, and the surname Fonda originates from <!--del_lnk--> Holland. The &quot;Lady&quot; part of Jane Fonda&#39;s name was apparently inspired by Lady <!--del_lnk--> Jane Seymour, the third wife of King <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a>, who she is distantly related to on her mother&#39;s side. The &quot;Jayne&quot; comes from her father&#39;s middle name Jaynes.<p>Her brother, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Fonda (born 1939), and his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Bridget Fonda (born 1964), are also actors. She has an older half-sister, <!--del_lnk--> Frances Brokaw, as well as an adopted sister, Amy, who was born in 1953.<p>After Seymour&#39;s suicide, Henry Fonda married <!--del_lnk--> Susan Blanchard, who was only 10 years older than Jane. Although all of Henry&#39;s children seemed to like Blanchard, Blanchard and Henry Fonda divorced before Jane turned 20.<p><a id="Acting_career" name="Acting_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Acting career</span></h2>
      <p>Before starting her acting career, Fonda was a fashion model, gracing the cover of <!--del_lnk--> Vogue magazine twice. <!--del_lnk--> Fonda became interested in acting in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Country Girl</i>, at the <!--del_lnk--> Omaha Community Theatre. After attending <!--del_lnk--> Vassar College in New York, she was introduced by her father to renowned drama teacher <!--del_lnk--> Lee Strasberg in 1958, and subsequently joined his <!--del_lnk--> Actors Studio.<p><a name="1960s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1960s</span></h3>
      <p>Her stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in <!--del_lnk--> 1960 with <i><!--del_lnk--> Tall Story</i>, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Perkins. <i><!--del_lnk--> Period of Adjustment</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Walk on the Wild Side</i> followed in <!--del_lnk--> 1962. In <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i>, Fonda played a prostitute, and earned a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1963, she appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> Sunday in New York</i>. <i><!--del_lnk--> Newsday</i> called her &quot;the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses&quot;. However, she also had her detractors&mdash;in the same year, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Harvard Lampoon</i> named her the &quot;Year&#39;s Worst Actress&quot;. Fonda&#39;s career breakthrough came with <i><!--del_lnk--> Cat Ballou</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy <!--del_lnk--> Western received five <!--del_lnk--> Oscar nominations and was one of the year&#39;s top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to stardom at the age of twenty-eight. After this came the comedies <i><!--del_lnk--> Any Wednesday</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1966) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Barefoot in the Park</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1967), the latter co-starring <!--del_lnk--> Robert Redford.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1968, she played the lead role in the <!--del_lnk--> science fiction spoof <i><!--del_lnk--> Barbarella</i>, which established her status as a <!--del_lnk--> sex symbol. In contrast, the tragedy <i><!--del_lnk--> They Shoot Horses, Don&#39;t They?</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective by the end of the 1960s, turning down lead roles in <i><!--del_lnk--> Rosemary&#39;s Baby</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Bonnie and Clyde</i>, films widely praised by critics and considered box-office successes.<p><a name="1970s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1970s</span></h3>
      <p>Fonda won her first <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for Best Actress in <!--del_lnk--> 1971, again playing a prostitute, the <!--del_lnk--> gamine Bree Daniel, in the detective murder mystery <i><!--del_lnk--> Klute</i>. It is generally acknowledged that her finest moment onscreen is the extraordinary scene towards the end of Klute where she is confronted by her potential killer. Her second Award was in <!--del_lnk--> 1978 for <i><!--del_lnk--> Coming Home</i>, the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran&#39;s difficulty in re-entering civilian life.<p>Between <i><!--del_lnk--> Klute</i> in 1971 and <i><!--del_lnk--> Fun With Dick and Jane</i> in 1977, Fonda spent most of the first half of the decade without a major film success, even though she appeared in films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> A Doll&#39;s House</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1973) and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Blue Bird</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views - &quot;I can&#39;t say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted.&quot; However in her 2005 autobiography, <i>My Life So Far</i> it would appear that she categorically rejects such simplification. &quot;The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed.&quot; From her own point of view it would appear that her absence from the silver screen was related more to the fact that her political activism provided a new focus in her life. By the same token her return to acting with a series of &#39;issue-driven&#39; films was a reflection of this new focus. &quot;When I hear admonitions ... warning outspoken actors to remember &#39;what happened to Jane Fonda back in the seventies&#39;, this has me scratching my head: And that what would be...?&quot;<p>Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The <!--del_lnk--> 1977 comedy film <i><!--del_lnk--> Fun With Dick and Jane</i> is generally considered her &quot;comeback&quot; picture. She also received very positive reviews and an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of playwright <!--del_lnk--> Lillian Hellman in the 1977 film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Julia</i>. During this period Fonda announced that she would make films only that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down <i><!--del_lnk--> An Unmarried Woman</i> because she felt the part was not relevant. She followed with popular and successful films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The China Syndrome</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1979), about a coverup of an accident in a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear power plant; and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Electric Horseman</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1979) with her previous co-star, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Redford.<p><a name="1980s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1980, Fonda starred in the office-politics comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> Nine to Five</i> with <!--del_lnk--> Lily Tomlin and <!--del_lnk--> Dolly Parton. Her character was re-entering the workforce, after a divorce had devastated both her finances and self-confidence. The film was one of Fonda&#39;s greatest financial successes, contributing significantly to her wealth.<p>She had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she was cast as a supporting actress alongside Henry Fonda and <!--del_lnk--> Katharine Hepburn in <i><!--del_lnk--> On Golden Pond</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1981). This film brought Henry Fonda his first <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and home bound. He died five months later.<p>Fonda continued appearing in feature films throughout the 1980s, most notably her role of Dr. Martha Livingston in <!--del_lnk--> Agnes of God.<p><a id="Exercise_videos" name="Exercise_videos"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Exercise videos</span></h4>
      <p>For many years, Fonda was a <!--del_lnk--> ballet enthusiast, but after <!--del_lnk--> fracturing her foot while filming <i>The China Syndrome</i>, she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began actively participating in <!--del_lnk--> aerobics and strengthening exercises. This became a second career for her, which continued for many years.<p>In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled <i>Jane Fonda&#39;s Workout</i>, which sold 17 million copies, the most of any home video ever. The video&#39;s release led many people to buy the then-new <!--del_lnk--> VCR, in order to watch and perform the workout in the privacy and convenience of their own homes. Fonda subsequently released 23 more workout videos, five workout books, and thirteen audio tapes. Her most recent original workout video was released in 1995.<p><b>Exercise videos in chronological order:</b><ul>

      <p>Fonda has been credited with popularizing the phrase &quot;go for the burn.&quot;<p><a id="Retirement_and_return" name="Retirement_and_return"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement and return</span></h3>
      <p>In April <!--del_lnk--> 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry. In May <!--del_lnk--> 2005, however, she returned to the screen, after a fourteen-year absence, with the box-office success <i><!--del_lnk--> Monster-in-Law</i>, a comedy in which she played the manipulative prospective mother-in-law of <!--del_lnk--> Jennifer Lopez&#39;s character .<p>In July 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> British tabloid <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sun</i> reported that when Fonda was asked if she would appear in a sequel to her 1980 hit <i><!--del_lnk--> Nine to Five</i>, she replied &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;<p>Fonda&#39;s next project is the <!--del_lnk--> Garry Marshall-directed, <i><!--del_lnk--> Georgia Rule</i>, which began shooting in July 2006. Fonda stars along with <!--del_lnk--> Felicity Huffman, and <!--del_lnk--> Lindsay Lohan.<p>In the course of her career, Fonda has received seven <!--del_lnk--> Oscar nominations, winning twice.<p><a id="Political_activism" name="Political_activism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political activism</span></h2>
      <p>During the 1960s, Fonda engaged in <!--del_lnk--> political activism in support of the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Movement and in <!--del_lnk--> opposition to the Vietnam War.<p>Along with other celebrities, she supported the <!--del_lnk--> Alcatraz Island occupation in 1969, which was intended to call attention to <!--del_lnk--> Native American issues. (In the 1990s, she was criticized by Native American activists for making the perceived racist, sports-fan celebration gesture, &quot;The Tomahawk Chop&quot;, at <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta Braves baseball games with her then-husband <!--del_lnk--> Ted Turner.)<p>She likewise supported <!--del_lnk--> Huey Newton and the <!--del_lnk--> Black Panthers in the early 1970s, stating &quot;Revolution is an act of love; we are the children of revolution, born to be rebels. It runs in our blood.&quot; She called the Black Panthers &quot;our revolutionary vanguard&quot;, and said &quot;we must support them with love, money, propaganda and risk.&quot; In a 1979 appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, DC, she was asked about her past praise for Huey Newton and won laughter and applause for her response: &quot;I&#39;ve said a lot of off-the-wall things in my life. All I can say about that is I was naive and utterly wrong.&quot;<p>Fonda has also been involved in the <!--del_lnk--> feminist movement since the 1970s, which dovetails with her activism in support of <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>.<p><a id="Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War" name="Opposition_to_the_Vietnam_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Opposition to the Vietnam War</span></h3>

      <p>In April 1970, <!--del_lnk--> Fred Gardner, Fonda and <!--del_lnk--> Donald Sutherland formed the <!--del_lnk--> FTA tour (&quot;Free The Army&quot;, a play on the troop expression &quot;Fuck The Army&quot;), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to <!--del_lnk--> Bob Hope&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> USO tour. The tour, referred to as &quot;political vaudeville&quot; by Fonda, visited military towns along the West Coast, with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (<i>F.T.A.</i>) that contained strong, frank criticism of the war by service men and women. It was released in 1972.<p>In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by <!--del_lnk--> Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) in <!--del_lnk--> Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW, and, for her efforts, was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator. On <!--del_lnk--> November 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by the <i>New York Times</i>, Fonda was a &quot;major patron&quot; of the VVAW.<p>In March 1971, Fonda traveled to Paris to meet with <!--del_lnk--> National Liberation Front (NLF) foreign minister Madam <!--del_lnk--> Nguyen Thi Binh. According to a transcript that was translated into Vietnamese and back to English, Fonda told Binh at one point: &quot;Many of us have seen evidence proving the Nixon administration has escalated the war, causing death and destruction, perhaps as serious as the bombing of Hiroshima.&quot; Afterwards, Fonda traveled to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, where she again came under fire for making a speech that discussed the use of <!--del_lnk--> torture by US troops in Vietnam. Her financial support to VVAW at this time was apparently not significant, as the organization ran out of money within a month, and one of its prominent leaders, <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry, was called upon to raise the necessary funds.<p><a name=".22Hanoi_Jane.22"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Hanoi Jane&quot;</span></h4>
      <p>Fonda visited <a href="../../wp/h/Hanoi.htm" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> in July 1972. She is credited with publicly exposing <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&#39;s potential strategy of <!--del_lnk--> bombing the dikes in Vietnam. At the time, she was called a liar by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> ambassador <a href="../../wp/g/George_H._W._Bush.htm" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. Bush was intending to provide evidence of US innocence, but cancelled the press conference after Fonda released filmed evidence, with Bush saying, &quot;I think that the best thing I can do on the subject is to shut up.&quot; In 2004, her former husband <!--del_lnk--> Tom Hayden renewed claims that &quot;Fonda was right and Bush was lying&quot;.<p>In Vietnam, Fonda was photographed seated on an <!--del_lnk--> anti-aircraft battery used against American aircrews. She also participated in several radio broadcasts on behalf of the Communist regime, asking US aircrews to consider the consequences of their actions. In her 2005 autobiography, she states that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery, and claims to have been immediately horrified at the implications of the pictures. Fonda says that it was not what was in her heart at all, and wasn&#39;t the reason why she was even there. She was there to film evidence of the Nixon Administration&#39;s plan to blow up the dikes, (a plan that Fonda says &quot;Johnson, to his credit decided not to do&quot;), and the lie the administration had been giving to the public, that troop returns were imminent. She expressed regret for her actions many times over the years, but some Americans remain hostile to her. &quot;I&#39;ve learned that a picture does not capture what was actually in your heart.&quot;<p>During this visit she also visited American <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war (POWs); and brought back messages from them to their families. When cases of torture began to emerge among POWs returning to the United States, Fonda called the returning POWs &quot;hypocrites and liars&quot;. She added, &quot;These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed.&quot; On the subject of torture in general, Fonda told the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i> in 1973, &quot;I&#39;m quite sure that there were incidents of torture... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that&#39;s a lie.&quot; Several American POWs and other eyewitnesses, including former POW and current US Senator <!--del_lnk--> John McCain, disagree with this sentiment.<p>The POW camp visits also lead to persistent stories - widely circulated on the Internet and via email - that the POWs she met had reviled her or attempted to sneak notes to her, which she had reported to the North Vietnamese, leading to further abuse. These false accounts have been discredited by the former prisoners who are directly mentioned in the accounts.<p>Although Fonda&#39;s actions in July 1972 did not receive widespread coverage at the time (The New York Times, for example, ran only a brief UPI story and no photograph), her trip was perceived by many as an unpatriotic display of aid and comfort to the enemy, with some characterizing it as <!--del_lnk--> treason; the Nixon Administration, however, dismissed calls for legal action against her. Years later, she was labeled as <i>Hanoi Jane</i> by her critics and compared to war propagandists <!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Rose and <!--del_lnk--> Hanoi Hannah. (The first recorded use of the phrase is in a 1979 Washington Post article, citing picket signs by KKK and American Nazi demonstrators, not Vietnam veterans, at a Fonda speech.) She has often been accused of contributing to a perceived anti-soldier sentiment (despite the fact that she got involved in the anti-war movement by working with active-duty anti-war soldiers and veterans). Because of her actions, actor <!--del_lnk--> John Wayne cut off all contact with her, despite his close ties to her father.<p>In 1972, Fonda funded and organized the <!--del_lnk--> Indochina Peace Campaign. It continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 <!--del_lnk--> Paris Peace Agreement, when most other antiwar organizations closed down.<p><a id="Fonda.27s_regrets" name="Fonda.27s_regrets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Fonda&#39;s regrets</span></h4>
      <p>In 1988, Fonda admitted to former American POWs and their families that she had some regrets, stating:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;I would like to say something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I&#39;m very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.&quot;</dl>
      <p>On the <i><!--del_lnk--> Charlie Rose</i> program, Fonda noted that her regrets were limited to the photo appearance with the anti-aircraft gun, and that she was &quot;proud&quot; of her activism against &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> bombing of the dikes&quot;.<p>In a <i><!--del_lnk--> 60 Minutes</i> interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft gun photo. She stated that the incident was a &quot;betrayal&quot; of American forces and of the &quot;country that gave me privilege&quot;. Fonda said, &quot;The image of Jane Fonda, <!--del_lnk--> Barbarella, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Fonda.htm" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>&#39;s daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine.&quot; She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and pride for her anti-war activism: &quot;There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda... It&#39;s not something that I will apologize for.&quot; Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: &quot;Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war.&quot;<p><a id="Feminist_causes" name="Feminist_causes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Feminist causes</span></h3>

      <p>Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including <!--del_lnk--> V-Day, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit <i><!--del_lnk--> The Vagina Monologues</i>, of which she is an honorary chairperson. She was present at their first summit in 2002, bringing together founder <!--del_lnk--> Eve Ensler, Afghan women oppressed by the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban, and a Kenyan activist campaigning to save girls from <!--del_lnk--> genital mutilation.<p>In 2002, Fonda established the <!--del_lnk--> Jane Fonda Centre for Adolescent Reproductive Health at <!--del_lnk--> Emory University in <a href="../../wp/a/Atlanta%252C_Georgia.htm" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>; the goal of the centre is to prevent adolescent pregnancy, and to promote women&#39;s reproductive rights.<p>On February 16 2004, Fonda led a march through <!--del_lnk--> Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, with <!--del_lnk--> Sally Field, <!--del_lnk--> Eve Ensler, and other women, urging <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.<p>Fonda strongly feels that many <!--del_lnk--> gender stereotypes are damaging to individuals of both genders. In 2004, she served as a mentor to the first ever all-<!--del_lnk--> transsexual cast of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>.<p>In the days before the Swedish election on <!--del_lnk--> September 17, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Fonda came to <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> to support the new political party <!--del_lnk--> Feministiskt initiativ in their election campaign.<p>In <i>My Life So Far</i>, Fonda says that she considers <!--del_lnk--> patriarchy to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were &quot;anti-male&quot;. But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she &quot;still loves men&quot;. She states that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so. On October 5, 2006, Fonda was invited to speak at the University of Notre Dame on &quot;Feminization of Poverty&quot;, however the lecture dealt more with the subject of patriarchy. Nonetheless she was granted a standing ovation by both students and faculty, following her 50 minute address.<p><a id="Israeli-Palestinian_conflict" name="Israeli-Palestinian_conflict"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</span></h3>
      <p>Fonda continues to participate in political activism, particularly in connection with the <!--del_lnk--> Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During a trip to <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 2002 (billed as a promotion of &quot;world peace&quot;), Fonda was criticized by right wing <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israelis</a>, and heckled as she arrived for a meeting with leading Israeli feminists. Three hecklers, members of <!--del_lnk--> Women in Green, criticized her controversial stance during the Vietnam War, her stance toward Israel, and said that she &quot;came to Israel as a guest of <!--del_lnk--> Peace Now, Israeli traitors&quot;.<p><a id="Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War" name="Opposition_to_the_Iraq_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Opposition to the Iraq War</span></h3>

      <p>Fonda has argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and has asserted that a global hatred of America will result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war. In July 2005, Fonda said that some of the war veterans she had met while on her book tour had urged her to speak out against the <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq_War.htm" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a>.<p>In September 2005, Fonda and <!--del_lnk--> George Galloway postponed their <!--del_lnk--> anti-war bus tour due to the slow start to the relief operation now underway in the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Coast, which had been devastated by <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Katrina.htm" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Fonda then planned to take a bus tour in March 2006 with her <!--del_lnk--> daughter and several families of military veterans but later scrapped her plans, mostly because she felt like she would distract attention from <!--del_lnk--> Cindy Sheehan&#39;s activism. She remains opposed to the Iraq War and to <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> in general.<p><a id="Anti-Fonda_protests" name="Anti-Fonda_protests"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anti-Fonda protests</span></h3>
      <p>Protestors in Waterbury, Connecticut, lead by a Republican politcal activist who was a WW2 veteran, threatened to disrupt filming of Fonda&#39;s 1990 picture <i><!--del_lnk--> Stanley and Iris</i>, but when filming began she was well recieved by the community and the city&#39;s Board of Aldermen decisively defeated a resolution saying she was not welcome in the city.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. presidential election, 2004, her name was used as a disparaging epithet against <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry, the former <!--del_lnk--> VVAW leader, who was then the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party presidential candidate. <!--del_lnk--> Republican National Committee Chairman <!--del_lnk--> Ed Gillespie called Kerry a &quot;Jane Fonda Democrat&quot;. In addition, Kerry&#39;s opponents circulated a photograph showing Fonda and Kerry in the same large crowd at a 1970 anti-war rally, although they were sitting several rows apart. A faked composite photograph, which gave the false impression that the two had shared a speaker&#39;s platform, was also circulated. Fonda appeared on <!--del_lnk--> CNN to defend Kerry against these attacks.<p>In April 2005, a man named Michael A. Smith from <a href="../../wp/k/Kansas_City%252C_Missouri.htm" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a> took advantage of one of Jane Fonda&#39;s book signings to spit tobacco juice in her face. Minutes later, Smith was caught by police and charged with disorderly conduct. He went to court on May 27, 2005, and stated that he spat in Fonda&#39;s face because he believed her to be a &quot;traitor&quot;, adding that his actions were &quot;absolutely worth it&quot;. After he was led away, Fonda carried on signing books. It was the only incident during her national book tour.<p><a id="Christianity" name="Christianity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Christianity</span></h2>
      <p>In 2001, Fonda publicly announced that she had become a <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a>. She considers herself a Biblical Christian and strongly opposes <!--del_lnk--> bigotry, <!--del_lnk--> discrimination, and <!--del_lnk--> dogma, which she believes are promoted by a small minority of Christians. Her announcement came shortly after her divorce from <!--del_lnk--> Ted Turner. Some believe that Fonda&#39;s Christianity led to the divorce as Turner had allegedly criticized religion.<p><a id="Autobiography" name="Autobiography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Autobiography</span></h2>
      <p>In 2005, Fonda released her autobiography, <i>My Life So Far</i>. The book describes her life as a series of three acts, each thirty years long, and declares that her third &quot;act&quot; will be her most significant, largely due to her commitment to Christ, and that it will determine the things she will be remembered for. Fonda also claims that her autobiography shows that &quot;she is so much more than what we as <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">America</a> knows her as&quot;.<p>Fonda&#39;s autobiography was praised by the <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Times, <!--del_lnk--> New York Times, and several other <!--del_lnk--> newspapers. Fonda has held book-signing events all over the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> since publishing her book.<p><a id="Romantic_relationships" name="Romantic_relationships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Romantic relationships</span></h2>

      <p>Fonda&#39;s first husband, from 1965-1973, was <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> film director <!--del_lnk--> Roger Vadim, with whom she had a daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Vanessa born in 1968 and named for actress and activist <!--del_lnk--> Vanessa Redgrave. According to her 2005 autobiography, Fonda participated in sexual <!--del_lnk--> threesomes at Vadim&#39;s suggestion.<p>In 1973, shortly after her divorce from Vadim, Fonda married author and politician <!--del_lnk--> Tom Hayden. Their son, <!--del_lnk--> Troy Garity (born 1973) was given his paternal grandmother&#39;s surname. With Hayden, she also raised a <!--del_lnk--> foster daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Luana Williams, who is an activist born to members of the <!--del_lnk--> Black Panthers. Fonda and Hayden divorced in 1990.<p>Fonda&#39;s third husband (1991-2001) was cable-television tycoon and <!--del_lnk--> CNN founder <!--del_lnk--> Ted Turner. In <i>My Life So Far</i>, Fonda states that she &quot;left the father&#39;s house&quot; when she divorced Turner. In addition to having become a Christian, Fonda&#39;s desire to disassociate herself from <!--del_lnk--> patriarchy may have contributed to the divorce.<p>Fonda has also had romantic relationships with <!--del_lnk--> Alexander &quot;Sandy&quot; Whitelaw, a film director, with whom she was involved in 1960; <!--del_lnk--> Donald Sutherland, with whom she co-starred in <i>Klute</i> and dated in the 1970s; and <!--del_lnk--> Barry Matalon, a hairdresser whom she dated in the 1990s.<p><a id="Film_awards_and_nominations" name="Film_awards_and_nominations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film awards and nominations</span></h2>
