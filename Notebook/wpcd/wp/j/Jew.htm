      <p>The origin of the Jews  is traditionally dated to around 1800 <!--del_lnk--> BCE  with the biblical account of the birth of Judaism.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Merneptah Stele, dated at 1200 BCE, is one of the earliest archaeological records of the Jewish people in the <!--del_lnk--> Land of Israel, where they further developed a <!--del_lnk--> monotheistic religion, <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and enjoyed periods of <!--del_lnk--> self-determination. As a result of foreign conquests and expulsions starting in the 8th century BCE, a <!--del_lnk--> Jewish diaspora was formed. Defeats in the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish-Roman Wars in the years 70 <!--del_lnk--> CE and 135 notably contributed to the numbers and <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a> of the diaspora, as significant numbers of the Jewish population of the Land of Israel were expelled and sold to <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> throughout the empire. Since then, Jews lived throughout <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, the greater <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, surviving discrimination, oppression, poverty, and even <!--del_lnk--> genocide (see the articles <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semitism, <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>), with occasional periods of cultural, economic, and individual prosperity in various locations (such as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>).<p>Until the late 18th century, the terms <i>Jews</i> and <i>adherents of Judaism</i> were practically synonymous, and Judaism was the prime binding factor among the Jews, although it was not strictly required to be followed in order to belong to the Jewish people. Following the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a> and its Jewish counterpart <!--del_lnk--> Haskalah, a gradual transformation occurred where many Jews came to view being a member of the Jewish nation as separate from adhering to the Jewish faith.<p>The Hebrew name <i>Yehudi</i> (plural <i>Yehudim</i>) came into being when the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Israel was split between the northern <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Israel and the southern <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Judah. The term originally referred to the people of the southern kingdom, although the term <i>B&#39;nei Yisrael</i> (Israelites) was still used for both groups. After the <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom leaving the southern kingdom as the only Israelite state, the word <i>Yehudim</i> gradually came to refer to people of the Jewish faith as a whole, rather than those specifically from Judah. The English word <i>Jew</i> is ultimately derived from <i>Yehudi</i> (see <!--del_lnk--> Etymology). Its first use in the <!--del_lnk--> Bible to refer to the Jewish people as a whole is in the <!--del_lnk--> Book of Esther.<p><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>

      <p>There are many different views as to the origin of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> word <i>Jew</i>. The most common view is that the <!--del_lnk--> Middle English word <i>Jew</i> is from the <!--del_lnk--> Old French <i>giu</i>, earlier <i>juieu</i>, from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>iudeus</i> from the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>Ioudaios</i> (<i><span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F38;&omicron;&upsilon;&delta;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></i>). The Latin simply means <i>Judaean</i>, from the land of <i><!--del_lnk--> Judaea</i>. The Hebrew for Jew, &#x5D9;&#x5D4;&#x5D5;&#x5D3;&#x5D9; , is pronounced ye-hoo-DEE. The Hebrew letter <!--del_lnk--> Yodh (or Yud), &#x5D9;, used as a &#39;y&#39; in the Hebrew language (as in the word ye-hoo-DEE), becomes a &#39;j&#39; in languages using the Latin-based alphabet when the Yodh is used as a consonant rather than as a vowel. Therefore, a rough transliteration of &#x5D9;&#x5D4;&#x5D5;&#x5D3;&#x5D9; in English would be <i>Jew</i>.<p>The etymological equivalent is in use in other languages, e.g., &quot;Jude&quot; in <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, &quot;juif&quot; in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, &quot;j&oslash;de,&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Danish, etc., but derivations of the word &quot;Hebrew&quot; are also in use to describe a Jewish person, e.g., in <!--del_lnk--> Italian (Ebreo) and <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>: <span lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">&#x415;&#x432;&#x440;&#x435;&#x439;</span>, (<i>Yevrey</i>).

      <p><a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> shares some of the characteristics of a <!--del_lnk--> nation, an <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity, a <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, and a <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, making the definition of who is a Jew vary slightly depending on whether a religious or national approach to identity is used. For discussions of the religious views on who is a Jew and how these views differ from each other, please see <!--del_lnk--> Who is a Jew?. Generally, in modern secular usage, Jews include three groups: people who practice Judaism and have a Jewish ethnic background (sometimes including those who do not have strictly matrilineal descent), people without Jewish parents who have converted to Judaism; and those Jews who, while not practicing Judaism as a religion, still identify themselves as Jewish by virtue of their family&#39;s Jewish descent and their own cultural and historical identification with the Jewish people.<p>Historical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on <!--del_lnk--> Halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent, and halachic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the oral tradition into the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian Talmud. Biblical interpretations of sections in the <!--del_lnk--> Tanach, such as <!--del_lnk--> Deuteronomy 7:1-5, by learned Jewish sages, is used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and non Jews because &quot;[the non-Jewish male spouse] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods of others.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Leviticus 24:10 speaks of the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man to be &quot;of the community of Israel.&quot;, which contrasts with <!--del_lnk--> Ezra 10:2-3, where Israelites returning from Egypt, vowed to put aside their gentile wives and their children. Since the <!--del_lnk--> Haskalah, these halakhic interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.<div style="clear: both">

      <p><a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> guides its adherents in both practice and belief, and has been called not only a religion, but also a &quot;way of life,&quot; which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism, Jewish culture, and Jewish nationality rather difficult.

They refer to both religious and ethnic divisions.<p>Other Jewish ethnic groups include <!--del_lnk--> Mizrahi Jews (a term overlapping <i>Sephardi</i>, but emphasizing North African and Middle Eastern rather than Spanish history, and including the <!--del_lnk--> Maghrebim); <!--del_lnk--> Teimanim (<a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemenite</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Oman.htm" title="Oman">Omani</a> Jews); and such smaller groups as the <!--del_lnk--> Gruzim and <!--del_lnk--> Juhurim from the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus, the <!--del_lnk--> Bene Israel, <!--del_lnk--> Bnei Menashe, <!--del_lnk--> Cochin and <!--del_lnk--> Telugu <!--del_lnk--> Jews of India, the <!--del_lnk--> Romaniotes of <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Italkim (Ben&eacute; Roma) of <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, various <!--del_lnk--> African Jews (most notably the <!--del_lnk--> Beta Israel or <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopian</a> Jews), the <!--del_lnk--> Bukharan Jews of Central Asia, <!--del_lnk--> Kaifeng Jews from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Jews of Iran.<p><a id="Population" name="Population"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h2>

Elsewhere in the Americas, there are also large Jewish populations in Canada and Argentina, and smaller populations in <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> , <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, and several other countries (see <!--del_lnk--> History of the Jews in Latin America).<p>Western Europe&#39;s largest Jewish community can be found in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, home to 600,000 Jews, the majority of whom are immigrants or refugees from North African Arab countries such as <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> (or their descendants). There are over 265,000 Jews in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe, there are anywhere from 500,000 to over two million Jews living in the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, but exact figures are difficult to establish. The fastest-growing Jewish community in the world, outside Israel, is the one in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, especially in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, its capital. Tens of thousands of Jews from the former <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc have settled in Germany since the fall of the <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin_Wall.htm" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>.<p>The Arab countries of North Africa and the Middle East were home to around 900,000 Jews in 1945. Systematic persecution after the founding of Israel caused almost all of these Jews to flee to Israel, North America, and Europe in the 1950s. Today, around 8,000 Jews remain in Arab nations. <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> is home to around 25,000 Jews, down from a population of 100,000 Jews before the 1979 revolution. After the revolution some of the Iranian Jews emigrated to Israel or Europe but most of them emigrated (with their non-Jewish Iranian compatriots) to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> (especially <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles).<p>Outside Europe, Asia and the Americas, significant Jewish populations exist in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>.<p><a id="Population_changes:_Assimilation" name="Population_changes:_Assimilation"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Population changes: Assimilation</span></h3>
      <p>Since at least the time of the ancient Greeks, a proportion of Jews have assimilated into the wider non-Jewish society around them, by either choice or force, ceasing to practice Judaism and losing their <!--del_lnk--> Jewish identity. Some <!--del_lnk--> Jewish communities, for example the <!--del_lnk--> Kaifeng Jews of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, have disappeared entirely, but assimilation has remained relatively low over much of the past millennium, as Jews were often not allowed to integrate with the wider communities in which they lived. The advent of the Jewish Enlightenment (see <!--del_lnk--> Haskalah) of the 1700s and the subsequent emancipation of the Jewish populations of Europe and America in the 1800s, changed the situation, allowing Jews to increasingly participate in, and become part of, secular society. The result has been a growing trend of assimilation, as Jews marry non-Jewish spouses and stop participating in the Jewish community. Rates of <!--del_lnk--> interreligious marriage vary widely: In the United States, they are just under 50%, in the United Kingdom, around 50%, and in Australia and Mexico, as low as 10%, and in France, they may be as high as 75%. In the United States, only about a third of children from intermarriages affiliate themselves with Jewish practice. Additionally, since non-religious Jews generally tend to marry later and have fewer children than the general population, the Jewish community in many countries is aging. The result is that most countries in the <!--del_lnk--> Diaspora have steady or slightly declining Jewish populations as Jews continue to assimilate into the countries in which they live.<p><a id="Population_changes:_Wars_against_the_Jews" name="Population_changes:_Wars_against_the_Jews"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Population changes: Wars against the Jews</span></h3>

      <p>Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations, or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed have ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. Some examples in the <!--del_lnk--> history of anti-Semitism are: the <!--del_lnk--> Great Jewish Revolt against the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>; the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Inquisition.htm" title="Spanish Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a> led by <!--del_lnk--> Torquemada and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Auto de f&eacute;</i> against the <!--del_lnk--> Marrano Jews; the <!--del_lnk--> Bohdan Chmielnicki <!--del_lnk--> Cossack massacres in <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>; the <!--del_lnk--> Pogroms backed by the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled. The persecution reached a peak in <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Final Solution, which led to <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and the slaughter of approximately 6 million Jews from 1939 to 1945.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> James Carroll, &quot;Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the Roman Empire. By that ratio, if other factors had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million.&quot;<p><a id="Population_changes:_Growth" name="Population_changes:_Growth"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Population changes: Growth</span></h3>
      <p>Israel is the only country with a consistently growing Jewish population due to natural population increase, though the Jewish populations of other countries in Europe and North America have recently increased due to immigration. In the Diaspora, in almost every country the Jewish population in general is either declining or steady, but <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox and <!--del_lnk--> Haredi Jewish communities, whose members often shun <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a> for religious reasons, have experienced rapid population growth, with rates near 4% per year for Haredi Jews in Israel, and similar rates in other countries.<p>Orthodox and Conservative Judaism discourage proselytization to non-Jews, but many Jewish groups have tried to reach out to the assimilated Jewish communities of the Diaspora in order to increase the number of Jews. Additionally, while in principle Reform Judaism favors seeking new members for the faith, this position has not translated into active proselytism, instead taking the form of an effort to reach out to non-Jewish spouses of intermarried couples. There is also a trend of Orthodox movements pursuing secular Jews in order to give them a stronger <!--del_lnk--> Jewish identity so there is less chance of intermarriage. As a result of the efforts by these and other Jewish groups over the past twenty-five years, there has been a trend of secular Jews becoming more religiously observant, known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Baal Teshuva</i> movement, though the demographic implications of the trend are unknown. Additionally, there is also a growing movement of <!--del_lnk--> Jews by Choice by <!--del_lnk--> gentiles who make the decision to head in the direction of becoming Jews.<p><a id="Jewish_languages" name="Jewish_languages"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewish languages</span></h2>

      <p>Jews descend mostly from the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Israelites (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Hebrews), who settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Land of Israel. The Israelites traced their common lineage to the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">biblical</a> patriarch <!--del_lnk--> Abraham through <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac.htm" title="Isaac">Isaac</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Jacob. A <!--del_lnk--> United Monarchy was established under <!--del_lnk--> Saul and continued under <!--del_lnk--> King David and <!--del_lnk--> Solomon. King David conquered <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> (first a <!--del_lnk--> Canaanite, then a <!--del_lnk--> Jebusite town) and made it his capital. After Solomon&#39;s reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Israel (in the north) and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Judah (in the south). The <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> ruler <!--del_lnk--> Shalmaneser V in the <!--del_lnk--> 8th century BCE and spread all over the Assyrian empire, where they were assimilated into other cultures and came to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ten Lost Tribes. The <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early <!--del_lnk--> 6th century BCE, destroying the <!--del_lnk--> First Temple that was at the centre of Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to Babylonia, but later at least a part of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the Persians seventy years later, a period known as the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian Captivity. A new <!--del_lnk--> Second Temple was constructed funded by Persian Kings, and old religious practices were resumed.<p><a id="Persian.2C_Greek.2C_and_Roman_rule" name="Persian.2C_Greek.2C_and_Roman_rule"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Persian, Greek, and Roman rule</span></h3>

      <p>Upon his death in 4 BCE the Romans directly ruled Judea and there were frequent changes of policies by conflicting and empire-building <!--del_lnk--> Caesars, generals, governors, and consuls who often acted cruelly or to maximize their own wealth and power. Rome&#39;s attitudes swung from tolerance to hostility against its Jewish subjects, who had since moved throughout the Empire. The Romans, worshiping a <!--del_lnk--> large pantheon, could not readily accommodate the exclusive <!--del_lnk--> monotheism of Judaism, and the religious Jews could not accept Roman <!--del_lnk--> polytheism. (It was in this tumultuous climate that <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> first emerged, among a small group of Jews.) After a famine and riots in 66 CE, the Judeans began to revolt against their Roman rulers. The revolt was smashed by <!--del_lnk--> Titus Flavius, a Roman general who later succeeded his father <!--del_lnk--> Vespasian as <!--del_lnk--> emperor. In Rome the <!--del_lnk--> Arch of Titus still stands, showing enslaved Judeans and a <i><!--del_lnk--> menorah</i> being brought to Rome. It is customary for Jews to walk around, rather than through, this arch.<p>The Romans all but destroyed <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; only a single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Western Wall&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Temple remained. After the end of this first revolt, the Judeans continued to live in their land in significant numbers, and were allowed to practice their religion. In the second century the Roman Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian began to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city while restricting some Jewish practices. Angry at this affront, the Judeans again revolted led by <!--del_lnk--> Simon Bar Kokhba. <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the revolution and killing as many as half a million Jews. After the Roman Legions prevailed in 135, Jews were not allowed to enter the city of Jerusalem and most Jewish worship was forbidden by Rome. Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, and instead was rebuilt around rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities. No new books were added to the Jewish Bible after the Roman period, instead major efforts went into interpreting and developing the <!--del_lnk--> Halakhah, or oral law, and writing down these traditions in the <!--del_lnk--> Talmud, the key work on the interpretation of Jewish law, written during the first to fifth centuries CE.<p><a id="Beginning_of_the_Diaspora" name="Beginning_of_the_Diaspora"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Beginning of the Diaspora</span></h3>

      <p>Though Jews had settled outside Israel since the time of the Babylonians, the results of the Roman response to the Jewish revolt shifted the centre of Jewish life from its ancient home to the diaspora. While some Jews remained in Judea, renamed Palestine by the Romans, some Jews were sold into <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, while others became citizens of other parts of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. This is the traditional explanation to the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish diaspora, almost universally accepted by past and present rabbinical or Talmudical scholars, who believe that Jews are almost exclusively biological descendants of the Judean exiles, a belief backed up at least partially by DNA evidence. Some secular historians speculate that a majority of the Jews in Antiquity were most likely descendants of converts in the cities of the Graeco-Roman world, especially in Alexandria and Asia Minor. They were only affected by the diaspora in its spiritual sense and by the sense of loss and homelessness which became a cornerstone of the Jewish creed, much supported by persecutions in various parts of the world. Any such policy of conversion, which spread the Jewish religion throughout Hellenistic civilization, seems to have ended with the wars against the Romans and the following reconstruction of Jewish values for the post-Temple era. DNA evidence of this theory has been spotty, however, some historians believe based on some historical records that at the dawn of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> as many as 10% of the population of the Roman Empire were <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, a figure that could only be explained by local conversion. This theory could also solve the paradox of DNA studies noted above that show <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazi Jews to be somewhat related to the peoples of the nations surrounding <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> despite physical features that more closely resembles that of the peoples of southern and central <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>; as one explanation would be a large <!--del_lnk--> miscegenation millennia ago followed by almost no outside genetic contact thereafter.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the first few hundred years of the Diaspora, the most important Jewish communities were in <!--del_lnk--> Babylonia, where the Talmud was written, and where relatively tolerant regimes allowed the Jews freedom. The situation was worse in the Byzantine Empire which treated the Jews much more harshly, refusing to allow them to hold office or build places of worship. In the belief of restoration to come, the Jews made an alliance with the Persians who invaded Palestine in 614, fought at their side, overwhelmed the Byzantine garrison in Jerusalem, and for three years governed the city. But the Persians made their peace with the Emperor <a href="../../wp/h/Heraclius.htm" title="Heraclius">Heraclius</a>. Christian rule was re-established, and those Jews who survived the consequent slaughter were once more banished from Jerusalem. <p>The conquest of much of the Byzantine Empire and Babylonia by Islamic armies generally improved the life of the Jews, though they were still considered second-class citizens. In response to these Islamic conquests, the <a href="../../wp/f/First_Crusade.htm" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> of 1096 attempted to reconquer Jerusalem, resulting in the destruction of many of the remaining Jewish communities in the area. The Jews were among the most vigorous defenders of Jerusalem against the Crusaders. When the city fell, the Crusaders gathered the Jews in a synagogue and burned them. The Jews almost single-handedly defended <!--del_lnk--> Haifa against the Crusaders, holding out in the besieged town for a whole month (June-July 1099). At this time, a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state, there were Jewish communities all over the country. Fifty of them are known to us; they include Jerusalem, <!--del_lnk--> Tiberias, <!--del_lnk--> Ramleh, <!--del_lnk--> Ashkelon, <!--del_lnk--> Caesarea, and <!--del_lnk--> Gaza. <div class="thumb tright">

       <dd> Jews settled in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> during the time of the Roman Empire, but the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Church resulted in frequent expulsions and persecutions. The Crusades routinely attacked Jewish communities, and increasingly harsh laws restricted them from most economic activity and land ownership, leaving open only moneylending and a few other trades. Jews were subject to expulsions from England, France, and the Holy Roman Empire throughout the Middle Ages, with most of the population moving to Eastern Europe and especially Poland, <!--del_lnk--> which was uniquely tolerant of the Jews through the 1700s. The final mass expulsion of the Jews, and the largest, occurred after the Christian conquest (<i><!--del_lnk--> reconquista</i>) of Spain in 1492 (see <!--del_lnk--> History of the Jews in Spain). Even after the end of the expulsions in the 17th century, individual conditions varied from country to country and time to time, but, as rule, Jews in Western Europe generally were forced, by decree or by informal pressure, to live in highly segregated <!--del_lnk--> ghettos and <!--del_lnk--> shtetls. By the beginning of the twentieth century, most European Jews lived in the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Pale of Settlement, the Western frontier of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire comprised generally of the modern day countries of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus and neighboring regions.</dl>

      <p>During the Middle Ages, Jews in Islamic lands generally had more rights than under Christian rule, with a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age of coexistence in Islamic Spain from about 900 to 1200, when Spain became the centre of the richest, most populous, and most influential Jewish community of the time. The rise of more radical Muslim regimes, such as that of the <!--del_lnk--> Almohades ended this period by the thirteenth century, and Jews were soon <!--del_lnk--> expelled from Spain after the Christian reconquest. Many of these Jews found refuge in the <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Empire, which remained tolerant of its Jewish population for much of its history.<p><a id="Enlightenment_and_emancipation" name="Enlightenment_and_emancipation"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Enlightenment and emancipation</span></h3>

      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, significant changes occurred within the Jewish community. The <!--del_lnk--> Haskalah movement paralleled the wider Enlightenment, as Jews began in the 1700s to campaign for emancipation from restrictive laws and integration into the wider European society. Secular and scientific education was added to the traditional religious instruction received by students, and interest in a national Jewish identity, including a revival in the study of Jewish history and Hebrew, started to grow.<p>The Haskalah movement influenced the birth of all the modern Jewish denominations, and planted the seeds of <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>. At the same time, it contributed to encouraging cultural assimilation into the countries in which Jews resided. At around the same time another movement was born, one preaching almost the opposite of Haskalah, <!--del_lnk--> Hasidic Judaism. Hasidic Judaism began in the 1700s by Israel ben Eliezer, the <!--del_lnk--> Baal Shem Tov, and quickly gained a following with its exuberant, mystical approach to religion. These two movements, and the traditional orthodox approach to Judaism from which they spring, formed the basis for the modern divisions within Jewish observance.<p>At the same time, the outside world was changing. France was the first country to <!--del_lnk--> emancipate its Jewish population in 1796, granting them equal rights under the law. <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> further spread emancipation, inviting Jews to leave the <!--del_lnk--> Jewish ghettos in Europe and seek refuge in the newly created tolerant political regimes (see <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon and the Jews). Other countries such as <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> also adopted liberal policies toward Jews during the period of Enlightenment, with some resulting immigration. By the mid-19th century, almost all Western European countries had <!--del_lnk--> emancipated their Jewish populations, with the notable exception of the <!--del_lnk--> Papal States, but persecution continued in Eastern Europe including massive <!--del_lnk--> pogroms at the end of the 19th century and throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Pale of Settlement. The persistence of anti-semitism, both violently in the east and socially in the west, led to a number of <!--del_lnk--> Jewish political movements, culminating in <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>.<p><a id="Zionism_and_immigration" name="Zionism_and_immigration"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Zionism and immigration</span></h3>
      <p>Many of the newly secular Jews who had embraced Haskalah found themselves deeply troubled by the continuing virulent anti-semitism of the late 1800s, especially the massive <!--del_lnk--> pogroms of the 1880s in Russia and the <!--del_lnk--> Dreyfus Affair, which occurred in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in 1894, a country many Jews had previously thought of as particularly accepting. Many Jews in Eastern Europe embraced <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> as a potential escape from persecution, but another group, the Zionists, led by <!--del_lnk--> Theodor Herzl, viewed the only solution as the creation of a Jewish state. The interplay between Jewish national and religious identities was evident in Zionism, which was initially an entirely secular movement, but drew inspiration and support from the religious connection between Jews and the Land of Israel. Zionism contributed to the growth of the Jewish population there, which at the time was the <!--del_lnk--> Palestine province of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, and later the <!--del_lnk--> British Mandate of Palestine. Zionism, initially one out of a number of competing <!--del_lnk--> Jewish political movements, gained nearly universal support from the world Jewish population following the near-complete destruction of the Jews of Europe in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, and led to the foundation of the <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">State of Israel</a>.<p>In addition to responding politically, during the late 19th century, Jews began to flee the persecutions of Eastern Europe in large numbers, mostly by heading to the United States, but also to Canada and Western Europe. By 1924, almost two million Jews had emigrated to the US alone, creating a large community in a nation relatively free of the persecutions of rising European <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semitism (see <!--del_lnk--> History of the Jews in the United States).<p><a id="The_Holocaust" name="The_Holocaust"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The Holocaust</span></h3>

      <p>This anti-Semitism reached its most destructive form in the policies of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> Germany, which made the destruction of the Jews a priority, culminating in the killing of approximately six million Jews during <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> from 1941 to 1945. Originally, the Nazis used death squads, the <!--del_lnk--> Einsatzgruppen, to conduct massive open-air killings of Jews in territory they conquered. By 1942, the Nazi leadership decided to implement the <!--del_lnk--> Final Solution, the <!--del_lnk--> genocide of the Jews of Europe, and to increase the pace of the Holocaust by establishing <!--del_lnk--> extermination camps specifically to kill Jews. This was an industrial method of genocide. Millions of Jews who had been confined to diseased and massively overcrowded <!--del_lnk--> Ghettos were transported (often by train) to <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Death-camps&quot; where some were herded into a specific location (often a <!--del_lnk--> gas chamber), then either gassed or shot. Afterwards, their remains were buried or burned. Others were interned in the camps were they given little food and disease was common. Many Jews tried to escape Europe before or during the Holocaust, but were unable to find refuge, giving new urgency to the Zionist goal of establishing a Jewish homeland.<p><a id="Israel" name="Israel"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Israel</span></h3>

      <p>In 1948, the Jewish state of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> was founded, creating the first Jewish nation since the Roman destruction of Jerusalem. After a series of wars with neighboring Arab countries, almost all of the 900,000 Jews previously living in North Africa and the Middle East fled to the Jewish state, joining an increasing number of immigrants from post-War Europe. By the end of the 20th century, Jewish population centers had shifted dramatically, with the United States and Israel being the centers of Jewish secular and religious life.<p><a id="Persecution" name="Persecution"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Persecution</span></h2>

      <p>The Jewish people and <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> have experienced various <!--del_lnk--> persecutions throughout <!--del_lnk--> Jewish history. In <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">medieval Europe</a>, many persecutions of Jews in the name of Christianity occurred, notably during the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a>&mdash;when Jews all over Germany were massacred&mdash;and a series of expulsions from England, Germany, France, and, in the largest expulsion of all, Spain. In the <!--del_lnk--> Papal States, which existed until 1870, Jews were required to live only in specified neighborhoods called <!--del_lnk--> ghettos. In the 19th and (before the end of the second World War) 20th centuries, the Roman Catholic church adhered to a distinction between &quot;good anti-Semitism&quot; and &quot;bad anti-Semitism&quot;. The &quot;bad&quot; kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The &quot;good&quot; kind criticized alleged Jewish conspiracies to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc.<p><!--del_lnk--> Islam and Judaism have a complex relationship. The political conflict between <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and the Jews of <!--del_lnk--> Medina in the 7th century left ample ideological fuel for <!--del_lnk--> Islam and anti-Semitism through the centuries. During the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Jews typically had a better status in the Muslim world than in <!--del_lnk--> Christendom. As the Muslim empire expanded during the centuries, the status of the non-Muslim communities was at times precarious, and they were generally subject to <i><!--del_lnk--> dhimmi</i> laws. These laws freed them from military service and paying <!--del_lnk--> zakah, but placed additional <!--del_lnk--> jizyah and land taxes on them.<p>The most notable modern day persecution of Jews remains the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> &mdash; the state-led systematic <!--del_lnk--> persecution and <!--del_lnk--> genocide of the Jews and other <!--del_lnk--> minority groups of Europe and North Africa during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and its <!--del_lnk--> collaborators During the Holocaust, the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> was in turmoil. Britain prohibited Jewish immigration to the <!--del_lnk--> British Mandate of Palestine. While the <!--del_lnk--> Allies and the <!--del_lnk--> Axis were fighting for the oil-rich region, the Mufti of Jerusalem <!--del_lnk--> Amin al-Husayni staged a pro-Nazi coup in Iraq and organized the <!--del_lnk--> Farhud pogrom which marked the turning point for about 150,000 Iraqi Jews who, following this event and the hostilities generated by the <!--del_lnk--> war with Israel in 1948, were targeted for violence, persecution, boycotts, confiscations, and near complete expulsion in 1951. In the French <!--del_lnk--> Vichy territories of <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> plans were drawn up for the liquidation of their Jewish populations were the <!--del_lnk--> Axis powers to triumph.<p>The tensions of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arab-Israeli_conflict.htm" title="Arab-Israeli conflict">Arab-Israeli conflict</a> were also a factor in the rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as <!--del_lnk--> refugees, the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.<p><a id="Jewish_leadership" name="Jewish_leadership"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Jewish leadership</span></h2>
