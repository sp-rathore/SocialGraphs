      <p><b>Dr John Arthur Thomas Robinson</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 1919 in <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury, England&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> December 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1983) was a <!--del_lnk--> New Testament scholar, author, and former <!--del_lnk--> Anglican <!--del_lnk--> bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Woolwich, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. He was a <!--del_lnk--> lecturer at <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity_College%252C_Cambridge.htm" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and later Dean of Trinity College until his death in 1983 from <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. Dr Robinson was considered a major force in shaping <!--del_lnk--> liberal Christian theology. Along with <!--del_lnk--> Harvard <!--del_lnk--> theologian <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Cox he spearheaded the field of <!--del_lnk--> secular theology.<p>Robinson wrote several notable books, the most famous being <i><!--del_lnk--> Honest to God</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1963. Robinson&#39;s own evaluation of <i>Honest to God,</i> found in the subsequent <i>Exploration into God</i> stated that the chief contribution of this work was its successful synthesis of the work of seemingly opposed theologians <!--del_lnk--> Paul Tillich and <!--del_lnk--> Dietrich Bonhoeffer.<p>Robinson proposed abandoning the notion of a God &quot;out there&quot;, existing somewhere out in the universe, just as we have abandoned already the idea of God &quot;up there&quot;, the notion of the old man up in the sky. In its place, he offered us the idea of God as the depth of our being and existence. <i>Honest to God</i> caused a storm of controversy as the first publication by a leading churchman which asked the question<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Now that we have rejected the ancients&#39; view of God living in a material heaven above the actual sky what does God&#39;s existence mean?&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>While the bulk of his ideas have become integrated with the more liberal circles of Christian thought, he is considered an extremist by some. As is often the case with <!--del_lnk--> iconoclasts who question traditional thinking, his ideas are considered <!--del_lnk--> anathema by <!--del_lnk--> Barthian evangelicals and by those whose concept of a <!--del_lnk--> supernatural God supersedes other theological concerns.<p>Although Robinson was firmly within the camp of <!--del_lnk--> liberal theology, he did challenge the work of colleagues in the field of <!--del_lnk--> exegetical criticism. Specifically, Dr Robinson examined the New Testament&#39;s reliability, because he believed that very little original research had been completed in the field during the period between 1900 and the mid 1970s. Concluding his research, he wrote in his work, <i>Redating the New Testament</i> that past scholarship was based on a &quot;tyranny of unexamined assumptions&quot; and an &quot;almost willful blindness&quot;.<p>Robinson concluded that New Testament was written before <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> 64, partly based on his judgement there is little textual evidence that the New Testament reflects knowledge of the Temple&#39;s AD&nbsp;70 destruction. C. H. Dodd, in a frank letter to Robinson wrote: &quot;I should agree with you that much of the late dating is quite arbitrary, even wanton, the offspring not of any argument that can be presented, but rather of the critic&#39;s prejudice that, if he appears to assent to the traditional position of the early church, he will be thought no better than a stick-in-the-mud.&quot; <!--del_lnk-->  Robinson&#39;s call for redating the New Testament was echoed by subsequent scholarship such as <!--del_lnk--> John Wenham&#39;s work <i>Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem</i>. Other subsequent works calling for redating of some or all of the gospels were written by such scholars as <!--del_lnk--> Claude Tresmontant, Gunther Zuntz, <!--del_lnk--> Carsten Peter Thiede, Eta Linneman, Harold Riley, Bernard Orchard. <!--del_lnk--> <p>In relation to the four gospels dates of authorship, according to <!--del_lnk--> Norman Geisler, &quot;Robinson places Matthew at 40 to after 60, Mark at about 45 to 60, Luke at before 57 to after 60, and John at from 40 to after 65.&quot; <!--del_lnk-->  Robinson went on to state that the book of James was penned by a brother of the Jesus Christ within twenty years of Jesus&rsquo; death, that Paul authored all the books that bear his name, and that John, the apostle, wrote the fourth Gospel. Dr. Robinson believed the result of his investigations argued for the rewriting of many theologies of the New Testament.<!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p>Robinson was also famous for his speech in the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> against the censorship of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover</i>.<p>Two books have been written about Dr Robinson: <i>A life of Bishop John A.T. Robinson: Scholar, pastor, prophet</i> by Eric James and <i>The Roots of Christian Freedom: The Theology of John A.T. Robinson</i> by Alistair Kee.<p><a id="Books_by_Robinson" name="Books_by_Robinson"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Books by Robinson</span></h2>
