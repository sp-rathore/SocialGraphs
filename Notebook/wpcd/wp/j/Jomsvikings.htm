      <p><b>Jomsvikings</b> were a company of <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> <!--del_lnk--> mercenaries of the <!--del_lnk--> 900s and <!--del_lnk--> 1000s, dedicated to the worship of such deities as <a href="../../wp/o/Odin.htm" title="Odin">Odin</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thor.htm" title="Thor">Thor</a>. Though staunchly <!--del_lnk--> pagan, they have been compared to the <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders of <!--del_lnk--> Christendom. However, they reputedly would fight for any lord able to pay their substantial fees. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Norse sagas (particularly the <i><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;msv&iacute;kinga saga</i>, <i>King Olaf Tryggvasson&rsquo;s Saga</i>, and stories found in the <!--del_lnk--> Flatey Book), their stronghold <!--del_lnk--> Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, but the location is disputed by modern historians and archeologists. <i><!--del_lnk--> Nordisk familjebok</i> asserts it to be located on the eastern side of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Wollin, on the hill <!--del_lnk--> Silberberg north of the town <!--del_lnk--> Wollin. <!--del_lnk--> Saxo Grammaticus mentioned a settlement called <i>Julinum</i> that he described as inhabited by <!--del_lnk--> Slavic pirates, while some believe an island fortress on the Slavonian coast to be the perfect haunt of <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> mercenaries, between the easterly and westerly courses of <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian sea routes, with all the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a> in the north.<p>The legend of the Joms appears in some of the <!--del_lnk--> Icelandic sagas from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The existence of Jomsborg is a matter of debate in historical circles, due to the scarcity of primary sources. There are no contemporary sources mentioning the names <i>Jomsvikings</i> and <i>Jomsborg</i>, but there are three contemporary runestones and several contemporary <!--del_lnk--> lausav&iacute;sur held to refer to one of their battles.<p>

      <p>The <i>Saga of the Jomsvikings</i> relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding who to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named <!--del_lnk--> Vagn &Aring;kesson, who defeated <!--del_lnk--> Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, often taking the form of a ritual <!--del_lnk--> duel, or <!--del_lnk--> holmgang, with a Jomsviking.<p>Once admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct in order to instill a sense of <!--del_lnk--> military discipline among its members. Any violation of these rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers, as well as to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. <!--del_lnk--> Blood feuds between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, though orderly retreat in the face of vastly outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none were to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Historians still debate the accuracy of the accounts of the Jomsvikings. Some maintain that the order was entirely legendary. The site of their headquarters has never been conclusively located, so confirming the tales of their exploits is somewhat difficult.<p>There are different accounts for the origins of the order. One version states that the Jomsvikings were founded by the King of Denmark, <!--del_lnk--> Harald Bluetooth, after his exile, yet he was probably an old man when his son <!--del_lnk--> Sweyn Forkbeard committed hiself to his father&#39;s domain. According to this version, he taught <!--del_lnk--> seafaring skills to the local <!--del_lnk--> Wends, and the Danes with him led aspirants on <!--del_lnk--> piratical raids against his enemies to the north. Jomsborg is described in these sources as a largely Wendish town with <!--del_lnk--> Norse officers. The <i><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;msv&iacute;kinga saga</i> states that the settlement was entirely Norse, and the brotherhood, was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Palnatoke, receiving the location from the mythical <!--del_lnk--> Wendish ruler <!--del_lnk--> Burislav. <i><!--del_lnk--> Styrbjarnar &thorn;&aacute;ttr Sv&iacute;akappa</i>, on the other hand, states that among the Norse there were many men from the &quot;East land&quot; arriving at Jomsborg, suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity.<p>Accounts of their size vary. Jomsborg, in various sources, is supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbour, with Jomsviking chieftains including <!--del_lnk--> Palnatoke, <!--del_lnk--> Styrbj&ouml;rn the Strong, <!--del_lnk--> Sveyn Forkbeard, <!--del_lnk--> Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, <!--del_lnk--> Thorkell the High, and <!--del_lnk--> Hemeng.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Styrbjarnar &thorn;&aacute;ttr Sv&iacute;akappa</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Eyrbyggja saga</i> relate that in the early <!--del_lnk--> 980s, Palnetoke lost the fortress and the control of the Jomsvikings to the exiled Swedish prince <!--del_lnk--> Styrbj&ouml;rn the Strong. He allied with the Danish king, Harald, but brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbj&ouml;rn&#39;s uncle <!--del_lnk--> Eric the Victorious at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the F&yacute;risvellir, <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala, in <!--del_lnk--> 984 or <!--del_lnk--> 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms. The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact that the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones, the <!--del_lnk--> H&ouml;gby Runestone (<i>the brave champion Asmund fell on the <!--del_lnk--> Fyrisvellir</i>), <!--del_lnk--> DR 295 (<i>he did not flee at <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> DR 279 (<i>he did not flee at Uppsala, but fought as long as he had weapons</i>), from this time relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic <!--del_lnk--> skald <!--del_lnk--> &THORN;&oacute;rvaldr Hjaltason, who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;msv&iacute;kinga saga</i> tells that in <!--del_lnk--> 986, they attacked <!--del_lnk--> Haakon Jarl in <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> and were defeated in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Hj&ouml;rungav&aacute;gr. The <i><!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;msv&iacute;kinga saga</i> ends with a brief explanation of the battle&#39;s aftermath, and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but <i><!--del_lnk--> Olaf Trygvasson&#39;s Saga</i> relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Svolder in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by <!--del_lnk--> Sigvald Jarl abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet. This action may have been intended to fight the <!--del_lnk--> Christianization of Scandinavia which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf . As it happened though, the Danish king who won the Norwegian throne when the seabattle ended, <!--del_lnk--> Sweyn Forkbeard, was (at least nominally) a Christian. He and his father, <!--del_lnk--> Harald Bluetooth, the king of Denmark are reported to have been baptized in 965.<p>Jomsvikings are also reported to have raided eastern <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> in 1009, and made forays into various <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian territories during the early 1000&#39;s. Around 1013 the Jomsvikings were campaigning in England on behalf of Sveyn Forkbeard, yet switched sides, maybe in a ruse to get their own Danegeld from the English, while the main Viking invasion force drove <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready to <!--del_lnk--> Normandy. Their decline continued over the next few decades. In 1043, according to the Heimskringla, <!--del_lnk--> Magnus I of Norway decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat. He sacked Jomsborg, destroyed the fortress and put the surviving brethren to death.<p><a id="Archaeological_evidence" name="Archaeological_evidence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Archaeological evidence</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Runestones are counted as historic documents about the events of the Viking Age in Scandinavia. The following three runestones probably mention Jomsvikings who died with <!--del_lnk--> Styrbj&ouml;rn the Strong south of <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala. Note that the first runestone mentions a warleader named Toki Gormsson and he may be a son of the Danish king <!--del_lnk--> Gorm the Old, an interpretation which fits the fact that Styrbj&ouml;rn was allied with another son of Gorm, Harald Bluetooth. The idea Harald was the Jomsviking founder is probably a cross of wires.<ul>
       <li>The runestone <!--del_lnk--> DR 295 in <!--del_lnk--> H&auml;llestad, <!--del_lnk--> Hallandia says: <i>Eskil raised this stone after Toki Gormsson, his beloved warleader. He did not flee at Uppsala. Champions erected this stone after their brother on the hill. They went closest with Toki.</i><ul>
