<h2>Press Release</h2><p><strong>10/05/2007</strong></p>
<p>(10 May 2007) - UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador Angelina Jolie and actor Brad Pitt have donated one million dollars towards the humanitarian effort assisting more than four million people affected by the crisis in Darfur. </p><p>The donation from the Jolie-Pitt Foundation will go to three agencies playing key roles in Darfur and neighboring Chad: the UN Refugee Agency; the International Rescue Committee and the international NGO, <strong>SOS Children's Villages</strong>. All three agencies are active in providing life-saving humanitarian assistance to the more than two million people displaced within Darfur and the 240,000 refugees from Darfur living in camps in eastern Chad. </p><p>&ldquo;This generous donation comes just months after Angelina Jolie made a personal visit to a refugee camp in Chad and it shows, once again, her and Brad Pitts&rsquo; commitment to helping refugees and the displaced,&rdquo; said Michel Gabaudan, UNHCR&rsquo;s Regional Representative for the United States and the Caribbean. &ldquo;As Goodwill Ambassador, Ms Jolie&rsquo;s continued support of UNHCR and those we seek to help is a powerful force in ensuring they are not forgotten.&rdquo;</p><p>In New York, George Rupp, president of the International Rescue Committee, said, &quot;This donation will make a real difference in the lives of thousands of vulnerable people.  We are grateful to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt for remembering them.&quot; </p><p>Jolie has visited the region three times. During her recent visit to the Oure-Cassoni camp she said she was struck by the sense of hope she encountered and by the widespread desire for peace-keepers to be deployed in eastern Chad. </p><p>It was in Oure-Cassoni <strong>where Jolie met staff working for SOS Children's Villages</strong>, who are providing psychological assistance to traumatized children.  </p><p>&ldquo;The children benefit enormously from the therapy,&rdquo; said Yolanda van den Broek, project leader of the Emergency Relief Program of SOS Children's Villages in Chad. &ldquo;Children who at first did not speak, did not eat and who were isolated in their own worlds, are now playing happily and are able to interact with others.&ldquo;</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan_A.htm">Sudan</a>.</p>
