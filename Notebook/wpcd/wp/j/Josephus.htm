      <p>Josephus, who introduced himself in <!--del_lnk--> Greek as &quot;Iosepos (&Iota;&#x3CE;&sigma;&eta;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;), son of Matthias, an ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew, a priest from <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>&quot; , fought the Romans in the <!--del_lnk--> First Jewish-Roman War of <!--del_lnk--> 66-<!--del_lnk--> 73 as a Jewish military leader in <!--del_lnk--> Galilee. After the Jewish garrison of <!--del_lnk--> Yodfat was taken under siege, the Romans invaded, killed thousands, and the remaining survivors who had managed to elude the forces committed suicide. However, in circumstances that are somewhat unclear (see also <!--del_lnk--> Josephus problem), Josephus surrendered to the Roman forces invading Galilee in July <!--del_lnk--> 67. He became a prisoner and provided the Romans with intelligence on the ongoing revolt. The Roman forces were led by Flavius <!--del_lnk--> Vespasian and his son <!--del_lnk--> Titus, both subsequently <!--del_lnk--> Roman emperors. In <!--del_lnk--> 69 Josephus was released (cf. <i>War</i> IV.622-629) and according to Josephus&#39; own account, he appears to have played some role as a negotiator with the defenders in the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Jerusalem in <!--del_lnk--> 70.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 71 he arrived in Rome in the entourage of Titus, becoming a Roman citizen and Flavian client (hence he is often referred to as Flavius Josephus - see below). In addition to Roman citizenship he was granted accommodation in Vespasian&#39;s former homeland in conquered <!--del_lnk--> Judea, and a decent, if not extravagant, pension. It was while in Rome, and under Flavian patronage, that Josephus wrote all of his known works.<p>Although he only ever calls himself &quot;Josephus&quot;, he appears to have taken the Roman <!--del_lnk--> nomen Flavius and <!--del_lnk--> praenomen Titus from his patrons . This was standard for new citizens.<p>Around <!--del_lnk--> 70, Josephus divorced his first wife and married a Jewish woman from <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria by whom he had two children: a son Flavius Hyrcanus and a second child, about whom nothing is known. Around <!--del_lnk--> 75, he again divorced and, by a third marriage, produced two more sons, Flavius Justus and Simonides Agrippa.<p>Josephus&#39; life is beset with ambiguity. For his critics, he never satisfactorily explained his actions during the Jewish war &mdash; why he failed to commit suicide in Galilee in 67 with some of his compatriots, and why, after his capture, he cooperated with the Roman invaders. Hence, some have viewed Josephus as a traitor and informer and questioned his credibility as a historian &mdash; dismissing his works as Roman propaganda or as a personal <!--del_lnk--> apologetic, aimed at rehabilitating his reputation in history. Most Rabbinical commentators, however, have found him to be an upright Jew.<p>Nevertheless, he was unquestionably an important apologist in the Roman world for the Jewish people and culture, particularly at a time of conflict and tension. He always remained, in his own eyes, a loyal and law-observant Jew. He went out of his way both to commend Judaism to educated <!--del_lnk--> gentiles, and to insist on its compatibility with cultured <!--del_lnk--> Graeco-Roman thought. He constantly contended for the antiquity of <!--del_lnk--> Jewish culture, presenting its people as civilised, devout and philosophical.<p><!--del_lnk--> Eusebius reports that a statue of Josephus was erected in Rome.<p><a id="Significance_to_scholarship" name="Significance_to_scholarship"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Significance to scholarship</span></h2>
      <p>The works of Josephus provide crucial information about the First Jewish-Roman War. They are also important literary source for understanding the context of the <!--del_lnk--> Dead Sea Scrolls and post-<!--del_lnk--> Second Temple Judaism. Josephan scholarship in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> and early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> became focused on Josephus&#39; relationship to the sect of the <!--del_lnk--> Pharisees. He was consistently portrayed as a member of the sect, but nevertheless viewed as a villainous traitor to his own nation - a view which became known in Josephan studies as the classical conception. In the mid 20th century, this view was challenged by a new generation of scholars who formulated the modern conception of Josephus, still considering him a Pharisee but restoring his reputation in part as patriot and a historian of some standing. Recent scholarship since 1990 has sought to move scholarly perceptions forward by demonstrating that Josephus was not a Pharisee but an orthodox Aristocrat-Priest who became part of the Temple establishment as a matter of deference and not willing association (Cf. Steve Mason, Todd Beall, and Ernst Gerlach).<p>Josephus offers information about individuals, groups, customs and geographical places. His writings provide a significant, extra-biblical account of the post-exilic period of the <!--del_lnk--> Maccabees, the <!--del_lnk--> Hasmonean dynasty and the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Herod the Great. He makes references to the <!--del_lnk--> Sadducees, Jewish <!--del_lnk--> High Priests of the time, Pharisees and <!--del_lnk--> Essenes, the <!--del_lnk--> Herodian Temple, <!--del_lnk--> Quirinius&#39; census and the <!--del_lnk--> Zealots, and to such figures as <!--del_lnk--> Pontius Pilate, Herod the Great, <!--del_lnk--> Agrippa I and <!--del_lnk--> Agrippa II, <!--del_lnk--> John the Baptist, <!--del_lnk--> James the brother of Jesus, and a <!--del_lnk--> disputed reference to <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. He is an important source for studies of immediate post-Temple Judaism (and, thus, the context of <!--del_lnk--> early Christianity).<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>

      <p>His first work in Rome was an account of the Jewish War, addressed to certain &quot;upper barbarians&quot; &ndash; usually thought to be the Jewish community in <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> &ndash; in his &quot;paternal tongue&quot; (<i>War</i> I.3), arguably the Western <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic language. He then wrote a seven-volume account in <!--del_lnk--> Greek known to us as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Jewish War</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Bellum Iudaicum</i>). It starts with the period of the <!--del_lnk--> Maccabees and concludes with accounts of the fall of <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the Roman victory celebrations in Rome, the mopping-up operations, Roman military operations elsewhere in the Empire and the uprising in <!--del_lnk--> Cyrene. Together with the account in his <i>Life</i> of some of the same events, it also provides the reader with an overview of Josephus&#39; own part in the events since his return to Jerusalem from a brief visit to Rome in the early <!--del_lnk--> 60s (<i>Life</i> 13-17).<p>Rome cannot have been an easy place for a Jew in the wake of the suppression of the Jewish revolt. Josephus would have witnessed the marches of Titus&#39; triumphant legions leading their Jewish captives, and carrying trophies of despoiled treasure from the <!--del_lnk--> Temple in Jerusalem. He would have experienced the popular presentation of the Jews as a bellicose and misanthropic people.<p>It was against this background that Josephus wrote his <i>War</i>, and although often dismissed as pro-Roman propaganda (perhaps hardly surprising given where his patronage was coming from), he claims to be writing to counter anti-Judean accounts. He disputes the claim that the Jews serve a defeated god and are naturally hostile to Roman civilization. Rather, he blames the Jewish War on what he calls &quot;unrepresentative and <!--del_lnk--> over-zealous fanatics&quot; among the Jews, who led the masses away from their natural aristocratic leaders (like him), with disastrous results. He also blames some of the governors of Judea, but these he presents as atypical Romans: corrupt and incompetent administrators. Thus, according to Josephus, the traditional Jew was, should be, and can be, a loyal and peace-loving citizen. Jews can, and historically have, accepted Rome&#39;s hegemony precisely because of their faith that God himself gives empires their power.<p><a id="Jewish_Antiquities" name="Jewish_Antiquities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Jewish Antiquities</i></span></h3>
      <p>The next literary work by Josephus is his twenty-one volume <i><!--del_lnk--> Antiquities of the Jews</i>, completed in the last year of the emperor Flavius <!--del_lnk--> Domitian (between 1.9.<!--del_lnk--> 93 and 14.3.94, cf. AJ X.267). He claims that interested persons have pressed him to give a fuller account of the Jewish culture and constitution. Here, in expounding Jewish history, law and custom, he is entering into many philosophical debates current in Rome at that time. Again he offers an <i>apologia</i> for the antiquity and universal significance of the Jewish people.<p>Beginning with the story of <!--del_lnk--> Creation, he outlines Jewish history. <!--del_lnk--> Abraham taught <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> to the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egyptians</a>, who in turn taught the <!--del_lnk--> Greeks. <!--del_lnk--> Moses set up a senatorial priestly aristocracy, which like that of Rome resisted monarchy. The great figures of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">biblical stories</a> are presented as ideal philosopher-leaders. There is again an autobiographical appendix defending Josephus&#39; own conduct at the end of the war when he cooperated with the Roman forces.<p><a id="Against_Apion" name="Against_Apion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Against Apion</i></span></h3>
      <p>Josephus&#39; <i><!--del_lnk--> Against Apion</i> is a final two-volume defence of Judaism as <!--del_lnk--> classical <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, stressing its antiquity against what Josephus claimed was the relatively more recent traditions of the Greeks. Some anti-Judean allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer <!--del_lnk--> Apion, and myths accredited to <!--del_lnk--> Manetho are also exposed.<p><a id="Literature_about_Josephus" name="Literature_about_Josephus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literature about Josephus</span></h2>
