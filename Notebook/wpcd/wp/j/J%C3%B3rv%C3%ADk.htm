      <p>York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of <i>Eboracum</i> and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of <i>Eoforwic</i>. It was first captured in November <!--del_lnk--> 866 by a large army of Danish Vikings, called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Great Heathen Army&quot; by Anglo-Saxon chroniclers, which had landed in <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia and made their way north, aided by a supply of horses with which King <!--del_lnk--> Edmund of East Anglia bought them off and by civil in-fighting between royal candidates in the Anglian Kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria. Declaring a truce, the rivals for the throne of Northumbria joined forces but failed to retake the city in March <!--del_lnk--> 867, and with their deaths the kingdom <!--del_lnk--> Deira came under Danish control, and the Northumbrian royal court fled north to refuge in <!--del_lnk--> Bernicia. A Viking attempt against <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a> the same season failed and in <!--del_lnk--> 869 their efforts against <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> were fruitless in the face of opposition from Kings <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred and <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>.<p>J&oacute;rv&iacute;k became the capital of a flourishing small kingdom when the Danish warlord, Guthrum, headed for East Anglia, while Prince Halfdan Wide-Embrace of Sjaelland and Uppsala took the York throne in AD 876. Both were in the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw, as were their English subjects. While the Danish army was busy in the British Isles, the Swedish army was occupied with defence of the Danish and Swedish homelands where Halfdan&#39;s brothers were in control.<p>Jorvik was founded by the paternally <!--del_lnk--> Halfdan Ragnarsson as a Danish institution but was passed onto the Norwegians, who fought for it. Native Danish rulers who eventually made <!--del_lnk--> Jelling in <!--del_lnk--> Jutland the site of <!--del_lnk--> Gorm the Old&#39;s kingdom, were in the East Anglian Kingdom. The Five Boroughs/Jarldoms were based upon the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Lindsey and were a sort of frontier between each kingdom. King <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute the Great</a> would later &quot;reinstall&quot; a Norwegian dynasty of jarls in Northumbria(<!--del_lnk--> Eric of Hlathir), with a Danish dynasty of jarls in East Anglia (<!--del_lnk--> Thorkel). <!--del_lnk--> Northern England would continue to be a source of intrigue for the Norwegians until <!--del_lnk--> Harald III of Norway&#39;s death at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Stamford Bridge.<p>The area of the palace built by the Viking rulers was known as the Konungsg&aring;rthr and is today known as King&#39;s Square, which nucleates the <!--del_lnk--> Ainsty. New streets, lined by regular building fronts for timber houses were added to an enlarging city between AD 900 and 935, dates arrived at by tree-ring chronology carried out on remaining posts preserved in anaerobic clay subsoil. The Viking kingdom was absorbed into England in <!--del_lnk--> 954, without cramping its economic success: by <i>ca</i> <!--del_lnk--> 1000, the urban boom brought Viking J&oacute;rv&iacute;k to a population total second only to that of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> within the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. <!--del_lnk--> William the Conqueror brought the independence of J&oacute;rv&iacute;k to an end and established garrisoned castles in the city.<p><a id="Kings_of_J.C3.B3rv.C3.ADk" name="Kings_of_J.C3.B3rv.C3.ADk"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Kings of J&oacute;rv&iacute;k</span></h2>

      <p>From 1976 to 1981, the <!--del_lnk--> York Archaeological Trust conducted a five-year <!--del_lnk--> excavation in and around the street of Coppergate. This demonstrated that, in the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a>, J&oacute;rv&iacute;k&#39;s trading connections reached to the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and beyond: a cap made of silk survives, and coins from <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand were familiar enough and respected enough for a counterfeit to have passed in trade. Both these items, as well as a large human <!--del_lnk--> coprolite known as the <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds Bank turd, were famously recovered in York a millennium later. Amber from the Baltic is often expected at a Viking site and at J&oacute;rv&iacute;k an impractical and presumably symbolic axehead of amber was found. A <!--del_lnk--> cowrie shell indicates contact with the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> or the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. Christian and pagan objects have survived side-by-side, usually taken as a sign that Christians were not in positions of authority.<p>After the excavation, the York Archaeological Trust took the decision to recreate the excavated part of J&oacute;rv&iacute;k on the Coppergate site, and this is now the <!--del_lnk--> JORVIK Viking Centre.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3rv%C3%ADk&quot;</div>
