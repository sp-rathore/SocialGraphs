      <p>Jersey history is influenced by its strategic location between the northern coast of France and the southern coast of England; the island&#39;s recorded history extends over a thousand years.<p>Evidence of bronze-age and early iron-age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. While archaeological evidence of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> influence has been found, in particular the coastal headland site at Le Pinacle, Les Landes, where remains of a primitive structure are attributed to Roman temple worship (<i>fanum</i>), evidence for regular Roman occupation has yet to be established. Formerly under the control of Brittany and named <i>Angia</i>, also spelled <i>Agna</i>, Jersey became subject to Viking influence in the 9th century, one of the &quot;Norman Islands&quot;. The name for Jersey itself is sourced from a Viking heritage: the Norse suffix <i>-ey</i> for <i>island</i> can be found in many places around the northern European coasts. However the significance of the first part of the island&#39;s toponym is unclear. Among theories are that it derives from <i>jarth</i> (Norse: <i>earth</i>) or <i><!--del_lnk--> jarl</i>, or perhaps a personal name, Geirr, to give &quot;Geirr&#39;s Island&quot;. Alternatively support for a Celtic origin can be made with reference to the Gaulish <i>gar-</i> (<i>oak</i>), <i>ceton</i> (<i>forest</i>). It is also said to be a corruption of the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Caesarea</i>, the Roman name for the island, influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Old English suffix <i>-ey</i> for &quot;island&quot;; this is plausible if regional pronunciation of Latin implied that <i>Caesarea</i> was not pronounced [<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">kaisarea</span>] but [<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">t&#x283;e&#x2D0;sarea</span>], probably under the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Ecclesiastical pronunciation of Latin.<p>The island was eventually annexed to the Duchy of Normandy by <!--del_lnk--> William Longsword, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy in 933; his descendant, <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William the Conqueror</a>, <!--del_lnk--> conquered England in 1066, which led to the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> being governed under one monarch. The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates on the island, and Norman families living on their estates founded many of the historical Norman-French Jersey family names. <!--del_lnk--> King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to <!--del_lnk--> King Philip II Augustus, but retained possession of Jersey, along with Guernsey and the other Channel Islands; the islands have been internally self-governing since.<p>Islanders became involved with the <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland fisheries in the late <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> gave <!--del_lnk--> George Carteret, Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey, now part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>.<p>Trade laid the foundations of prosperity, aided by neutrality between England and France. The Jersey way of life involved agriculture, fishing, shipbuilding, and production of woollen goods until 19th century improvements in transport links brought tourism to the Island.<p>Jersey was occupied by <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> from <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1940, and was held until <!--del_lnk--> 9 May <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Jersey&#39;s legislature is the <!--del_lnk--> States of Jersey. It includes 53 <!--del_lnk--> elected members &mdash; 12 <!--del_lnk--> senators (elected for 6-year terms), 12 <!--del_lnk--> constables (heads of parishes elected for three-year terms), 29 <!--del_lnk--> deputies (elected for three-year terms); the Bailiff and the Deputy Bailiff (appointed to preside over the assembly and having a casting vote in favour of the status quo when presiding); and three non-voting members &mdash; the Dean of Jersey, the Attorney General, and the Solicitor General all appointed by the Crown. Government departments are run by a cabinet of ministers under a <!--del_lnk--> Chief Minister. The civil head of the Island is the <!--del_lnk--> Bailiff.<p>All current States Members have been elected as independents. Formally constituted political parties are unfashionable, although groups of &quot;like-minded members&quot; act in concert.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Democratic Alliance is the only party currently having States Members, although these were elected as independents. The <!--del_lnk--> Centre Party (Jersey) has committed to only proposing candidates for Senatorial elections, though members are free to, and have, stood for Deputy as independents. They would remain independent in the Chamber. <!--del_lnk--> Stuart Syvret is often reported to be of the <!--del_lnk--> Jersey Green Party.<p>The legal system is based on <!--del_lnk--> Norman customary law (including the <!--del_lnk--> Clameur de Haro), statute and <!--del_lnk--> English law; justice is administered by the Royal Court.<p><a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>&#39;s traditional title as head of state is that of <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy, but she does not hold that title formally. She reigns by her position as Queen over a crown dependency. Her representative in the island is the Lieutenant Governor, who has little but a token involvement in island politics. Since 2006 the incumbent Lieutenant Governor is <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway.<p><a id="Parishes" name="Parishes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parishes</span></h3>

      <p>Administratively, Jersey is divided into 12 <!--del_lnk--> parishes, all having access to the sea and named after the dedications of their ancient parish churches:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Grouville (historically <i>Saint Martin de Grouville</i>)<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Brelade<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Clement<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Helier<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint John<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Lawrence<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Martin (historically <i>Saint Martin le Vieux</i>)<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Mary<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Ouen<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Peter<li><!--del_lnk--> Saint Saviour<li><!--del_lnk--> Trinity</ul>
      <p>
       <br />
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> parishes of Jersey are further divided into <i><!--del_lnk--> vingtaines</i> (or, in St. Ouen, <i>cueillettes</i>), divisions which are historic and nowadays mostly used for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.<p>The Constable (or Conn&eacute;table) is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a three year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the States. The <!--del_lnk--> Procureur du Bien Public (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish, elected at a public election (since 2003 in accordance with the <i>Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003</i>; prior to that an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the <i>Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl&eacute;es paroissiales</i>). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for a mandate of three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and to be empowered to pass contract on behalf of the parish if so authorised by a Parish Assembly.<p><!--del_lnk--> Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (known as the Chef de Police) deputised for the Constable in the States of Jersey when the Constable was unable to attend a sitting of the States &mdash; this function has been abolished.<p><a id="International_relations" name="International_relations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International relations</span></h3>
      <p>Although diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown, Jersey negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the States of Jersey. Jersey maintains a permanent non-diplomatic representation in <!--del_lnk--> Caen, the <i>Maison de Jersey</i>. A similar office in St. Helier represents the <!--del_lnk--> Conseil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral of <!--del_lnk--> Manche and the <!--del_lnk--> Conseil r&eacute;gional of <!--del_lnk--> Basse-Normandie and hosts the Consulate of France.<p>Jersey is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> British-Irish Council, the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the <!--del_lnk--> Assembl&eacute;e parlementaire de la Francophonie. Jersey is aiming to become a full member of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth in its own right.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Federal Court of Justice of Germany ruled on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 2002 (case: II ZR 380/00), that under German law, for the purposes of &sect; 110 of the German Civil Procedures Act (ZPO), Jersey is to be deemed part of the UK and part of the EU as well. The European Union classes Jersey as a &quot;special territory&quot;. It is part of the Common Customs Territory.<p>Jersey is currently considering its stance on the signing of European treaties. Should the UK sign up to the single-currency treaty, Jersey may decline and choose to maintain the Pound on its own, endowed as it is with its own treasury and economic prosperity as a result of its status as one of the world&#39;s largest offshore financial centres.<p>In a survey carried out by <!--del_lnk--> Channel Television in the summer of <!--del_lnk--> 2000 700 people were questioned, with 68% supporting independence from the United Kingdom. Senator (now Deputy) Paul le Claire lodged a projet calling for Jersey&#39;s independence shortly thereafter. Subsequently, the Jersey Law Review published an editorial and articles touching on the possibility of full independence.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

It lies in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>, approximately 22.5 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres (12&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> nm) from the <!--del_lnk--> Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, and approximately 161 kilometres (100&nbsp;mi) south of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. It is the largest and southernmost of the Channel Islands.<p>The climate is temperate with mild winters and cool summers, it also averages the most sunshine per year in the British Isles. The terrain consists of a plateau sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north. The plateau is cut by valleys running generally north-south.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Jersey&#39;s economy is based on <!--del_lnk--> financial services, <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> electronic commerce and <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>; financial services contribute approximately 60 per cent of the Island&#39;s economy, and the Island is recognised as one of the <!--del_lnk--> leading offshore financial centres.<p>Major agricultural products are <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a> and dairy produce. The source of milk is <!--del_lnk--> Jersey cattle, a small breed of cow that has also been acknowledged (though not widely so) for the quality of its meat. Small-scale organic beef production has been reintroduced in an effort to diversify the industry.<p>Farmers and growers often sell surplus food and flowers in boxes on the roadside, relying on the honesty of those who pass to drop the correct change into the money box and take what they want.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Jersey was granted <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade Island status.<p>The absence of <!--del_lnk--> VAT has led to the recent growth of the &#39;fulfilment&#39; industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported to the UK, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting UK prices on the same products. The States of Jersey announced in 2005 limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way.<p><!--del_lnk--> Duty free goods are available for purchase on travel to and from the Island.<p>Aside from its banking and finance underpinnings Jersey also depends on tourism. Notable hotels include:<ul>
       <li>the Pomme d&#39;Or overlooking Liberation Square in St. Helier, which during the Occupation served as the German Navy Headquarters and from whose balcony the Liberation force raised the Union Flag on Liberation Day, <!--del_lnk--> 9 May <!--del_lnk--> 1945;<li>the Hotel de France, formerly the Imperial and the <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit college, in St. Saviour overlooking the town of St. Helier;<li>the Hotel L&#39;Horizon in St. Brelade&#39;s Bay.<li>La Grande Vere, in St. Helier overlooking St. Aubins Bay, with views of <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Castle and the Waterfront</ul>
      <p><a id="Taxation" name="Taxation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Taxation</span></h3>
      <p>Until the 20th century, the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey. The levying of imp&ocirc;ts (duties) was in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body&#39;s tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing <!--del_lnk--> income tax was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a <!--del_lnk--> flat rate of 20% for decades.<p>As VAT has not been levied in the Island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 13 May <!--del_lnk--> 2005 the States of Jersey approved the introduction of a <!--del_lnk--> goods and services tax, scheduled for 2008.<p><a id="Currency" name="Currency"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Currency</span></h3>

      <p>The Island plays host to large amount of people born outside Jersey; roughly 50% of the population are not originally from the island.<p>30% of the population is concentrated in <!--del_lnk--> Saint Helier, site of the only town. Of the roughly 87,000 people in Jersey, around two fifths are of Jersey/Norman descent and two fifths of British (English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish) descent. The largest minority groups in the island, after the British, are Portuguese (around 6% &mdash; especially <!--del_lnk--> Madeiran), Irish and Polish. The French community is also always present. The people of Jersey are often called Islanders, or in individual terms Jerseyman or Jerseywoman. Most Jersey-born people consider themselves British and value the special relationship between the British Crown and the Island.<p><!--del_lnk--> Religion in Jersey has a complex history and much diversity. The <!--del_lnk--> established church is the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. In the countryside, <!--del_lnk--> Methodism found its traditional stronghold. A minority of <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic can also be found in Jersey, with two Catholic private schools situated in the main town of Saint Helier (De <!--del_lnk--> La Salle being an all-boys Catholic school, and Beaulieu Convant School down the road being an all-girls school where the sisters still have a presence in school life).<p>Jersey, like most places in the western world, has an ageing population. Reasons for this change particular to Jersey are the emigration of young people seeking opportunities the Island cannot provide.<p>For immigration and nationality purposes the United Kingdom generally treats Jersey as though it were part of the UK. However, Jersey is constitutionally entitled to restrict immigration by non-Jersey residents and maintains its own immigration and border controls. Population is currently controlled by restrictions on those without <i>residential status</i> purchasing or renting property in the Island. Although Jersey&#39;s citizens are full British citizens, an endorsement restricting the right of establishment in European Union states other than the UK is placed in the Jersey passport of British citizens connected solely with the Channel Islands and Isle of Man. Those who have a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom, or who have lived in the United Kingdom for five years, are not subject to this restriction.<p>Censuses have been undertaken in Jersey since <!--del_lnk--> 1821, the most recent being the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 Census (taken 11 March on the island).<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>In the 19th century, the most spoken language was <!--del_lnk--> J&egrave;rriais, the island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> indigenous language. It is a <!--del_lnk--> variety of <!--del_lnk--> Norman. However, the number of J&egrave;rriais speakers has been decreasing. There have been efforts to revive the language in schools. J&egrave;rriais language is still spoken mostly by older people, most commonly in the country parishes. The highest number of declared J&egrave;rriais speakers is in the capital.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> dialects of J&egrave;rriais differ in <!--del_lnk--> phonology and, to a lesser extent, <!--del_lnk--> lexis between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in J&egrave;rriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. Anglicisation of the <!--del_lnk--> toponymy increased apace with the migration of English people into the island.<p>Some <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey. Only fragmentary wall-paintings remain from the rich mediaeval artistic heritage, after the wholesale <!--del_lnk--> iconoclasm of the <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist reformation of the 16th century.<p><!--del_lnk--> Printing arrived in Jersey only in the 1780s, but the Island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and J&egrave;rriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> J&egrave;rriais literature</i>.<p><!--del_lnk--> John Everett Millais, <!--del_lnk--> Elinor Glyn, and <!--del_lnk--> Wace are among Jersey&#39;s artistic figures. <!--del_lnk--> Lillie Langtry, the <i>Jersey Lily</i>, is the Island&#39;s most widely recognised cultural icon. The famous French writer, <a href="../../wp/v/Victor_Hugo.htm" title="Victor Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, lived in exile in Jersey 1852-1855.<p>The Island is particularly famous for the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Flowers, a carnival held annually since 1902.<p>The Island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> patron saint is Saint <!--del_lnk--> Helier.<h3> <span class="mw-headline">Food and drink</span></h3>

      <p>Seafood has traditionally been important to the cuisine of Jersey: <!--del_lnk--> mussels (called <i>moules</i> locally), <!--del_lnk--> oysters, <!--del_lnk--> lobster and <!--del_lnk--> crabs &mdash; especially <!--del_lnk--> spider crabs &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> ormers, and <!--del_lnk--> conger.<p>Jersey <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a> being very rich, <!--del_lnk--> cream and <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a> have played a large part in insular cooking. <i>(See <!--del_lnk--> Channel Island milk)</i> However there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey <!--del_lnk--> fudge, mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.<p><!--del_lnk--> Jersey Royal potatoes are the local variety of <!--del_lnk--> new potato, and the island is famous for its early crop of small potatoes from the south-facing c&ocirc;tils (steeply-sloping fields). They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Apple.htm" title="Apple">Apples</a> historically were an important crop. <i>Bourd&eacute;lots</i> are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (<i>l&eacute; ni&egrave;r beurre</i>), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices.<p>Among other traditional dishes are cabbage loaf, Jersey wonders (<i>les m&egrave;rvelles</i>), fliottes, bean crock (<i>les pais au fou</i>), <!--del_lnk--> nettle (<i>ortchie</i>) soup, vraic buns.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Cider.htm" title="Cider">Cider</a> used to be an important export.
