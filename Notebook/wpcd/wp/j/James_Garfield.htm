      <p>Garfield was born in <!--del_lnk--> Orange Township, now <!--del_lnk--> Moreland Hills, Ohio. His father died in 1833, when James Abram was 18 months old. He grew up cared for by his mother and an uncle.<p>In Orange Township, Garfield attended school, a predecessor of the <!--del_lnk--> Orange City Schools. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named <!--del_lnk--> Hiram College) in <!--del_lnk--> Hiram, Ohio. He then transferred to <!--del_lnk--> Williams College in <!--del_lnk--> Williamstown, Massachusetts, where he was a brother of <!--del_lnk--> Delta Upsilon. He graduated in 1856 as an outstanding student who enjoyed all subjects except <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>. He then taught at the Eclectic Institute. He was an instructor in <!--del_lnk--> classical languages for the 1856-1857 academic year, and was made principal of the Institute from 1857 to 1860.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1858, he married <!--del_lnk--> Lucretia Rudolph. They had seven children, five sons and two daughters: Eliza A. Garfield (1860-63); Harry A. Garfield (1863-1942); James R. Garfield (1865-1950); Mary Garfield (1867-1947); Irvin M. Garfield (1870-1951); Abram Garfield (1872-1958); and Edward Garfield (1874-76). One son, <!--del_lnk--> James Rudolph Garfield, followed him into politics and became <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of the Interior under President <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.<p>Garfield decided that the academic life was not for him and studied law privately. He was admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio <!--del_lnk--> bar in 1860. Even before admission to the bar, he entered politics. He was elected an Ohio state senator in 1859, serving until 1861. He was a <!--del_lnk--> Republican all his political life.<p>In 1876, Garfield discovered a novel proof of the <!--del_lnk--> Pythagorean Theorem using a <!--del_lnk--> trapezoid while serving as a member of the House of Representatives.

      </div>
      <p>With the start of the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, Garfield enlisted in the <!--del_lnk--> Union Army, and was assigned to command the 42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. General <!--del_lnk--> Don Carlos Buell assigned Colonel Garfield the task of driving <!--del_lnk--> Confederate forces out of eastern <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky in November 1861, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign. In December, he departed <!--del_lnk--> Catlettsburg, Kentucky, with the 40th and 42nd Ohio and the 14th and 22nd Kentucky infantry regiments, as well as the 2nd (West) Virginia Cavalry and McLoughlin&#39;s Squadron of Cavalry. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached <!--del_lnk--> Paintsville, Kentucky, where Garfield&#39;s cavalry engaged the Confederate cavalry at Jenny&#39;s Creek on <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1862. The Confederates, under <!--del_lnk--> Brig. Gen. <!--del_lnk--> Humphrey Marshall, withdrew to the forks of Middle Creek, two miles from <!--del_lnk--> Prestonsburg, Kentucky, on the road to <!--del_lnk--> Virginia. Garfield attacked on <!--del_lnk--> January 9. At the end of the day&#39;s fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, but Garfield did not pursue them. He ordered a withdrawal to <!--del_lnk--> Prestonsburg so he could resupply his men. His victory brought him early recognition and a promotion to the rank of brigadier general on <!--del_lnk--> January 11.<p>Garfield served as a brigade commander under Buell at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Shiloh and under <!--del_lnk--> Thomas J. Wood in the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Corinth. His health deteriorated and he was inactive until autumn, when he served on the commission investigating the conduct of <!--del_lnk--> Fitz John Porter. In the spring of 1863, Garfield returned to the field as Chief of Staff for <!--del_lnk--> William S. Rosecrans, commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Army of the Cumberland.<p><a id="Later_political_career" name="Later_political_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later political career</span></h2>
      <p>In 1863, he re-entered politics, being elected to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> for the <!--del_lnk--> 38th Congress. Garfield was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> major general after the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Chickamauga, shortly after he had had been elected. He left the army and returned to Ohio to take his seat in Congress. He succeeded in gaining re-election every two years up through 1878. In the House during the Civil War and the following <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction era, he was one of the most hawkish Republicans. In 1876, when <!--del_lnk--> James G. Blaine moved from the House to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>, Garfield became the Republican <!--del_lnk--> floor leader of the House.<p>In 1876, Garfield was a Republican member of the <!--del_lnk--> Electoral Commission that awarded 22 hotly-contested electoral votes to <a href="../../wp/r/Rutherford_B._Hayes.htm" title="Rutherford B. Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> in his <!--del_lnk--> contest for the Presidency against <!--del_lnk--> Samuel J. Tilden. That year, he also purchased the property in <!--del_lnk--> Mentor that reporters later dubbed <i>Lawnfield</i>, and from which he would go on to conduct the first successful <!--del_lnk--> front porch campaign for the Presidency. The home is now maintained by the <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service as the <!--del_lnk--> James A. Garfield National Historic Site.<p><a id="Election_of_1880" name="Election_of_1880"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Election of 1880</span></h2>

      <p>In 1880, Garfield&#39;s life underwent tremendous change with the publication of the <!--del_lnk--> Morey letter, and the end of <!--del_lnk--> Democratic U.S. Senator <!--del_lnk--> Allen Granberry Thurman&#39;s term. The Ohio <!--del_lnk--> legislature, which had recently again come under Republican control, chose Garfield to fill Thurman&#39;s seat. However, at the <!--del_lnk--> Republican National Convention Garfield gained support for the party&#39;s Presidential nomination, and on the 36th ballot Garfield was nominated, with virtually all of Blaine&#39;s and <!--del_lnk--> John Sherman&#39;s delegates breaking ranks to vote for the <!--del_lnk--> dark horse nominee. Ironically, the U.S. Senate seat to which Garfield had been chosen ultimately went to Sherman, whose Presidential candidacy Garfield had gone to the convention to support.<p>In the general election, Garfield defeated the Democratic candidate <a href="../../wp/w/Winfield_Scott_Hancock.htm" title="Winfield Scott Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>, another distinguished former Union Army general, by 214 electoral votes to 155. (The popular vote was much closer; see <!--del_lnk--> U.S. presidential election, 1880.) President Garfield took office on <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1881.<p><a id="Administration_and_Cabinet" name="Administration_and_Cabinet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Administration and Cabinet</span></h3>

      <p>Garfield was shot by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Julius Guiteau on <!--del_lnk--> July 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1881, at 9:30 a.m., less than four months after taking office. The President had been walking through the Sixth Street Station of the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (a predecessor of the <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>) in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, on his way to a college reunion, accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State <!--del_lnk--> James G. Blaine and his sons, James and <!--del_lnk--> Harry. As he was being arrested after the shooting, Guiteau excitedly said, &quot;I am a Stalwart of the <!--del_lnk--> Stalwarts! I did it and I want to be arrested! Arthur is President now,&quot; which briefly led to unfounded suspicions that Arthur or his supporters had put Guiteau up to the crime. (The Stalwarts strongly opposed Garfield&#39;s Half-Breeds; like many Vice Presidents, Arthur was chosen for political advantage, to placate his faction, rather than for skills or loyalty to his running-mate. It was thus conceivable that he might have been involved in the assassination). Guiteau was upset because of the rejection of his repeated attempts to be appointed as the United States <!--del_lnk--> consul in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>&mdash;a position for which he had absolutely no qualifications&mdash;and was mentally ill. Garfield&#39;s assassination was instrumental to the passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act on <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1883.<p>One bullet went through Garfield&#39;s shoulder and out his back, just missing an artery; the second bullet lodged in his chest and could not be found, although scientists today think that the bullet is near his lung. <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_Graham_Bell.htm" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> devised a <!--del_lnk--> metal detector in an attempt to find the bullet, but the metal bedframe Garfield was lying on made the instrument malfunction. Because metal bedframes were relatively rare, the cause of the instrument&#39;s deviation was unknown at the time. Garfield became increasingly ill over a period of several weeks due to infection, which caused his heart to weaken. He died of a massive <!--del_lnk--> heart attack or a ruptured splenic artery <!--del_lnk--> aneurysm, following <!--del_lnk--> blood poisoning and bronchial <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, at 10:35 p.m. on Monday, <!--del_lnk--> September 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1881, in <!--del_lnk--> Elberon, New Jersey, exactly two months before his 50th birthday. The ailing President had been moved to Elberon, a seaside community, in the vain hope that the fresh air and quiet there might aid his recovery.<p>Most historians and medical experts now believe that Garfield probably would have survived his wound had the doctors attending him been more capable. Several inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, and one doctor punctured Garfield&#39;s liver in doing so.<p>Guiteau was found guilty of assassinating Garfield, despite his lawyers raising an <!--del_lnk--> insanity defense. He insisted that incompetent medical care had really killed the President; although historians generally agree that while this was a contributing factor, it was not a legal defense. Guiteau was sentenced to death, and was executed by hanging on <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1882, in Washington, D.C.<div class="thumb tright">
