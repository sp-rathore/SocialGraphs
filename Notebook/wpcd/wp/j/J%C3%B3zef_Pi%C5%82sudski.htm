      <p><b>J&oacute;zef Klemens Pi&#x142;sudski</b> (<span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> [&#39;juz&epsilon;f piw&#39;sutski]</span>&nbsp;, <!--del_lnk--> December 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1867 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> May 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1935) was a <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary and <!--del_lnk--> statesman, <!--del_lnk--> Field Marshal, first <!--del_lnk--> Chief of State (1918&ndash;1922) and <!--del_lnk--> dictator (1926&ndash;1935), of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Polish Republic, as well as the leader of its <!--del_lnk--> armed forces. From the middle of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, until his death, Pi&#x142;sudski was the major influence in the foreign policy and government of Poland, and an important figure in European politics. He is considered to be largely responsible for Poland regaining its <!--del_lnk--> independence, one hundred and twenty three years after the <!--del_lnk--> partitions of Poland.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski was a supporter of the cause of Polish independence from his youth, and in his early political life was an influential member&mdash;and later, leader&mdash;of the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Socialist Party. He considered the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire to be the most formidable obstacle to Polish independence, and thus worked with <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> to ensure its defeat in the First World War. Later, he withdrew his support from the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers as it became more beneficial for the Polish cause to work with the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente. During the ensuing <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Soviet_War.htm" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a>, he commanded the <!--del_lnk--> 1920 Kiev Offensive and the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a>. From 1918 (the year Poland regained independence) until 1921, he was the <!--del_lnk--> Chief of State (<!--del_lnk--> Naczelnik Pa&#x144;stwa).<p>Later, as the <!--del_lnk--> Polish government became dominated by his political opponents from <i><!--del_lnk--> endecja</i> he withdrew from politics, but returned to power after <!--del_lnk--> the May 1926 <i>coup d&#39;&eacute;tat</i>, becoming the <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> <!--del_lnk--> dictator of Poland. From then on, he primarily concentrated on <!--del_lnk--> military and <!--del_lnk--> foreign affairs, until his death in 1935. To this day, he is held in high regard by most of the <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> public.<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Pi&#x142;sudski was born in the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian Empire</a> in the village of <!--del_lnk--> Zu&#x142;&oacute;w (today Zalavas, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>) to a Polish <i><!--del_lnk--> szlachta</i> family of Lithuanian ancestry. He attended school in <!--del_lnk--> Wilno (today Vilnius, Lithuania), but was not especially diligent in his school studies. As a boy, he was introduced by his mother, Maria Bilewicz&oacute;wna, to Polish literature and history, which was suppressed by the Russian authorities. His father, also named J&oacute;zef, fought in the 1863 <!--del_lnk--> January Uprising against the Russian occupation of Poland. His families had strong patriotic inclinations, and Pi&#x142;sudski was much troubled by the <!--del_lnk--> Russification programs of the Russian government. For example, Pi&#x142;sudski was compelled to attend <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> services, which he found deeply distasteful.<p>In 1885, he began studying <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Kharkov (modern <!--del_lnk--> Kharkiv, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>), where he became involved with <!--del_lnk--> Narodnaya Vola revolutionary movement, part of the Russian <i><!--del_lnk--> Narodniki</i>. In 1886 he was suspended for participation in student demonstrations. He was also rejected by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Dorpat (now Tartu), Estonia, whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation. On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by the Tsarist authorities on a false charge of plotting to assassinate <!--del_lnk--> Tsar <!--del_lnk--> Alexander III with Vilnian <!--del_lnk--> socialists. In fact, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s main connection to that plan was the involvement in it of his elder brother, <!--del_lnk--> Bronis&#x142;aw Pi&#x142;sudski. Bronis&#x142;aw had been friends with friends of <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>&#39;s brother, <!--del_lnk--> Aleksandr Ulyanov, and was sentenced to <!--del_lnk--> hard labor (<i><!--del_lnk--> katorga</i>) in eastern Siberia, for fifteen years.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski was sentenced to a punishment milder then his brother: <!--del_lnk--> exiled for five years to eastern <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, first to <!--del_lnk--> Kirinsk on the river <!--del_lnk--> Lena, and later to <!--del_lnk--> Tunka. As an exilee, Pi&#x142;sudski was allowed to work in occupation of his chosing, although for being a Polish noble local officials decided he was not entitled to receive the 10-<!--del_lnk--> ruble pension most other exilees received. During his voyage in a prisoner&#39;s convoy to Siberia, he was held for few weeks in a prison in <!--del_lnk--> Irkutsk. There, he took part in a &#39;revolt&#39; of prisoners: after one of prisoners insulted a guard and refused to aplogize, he and others political prisoners were brutally beaten down by the prison guards for their defiance; Pi&#x142;sudski lost two of his teeth there and took part in a subsequent <!--del_lnk--> hunger strike until the authorities reinstated the priviliges of political prisoners they suspended after the &#39;revolt&#39;. For his involvement in this event, he was, in 1888, sentenced to six months imprisonment; he had to spend the first night of his incarceration in a 40-degree below zero Siberian cold; this led to an ilness that nearly killed him then and to various health problem that would plague him throughout his life. During the years of exile to Siberia, Pi&#x142;sudski meet many <!--del_lnk--> Sybiraks, among them <!--del_lnk--> Bronis&#x142;aw Szwarce, who almost became one of the leaders of the <!--del_lnk--> January Uprising..<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Pi&#x142;sudski, after his release in 1892, joined the Lithuanian branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Socialist Party (PPS) in 1893,  forming the Lithuanian branch of PPS.Initially, he sided with the Socialists&#39; more radical wing, but despite the ostensible internationalism of the Socialist movement, he always remained a Polish nationalist. As a <!--del_lnk--> chief editor he began publishing a <i><!--del_lnk--> bibu&#x142;a</i> <!--del_lnk--> socialist <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Robotnik</i> (The Worker) from 1894; he would be one of his chief writers. From 1895, he became one of the PPS leaders, where he took the stance that doctrinal issues are of minor importance and <!--del_lnk--> socialist ideology should be merged with <!--del_lnk--> nationalist one, as that combination gave the biggest chance to regain Polish independence. In 1899, during his time as an underground organizer, Pi&#x142;sudski married a fellow <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialist</a> organizer, <!--del_lnk--> Maria Juszkiewiczowa z Koplewskich, but his marriage started to come apart when several years later Pi&#x142;sudski started an affair with a younger female Socialist, <!--del_lnk--> Aleksandra Zahorska. Maria died in 1921 and Pi&#x142;sudski married Aleksandra in October of that year. They had two daughters (Wanda and Jadwiga), but this marriage also had its own troubles.<p>In February 1900, after the Russian authorities found <i>Robotnik&#39;</i>s underground <!--del_lnk--> printing press in <!--del_lnk--> &#x141;&oacute;d&#x17A;, Pi&#x142;sudski was imprisoned at the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Citadel but, after feigning <!--del_lnk--> mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a <!--del_lnk--> mental hospital at <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a> with the help of <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Mazurkiewicz and others, fleeing to <!--del_lnk--> Galicia, then a region of <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary.<p>On the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War (1904&ndash;1905), in summer 1904, Pi&#x142;sudski travelled to <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, where he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain that country&#39;s assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with <!--del_lnk--> intelligence in support of her war with Russia and proposed a plan to create a <!--del_lnk--> legion from Poles, <!--del_lnk--> conscripted into the Russian army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Promethean&quot; project directed at liberating <!--del_lnk--> ethnic communities occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire &mdash; a goal that he later continued to pursue and that would be partly achieved only in 1991 with the disintegration of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Interestingly, in the same time period, another notable Pole, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Dmowski, also travelled to Japan, where he argued against Pi&#x142;sudski plan trying to discourage Japanese government from supporting the Polish revolution at this time, an insurrection which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure. A Polish patriot himself, Dmowski would remain Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s political arch-enemy until the end of his life (he actually outlived Pi&#x142;sudski). In the end, Japanese offered only a limited assistance to Pi&#x142;sudski; he received Japan&#39;s help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and the combat organisation associated with the party, but the Japanese declined the legion proposal; it was much less than he hoped for.<p>In fall 1904, Pi&#x142;sudski founded an armed organization, the &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Boj&oacute;wki</i>&quot; (&quot;combat teams&quot;), to create an armed <!--del_lnk--> resistance movement aimed against the Russian authorities. PPS organized an increasing number of demonstrations (mostly in <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>); on <!--del_lnk--> October 28, 1904 Russian <!--del_lnk--> Cossack cavalry trampled one of the demonstrations, in revenge, on <!--del_lnk--> November 13 the &#39;boj&oacute;wki&#39; opened fire on the Russian police and military during a new demonstration. First concentrating on fighting the spies and informants, in March 1905 &#39;boj&oacute;wki&#39; started using <!--del_lnk--> bombs to <!--del_lnk--> assassinate selected members of Russian police.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Revolution of 1905, Pi&#x142;sudski played a leading role in events in <!--del_lnk--> Congress Poland In early 1905, he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there. It involved some 400,000 workers, and lasted two months before it was broken by the Russian authorities. In June 1905, Pi&#x142;sudski ordered an uprising in <!--del_lnk--> &#x141;&oacute;d&#x17A;. During the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> June Days&quot;, as the &#x141;&oacute;d&#x17A; uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between gunmen loyal to Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s PPS and those loyal to <!--del_lnk--> Roman Dmowski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> National Democratic Party (<i>Endeks</i>). On <!--del_lnk--> December 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1905, Pi&#x142;sudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; his call was widely ignored. Unlike the <i>Endeks</i>, Pi&#x142;sudski ordered the PPS to boycott the elections to the First <!--del_lnk--> Duma. The decision to boycott the elections and to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused much tension within the PPS, and, in November 1906, a faction of the party split off in protest of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s leadership. The Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s faction was known as <i>Old Faction</i> or the <i>Revolution Faction</i> (Starzy, <!--del_lnk--> Frakcja Rewolucyjna), while their opponents were known as the <i>Young Faction</i>, <i>Moderate Faction</i> or the <i>Left Wing</i> (M&#x142;odzi, <i>Frakcja Umiarkowana</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Lewica). The Youngs sympathized with the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and believed that the priority should be cooperation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the <!--del_lnk--> tsardom and creating a <!--del_lnk--> socialist <!--del_lnk--> utopia first, and negotiation for independence would be easier later. Pi&#x142;sudski with his supporters from the revolutionary faction of the PPS, continued to plan a revolution against tsarist Russia which would secure Polish independence first. By 1909 Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s faction would be the majority faction of PPS again, and Pi&#x142;sudski would remain one of the most important leaders of PPS until the <!--del_lnk--> First World War.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski anticipated a coming European war and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish army that could help win Poland&#39;s independence from the three empires that had <!--del_lnk--> partitioned her out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906, Pi&#x142;sudski, with the connivance and support of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in <!--del_lnk--> Krak&oacute;w for the training of <i>Boj&oacute;wki</i>. In 1906 alone, the 800-strong <i>Boj&oacute;wki</i>, operating in five-man units in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; the number of casualties declined in the coming years; while the number of its members increased (to around 2,000 in 1908). &#39;Boj&oacute;wki&#39; also assaulted Russian transports of money leaving Polish territories. In April/September 1908, the <i>Boj&oacute;wki</i> robbed a Russian mail train carrying <!--del_lnk--> tax revenues from <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> to <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>. Pi&#x142;sudski, who took part in the <!--del_lnk--> raid at Bezdany near Vilna 1908, used those funds to aid his secret military organization. The loot from that single raid (200,812 <!--del_lnk--> rubles--or approximately $100,000) was a virtual fortune in contemporary Eastern Europe and equaled the amount &#39;Boj&oacute;wki&#39; looted in the two previous years.<p>In 1908, Pi&#x142;sudski transformed the &quot;Combat Teams&quot; to &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Zwi&#x105;zek Walki Czynnej</i>&quot; (Association for Active Struggle), headed by three of his associates, <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Sikorski, <!--del_lnk--> Marian Kukiel, and <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Sosnkowski. One of the main purposes of ZWC was to train officers and NCOs for the future Polish army. In 1910 two legal <!--del_lnk--> paramilitary organisations were created in the Austrian partitional zone (one in <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w and the second in <!--del_lnk--> Cracow), to conduct training and lectures in military science. In 1912, Pi&#x142;sudski became the Commander-in-Chief of Zwi&#x105;zek Strzelecki (under the codename &#39;Mieczys&#x142;aw&#39;). With the permission of Austrian authorities, Pi&#x142;sudski founded a series of &quot;sporting clubs,&quot; followed by a <!--del_lnk--> riflemen&#39;s association that served as cover for training a Polish military force that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men. In 1914, Pi&#x142;sudski declared that &quot;only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation&quot;.<p><a id="World_War_I" name="World_War_I"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h3>

      <p>At a meeting in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1914, Pi&#x142;sudski presciently declared that in the imminent war, for Poland to regain her independence, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> must be beaten by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers (the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian and <!--del_lnk--> German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Britain and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. At the same time, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Dmowski, leader of another faction of the Polish nationalist movement, believed the best way to achieve a unified and independent <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, was to support the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Entente against the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Alliance.<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> he set out from <!--del_lnk--> Krak&oacute;w at the head of a well-trained group of units, with which he entered the Russian partitioned Poland and took control of a border strip evacuated by the Russians near <!--del_lnk--> Kielce, but failed to encourage a national uprising. Next he made an alliance with Austria, and officially established the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Legion, taking personal command of its <!--del_lnk--> First Brigade, which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles. However, he secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914, that his Legions would never fight against France and Britain--only against Russia. Within the Legions, Pi&#x142;sudski decreed that personnel were to be addressed by the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French-Revolution</a>-inspired &quot;Citizen,&quot; and he himself was referred to as &quot;the Commandant&quot; (&quot;<i>Komendant</i>&quot;). Pi&#x142;sudski commanded extreme respect and loyalty of his men that would remain for years to come. The Polish Legion fought with distinction against Russia at the side of the Central Powers until 1917. Soon after the formation of the Legions, and also in 1914, Pi&#x142;sudski also formed another secter organization, the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Military Organisation (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa), which served as a precursor to the <!--del_lnk--> Polish intelligence and was designed to carry out espionage and sabotage missions.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1916, the Central Powers proclaimed the &quot;independence&quot; of Poland, hoping that as a result Polish troops would be sent to the eastern front against Russia, relieving German forces to bolster the Western front. Pi&#x142;sudski agreed to serve in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Poland&quot; created by the Central Powers, but insisted that his men not be treated as &quot;German <!--del_lnk--> colonial troops&quot; and only be used to fight <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Pi&#x142;sudski, then serving as <!--del_lnk--> minister of war in the newly created <!--del_lnk--> Polish Regency government, also opposed the demand that the Polish units swear loyalty to Germany and Austria. In the aftermath of the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a> and worsening situation of the Central Powers, Pi&#x142;sudski increasingly took an uncompromising stance. In the aftermath of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oath crisis</i>, in July 1917, where he forbade Polish soldiers to take an oath of loyalty to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at <!--del_lnk--> Magdeburg; the Polish units were then disbanded and soldiers incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian army, and the Polish Military Organizations started attacking German targets. The arrest vastly increased Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s reputation among Poles, and many in the Polish society began to see him as the most consequent and determined of the Polish leaders, willing to fight against all partitioners.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1918, Pi&#x142;sudski and his comrade, <!--del_lnk--> Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Sosnkowski, were released from Magdeburg and soon &mdash; like <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> before them &mdash; placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as increasingly desperate Germans were hoping Pi&#x142;sudski would gather forces friendly to them.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 11, in <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Pi&#x142;sudski was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Commander in Chief of the Polish forces by the <!--del_lnk--> Regency Council and was entrusted with the mission of creating a national government in the newly independent country; on that day, he proclaimed an independent Polish state (that day would become the Polish <!--del_lnk--> independence day). He negotiated the retreat of the German garrison from Warsaw and other German troops from the <!--del_lnk--> Ober-Ost (Eastern front) and on 14 November 1918, he was asked to provisionally supervise the running of the country, and, on 22 November, he officially received the title of Provisional <!--del_lnk--> Chief of State (<i><!--del_lnk--> Naczelnik Pa&#x144;stwa</i>), of renascent Poland from the new government of <!--del_lnk--> J&#x119;drzej Moraczewski.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Provisional People&#39;s Government of the Republic of Poland, formed in <!--del_lnk--> Lublin, bowed to Pi&#x142;sudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly Socialist and immediately introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the <!--del_lnk--> Polish Socialist Party (e.g. the 8-hour day, free school education, vote for women). This was absolutely necessary to avoid major unrest. However, Pi&#x142;sudski believed that as head of state he must be above political parties, and the day after his arrival in <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialist</a>-style as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Comrade&quot; (&quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> Towarzysz</i>&quot;) and asked for support of their revolutionary policies; Pi&#x142;sudski rebuked them with his famous remark that &quot;I took the red tram of socialism to the stop named Independence, but that&#39;s where I got off&quot;. He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own. He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.<p>In the days immediately after the World War I, Pi&#x142;sudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region&#39;s wealth by at least 10%. A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: &quot;I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one&#39;s eye at almost every turn&quot;. In addition, Pi&#x142;sudski had to transform the different systems of <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> administration in the former German, Austrian and Russian partitions of Poland into one; there were nine different <!--del_lnk--> legal systems, five <a href="../../wp/c/Currency.htm" title="Currency">currencies</a>, 66 types of <!--del_lnk--> rail systems (with 165 models of <!--del_lnk--> locomotives), and other similar problems, which all had to be urgently consolidated.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski drove himself hard, working all day and, on a <!--del_lnk--> regimen of tea and chain-smoked cigarettes, all night. He maintained a <!--del_lnk--> Spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant, and became increasingly pale and thin. Though Pi&#x142;sudski was very popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years&#39; underground work), of a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.<p>The first Polish government and Pi&#x142;sudski were also distrusted in the West because Pi&#x142;sudski had cooperated with the Central Powers in 1914-17 and because he had supported the formation of a Socialist government. It was not until January 1919, when the world-famed pianist and composer <!--del_lnk--> Ignacy Jan Paderewski became <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister (also Foreign Minister) of a new government, that it was recognized in the West. That still left two separate governments claiming to be the legitimate government of Poland: Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s in Warsaw, and <!--del_lnk--> Roman Dmowski&#39;s in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Pi&#x142;sudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Pi&#x142;sudski acting as provisional <!--del_lnk--> president and supreme <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Peace Conference of 1919.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski often clashed with Dmowski, at variance with the latter&#39;s vision of the Poles as the dominant nationality in reborn Poland, and irked by Dmowski&#39;s attempt to send the <!--del_lnk--> Blue Army back to Poland through <!--del_lnk--> Danzig, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> (modern <!--del_lnk--> Gda&#x144;sk, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>).<p>On 20 February 1919, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (<!--del_lnk--> Sejm). However, the Sejm reinstated his office in the <!--del_lnk--> Small Constitution. The word Provisional was removed from the title; and Pi&#x142;sudski would hold that office until 9 December 1922, when <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Narutowicz was elected the first <!--del_lnk--> President of Poland.<p><a id="Polish-Soviet_War" name="Polish-Soviet_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Polish-Soviet War</span></h3>

      <p>Speaking of Poland&#39;s future frontiers, Pi&#x142;sudski said: &quot;All that we can gain in the west depends on the <!--del_lnk--> Entente &mdash; on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany,&quot; while in the east &quot;there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far&quot;.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski aspired to create a <!--del_lnk--> federation (to be called <i><!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze</i>, &quot;Between-Seas,&quot; stretching once again from the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic</a> to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>), of Poland with Lithuania, <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> and independent Ukraine, somewhat in emulation of the pre-partition <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>, but with the smaller Poland surrounded by a federation of friendly nations.

      <p>In 1919, there was unrest on all Polish borders. Pi&#x142;sudski viewed the <!--del_lnk--> Bolsheviks as less dangerous for Poland than their <!--del_lnk--> Russian-civil-war contenders, as the White Russians were not willing to accept Poland&#39;s independence, while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the <!--del_lnk--> partitions of Poland null and void. As such, by his refusal to join the attack on <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin&#39;s</a> struggling <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> government, ignoring strong pressure from the <!--del_lnk--> Entente Cordiale, Pi&#x142;sudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in summer-fall 1919. In the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the <!--del_lnk--> Polish-Ukrainian War, but soon it became apparent that the real enemy of both nations was the <!--del_lnk--> Bolsheviks.<p>In April 1920, <!--del_lnk--> Marshal Pi&#x142;sudski (as his rank had been since that March) signed an <!--del_lnk--> alliance with Ukraine&#39;s leader, <!--del_lnk--> Symon Petliura, to conduct a joint operation against the <!--del_lnk--> Russian SFSR. The Polish-Ukrainian alliance treaty, signed on <!--del_lnk--> 22 April, had the goal of establishing an independent Ukraine in alliance with Poland. In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to <!--del_lnk--> East Galicia, and was denounced for this by the Ukrainian leaders there. The Polish and Ukrainian armies, under Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s command, launched <!--del_lnk--> a successful offensive against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On <!--del_lnk--> May 7, with remarkably little fighting, they captured <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Soviets launched their own successful counteroffensive from <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> counter-attacked in Ukraine, advancing into Poland in a drive toward Germany in order to encourage the <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">communist</a> movements (like the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of Germany) struggling to take power. The Soviets confidence soared as Soviet communist theorist <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Bukharin, writer for the newspaper <!--del_lnk--> Pravda, wished for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw &quot;right up to London and Paris&quot;. General&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Tukhachevsky order of the day, <!--del_lnk--> 2 July <!--del_lnk--> 1920 read: &quot;To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to world-wide conflagration. March on <!--del_lnk--> Vilno, <!--del_lnk--> Minsk, <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>!&quot; and &quot;onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!&quot;.<p>The National Democracts argued that the string of Bolshevik victories was Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s fault and demanded his resignation. On 12 August, Pi&#x142;sudski presented his resignation to the Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Wincenty Witos, but he refused to accept it. Over the next few weeks Polish risky, unconventional strategy at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a> (August 1920) managed to halt the Soviet advance.<p>The Polish plan was developed by Pi&#x142;sudski and others, like <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz Rozwadowski. Later, some supporters of Pi&#x142;sudski tried to portray him as the sole inventor of the Polish strategy, while his opponents would try to minimize his role. The plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the Vistula River and defend the bridgeheads at <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Wieprz River, while some 25% of available <!--del_lnk--> divisions concentrated to the south for a strategic counter-offensive.<p>Next Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s plan required that two armies under General <!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;zef Haller facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, hold their en<!--del_lnk--> trenched positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Sikorski was to strike north from behind Warsaw, thus cutting off the Soviet forces attempting to envelope Warsaw from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small (approximately 20,000-man), newly assembled &quot;Reserve Army&quot; (known also as the &quot;Strike Group&quot; &mdash; <i>Grupa Uderzeniowa</i>), commanded personally by Pi&#x142;sudski, comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northern offensive, from the Vistula-<!--del_lnk--> Wieprz River triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern Fronts. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski&#39;s army and the &quot;Strike Group&quot; would close near the East Prussian border, resulting in the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At the time, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other army commanders to go along with it. Although based on fairly reliable intelligence, including intercepted Soviet <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> communications, the plan was termed &quot;amateurish&quot; by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s lack of a formal military education. When a copy of the plan accidentally fell into the Soviets&#39; hands, Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, they paid dearly for their mistake, when during the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a> the overconfident <!--del_lnk--> Red Army suffered one of its largest defeats in history.<p>An &quot;Endek&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Sejm deputy, <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Stro&#x144;ski, coined the phrase, &quot;Miracle at the Wis&#x142;a&quot; (Polish: &quot;Cud nad Wis&#x142;&#x105;&quot;), to underline his disapproval of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s &quot;Ukrainian adventure.&quot; Stro&#x144;ski&#39;s phrase was adopted by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles praising Pi&#x142;sudski, unaware of Stro&#x144;ski&#39;s ironic intent. The Marshal&#39;s Polish detractors also sought to ascribe the winning strategy to General <!--del_lnk--> Maxime Weygand of the <!--del_lnk--> French military mission to Poland. Later, a junior member of that mission, <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle, would adopt some lessons from the war as well as from Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s career.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Riga (1921), closing the Polish-Soviet War, which Pi&#x142;sudski called an <i>act of cowardice</i>, partitioned the Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia. This treaty, and general <!--del_lnk--> Lucjan &#x17B;eligowski capture of <!--del_lnk--> Wilno from the Lithuanians, marked an end to Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s federalist dream.<p><a id="Early_retirement_and_return_to_power" name="Early_retirement_and_return_to_power"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early retirement and return to power</span></h3>
      <p>After the Polish <!--del_lnk--> constitution adopted in March 1921 (<!--del_lnk--> March Constitution) severely limited the powers of the <!--del_lnk--> presidency in the new <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democratic</a> <!--del_lnk--> Second Polish Republic, Pi&#x142;sudski refused to run for the office of president. On 9 December 1922, he turned over his powers to his friend, the newly elected president, <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Narutowicz. Five days later, after his inauguration, Narutowicz was shot dead by a mentally deranged, <!--del_lnk--> right-wing, <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semitic <!--del_lnk--> painter and <!--del_lnk--> art critic, <!--del_lnk--> Eligiusz Niewiadomski, who had originally wanted to kill Pi&#x142;sudski. When a right-wing government subsequently came to power, Pi&#x142;sudski found it impossible to work with <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Wincenty Witos, whom he regarded as morally responsible for the incident. In May 1923 Pi&#x142;sudski disgustedly resigned as <!--del_lnk--> chief of the <!--del_lnk--> general staff and went into retirement outside Warsaw to his country house at <!--del_lnk--> Sulej&oacute;wek, where he settled down to literary work and political writings, especially a series of books of political and military memoirs.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Meanwhile, the economy of Poland was in shambles. <!--del_lnk--> Hyperinflation fueled public dissent and Polish government was unable to find a quick solution to civil unrest, mounting <!--del_lnk--> unemployment and economic crisis. Allies and supporters of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s repeatedly asked him to return to politics and he begun to create a new powerbase, centered around the former members of the Legions and Polish Military Organizations, as well as some <!--del_lnk--> left-wing and <i><!--del_lnk--> intelligencja</i> parties. In 1925, when several Polish governments resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming more and more chaotic, Pi&#x142;sudski was increasingly critical of the government, giving many interviews, and eventually issued several statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet. When the government now showed signs of stabilization, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> endecja</i> coalition <!--del_lnk--> Chjeno-Piast, strongly criticized by Pi&#x142;sudski, formed a new government, on May 12-14 1926, Pi&#x142;sudski returned to power in a military <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;etat (the <!--del_lnk--> May Coup), aided by socialist railwaymen whose strike paralysed communications and prevented government reinforcements from reaching <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>.<p>President <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Wojciechowski and Prime Minister Witos stepped down. Pi&#x142;sudski, however, did not accept the office of president, aware of its limited powers. 215 soldiers and 164 civilians were killed during those events, and over 900 people were wounded (many of them were careless bystanders). J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s formal offices &mdash; apart from two terms as <!--del_lnk--> prime minister in 1926-28 and 1930 &mdash; were for the most part limited to those of <!--del_lnk--> minister of defence and <!--del_lnk--> inspector-general of the <!--del_lnk--> armed forces. He also held the offices of minister of military affairs and chairman of the council of war.<p><a id="The_period_of_authoritarian_rule" name="The_period_of_authoritarian_rule"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The period of authoritarian rule</span></h3>

      <p>In internal politics, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s coup meant in reality the end of parliamentary government in Poland for the next 10 years, as Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Sanacja</i> government (1926-1939) &mdash; conducted at times by <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian means &mdash; directed at restoring &quot;moral health&quot; to public life. Pi&#x142;sudski quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters, declaring that his coup was to be a &quot;revolution without revolutionary consequences&quot;. From 1928 Sanacja was represented by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bezpartyjny Blok Wsp&oacute;&#x142;pracy z Rz&#x105;dem</i> party. Popular support and elegant rhetoric allowed Pi&#x142;sudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled by the president, who in any case had been nominated by the Marshal, nor by Sejm, whose powers were curtailed in constitutional amendments introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926.<p>One of the main goals for Pi&#x142;sudski, who was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, was to transform the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> into a <!--del_lnk--> presidential system. The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935, tailored by Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s supporters to his specifications &mdash; providing for <!--del_lnk--> a strong presidency &mdash; came too late for Pi&#x142;sudski to seek that office; but the <!--del_lnk--> April Constitution would serve Poland up to the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and would carry its <!--del_lnk--> Government in Exile through to the end of the war and beyond. Nonetheless Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s reign depended more on his <!--del_lnk--> charismatic authority than on <!--del_lnk--> rational-legal authority. None of his followers could claim to be his successor and after his death the <i>Sanacja</i> would quickly fracture, with Poland returning to the pre-Pi&#x142;sudski era of parliamentary political struggles.<p>Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s regime marked the much needed stabilization and improvements in the situation of <!--del_lnk--> ethnic minorities, which formed almost a third of the population of the Second Republic. Pi&#x142;sudski replaced <i>endecja&#39;s</i> &#39;<!--del_lnk--> ethnic assimilation&#39; with the &#39;state assimilation&#39; policy: citizens were judged by their loyalty to the state, not by their nationality. The years 1926-1935, and Pi&#x142;sudski himself, were favourably viewed by many <!--del_lnk--> Polish Jews, whose situation improved especially under the cabinet of the Pi&#x142;sudski-appointed prime minister <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Bartel. However a combination of various reasons, from the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression to the <!--del_lnk--> vicious spiral of terrorist attacks by <!--del_lnk--> Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and government pacifications meant that the situations of minorities of Poland was less than satisfactory, despite Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s efforts.<p>From 1926 to 1930, Pi&#x142;sudski used mostly <a href="../../wp/p/Propaganda.htm" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> tools to weaken the position and influence of the opposition leaders. The culmination of his dictatorial and &#39;above the law&#39; policies came in 1930 with imprisonment of certain political opponents before the <!--del_lnk--> Polish legislative election, 1930, and the establishment of the prison for <!--del_lnk--> political prisoners in Bereza Kartuska (today <!--del_lnk--> Biaroza) where some prisoners were beaten and brutally mistreated. After the 1930 victory of BBWR Pi&#x142;sudski left most of the internal matters in the hands of his &quot;colonels&quot;, himself concentrating on military and foreign affairs.<p>In the realm of military, Pi&#x142;sudski, once a great military strategist responsible for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Miracle at Vistula</i>, had been criticized for concentrating on <!--del_lnk--> personnel management, and ignoring development of new plans, strategies or military equipment.<p><a id="Foreign_policy" name="Foreign_policy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign policy</span></h4>

      <p>In foreign policy, Pi&#x142;sudski, as <!--del_lnk--> de Gaulle was later to do in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, sought to maintain his country&#39;s independence on the international scene. Ably assisted by his protege, <!--del_lnk--> Minister of Foreign Affairs <!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;zef Beck, he sought support for Poland in alliances with western <!--del_lnk--> powers &mdash; <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a> &mdash; and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbours: <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. A supporter of the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the <!--del_lnk--> Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the <!--del_lnk--> Little Entente), he was nonetheless disappointed by the French policy of <!--del_lnk--> appeasement, visible in the such actions as the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Locarno Treaties.Therefore Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s aim was also to maintain good relations with the USSR and with Germany, and thus Poland signed the <!--del_lnk--> non-aggression pacts with both of its powerful neighbours (<!--del_lnk--> Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932, <!--del_lnk--> German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934). Both treaties were meant to strengthen Poland&#39;s position in the eyes of its allies and neighbours. He was acutely aware of the shakiness of the <!--del_lnk--> non-aggression pacts, remarking sarcastically: &quot;Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first and when that will be.&quot;<p>Under his control, Poland had good relations with some of its neighbours (notably <a href="../../wp/r/Romania.htm" title="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvia</a>), however relations with <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia were strained, and with <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> even worse. Relations with Germany and the Soviet Union varied in time, but during Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s life could, for the most part, be described as neutral.<p>One of notable Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s foreign polices, <!--del_lnk--> Prometheism, which was designed to reduce the power of Russia, was pursued by <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Charaszkiewicz. However, this policy proved to be relatively unsuccessful.<p>One of the most widely mentioned plans of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s foreign policy was his rumored proposal to French about declaring war on Germany after <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power in Germany in January 1933. Pi&#x142;sudski might have sounded out Poland&#39;s ally, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, regarding the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the <!--del_lnk--> Versailles Treaty. When France declined, Pi&#x142;sudski was compelled to sign a <!--del_lnk--> German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in January 1934. However, this argument that the German-Polish non-aggression pact had been forced on Pi&#x142;sudski by French refusal to wage a &quot;preventive war&quot; on <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> has been disputed by some historians who point out that there is no evidence in either the French or Polish diplomatic archives that such an offer was made. They point out that when in late October 1933 rumours of Polish &quot;preventive war&quot; proposal were reported in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, the source of these rumours were the Polish Embassy, which informed French reporters that Poland had proposed a &quot;preventive war&quot; to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, but by this time, Poland and Germany were already secretly negotiating the non-aggression pact with Germany. It has been argued that Pi&#x142;sudski had the Polish Embassy start rumours of a &quot;preventive war&quot; being considered as a way of pressuring the Germans, who were demanding that the Poles abrogate the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Polish alliance of 1921. As it was, the non-aggression pact specifically excluded the Franco-Polish alliance. It has been argued that Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s reasons for seeking a non-aggression pact with Germany was due to his concerns over the <!--del_lnk--> Maginot Line. Up to 1929, French plans in the event of war with Germany called for an French offensive onto the North German plain in conjunction with offensives from Poland and <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia. The building of the <!--del_lnk--> Maginot Line, which was started in 1929, strongly indicated that henceforward, in the event of war with Germany, the French Army would maintain a strictly defensive position, and that France&rsquo;s eastern allies were going to be on their own (if true, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s successfully predicted the future: this is what in fact happened in the 1939 with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Phony War</i>). Thus, from Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s viewpoint, in light of France&#39;s military plans, a non-aggression pact with Germany was the best option under the circumstances.<p>Hitler unceasingly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets, but Pi&#x142;sudski declined the proposal, instead seeking precious time to prepare for war with Germany or the Soviet Union if it was necessary. Also on numerous occasions, Hitler planned to meet with Pi&#x142;sudski, and again he was rebuffed.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h3>

      <p>By 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Pi&#x142;sudski had for several years been in declining health.

      <p>On May 13, 1935, in accordance with the last wishes of J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Rydz-&#x15A;mig&#x142;y was nominated by the president and the government of Poland to serve in the capacity of the Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces and on November 10, 1936 he was elevated to the rank of Marshal of Poland. Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland and was awarded the title of &quot;Second Man in the State after the President&quot;. Many saw him Rydz-&#x15A;mig&#x142;y as Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s successor, however he never became as influential as Pi&#x142;sudski was. Polish government nonetheless became increasingly <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian and <!--del_lnk--> conservative, with &#x15A;mig&#x142;y-Rydz faction opposed by the more moderate <!--del_lnk--> Ignacy Mo&#x15B;cicki, who remained President. After 1938, Rydz-&#x15A;mig&#x142;y reconciled himself with the President, but the ruling clique was henceforth divided into the &quot;President&#39;s Men&quot; (or &quot;Castle Group&quot;) &mdash; most of them civilians, and the &quot;Marshal&#39;s Men&quot; (or &quot;Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s Colonels&quot;) who were mostly old companions of Pi&#x142;sudski and professional officers. After <!--del_lnk--> German invasion of Poland in 1939 marked the start of the World War II, some of this political division survived within the <!--del_lnk--> Polish government in exile, however after the war relatively little of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s thought influenced the politics of the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republic of Poland, dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Polish communists <i>de facto</i> <!--del_lnk--> satellite state of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.<p>Nonetheless Pi&#x142;sudski had given Poland something akin to what <!--del_lnk--> Henryk Sienkiewicz&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Onufry Zag&#x142;oba had mused about: a Polish <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification. During the times of the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republic of Poland, Pi&#x142;sudski was publicly ignored or condemned by the state - which only served to increase his popularity with the nation. After the <!--del_lnk--> fall of communism, he become increasingly recognized as a <!--del_lnk--> national hero. On the 60th anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, the Polish <!--del_lnk--> Sejm issued a statement: &quot;J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski will remain in the memory of our nation as the founder of independence and as the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilisation. J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski served his motherland well, and has entered our history forever.&quot;<p>This declaration was not that different from the words of President of Poland, <!--del_lnk--> Ignacy Mo&#x15B;cicki, in a speech during Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s funeral: &quot;He was king of our hearts and ruler of our will. Through half a century of his life&rsquo;s toil, he took into his possession heart after heart, soul after soul, until he drew the whole of Poland under the purple of his royal spirit [...] He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">
