      <p>Wales&#39; father worked as a <!--del_lnk--> grocery store manager while his mother, Doris, and his grandmother, Erma, ran a small <!--del_lnk--> private school &quot;in the tradition of the <!--del_lnk--> one-room schoolhouse&quot; where Wales received his education. Most of the time there were four children in his grade so the school grouped the first, second, third and fourth grade students and the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students.<p>Currently, Wales works and lives in <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg, <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>After eighth grade, Wales attended <!--del_lnk--> Randolph School, a <!--del_lnk--> university-preparatory school, which was an early supporter of computer labs and other technology for student use. Wales has said that the school was expensive for his family, but that education was regarded as important. &quot;Education was always a passion in my household &hellip; you know, the very traditional approach to knowledge and learning and establishing that as a base for a good life.&quot; He received his <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor&#39;s degree in <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Auburn University and started with the <!--del_lnk--> Ph.D. finance program at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Alabama, where he left with a <!--del_lnk--> Master&#39;s in finance. After that, he took courses offered in the Ph.D. finance program at <!--del_lnk--> Indiana University. He taught at both universities during his postgraduate studies, but did not write the <!--del_lnk--> doctoral dissertation required to earn a Ph.D.<p><a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h2>

      <p>From 1994-2000, Wales served as research director at Chicago Options Associates, a <!--del_lnk--> futures and <!--del_lnk--> options <!--del_lnk--> trader in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>. By &quot;betting on interest rate and foreign-currency fluctuations&quot; he had soon earned enough to &quot;support himself and his wife for the rest of their lives&quot;, according to Daniel Pink of Wired Magazine.<p><a id="Bomis_and_Nupedia" name="Bomis_and_Nupedia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Bomis and Nupedia</span></h3>
      <p>In 1996, Wales founded a search portal called <!--del_lnk--> Bomis, which also sold erotic materials until mid-2005. He was asked in a September 2005 <!--del_lnk--> C-SPAN interview about his previous involvement with what the interviewer, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Lamb, called &quot;dirty pictures.&quot; In response, Wales described Bomis as a &quot;guy-oriented search engine&quot;, with a market similar to <!--del_lnk--> Maxim magazine. In an interview with <i><!--del_lnk--> Wired News</i>, he also explained that he disputed the categorization of Bomis content as &quot;soft-core pornography&quot;: &quot;If <!--del_lnk--> R-rated movies are <!--del_lnk--> porn, it was porn. In other words, no, it was not.&quot; Wales is no longer actively involved in the company.<p>In March 2000, he started a peer-reviewed, open-content encyclopedia, <!--del_lnk--> Nupedia.com (&quot;the free encyclopedia&quot;), and hired <!--del_lnk--> Larry Sanger to be its editor-in-chief.<p><a id="Wikipedia" name="Wikipedia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia</span></h3>

      <p>Using a wiki to create an encyclopedia was publicly proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Larry Sanger on <!--del_lnk--> January 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2001, and Wales worked on setting one up, starting it on <!--del_lnk--> January 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2001. Wikipedia was at that point a <!--del_lnk--> wiki-based site intended for collaboration on early encyclopedic content for submission to <!--del_lnk--> Nupedia for peer review, but Wikipedia&#39;s rapid growth soon made it the dominant project and Nupedia was mothballed. Sanger resigned from the project in 2002.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In mid-2003, Wales set up the <a href="../../wp/w/Wikimedia_Foundation.htm" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, a St. Petersburg-based <!--del_lnk--> non-profit organization, to support Wikipedia and its younger sibling projects. He appointed himself and two business partners who are not active Wikipedians to the five-member board; the remaining two members are elected community representatives.<p>According to Daniel H. Pink from Wired magazine, by 2004, Wales had spent around US$500,000 on the establishment and operation of his Wiki projects, most of it his own funds. By the end of its February 2005 fund drive, the Wikimedia Foundation was supported entirely by grants and donations. Wales has become increasingly involved with promoting and speaking about its projects, and to this end, he travels to conferences and Wikimedia functions, such as &quot;Wikimeets&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Wikimania.<p>Wales has explained his motivations about Wikipedia. In an interview with <!--del_lnk--> Slashdot, he said, &quot;Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.&quot;<p>In late 2005, Wales was criticised for editing his own biography in a way some characterized as &quot;revisionist history.&quot;  In particular, <!--del_lnk--> Rogers Cadenhead drew attention to logs showing that Mr. Wales had removed references to Sanger as the co-founder of Wikipedia. He was also observed to have modified references to Bomis in a way that was characterized as downplaying the sexual nature of some of his former company&#39;s products. <p>In both cases, Wales argued that his modifications were solely intended to improve the accuracy of the content. Wales explained that Sanger had been his employee, and that he had always considered himself to be the sole founder of Wikipedia. In 2006, Wales told the <i><!--del_lnk--> Boston Globe</i> that &quot;it&#39;s preposterous&quot; to call Sanger the co-founder. However, Sanger strongly contests that description. He was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia at least as early as September 2001 and referred to himself that way as early as January 2002.  <p>Following this incident, Wales apologized for editing his own biography (a practice generally frowned on at Wikipedia). Wales said in the <i>Wired</i> interview, &quot;People shouldn&#39;t do it, including me. I wish I hadn&#39;t done it.&quot; However, he continues to assert that he is the sole founder of Wikipedia.<p><a id="Wikia" name="Wikia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Wikia</span></h3>

      <p>Wikia (formerly known as Wikicities) is a wiki hosting service created in October 2004 by Jimmy Wales and <!--del_lnk--> Angela Beesley, according to a Wikia press release. It is a collection of <!--del_lnk--> wikis running on <!--del_lnk--> MediaWiki software and operated by <!--del_lnk--> Wikia, Inc. that target different communities. It is free of charge for readers and editors, and gets its income from advertisements. Following the change in name, Wikia announced that it had received US$4 million in venture capital from a group of investors. &quot;&#39;We&#39;ve had a lot of interest from investors, and it was really a matter of sorting through the investors to be sure that people who are investing were people who were believers in our mission,&#39; said Wales, who operates Wikipedia and Wikia separately from his St. Petersburg offices&quot; reports the Tampa Bay Business Journal.<p><a id="Honors" name="Honors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Honours</span></h2>
