      <p>Jupiter is 2.5 times more <!--del_lnk--> massive than all the other planets combined, so massive that its <!--del_lnk--> barycenter with the Sun actually lies above the Sun&#39;s surface (1.068 <!--del_lnk--> solar radii from the Sun&#39;s centre). It is 318 times more massive than Earth, with a <!--del_lnk--> diameter 11 times that of Earth, and its <!--del_lnk--> volume is 1300 times as great as that of Earth. Quite naturally, Jupiter&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravitational</a> influence has dominated the evolution of the solar system: some have described the solar system as consisting of the Sun, Jupiter, and assorted debris. Most planets&#39; orbits lie closer to Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> orbital plane than the Sun&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> equatorial plane (<a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528planet%2529.htm" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury</a> is the only planet which is closer to the Sun&#39;s equator in orbital tilt), the majority of <!--del_lnk--> short-period comets belong to Jupiter&#39;s family (a result due to both Jupiter&#39;s mass and its relative speed), the <!--del_lnk--> Kirkwood gaps in the <!--del_lnk--> asteroid belt are mostly due to Jupiter, and the planet may have been responsible for the <!--del_lnk--> Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner solar system&#39;s history. Jupiter has been called the solar system&#39;s vacuum cleaner, due to its immense <!--del_lnk--> gravity well.<p>As impressive as Jupiter&#39;s mass is, <a href="../../wp/e/Extrasolar_planet.htm" title="Extrasolar planet">extrasolar planets</a> have been discovered with much greater masses. There is no clear-cut definition of what distinguishes a large planet such as Jupiter from a <!--del_lnk--> brown dwarf star, although the latter possesses rather specific <!--del_lnk--> spectral lines. Currently, if an object of solar <!--del_lnk--> metallicity is 13 Jupiter masses or above, large enough to burn <!--del_lnk--> deuterium, it is considered a brown dwarf; below that mass (and orbiting a star or stellar remnant), it is a planet. Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its composition can; adding extra mass would result in further gravitational compression, in theory leading to <!--del_lnk--> stellar ignition. This has led some astronomers to term it a &quot;failed star&quot; -- although Jupiter would need to be about seventy-five times as massive to become a <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">star</a>, the smallest <a href="../../wp/r/Red_dwarf.htm" title="Red dwarf">red dwarf</a> is only about 30% larger than Jupiter. In light of this, it is also interesting to note that it radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun. This additional heat radiation is produced by the <!--del_lnk--> Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism. As another symptom of this process, the planet shrinks at the rate of a few millimeters each year. When it was younger and hotter, Jupiter was much larger than it is today, though previously <a href="../../wp/s/Saturn.htm" title="Saturn">Saturn</a> would have been even bigger than Jupiter due to its lower mass: Saturn has a much weaker gravitational pull and with more heat, both planets would have been more bloated (and because of Saturn&#39;s lower core mass, this effect would have been greater). In general, the more massive the core, the smaller the planet in size.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Jupiter also has the fastest <!--del_lnk--> rotation rate of any planet within the solar system, making a complete rotation on its <!--del_lnk--> axis in slightly less than ten hours, which results in an <!--del_lnk--> equatorial bulge easily seen through an Earth-based amateur <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>. Jupiter is perpetually covered with a layer of clouds, composed of <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulphide, and it may not have any solid surface in that the density may simply increase gradually as you move towards the core. Its best known feature is the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Red_Spot.htm" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> storm larger than Earth which was likely first observed by <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Domenico Cassini and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Hooke four centuries ago. Indeed, mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and may be a permanent feature of the planet. In 2000, three small spots merged to form a larger spot named <!--del_lnk--> Oval BA, which later acquired a red hue very similar to that of the Great Red Spot.<p><a id="Historical_observations" name="Historical_observations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Historical observations</span></h2>
      <p>The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> named the planet after the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_mythology.htm" title="Roman mythology">Roman god</a> <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter (also called Jove). The <!--del_lnk--> astronomical symbol for the planet is a stylized representation of the god&#39;s lightning bolt. &#x2643; is found at <!--del_lnk--> Unicode position U+2643.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korean</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a>, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnamese</a> refer to the planet as the <i>wood star</i>, &#x6728;&#x661F;, based on the Chinese <!--del_lnk--> Five Elements. In <!--del_lnk--> Vedic Astrology, Hindu astrologers refer to Jupiter as <!--del_lnk--> Brihaspati, or &quot;Guru&quot; which means the &quot;Big One&quot;. In Hindi, Thursday is referred to as <i><!--del_lnk--> Guruvaar</i> (day of Jupiter). In the English language Thursday is rendered as Thor&#39;s day, with Thor being identified with the Roman god Jupiter.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1610, <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> discovered the four largest <!--del_lnk--> moons of Jupiter, <!--del_lnk--> Io, <!--del_lnk--> Europa, <!--del_lnk--> Ganymede and <!--del_lnk--> Callisto (now known as the <!--del_lnk--> Galilean moons) using a telescope, the first observation of moons other than Earth&#39;s. This was also the first discovery of a <!--del_lnk--> celestial motion not apparently centered on the Earth. It was a major point in favour of <a href="../../wp/n/Nicolaus_Copernicus.htm" title="Nicolaus Copernicus">Copernicus</a>&#39; <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentric</a> theory of the motions of the planets; Galileo&#39;s outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the <!--del_lnk--> Inquisition.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1892, <!--del_lnk--> E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch refractor at <!--del_lnk--> Lick Observatory in California.

      <p>The <b>Great Red Spot</b> is a persistent <!--del_lnk--> anticyclonic <!--del_lnk--> storm on the <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a> <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter, 22&deg; south of the equator, which has lasted at least 340 years. The storm is large enough to be visible through Earth-based <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescopes</a>. It was probably first observed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini, who described it around 1665.<p>This dramatic view of Jupiter&#39;s Great Red Spot and its surroundings was obtained by <!--del_lnk--> Voyager 1 on <!--del_lnk--> February 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1979, when the spacecraft was 9.2 million km (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter. Cloud details as small as 160 km (100 miles) across can be seen here. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern to the left of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion. To give a sense of Jupiter&#39;s scale, the white oval storm directly below the Great Red Spot is approximately the same diameter as Earth.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> oval object <!--del_lnk--> rotates <!--del_lnk--> counterclockwise, with a <!--del_lnk--> period of about 6 days. The Great Red Spot&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> dimensions are 24&ndash;40,000 km &times; 12&ndash;14,000 km. It is large enough to contain two or three planets of Earth size. The cloudtops of this storm are about 8 km above the surrounding cloudtops.<p>Storms such as this are not uncommon within the <!--del_lnk--> turbulent <!--del_lnk--> atmospheres of <a href="../../wp/g/Gas_giant.htm" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>. Jupiter also has white ovals and brown ovals, which are lesser unnamed storms. White ovals tend to consist of relatively <a href="../../wp/h/Heat.htm" title="Heat">cool</a> clouds within the upper atmosphere. Brown ovals are warmer and located within the &quot;normal cloud layer&quot;.

      <p>Jupiter has a faint <!--del_lnk--> planetary ring system composed of smoke-like dust particles knocked from its moons by energetic meteor impacts. The innermost doughnut-shaped ring, called the halo, is almost as thick (20,000km) as it is wide (22,800km). This is followed by the thinnest and brightest main ring, which is made of dust from the satellites Adrastea and Metis. Metis orbits within its fluid <a href="../../wp/r/Roche_limit.htm" title="Roche limit">Roche limit</a> with Jupiter, and objects not rigidly attached to it may freely fall away from it and into Jupiter&#39;s gravitational field. Two wide gossamer rings encircle the main ring, originating from Thebe and Amalthea. Finally, there is a distant and very faint outer ring circling Jupiter backwards&mdash;retrograde of its spin. It is not known for certain where the material for this outer ring comes from, but it may be captured interplanetary dust.<p><a id="Magnetosphere" name="Magnetosphere"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Magnetosphere</span></h3>
      <p>Jupiter has a very large and powerful <!--del_lnk--> magnetosphere. In fact, if one could see Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field from Earth, it would appear five times as large as the <a href="../../wp/f/Full_moon.htm" title="Full moon">full moon</a> in the sky despite being so much farther away. The magnetic field is generated by eddy currents in Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> metallic hydrogen core. This magnetic field collects a large flux of <!--del_lnk--> particle radiation in Jupiter&#39;s radiation belts, as well as producing a dramatic gas <!--del_lnk--> torus and <!--del_lnk--> flux tube associated with Io(one of Jupiter&#39;s moon). Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere is the largest planetary structure in the solar system. <p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pioneer</i> probes confirmed that Jupiter&#39;s enormous magnetic field is 10 times stronger than Earth&#39;s and contains 20,000 times as much energy. The sensitive instruments aboard found that the Jovian magnetic field&#39;s &quot;north&quot; <!--del_lnk--> magnetic pole is at the planet&rsquo;s geographic south pole, with the axis of the magnetic field tilted 11 degrees from the Jovian rotation axis and offset from the centre of Jupiter in a manner similar to the axis of the Earth&#39;s field. The <i>Pioneers</i> measured the <!--del_lnk--> bow shock of the Jovian <!--del_lnk--> magnetosphere to the width of 26 million kilometers (16 million miles), with the magnetic tail extending beyond Saturn&rsquo;s orbit.<p>The data showed that the magnetic field <!--del_lnk--> fluctuates rapidly in size on the sunward side of Jupiter because of pressure variations in the <!--del_lnk--> solar wind, an effect studied in further detail by the two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Voyager</i> spacecraft. It was also discovered that streams of high-energy atomic particles are ejected from the Jovian magnetosphere and travel as far as the orbit of the Earth. Energetic <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> were found and measured in the Jovian <!--del_lnk--> radiation belt and <!--del_lnk--> electric currents were detected flowing between Jupiter and some of its moons, particularly Io.<p><a id="Exploration_of_Jupiter" name="Exploration_of_Jupiter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exploration of Jupiter</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to circularize their orbits. This constant tug of war causes regular flexing of the three moons&#39; shapes, Jupiter&#39;s gravity stretches the moons more strongly during the portion of their orbits that are closest to it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes when they&#39;re farther away. This flexing causes tidal heating of the three moons&#39; cores. This is seen most dramatically in Io&#39;s extraordinary volcanic activity, and to a somewhat less dramatic extent in the geologically young surface of Europa indicating recent resurfacing.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>Before the discoveries of the Voyager missions, Jupiter&#39;s moons were arranged neatly into four groups of four. Since then, the large number of new small outer moons has complicated this picture. There are now thought to be six main groups, although some are more distinct than others. A basic division is between the eight inner regular moons with nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter&#39;s equator, which are believed to have formed with Jupiter, and an unknown number of small irregular moons, with elliptical and inclined orbits, which are believed to be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids.<div class="thumb tright">

      <ol>
       <li>Regular moons <ol>
         <li>The inner group of four small moons all have diameters of less than 200 km, orbit at radii less than 200,000 km, and have orbital inclinations of less than half a degree..<li>The four <!--del_lnk--> Galilean moons, discovered by <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> and by <!--del_lnk--> Simon Marius in parallel, orbit between 400,000 and 2,000,000 km, and include some of the largest moons in the solar system.</ol>
       <li>Irregular moons <ol>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Themisto is in a group of its own, orbiting halfway between the Galilean moons and the next group.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Himalia group is a tightly clustered group of moons with orbits around 11,000,000-12,000,000 km from Jupiter.<li><!--del_lnk--> Carpo is another isolated case; at the inner edge of the Ananke group, it revolves in the direct sense.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Ananke group is a group with rather indistinct borders, averaging 21,276,000 km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 149 degrees.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Carme group is a fairly distinct group that averages 23,404,000 km from Jupiter with an average inclination of 165 degrees.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Pasipha&euml; group is a dispersed and only vaguely distinct group that covers all the outermost moons.</ol>
      </ol>
      <p>It is thought that the groups of outer moons may each have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.<p><a id="Life_on_Jupiter" name="Life_on_Jupiter"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Life on Jupiter</span></h2>
      <p>It is considered highly unlikely that there is any Earth-like <a href="../../wp/e/Extraterrestrial_life.htm" title="Extraterrestrial life">life</a> on Jupiter, as there is little water in the atmosphere and any possible solid surface deep within Jupiter would be under extraordinary pressures. However, in <!--del_lnk--> 1976, before the <!--del_lnk--> Voyager missions, <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> hypothesized (with <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Ernest Salpeter) that <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonia.htm" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a>-based life could evolve in Jupiter&#39;s upper atmosphere. Sagan and Salpeter based this hypothesis on the ecology of terrestrial seas which have simple <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> <!--del_lnk--> plankton at the top level, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> at lower levels feeding on these creatures, and marine <!--del_lnk--> predators which hunt the fish. The Jovian equivalents Sagan and Salpeter hypothesized were &quot;sinkers&quot;, &quot;floaters&quot;, and &quot;hunters&quot;. The &quot;sinkers&quot; would be plankton-like organisms which fall through the atmosphere, existing just long enough that they can reproduce in the time they are kept afloat by convection. The &quot;floaters&quot; would be giant bags of gas functioning along the lines of hot air balloons, using their own metabolism (feeding off sunlight and free molecules) to keep their gas warm. The &quot;hunters&quot; would be almost <!--del_lnk--> squid-like creatures, using jets of gas to propel themselves into &quot;floaters&quot; and consume them.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In addition to its moons, Jupiter&#39;s gravitational field controls numerous <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a> which have settled into the regions of the <!--del_lnk--> Lagrangian points preceding and following Jupiter in its orbit around the sun. These are known as the <!--del_lnk--> Trojan asteroids, and are divided into <!--del_lnk--> Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Trojan &quot;camps&quot; to commemorate the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i>. The first of these, <!--del_lnk--> 588 Achilles, was discovered by <!--del_lnk--> Max Wolf in <!--del_lnk--> 1906; since then hundreds more have been discovered. The largest is <!--del_lnk--> 624 Hektor.<p><a id="Cometary_impact" name="Cometary_impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cometary impact</span></h2>

      <p>During the period <!--del_lnk--> July 16 to <!--del_lnk--> July 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1994, over twenty fragments from the <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> <a href="../../wp/c/Comet_Shoemaker-Levy_9.htm" title="Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9">Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> hit Jupiter&#39;s southern hemisphere, providing the first direct observation of a collision between two solar system objects.
