      <p><b>Jordanhill railway station</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> side platformed <!--del_lnk--> suburban <!--del_lnk--> railway station in the <!--del_lnk--> Jordanhill area in the <!--del_lnk--> West End of <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The station, which is governed by <!--del_lnk--> Transport Scotland and managed by <!--del_lnk--> First ScotRail, lies on the <!--del_lnk--> Argyle Line and the <!--del_lnk--> North Clyde Line. It is located near the <!--del_lnk--> Jordanhill Campus of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Strathclyde and sits atop Crow Road, an important western thoroughfare in Glasgow and the main route to the <!--del_lnk--> Clyde Tunnel. The station is five stops and eleven minutes journey time from <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Central on the Argyle Line. Trains on the North Clyde Line pass through without stopping at the station.<p>

      <p>The station opened on <!--del_lnk--> 1 August <!--del_lnk--> 1887 as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway. Construction of the station structure was not completed until 1895, with modular-design wooden buildings, commonly seen on the new suburban railway lines, being built on both platforms. The station is located on part of the former site of brick and tile works, Jordanhill being an area of <!--del_lnk--> artisans and <!--del_lnk--> miners until the close of the 19th century. The railway station arrived just as much of the local industry was declining, giving residents, who previously had to walk to <!--del_lnk--> Hillhead or <!--del_lnk--> Partick to find transport into Glasgow, proper access to the city centre.<p>The station&#39;s opening effectively filled a gap in provision, as lines in the area had already been constructed; the <!--del_lnk--> Whiteinch and <!--del_lnk--> Stobcross Railways both opened in 1874, but no station was constructed on these lines at Jordanhill. A new link allowed services to <!--del_lnk--> Whiteinch Victoria Park to begin in 1897, but they ceased in 1951 and the link was closed to <!--del_lnk--> freight in 1967. The route of the link has been converted into a nature walk from <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Park to Jordanhill station, running alongside the existing line for approximately half its length.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 15 January <!--del_lnk--> 1898, a man named J. Johnstone, a member of the Whiteinch Harriers running club, was killed while attempting to run across the line west of the station. A small lead memorial stood on the spot for many years. The freight line saw near-disaster on <!--del_lnk--> 28 December <!--del_lnk--> 1932, when seventeen wagons laden with coal ran away on a slight incline on the sidings operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Western Steam Laundry; they ran into other wagons, derailing nine and spilling coal over the line, seriously disrupting passenger traffic.<p>A serious accident occurred on <!--del_lnk--> 28 April <!--del_lnk--> 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from <!--del_lnk--> Dalmuir to <!--del_lnk--> Motherwell derailed at the <!--del_lnk--> Hyndland junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the <!--del_lnk--> bogies on the leading coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously enough for them to be taken to the <!--del_lnk--> Western Infirmary.<p><a id="Plans_for_rebuilding" name="Plans_for_rebuilding"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Plans for rebuilding</span></h3>
      <p>In 1998, <!--del_lnk--> Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) undertook a study into the possible relocation of the station west to Westbrae Drive. A December 2002 report from the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive included this station as part of their High Resource Scenario, estimating the project cost at approximately &pound;2 million (<a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">USD</a> 3.5 million). By 2004, SPT had identified this station as one of their top three priorities, and <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow City Council had identified it as a &quot;main priority&quot;.<p>An alternative proposal would keep the existing station open, but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by <!--del_lnk--> Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yards (460&nbsp;m) away.<p>If Glasgow has a successful bid for the <!--del_lnk--> 2014 Commonwealth Games, Jordanhill Station will be among those rebuilt, through a <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">&pound;</a>300 million transport legacy plan.<p>The station at Jordanhill is to be rebuilt, one of six new stations in the west of Scotland, according to an announcement made on <!--del_lnk--> 19 May <!--del_lnk--> 2006 by SPT chief executive <!--del_lnk--> Ron Culley.<p><a id="Services" name="Services"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Services</span></h2>

      <p>As part of the <!--del_lnk--> Argyle Line, the station is used &mdash; along with <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Central and <!--del_lnk--> Anderston &mdash; by those commuting to and from Central Glasgow, near the heart of its business and financial district. The typical hourly service from the station is four trains per hour to <!--del_lnk--> Dalmuir via <!--del_lnk--> Clydebank, two trains to <!--del_lnk--> Motherwell via Glasgow Central and two trains to <!--del_lnk--> Springburn via <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow Queen Street. In <!--del_lnk--> SRA&#39;s 2002/3 financial year, 85,861 people boarded trains at Jordanhill station, and 94,613 disembarked, making it the 1029th busiest station in the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom, and 25th busiest on the Argyle Line in 2003.<p>The station no longer has a staffed ticket counter, but it contains a <!--del_lnk--> ticket machine, one of an initial batch of ten installed by SPT in late 2003 and early 2004 as part of a drive to curb fare dodging, which was estimated to be costing the company &pound;2 million a year. Both <!--del_lnk--> platforms are elevated and each has a <!--del_lnk--> wheelchair ramp. There is a connecting <!--del_lnk--> footbridge between the two platforms.<p><a id="In_the_area" name="In_the_area"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In the area</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Jordanhill Campus of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Strathclyde, which hosts the Faculty of Education, is located nearby.

For the later part of the 1980s and the early part of the 1990s, a huge Jolly Giant toy centre lay just across Crow Road, and was a major local attraction. It closed in 199X and after housing a discount clothing store for a few years it is now an Arnold Clark <!--del_lnk--> Volkswagen <!--del_lnk--> car dealership. <p>Backing onto platform 2 is a <a href="../../wp/s/Scouting.htm" title="Scouting">Scout</a> hall, home to the <!--del_lnk--> 72nd Scout Troop.<p>There are two sports facilities accessible from the station:<ul>
