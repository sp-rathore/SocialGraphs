      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kofun period, from the 3rd century to the 7th century, saw the establishment of a dominant polity centered in the <!--del_lnk--> Yamato area whence arose the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese imperial lineage.<p>The kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Baekje introduced <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> to Japan, and it was promoted by the Japanese ruling class.

He is credited with bringing relative peace to Japan through the proclamation of the <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen-article constitution.<p>Starting with the <!--del_lnk--> Taika Reform Edicts of 645, the Yamato court intensified the adoption of Chinese cultural practices and reorganized the government and the penal code based on the Chinese administrative structure of the time.

The imperial court then moved briefly to <!--del_lnk--> Nagaoka, and then to Heian-ky&#x14D; (now <!--del_lnk--> Kyoto).<p>Historical writing in Japan culminated in the early 8th century with the epic chronicles, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kojiki</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nihon Shoki</i>. These two chronicles give a legendary account of Japan&#39;s beginnings. According to them Japan was founded in 660 BC by <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Jimmu, a descendant of the <a href="../../wp/s/Shinto.htm" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> deity <!--del_lnk--> Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess). Emperor Jimmu is said to be the ancestor of the <!--del_lnk--> line of emperors that remains unbroken to this day.

In the early 11th century, <!--del_lnk--> Lady Murasaki wrote the world&#39;s oldest surviving novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tale of Genji</i>.

      <p>Japan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> medieval era was characterized by the emergence of a ruling class of warriors, the <!--del_lnk--> samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the rival <!--del_lnk--> Taira clan, <!--del_lnk--> Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Sh&#x14D;gun and established a base of power in <!--del_lnk--> Kamakura.

The <!--del_lnk--> Kamakura shogunate managed to repel <!--del_lnk--> Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281, with assistance from a storm that the Japanese interpreted as a <!--del_lnk--> kamikaze, or Divine Wind. The Kamakura shogunate lasted another fifty years and was eventually overthrown by <!--del_lnk--> Ashikaga Takauji in 1333. The succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Ashikaga shogunate failed to manage the feudal warlords &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> daimyo &mdash; and a civil war erupted. The <!--del_lnk--> &#x14C;nin War (1467 to 1477) is generally regarded as the onset of the &quot;Warring States&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> Sengoku period.<p>During the 16th century, traders and <!--del_lnk--> missionaries from <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> reached Japan for the first time, initiating the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nanban</i> (&quot;southern barbarian&quot;) period of active commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. <!--del_lnk--> Oda Nobunaga conquered numerous other <i>daimyo</i> by using European technology and <!--del_lnk--> firearms, and had almost unified the nation when he was assassinated in the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Incident at Honn&#x14D;ji&quot; in 1582. <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi Hideyoshi succeeded Nobunaga and united the nation in 1590. Hideyoshi <!--del_lnk--> twice invaded Korea, but was thwarted by <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korean</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming</a> Chinese forces.

      <p>After Hideyoshi&#39;s death, <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Ieyasu utilized his position as the regent of Hideyoshi&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi Hideyori as well as the conflicts among loyalists of the <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi clan, to gain the support of warlords from across Japan. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Ieyasu was appointed <!--del_lnk--> sh&#x14D;gun in 1603 and established the <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa shogunate at <!--del_lnk--> Edo (modern <a href="../../wp/t/Tokyo.htm" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>).<p>After defeating Toyotomi clan, at the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Osaka in 1614 and 1615, the Tokugawas became rulers of Japan, setting up a centralized feudal system with the Tokugawa shogunate at the head of the <!--del_lnk--> feudal domains. After Ieyasu, the <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa shogunate enacted a variety of measures to control the <!--del_lnk--> daimyo, among them the <i><!--del_lnk--> sankin-k&#x14D;tai</i> policy of enforced rotation between fiefs and attendance in Edo. In 1639, the shogunate began the isolationist <i><!--del_lnk--> sakoku</i> (&quot;closed country&quot;) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the <!--del_lnk--> Edo period. This is often considered to be the height of Japan&#39;s medieval culture. The study of Western sciences, known as <i><!--del_lnk--> rangaku</i>, continued during this period through contacts with the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> enclave at <!--del_lnk--> Dejima in <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to <i><!--del_lnk--> kokugaku</i>.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1854, Commodore <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Perry and the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Black Ships&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the West with the <!--del_lnk--> Convention of Kanagawa. The <!--del_lnk--> Boshin War of 1867-1868 led to the resignation of the shogunate, and the <!--del_lnk--> Meiji Restoration established a government centered around the emperor. Japan adopted numerous Western institutions, including a modern government, legal system and military. Japan introduced a <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary system</a> modeled after the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British parliament</a>, with <!--del_lnk--> Ito Hirobumi as first Prime Minister in 1882.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Meiji era reforms helped transform the <!--del_lnk--> Empire of Japan into a <!--del_lnk--> world power and embarked on a number of military conflicts to increase access to natural resources with victories in the <!--del_lnk--> First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). That was the first time that an Asian country had defeated a European imperial power. By 1910, Japan controlled <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> and the southern half of <!--del_lnk--> Sakhalin. Next year, the <!--del_lnk--> unequal treaties Japan had signed with western powers were cancelled.<p>The early 20th century saw a brief period of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Taisho democracy&quot; overshadowed by the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Japanese expansionism and <!--del_lnk--> militarization. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> enabled Japan, which fought on the side of the victorious Allies, to expand its influence in Asia and its territorial holdings in the Pacific. In 1920 Japan joined the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> and became a member of its security council. Japan continued its expansionist policy by occupying <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria in 1931. The ensuing criticism from the League prompted its withdrawal in 1933. In 1936, Japan signed the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Comintern Pact with <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Germany</a>, later joining the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers alliance in 1941.<p>Japan subsequently attacked the rest of China, starting the <!--del_lnk--> Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), as well as many countries and islands in <!--del_lnk--> southeast Asia and the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific. As a result of Japan&#39;s actions, an oil embargo and other actions were put in place by the western nations, such as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> In a steady campaign, Japan&#39;s forces in the occupied lands under its control were destroyed or neutralized.

These attacks killed several hundred thousand Japanese, and brought about an early end to the war. After the atomic bombings, Imperial Japan agreed to an <!--del_lnk--> unconditional surrender. The <!--del_lnk--> Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed on <!--del_lnk--> September 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1945 (<!--del_lnk--> V-J Day). The <!--del_lnk--> International Military Tribunal for the Far East (on <!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1946) was convened to prosecute Japanese leaders for <a href="../../wp/j/Japanese_war_crimes.htm" title="Japanese war crimes">crimes against peace and humanity</a> as well as war crimes such as the <!--del_lnk--> Nanking Massacre. Other war crimes were treated in the local tribunals held in the Asia-Pacific region. Emperor <a href="../../wp/h/Hirohito.htm" title="Hirohito">Hirohito</a> received immunity from prosecution and retained his position as emperor.<p>The war cost Japan millions of lives and left much of the country&#39;s industry and infrastructure destroyed. In 1947, Japan adopted a new <!--del_lnk--> pacifist <!--del_lnk--> constitution, seeking international cooperation and emphasizing human rights and democratic practices. Official <!--del_lnk--> American occupation lasted until 1952 and Japan was granted membership of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in 1956. After the American occupation, under a program of aggressive industrial development and with US assistance, Japan achieved <!--del_lnk--> spectacular growth to become the second largest economy in the world, with a growth rate averaging 10% for four decades. This ended in the 1990s, when Japan suffered a major recession from which it has since been slowly recovering.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Japan is a country of islands which extends along the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> coast of Asia.

In addition, about 3,000 smaller islands may be counted in the full extent of the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> archipelago. Japan also claims the southern <!--del_lnk--> Kuril Islands (controlled by <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>), which are located to the north-east of Hokkaid&#x14D;.<p>Japan is the thirtieth <!--del_lnk--> most densely populated country in the world. About 70% to 80% of the country is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial, or residential use, due to the generally steep elevations, climate, and risk of landslides caused by earthquakes, soft ground, and heavy rain. This has resulted in an extremely high population density in the habitable zones that are mainly located in coastal areas. Its location on the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Ring of Fire, at the juncture of three tectonic plates, gives Japan frequent low-intensity tremors and occasional volcanic activity. Destructive <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a>, often resulting in <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a>, occur several times each century. The most recent major quakes are the <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Ch&#x16B;etsu Earthquake and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. <!--del_lnk--> Hot springs are numerous, and have been developed as resorts.<p>The climate of Japan is predominantly <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> but varies greatly from north to south. Japan&#39;s geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Hokkaid&#x14D;: The northernmost zone has a temperate climate with long, cold winters and cool summers. <!--del_lnk--> Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snow banks in the winter.<li><!--del_lnk--> Sea of Japan: On Honsh&#x16B;&#39;s west coast, the northwest wind in the wintertime brings heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures, due to the <!--del_lnk--> F&ouml;hn wind phenomenon.<li><!--del_lnk--> Central Highland: A typical inland climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, and between day and night. Precipitation is light.<li><!--del_lnk--> Seto Inland Sea: The mountains of the <!--del_lnk--> Ch&#x16B;goku and <!--del_lnk--> Shikoku regions shelter the region from the seasonal winds, bringing mild weather throughout the year.</ul>

Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">Typhoons</a> are common.</ul>
      <p>The main <!--del_lnk--> rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the stationary rain front responsible for this gradually works its way north until it dissipates in northern Japan before reaching Hokkaid&#x14D; in late July. In most of Honsh&#x16B;, the rainy season begins before the middle of June and lasts about six weeks. In late summer and early autumn, <!--del_lnk--> typhoons often bring heavy rain.<p>Japan is home to nine forest <!--del_lnk--> ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands.

      <p>Growth slowed markedly in the 1990s largely due to the after-effects of <!--del_lnk--> over-investment during the late 1980s and domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Government efforts to revive economic growth have met with little success and were further hampered in 2000 to 2001 by the slowing of the global economy.<p>However, the economy saw signs of strong recovery in 2005. GDP growth for the year was 2.8%, with an annualized fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> during the same period. Unlike previous recovery trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor in leading the growth. Hence, the Japanese government predicts that recovery will continue in 2006.<p>Distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese economy include the cooperation of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in closely-knit groups called <!--del_lnk--> keiretsu (examples include <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi, <!--del_lnk--> Sumitomo, <!--del_lnk--> Fuyo, <!--del_lnk--> Mitsui, <!--del_lnk--> Dai-Ichi Kangyo and <!--del_lnk--> Sanwa); the powerful enterprise unions and <i><!--del_lnk--> shunt&#x14D;</i>; cosy relations with government bureaucrats, and the guarantee of <!--del_lnk--> lifetime employment (<i>shushin koyo</i>) in big corporations and highly <!--del_lnk--> unionized <!--del_lnk--> blue-collar factories. Recently, Japanese companies have begun to abandon some of these norms in an attempt to increase profitability.<p>The country has very limited <!--del_lnk--> natural resources to sustain economic development, since most of the islands are volcanic and mountainous.

      <p>Japan&#39;s population is estimated at around 127,463,611. For the most part, Japanese society is <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguistically</a> and culturally homogeneous with only small populations of foreign workers, <!--del_lnk--> Zainichi Korean and others. Japan has indigenous minority groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ainu and <!--del_lnk--> Ry&#x16B;ky&#x16B;ans, and social minority groups like the <i><!--del_lnk--> burakumin</i>.<p>Japan has one of the highest <!--del_lnk--> life expectancy in the world, at 81.25 years of age as of 2006. However, the Japanese population is rapidly aging, the effect of <!--del_lnk--> a postwar baby boom followed by a decrease in births in the latter part of the 20th century. In 2004, about 19.5% of the population was over the age of 65. The changes in the demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in the workforce population and increases in the cost of social security benefits such as the <!--del_lnk--> public pension plan. If its birth and death rates remain at the current levels, Japan&#39;s population has passed its peak and its population will continue to decline. It is expected to drop to 100 million by 2050, and to 64 million by 2100. Demographers and government planners are currently in a heated debate over how to cope with this problem. <!--del_lnk--> Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation&#39;s aging population. Immigration, however, is not popular as recent increased <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> rates are often attributed to foreigners living in Japan both by the National Police Agency and in popular Japanese media. But despite public views on foreigners, the Japanese in general do not mind foreigners in their country, and this is pointed out when comparing the increasingly common inter-marriage between Japanese and foreigners, but opinions on &quot;rebellious&quot; foreigners are still strong. Ethnic issues are improving, so there is a narrow but strong chance that if more foreigners enter Japan, and decide to marry another foreigner or Japanese resident, this may increase the chance of the population growing again. It is also noted that many Japanese youth are increasingly preferring not to <!--del_lnk--> marry or have families as adults.<p><a id="Largest_cities" name="Largest_cities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Largest cities</span></h3>

      <p>Japan does not legally recognize an <!--del_lnk--> official language; however, <!--del_lnk--> Japanese is the <i>de facto</i> official language. Japanese courts are the sole location that define language use: Judicial Code Article 74 states &quot;Japanese will be used in courts&quot;.<p>About 99% of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. The <!--del_lnk--> Ry&#x16B;ky&#x16B;an languages, also part of the <!--del_lnk--> Japonic language family to which Japanese belongs, are spoken in <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa, but few children learn these languages. <!--del_lnk--> Ainu, the language of the indigenous minority in northern Japan, is moribund, with only a few elderly <!--del_lnk--> native speakers remaining in <!--del_lnk--> Hokkaid&#x14D;. Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Japanese language is an <!--del_lnk--> agglutinative language distinguished by a system of <!--del_lnk--> honorifics reflecting the <!--del_lnk--> hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary which indicate the relative status of speaker and listener. There is no consensus on what, if any, linguistic relationship Japanese has with other languages, but scholars continue to <!--del_lnk--> research the issue.<p>Japanese incorporates many foreign elements. Japanese has borrowed or derived large amounts of vocabulary from <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>. When non-Chinese foreign words are written in Japanese, they are usually done so in a separate alphabet called <!--del_lnk--> katakana. Since the end of World War II, Japanese has also extensively borrowed from <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> writing system uses <!--del_lnk--> kanji (<!--del_lnk--> Chinese characters) and two sets of <!--del_lnk--> kana (<!--del_lnk--> syllabaries based on simplified forms of Chinese characters), as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Roman alphabet and <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-Arabic numerals.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>In Japan, healthcare services are provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
