      <p>Archaeological finds show that humankind has inhabited Cameroonian territory since the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic. The longest continuous inhabitants are probably the <!--del_lnk--> Pygmy groups such as the <!--del_lnk--> Baka. The <!--del_lnk--> Sao culture occupied the area around <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Chad.htm" title="Lake Chad">Lake Chad</a> c. AD 500. The <!--del_lnk--> Kanem-Bornu Empire later came to dominate this area. Kingdoms, <!--del_lnk--> fondoms, and chiefdoms arose in the west, including those of the <!--del_lnk--> Bamileke, <!--del_lnk--> Bamun, and <!--del_lnk--> Tikar.<p><a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> sailors reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of prawns and crayfish in the <!--del_lnk--> Wouri River and named it <span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt"><i>Rio dos Camar&otilde;es</i></span>, <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> for <i>River of Prawns</i>, and the phrase from which <i>Cameroon</i> is derived. Over the next few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples. Meanwhile, Christian <!--del_lnk--> missionaries established operations and gradually moved inland.<p>In the early 19th century, <!--del_lnk--> Modibo Adama led <!--del_lnk--> Fulani soldiers on a <!--del_lnk--> jihad against the non-Muslim peoples (<!--del_lnk--> Kirdi) of the north and those Muslims who still practiced aspects of paganism. Adama established the <!--del_lnk--> Adamawa Emirate, a vassal to the <!--del_lnk--> Sokoto Caliphate of <!--del_lnk--> Usman dan Fodio. Ethnic groups who fled the Fulani warriors displaced others, resulting in a major redistribution of population.<p><a id="Colonial_period" name="Colonial_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial period</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> German Empire claimed the territory as the <!--del_lnk--> colony of Kamerun in 1884. They moved inland, breaking trade monopolies held by coastal peoples such as the <!--del_lnk--> Duala and steadily expanded their control. The Germans established <!--del_lnk--> plantations in the forested south, especially in the coastal southwest. They made substantial investments in the colony&#39;s infrastructure, including the building of railways, roads, and hospitals. However, the indigenous peoples were reluctant to work on these projects, so the government instigated a harsh system of <!--del_lnk--> forced labour. With the defeat of Germany in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Kamerun became a <!--del_lnk--> League of Nations mandate territory and was split between French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cameroun</span> and <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> Cameroons in <!--del_lnk--> 1919. <!--del_lnk--> New Kamerun, territories acquired by Germany in 1911, became part of <!--del_lnk--> French Equatorial Africa.<p>France improved the infrastructure of its territory with capital investments, a supply of skilled workers, and continued forced labour. French Cameroun eventually surpassed its British counterpart in gross national product, education, and health care services. Nevertheless, these developments were largely relegated to <!--del_lnk--> Douala, <!--del_lnk--> Foumban, <!--del_lnk--> Yaound&eacute;, and <!--del_lnk--> Kribi, and the territory between them. The economy was carefully tied with that of France; raw materials sent to Europe were then sold back to the colony as finished goods.<p>Great Britain administered its territory from neighbouring <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Natives complained that this made them a neglected &quot;colony of a colony&quot;. Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, removing the need for forced labour but angering indigenous peoples. The plantations were returned to German administration until after World War II, when they were consolidated into the <!--del_lnk--> Cameroon Development Corporation. British administrators paid little attention to Northern Cameroons.<p>The League of Nations mandates were converted into <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Trusteeships in 1946. The question of <!--del_lnk--> independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun, where numerous political parties held different ideas on the timetable and goals of independence. The <!--del_lnk--> Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) was the most radical of these and advocated immediate independence and the adoption of a <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialist</a> economy. France outlawed the party on <!--del_lnk--> 13 July <!--del_lnk--> 1955, prompting a long <!--del_lnk--> guerilla war and the assassination of its leader <!--del_lnk--> Ruben Um Nyobe. France eventually granted increasing degrees of autonomy to the territory&#39;s governing bodies. In British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join with Nigeria.<p><a id="Post-independence" name="Post-independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-independence</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1960, French Cameroon gained independence under President <!--del_lnk--> Ahmadou Ahidjo. On <!--del_lnk--> 1 October <!--del_lnk--> 1961, British Southern Cameroons reunified with them&mdash;Northern British Cameroons opted to join Nigeria instead&mdash;as the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The continuing war with the UPC allowed Ahidjo to concentrate power in the presidency. The resistance was finally suppressed in 1971, but the declared state of emergency persisted. Ahidjo emphasized the importance of <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> over <!--del_lnk--> tribalism, using fears of ethnic violence to further consolidate power. Ahidjo&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Cameroon National Union (CNU) became the sole political party on <!--del_lnk--> 1 September <!--del_lnk--> 1966. In 1972, the <!--del_lnk--> federation was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon headed from Yaound&eacute;.<p>Economically, Ahidjo pursued a policy of <!--del_lnk--> planned liberalism. Cash crops were an early priority, but the discovery of <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> in the 1970s shifted focus to that sector. Oil money was used to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects. Communications, education, transportation, and hydroelectric infrastructure were all expanded. Nevertheless, Ahidjo used posts at these new industries as rewards for his allies, many of whom had no development or business background; many failed.<p>Ahidjo stepped down on <!--del_lnk--> 4 November <!--del_lnk--> 1982, leaving power to his constitutional successor, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Biya. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU, and a power struggle developed between the former and current president. When Ahidjo tried to assert the party&#39;s right to choose the president, Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya at first allowed open elections for party offices and for the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly. However, after a failed <!--del_lnk--> coup attempt and the <!--del_lnk--> Cameroonian Palace Guard Revolt on <!--del_lnk--> 6 April <!--del_lnk--> 1984, he moved more toward the leadership style of his predecessor.<p>Biya&#39;s first major challenge was the <!--del_lnk--> economic crisis of the mid-1980s to late 1990s, the result of international economic conditions, drought, and falling petroleum prices coupled with years of <!--del_lnk--> corruption, mismanagement, and <!--del_lnk--> cronyism. Cameroon turned to <!--del_lnk--> foreign aid; cut funds for education, government, and healthcare; and <!--del_lnk--> privatised industries. The growing dissatisfaction of Cameroon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Anglophones has since given Biya another challenge. Leaders from the formerly British portion of the country have called for greater autonomy, with some advocating complete secession as the Republic of <!--del_lnk--> Ambazonia.<p>After the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, numerous ethnic and regional political groups have formed, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Front under <!--del_lnk--> John Fru Ndi and the <!--del_lnk--> National Union for Democracy and Progress under <!--del_lnk--> Maigari Bello Bouba. Biya and his <!--del_lnk--> Cameroon People&#39;s Democratic Movement have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections, but rivals contend that these have been unfair. The last elections were held on <!--del_lnk--> October 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

(The second house of parliament, the Senate, as of 2006, has not yet been formed.) The National Assembly consists of 180 delegates and meets three times a year. The main responsibility of the Assembly is to pass laws, but rarely has it changed any laws or blocked the passage of legislation.<p>Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeal and Tribunals. Although the Constitutution prescribes that Judicial Power be independent of the executive and legislative powers, in practice, the judiciary is subordinate to the executive branch&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Justice. The <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court may review the constitutionality of a law only at the president&#39;s request.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At 183,568 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (475,440 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;), Cameroon is the world&#39;s 53rd-largest country. It is comparable in size to <a href="../../wp/p/Papua_New_Guinea.htm" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, and somewhat larger than the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>. Cameroon&#39;s landmass is 181,252 mi&sup2; (469,440 km&sup2;), with 2,317 mi&sup2; (6,000 km&sup2;) of water.<p>The country is located in Central and West Africa, bordering the Bight of Biafra, between Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.<p>Cameroon is sometimes described as &quot;Africa in miniature&quot; because it exhibits all the major climates and vegetation of the continent: mountains, desert, rain forest, savannah grassland, and ocean coastland. Cameroon can be divided into five geographic zones. These are distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Cameroon&#39;s coastal plain extends 10 to 50 <!--del_lnk--> miles (15&ndash;80&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km) inland from the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Guinea (part of the Atlantic Ocean) to the edge of a plateau. In the former western state, however, the mass of <!--del_lnk--> Mount Cameroon reaches almost to the sea. Exceedingly hot and humid, the coastal belt includes some of the wettest places on earth. For example, Debundscha, at the base of Mt. Cameroon, has an average annual rainfall of 405 <!--del_lnk--> inches (10,290&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm). The plain is densely forested.<p>The low southern plateau, rising from the coastal plain and dominated by tropical rain forest, has an average elevation of 1,500 to 2,000 <!--del_lnk--> feet (450&ndash;600&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m). It is less humid than the coast.<p>In western Cameroon is an irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus that extend from Mt. Cameroon almost to <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Chad.htm" title="Lake Chad">Lake Chad</a> at the northern tip of the country. This region enjoys a pleasant climate, particularly in the <!--del_lnk--> Bamenda, <!--del_lnk--> Bamil&eacute;k&eacute;, and <!--del_lnk--> Mambilla highlands. It also contains some of the country&#39;s most fertile soils, notably around volcanic Mt. Cameroon.<p>From the forested southern plateau the land rises northward to the grassy, rugged <!--del_lnk--> Adamaoua (Adamawa) highlands. Stretching across Cameroon from the western mountain area, the Adamaoua forms a barrier between the north and south. Its average elevation is 3,400 feet (1,035&nbsp;m), and its climate is reasonably pleasant.<p>The northern <!--del_lnk--> savanna plain extends from the edge of the Adamaoua to Lake Chad. Its characteristic vegetation is scrub and grass. This is a region of sparse rainfall and high median temperatures.<p><a id="Rivers" name="Rivers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rivers</span></h3>
      <p>The country has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Wouri, <!--del_lnk--> Sanaga, <!--del_lnk--> Nyong, and <!--del_lnk--> Ntem&mdash;flow southwestward or westward directly into the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Guinea. The <!--del_lnk--> Dja and <!--del_lnk--> Kade&iuml;, however, drain southeastward into the <a href="../../wp/c/Congo_River.htm" title="Congo River">Congo River</a>. In northern Cameroon, the <!--del_lnk--> Benou&eacute; River (Benue) runs north and west, eventually into the Niger, while the <!--del_lnk--> Logone River flows northward into <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Chad.htm" title="Lake Chad">Lake Chad</a>.<p>Only part of Lake Chad lies within Cameroon. The rest belongs to <a href="../../wp/c/Chad.htm" title="Chad">Chad</a>, Nigeria, and Niger. The lake varies in size according to seasonal rainfall.<p><a id="Border_rivers" name="Border_rivers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Border rivers</span></h3>

      <p>For a quarter-century following independence, Cameroon was one of the most prosperous countries in Africa. The drop in commodity prices for its principal exports &mdash; petroleum, cocoa, coffee, and cotton &mdash; in the mid-1980s, combined with an overvalued currency, widespread corruption, and economic mismanagement, led to a decade-long recession. Real per capita GDP fell by more than 60% from 1986 to 1994. The current account and fiscal deficits widened, and foreign debt grew. Yet because of its oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon still has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>As with many developing countries, rapid urbanisation has created many strains on the economy. The single largest economic activity in Cameroon is still subsistence agriculture. Many obstacles are slowing Cameroon&#39;s growth; some of these include onerous levels of bureaucracy, crumbling infrastructure, and ingrained corruption. Recently, the government has claimed to be making another attempt to crack down on corruption and to create a more transparent business environment.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Two separate systems of education were used in Cameroon after independence. East Cameroon&#39;s system was based on the French model, West Cameroon&#39;s on the British model. The two systems were merged by 1976. Christian mission schools have been an important part of the educational system.<p>Cameroon is known for having one of the best education systems in Africa. Primary school is both free and obligatory. Statistics say that 70% of all children aged between 6-12 years go to school, whilst 79% of the Cameroon population as a whole is literate. In the southern areas of the country almost all children of primary-school age are enrolled in classes. However, in the north, which has always been the most isolated part of Cameroon, registration is low. Most students in Cameroon do not go beyond the primary grades.<p>The country has institutions for teacher training and technical <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>.
