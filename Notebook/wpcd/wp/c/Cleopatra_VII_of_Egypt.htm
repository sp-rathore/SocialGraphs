      <p><b>Cleopatra</b> was a co-ruler of Egypt with her father (<!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XII Auletes), her brothers/husbands <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XIII and <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XIV, consummated a liaison with <!--del_lnk--> Gaius Julius Caesar that solidified her grip on the throne, and, after Caesar&#39;s assassination, aligned with <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Antony.htm" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a>, with whom she produced twins. In all, Cleopatra had 4 children, 3 by <!--del_lnk--> Antony (<!--del_lnk--> Cleopatra Selene, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Helios, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy Philadelphus) and 1 by <!--del_lnk--> Caesar (<!--del_lnk--> Caesarion). Her unions with her brothers produced no children.<p>After Antony&#39;s rival and Caesar&#39;s legal heir, Gaius Julius Caesar <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Octavian">Octavian</a>, brought the might of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Rome</a> against Egypt, It is said that Cleopatra took her own life on <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 30 BC. Her legacy survives in the form of numerous dramatizations of her story, including <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Antony and Cleopatra</i> and several modern <!--del_lnk--> films.<p>Cleopatra was a direct descendant of Alexander&#39;s general, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy I Soter, son of Arsinoe and Lacus, both of Macedon. A Greek by language and culture, Cleopatra is reputed to have been the first member of her family in their 300-year reign in Egypt to have learned the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian language.<p>

      <p>&quot;Cleopatra&quot; is <!--del_lnk--> Greek for &quot;father&#39;s glory,&quot; and her full name, Cleopatra Thea Philopator, means &quot;the Goddess Cleopatra, the Beloved of Her Father.&quot; She was the third daughter of the king <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XII Auletes, probably born to her father&#39;s sister, making her third in line to rule after her two other sisters died. Little is known about Cleopatra&#39;s childhood, but she would have observed the disordered events and loss of public affection for the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic dynasty under the reign of her father. It is said that her father survived an assassination attempt when a servant found a deadly puff adder in his bed. Her eldest sister Tryphaena also tried to poison her, so she hired food-tasting servants. This occurred for many reasons, including physical and moral degeneration of the sovereigns, <!--del_lnk--> centralization of power and <!--del_lnk--> corruption. This led to uprising in and loss of <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and of <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica, making Ptolemy&#39;s reign one of the most calamitous of the dynasty. In 58 BC Cleopatra&#39;s older sister, <!--del_lnk--> Berenice IV seized power from her father. With the assistance of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman governor of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Aulus Gabinius, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XII overturned his eldest daughter in 55 BC and had her <!--del_lnk--> executed. This left Cleopatra with her husband and younger brother, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XIII, joint heirs to the throne.<p>&#39;&#39;Italic text&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;Italic text&#39;&#39;Insert non-formatted text here<small>Small Text</small><i>Italic text</i>===The accession to the throne=== <!--del_lnk--> Pharaoh <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XII died in March 51 BC, making the 18 year old Cleopatra and the 12 year old <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XIII joint monarchs. The first three years of their reign were difficult due to economic difficulties, famine, deficient floods of <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> and political conflicts. Although Cleopatra was married to her young brother, she quickly showed indications that she had no intentions of sharing power.<p>In August 51 BC relations between the sovereigns completely broke down. Cleopatra dropped Ptolemy&#39;s name from official documents and her face appeared alone on coins, which went against Ptolemaic tradition of female rulers being subordinate to male co-rulers. This resulted in a cabal of courtiers, led by the <!--del_lnk--> eunuch <!--del_lnk--> Pothinus, removing Cleopatra from power and making Ptolemy sole ruler in circa 48 BC (possibly earlier, a decree exists with Ptolemy&#39;s name alone from 51 BC). She tried to raise a rebellion around <!--del_lnk--> Pelusium but she was soon forced to flee Egypt with her only surviving sister, <!--del_lnk--> Arsino&euml;.<p><a id="Cleopatra_and_Julius_Caesar" name="Cleopatra_and_Julius_Caesar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cleopatra and Julius Caesar</span></h2>
      <p><a id="The_assassination_of_Pompey" name="The_assassination_of_Pompey"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The assassination of Pompey</span></h3>
      <p>While Cleopatra was in exile, Ptolemy became embroiled in the <!--del_lnk--> Roman civil war. In the autumn of 48 BC, <!--del_lnk--> Pompey fled from the forces of <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, seeking sanctuary. Ptolemy, only fifteen years old at that time, had set up a throne for himself on the harbour from where he watched as on <!--del_lnk--> July 28, <!--del_lnk--> 48 BC Pompey was murdered by one of his former officers, now in Ptolemaic service. Ptolemy is thought to have ordered the death as a way of pleasing <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and thus become an ally of Rome, to which Egypt was in debt. This was a catastrophic miscalculation on Ptolemy&#39;s part. When Caesar arrived in Egypt two days later, Ptolemy presented him with Pompey&#39;s severed, pickled head. Caesar was enraged. This was probably due to the fact that, although political enemies, <!--del_lnk--> Pompey was a <!--del_lnk--> Consul of Rome and the <!--del_lnk--> widower of Caesar&#39;s only daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Julia who died in childbirth with their son. Caesar seized the Egyptian capital and imposed himself as arbiter between the rival claims of Ptolemy and Cleopatra.<p><a id="Caesar_and_Caesarion" name="Caesar_and_Caesarion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caesar and Caesarion</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Plutarch, eager to take advantage of <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>&#39;s anger with Ptolemy, Queen Cleopatra returned to the palace in a Persian carpet and had it presented to Caesar by her servant. It was at this point Caesar abandoned his plans to annex Egypt, instead backing Cleopatra&#39;s claim to the throne. After a short civil war, Ptolemy XIII was drowned in the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> and Caesar restored Cleopatra to her throne, with another younger brother <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy XIV as new co-ruler.<p>Despite the thirty year age difference, Cleopatra and Caesar became lovers during his stay in Egypt between 48 BC and 47 BC. On <!--del_lnk--> 23 June <!--del_lnk--> 47 BC Cleopatra gave birth to a child, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy Caesar (<!--del_lnk--> nicknamed &quot;Caesarion&quot; which means &quot;little Caesar&quot;). Cleopatra claimed Caesar was the father and wished him to name the boy his heir, but Caesar refused, choosing his grand-nephew <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Octavian</a> instead.<p>Cleopatra and Caesarion visited Rome between 47 BC and 44 BC and were present when Caesar was assassinated on <!--del_lnk--> 15 March <!--del_lnk--> 44 BC. Before or just after the assassination she returned to Egypt. When Ptolemy XIV died mysteriously (possibly poisoned by Cleopatra) Cleopatra made <!--del_lnk--> Caesarion her co-regent and successor.<p><a id="Cleopatra_and_Mark_Antony" name="Cleopatra_and_Mark_Antony"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cleopatra and Mark Antony</span></h2>
      <p>In 42 BC, <a href="../../wp/m/Mark_Antony.htm" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a>, one of the <!--del_lnk--> triumvirs who ruled Rome in the power vacuum following Caesar&#39;s death, summoned Cleopatra to meet him in <!--del_lnk--> Tarsus to answer questions about her loyalty. Cleopatra arrived in great state, and so charmed Antony that he chose to spend the winter of 41 BC&ndash;40 BC with her in Alexandria. On <!--del_lnk--> 25 December 40 BC she gave birth to <!--del_lnk--> twins, who were named <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Helios and <!--del_lnk--> Cleopatra Selene (II).<p>Four years later, in 37 BC, Antony visited Alexandria again while on route to make war with the <!--del_lnk--> Parthians. He renewed his relationship with Cleopatra, and from this point on Alexandria would be his home. He married Cleopatra according to the Egyptian rite (a letter quoted in <!--del_lnk--> Suetonius suggests this), although he was at the time married to <!--del_lnk--> Octavia Minor, sister of his fellow triumvir <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Octavian">Octavian</a>. He and Cleopatra had another child, <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy Philadelphus. At the <a href="../../wp/c/Cleopatra_VII.htm" title="Donations of Alexandria">Donations of Alexandria</a> in late 34 BC, following Antony&#39;s conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Armenia, Cleopatra and Caesarion were crowned co-rulers of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Helios was crowned ruler of Armenia, <!--del_lnk--> Media, and <!--del_lnk--> Parthia; <!--del_lnk--> Cleopatra Selene (II) was crowned ruler of <!--del_lnk--> Cyrenaica and <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>; and <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy Philadelphus was crowned ruler of <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicia, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia. Cleopatra also took the title of Queen of Kings.<p>There are a number of unverifiable but famous stories about Cleopatra, of which one of the best known is that, at one of the lavish dinners she shared with Antony, she playfully bet him that she could spend ten million <!--del_lnk--> sesterces on a dinner. He accepted the bet. The next night, she had a conventional, unspectacular meal served; he was ridiculing this, when she ordered the second course &mdash; only a cup of strong vinegar. She then removed one of her priceless pearl earrings, dropped it into the vinegar, allowed it to dissolve, and drank the mixture.<p>Antony&#39;s behaviour was considered outrageous by the Romans, and Octavian convinced the Senate to levy war against Egypt. In 31 BC Antony&#39;s forces faced the Romans in a naval action off the coast of <!--del_lnk--> Actium. Cleopatra was present with a fleet of her own. Popular legend tells us that when she saw that Antony&#39;s poorly equipped and manned ships were losing to the Romans&#39; superior vessels, she took flight and that Antony abandoned the battle to follow her, but no contemporary evidence states this was the case.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Actium, Octavian invaded Egypt. As he approached Alexandria, Antony&#39;s armies deserted to Octavian on <!--del_lnk--> August 12, <!--del_lnk--> 30 BC.<p><a id="Suicide" name="Suicide"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Suicide</span></h2>
      <p>Antony committed suicide, having been told Cleopatra was dead. According to the doctor Olympus (an eye-witness), he was brought to Cleopatra&#39;s tomb and died in her arms. A few days later, on November 30, Cleopatra also died by her own hand. The ancient sources generally agree that she had two <a href="../../wp/a/Asp_%2528reptile%2529.htm" title="Asp (reptile)">asps</a> smuggled into her tomb in a water-jug which she applied to her arm (not, contrary to popular belief, to her breast). Her two handmaidens died with her. Octavian, waiting in a building nearby, was informed of her death, and went to see for himself.<p>Cleopatra&#39;s son by Caesar, <!--del_lnk--> Caesarion, was proclaimed pharaoh by <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians, but Octavian had already won. Caesarion was captured and executed, his fate reportedly sealed by Octavian&#39;s famous phrase: &quot;<i>Too many Caesars</i>&quot;. Thus ended not just the Hellenistic line of Egyptian pharaohs, but the line of all Egyptian pharaohs. The three children of Cleopatra with Antony were spared and taken back to Rome where they were reared by Antony&#39;s wife, Octavia.<p><a id="Cleopatra_in_art.2C_film.2C_TV.2C_and_literature" name="Cleopatra_in_art.2C_film.2C_TV.2C_and_literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cleopatra in art, film, TV, and literature</span></h2>
      <p>Cleopatra&#39;s story has fascinated scores of writers and artists through the centuries. No doubt, much of her appeal lay in her legend as a great <!--del_lnk--> seductress who was able to ally herself with two of the most powerful men (Caesar and Antony) of her time.<p><a id="Literature:_Drama" name="Literature:_Drama"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Literature: Drama</span></h3>

      <p>The most famous painting of Cleopatra is one that almost certainly no longer exists now. Because the queen died in Egypt well before Augustus&#39; triumph could be put on in Rome, in which she would have walked in chains, Augustus commissioned a large painting of her, which was carried in his triumphal procession, and which may have represented her being poisoned by an asp. The sources for the story are <!--del_lnk--> Plut. Ant.&nbsp;86 and <!--del_lnk--> App. Civ. II.102, although the latter may well refer to a statue, and <!--del_lnk--> Cass. Dio&nbsp;LI.21.3 reports that the &quot;image&quot; was of gold, and thus not a painting at all. The purported painting was seen and engraved in the early 19th century: it was in a private collection near <!--del_lnk--> Sorrento. Since then, this painting is said to have formed part of a collection in <!--del_lnk--> Cortona, but there no longer appears to be any trace of it; its quiet disappearance is almost certainly due to its being a fake.
