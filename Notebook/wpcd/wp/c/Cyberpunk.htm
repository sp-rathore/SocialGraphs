      <p><b>Cyberpunk</b> is a sub-genre of <!--del_lnk--> science fiction, noted for its focus on &quot;high tech and low life&quot; and taking its name from the combination of <!--del_lnk--> cybernetics and <!--del_lnk--> punk. It features advanced science such as <!--del_lnk--> information technology and <!--del_lnk--> cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or a radical change in the <!--del_lnk--> social order.<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was impacted by rapid technological change, a ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>The plot of cyberpunk writing often centers on a conflict among <!--del_lnk--> hackers, <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligences, and <!--del_lnk--> mega corporations, tending to be set within a near-future <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>, rather than the far future settings or galactic vistas found in novels like <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Asimov.htm" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Frank Herbert&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Dune</i>. The settings of this future tend to be <!--del_lnk--> post-industrial <!--del_lnk--> dystopias, but are normally marked by extraordinary cultural ferment, and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its creators (&quot;the street finds its own uses for things&quot;). Much of the genre&#39;s &quot;atmosphere&quot; echoes <!--del_lnk--> film noir, and written works in the genre often use techniques from <!--del_lnk--> detective fiction. Primary exponents of the cyberpunk field include <!--del_lnk--> William Gibson, <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Sterling, <!--del_lnk--> Pat Cadigan, <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Rucker and <!--del_lnk--> John Shirley.<p>Unlike <!--del_lnk--> New Wave Science Fiction, which imported stylistic techniques and concerns that already existed in literature and culture at large, cyberpunk originated in the written science fiction genre first before gaining mainstream exposure. During the early and mid-1980s, cyberpunk became a fashionable topic in <!--del_lnk--> academic circles, where it began to be the subject of <!--del_lnk--> postmodernist investigation. In the same period, the genre penetrated <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood and became one of cinema&#39;s staple science-fiction styles. Many influential films such as <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blade_Runner.htm" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Matrix</i> trilogy can be seen as prominent outgrowths of the genre&#39;s styles and themes. <!--del_lnk--> Computer games, <!--del_lnk--> board games and <!--del_lnk--> role-playing games (such as <!--del_lnk--> Shadowrun, or the rather appropriately named <!--del_lnk--> Cyberpunk 2020) often feature storylines that are heavily influenced by cyberpunk writing and movies. Beginning in the early 1990s, trends in <!--del_lnk--> fashion and <!--del_lnk--> music were labeled as cyberpunk.<p>As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new sub-genres emerged, each of which focuses on technology and its social effects in a different way. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> steampunk, pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Tim Powers, <!--del_lnk--> K. W. Jeter and <!--del_lnk--> James Blaylock, and <!--del_lnk--> biopunk or alternatively <!--del_lnk--> ribofunk, in which <!--del_lnk--> Paul Di Filippo is prominent. In addition, some people consider works such as <!--del_lnk--> Neal Stephenson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Diamond Age</i> as being in a <!--del_lnk--> postcyberpunk category.<p>

      <p>Cyberpunk writers tend to use elements from the <!--del_lnk--> hard-boiled <!--del_lnk--> detective novel, <!--del_lnk--> film noir, and <!--del_lnk--> postmodernist prose to describe the often <!--del_lnk--> nihilistic underground side of an electronic society. The genre&#39;s vision of a <!--del_lnk--> troubled future is often called the antithesis of the generally <!--del_lnk--> utopian visions of the future popular in the 1940s and 1950s. (Gibson defined cyberpunk&#39;s antipathy towards utopian SF in his 1981 <!--del_lnk--> short story <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gernsback Continuum</i>, which pokes fun of and, to a certain extent, condemns utopian SF.)<p>Cyberpunk author <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Sterling summarized the cyberpunk ethos in <i>Cyberpunk in the Nineties</i> as follows:<dl>
       <dd>Anything that can be done to a rat can be done to a human being. And we can do most anything to rats. This is a hard thing to think about, but it&#39;s the truth. It won&#39;t go away because we cover our eyes.<dd><i>That</i> is cyberpunk.</dl>
      <p>In some cyberpunk writing, much of the action takes place <!--del_lnk--> online, in <!--del_lnk--> cyberspace, blurring the border between the actual and the <!--del_lnk--> virtual reality. A typical <!--del_lnk--> trope in such work is a direct connection between the <!--del_lnk--> human brain and <!--del_lnk--> computer systems. Cyberpunk depicts the world as a dark, sinister place with <!--del_lnk--> networked computers which dominate every aspect of life. Giant, <!--del_lnk--> multinational corporations have for the most part replaced governments as centers of political, economic and even military power. The <!--del_lnk--> alienated outsider&#39;s battle against a <!--del_lnk--> totalitarian or quasi-totalitarian system is a common theme in science fiction (cf. <i><a href="../../wp/n/Nineteen_Eighty-Four.htm" title="Nineteen Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a></i>) and cyberpunk in particular, though in conventional science fiction the totalitarian systems tend to be sterile, ordered, and state controlled.<p><!--del_lnk--> Protagonists in cyberpunk writing usually include computer <!--del_lnk--> hackers, who are often patterned on the idea of the lone hero fighting injustice: Western <!--del_lnk--> gunslingers, <!--del_lnk--> ronin, etc. They are often disenfranchised people placed in extraordinary situations, rather than brilliant scientists or starship captains intentionally seeking advance or adventure, and are not always true &quot;heroes&quot;; an apt comparison might be to the moral ambiguity of <!--del_lnk--> Clint Eastwood&#39;s character in the <!--del_lnk--> Man with No Name trilogy. One of the cyberpunk genre&#39;s prototype characters is Case, from Gibson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer.</i> Case is a &quot;console cowboy,&quot; a brilliant hacker, who betrays his organized criminal partners. Robbed of his talent through a crippling injury inflicted by the vengeful partners, Case unexpectedly receives a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be healed by expert medical care, but only if he participates in another criminal enterprise with a new crew.<p>Like Case, many cyberpunk protagonists are thus manipulated, placed in situations where they have little or no choice, and although they might see things through, they do not necessarily come out any further ahead than they previously were. These <!--del_lnk--> anti-heroes &mdash; &quot;criminals, outcasts, visionaries, dissenters and misfits&quot;  &mdash; do not experience a <!--del_lnk--> Campbellian &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hero&#39;s journey&quot;, like a protagonist of a <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homeric</a> <!--del_lnk--> epic or an <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Dumas novel. Instead, they call to mind the <!--del_lnk--> private eye of <!--del_lnk--> detective novels, who might solve the trickiest cases but never receive a just reward. This emphasis on the misfits and the malcontents &mdash; what <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Pynchon.htm" title="Thomas Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> called the &quot;preterite&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Zappa the &quot;left behinds of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Society&quot; &mdash; is the &quot;punk&quot; component of cyberpunk. Cyberpunk literature is often used as a <!--del_lnk--> metaphor for the present day-worries about the failings of corporations, <!--del_lnk--> corruption in governments, alienation and <!--del_lnk--> surveillance technology. Cyberpunk can be intended to disquiet readers and call them to action. It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of <!--del_lnk--> countercultural science fiction. In the words of author and critic <!--del_lnk--> David Brin,<dl>
       <dd>&hellip; a closer look at [cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic &hellip; Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others <i>do</i> depict <!--del_lnk--> Orwellian accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate <!--del_lnk--> elite. (<i>The Transparent Society</i>, Basic Books 1998)</dl>
      <p>Cyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> virtual world of what is now known as the Internet often appears under various names, including &quot;cyberspace&quot;, &quot;the Wired&quot;, &quot;the Metaverse&quot; or &quot;the Matrix&quot;. In this context it is important to note that the earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science fiction writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Arthur C. Clarke and some social commentators such as <!--del_lnk--> James Burke began predicting that such networks would eventually form.<p><a id="Literature" name="Literature"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literature</span></h2>
      <p>The science fiction editor <!--del_lnk--> Gardner Dozois is generally acknowledged as the person who popularized the use of the term &quot;cyberpunk&quot; as a kind of <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>. Minnesota writer <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Bethke coined the term in 1980 for his <!--del_lnk--> short story &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;, although the story was not actually published until November 1983, in <i><!--del_lnk--> Amazing Science Fiction Stories</i>, Volume 57, Number 4 . The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of <!--del_lnk--> William Gibson, <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Sterling, <!--del_lnk--> John Shirley, <!--del_lnk--> Rudy Rucker, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Swanwick, <!--del_lnk--> Pat Cadigan, <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Shiner, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Kadrey and others. Of these, Sterling became the movement&#39;s chief ideologue, thanks to his <!--del_lnk--> fanzine <i><!--del_lnk--> Cheap Truth.</i> (See also John Shirley&#39;s articles on Sterling and Rucker .)<p>Cyberpunk elements are present in the <!--del_lnk--> Hyperion Cantos by <!--del_lnk--> Dan Simmons. The planet Lusus has many characteristics of <i>Neuromancer&#39;s</i> dystopian world, and the cybernetic levels of existence where the AI:s live has obviously been influenced by Gibson&#39;s works.<p><!--del_lnk--> William Gibson with his novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer</i> (1984) is likely the most famous writer connected with the term cyberpunk. He emphasized style, a fascination with surfaces and the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the future, and atmosphere over traditional science-fiction <!--del_lnk--> tropes. Regarded as ground-breaking, and sometimes as &quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work&quot; , <i>Neuromancer</i> was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Hugo, <!--del_lnk--> Nebula, and <!--del_lnk--> Philip K. Dick Awards. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Jargon File, &quot;Gibson&#39;s near-total ignorance of computers and the present-day hacker culture enabled him to speculate about the role of computers and hackers in the future in ways hackers have since found both irritatingly na&iuml;ve and tremendously stimulating.&quot; <p>Early on, cyberpunk was hailed as a radical departure from science-fiction standards and a new manifestation of vitality. Shortly thereafter, however, many critics arose to challenge its status as a revolutionary movement. These critics said that the SF &quot;<!--del_lnk--> New Wave&quot; of the 1960s was much more innovative as far as narrative techniques and styles were concerned. Further, while <i>Neuromancer</i>&#39;s narrator may have had an unusual &quot;voice&quot; for science fiction, much older examples can be found: Gibson&#39;s narrative voice, for example, resembles that of an updated <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Chandler, as in his novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Big Sleep</i> (1939). Others noted that almost all traits claimed to be uniquely cyberpunk could in fact be found in older writers&#39; works &mdash; often citing <!--del_lnk--> J. G. Ballard, <!--del_lnk--> Philip K. Dick, <!--del_lnk--> Harlan Ellison, <!--del_lnk--> Stanislaw Lem, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel R. Delany and even <!--del_lnk--> William S. Burroughs. For example, Philip K. Dick&#39;s works contain recurring themes of social decay, artificial intelligence, paranoia, and blurred lines between reality and some kind of virtual reality, and the cyberpunk movie <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blade_Runner.htm" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> is based on one of his books. Humans linked to machines are found in Pohl and Kornbluth&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Wolfbane</i> (1959) and <!--del_lnk--> Roger Zelazny&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Creatures of Light and Darkness</i> (1968).<p>In 1994, scholar Brian Stonehill suggested that <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Pynchon.htm" title="Thomas Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>&#39;s 1973 novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Gravity&#39;s Rainbow</i> &quot;not only curses but precurses what we now glibly dub cyberspace&quot;.  Other important predecessors include <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Bester&#39;s two most celebrated novels, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Demolished Man</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Stars My Destination,</i> as well as <!--del_lnk--> Vernor Vinge&#39;s novella <i><!--del_lnk--> True Names</i>.<p>Science-fiction writer <!--del_lnk--> David Brin describes cyberpunk as &quot;...the finest free promotion campaign ever waged on behalf of science fiction.&quot; It may not have attracted the &quot;real punks&quot;, but it did ensnare many new readers, and it provided the sort of movement which postmodern literary critics found alluring. (One illustration of this is <!--del_lnk--> Donna Haraway&#39;s &quot;Cyborg Manifesto&quot;, an attempt to build a &quot;political myth&quot; using <!--del_lnk--> cyborgs as <!--del_lnk--> metaphors for contemporary &quot;social reality&quot;. ) Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood and to the visual arts generally. Although the &quot;self-important rhetoric and whines of persecution&quot; on the part of cyberpunk fans were irritating at worst and humorous at best, Brin declares that the &quot;rebels did shake things up. We owe them a debt. [...] But,&quot; he asks, &quot;were they original?&quot; <p>Cyberpunk further inspired many professional writers who were not among the &quot;original&quot; cyberpunks to incorporate cyberpunk ideas into their own works, such as Walter Jon Williams&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Hardwired and <!--del_lnk--> Voice of the Whirlwind, and <!--del_lnk--> George Alec Effinger&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> When Gravity Fails.<p>As new writers and artists began to experiment with cyberpunk ideas, new varieties of fiction emerged, sometimes addressing the criticisms leveled at the original cyberpunk stories. <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Person writes, in an essay he posted to the Internet forum <!--del_lnk--> Slashdot,<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Many writers who grew up reading in the 1980s are just now starting to have their stories and novels published. To them cyberpunk was not a revolution or alien philosophy invading SF, but rather just another flavor of SF. Like the writers of the 1970s and 80s who assimilated the New Wave&#39;s classics and stylistic techniques without necessarily knowing or even caring about the manifestos and ideologies that birthed them, today&#39;s new writers might very well have read</i> <!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer <i>back to back with <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Asimov.htm" title="Isaac Asimov">Asimov&#39;s</a></i> <!--del_lnk--> Foundation, <i><!--del_lnk--> John Brunner&#39;s</i> <!--del_lnk--> Stand on Zanzibar<i>, and Larry Niven&#39;s</i> <!--del_lnk--> Ringworld <i>and seen not discontinuities but a continuum.&quot;</i> </dl>
      <p>Person&#39;s essay advocates using the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> postcyberpunk&quot; to label the new works such writers produce. In this view, typical postcyberpunk stories continue the focus on an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized information and cybernetic augmentation of the human body, but without the assumption of <!--del_lnk--> dystopia. Good examples might be <!--del_lnk--> Neal Stephenson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Diamond Age</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Warren Ellis and <!--del_lnk--> Darick Robertson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Transmetropolitan.</i> Like all categories discerned within science fiction, the boundaries of postcyberpunk are likely to be fluid or ill defined. To complicate matters, there is a continuing market for &quot;pure&quot; cyberpunk novels strongly influenced by Gibson&#39;s early work, such as Richard Morgan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Altered Carbon.<p>Among the subgenres of cyberpunk is <!--del_lnk--> steampunk, which is set in an anachronistic <!--del_lnk--> Victorian environment, but with cyberpunk&#39;s bleak <!--del_lnk--> film noir world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of <!--del_lnk--> Tim Powers, <!--del_lnk--> James P. Blaylock, and <!--del_lnk--> K.W. Jeter, but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their collaborative novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Difference Engine</i> the term was being used earnestly as well.  The early 1990s saw the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> biopunk AKA <!--del_lnk--> ribofunk, a derivative style building not on informational technology but on biology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by <!--del_lnk--> genetic manipulation of their very chromosomes. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Di Filippo is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, although <!--del_lnk--> Bruce Sterling&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Shaper/Mechanist cycle is also a major influence.<p><a id="Film_and_television" name="Film_and_television"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film and television</span></h2>
      <p>The film <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blade_Runner.htm" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> (1982), adapted from Philip K. Dick&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, is set in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called <!--del_lnk--> replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who &quot;retire&quot; (kill) them. Although <i>Blade Runner</i> was not successful in its first theatrical release, it found a wide viewership in the home video market. Since the movie omits the religious and mythical elements of Dick&#39;s original novel (<i>e.g.,</i> empathy boxes and Wilbur Mercer), it falls more strictly within the cyberpunk genre than the novel does. William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision when he was working on <i><!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer</i>.<p>As mentioned above, the short-lived television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Max Headroom</i> also spread cyberpunk tropes, perhaps with more popular success than the genre&#39;s first written works.<p>The number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since <i>Blade Runner.</i> Several of Philip K. Dick&#39;s works have been adapted to the silver screen, with cyberpunk elements typically becoming dominant; examples include <i><!--del_lnk--> Screamers</i> (1996), <i><!--del_lnk--> Minority Report</i> (2002), <i><!--del_lnk--> Paycheck</i> (2003) and <i><!--del_lnk--> A Scanner Darkly</i> (2006). But unfortunately for cyberpunk&#39;s arguable originator, the film <i><!--del_lnk--> Johnny Mnemonic</i> (1995) was a flop, both commercially and critically. Gibson fans derided the screenplay as deviating substantially from his original work, even though Gibson wrote the final screenplay himself.<p>Director <!--del_lnk--> Darren Aronofsky set his debut feature <i><!--del_lnk--> &pi;</i> (1998) in a present-day <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, but built its script with influences from cyberpunk aesthetic. According to the <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> commentary, he and his production team deliberately used antiquated machines (like 5-1/4 inch <a href="../../wp/f/Floppy_disk.htm" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a>), echoing the technological style of <i><!--del_lnk--> Brazil</i> (1985), to create a cyberpunk &quot;feel&quot;. Aronofsky describes <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown, where the film is set, as &quot;New York&#39;s last cyberpunk neighbourhood&quot;.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> RoboCop</i> series has a more near-futuristic setting where at least one <!--del_lnk--> corporation, Omni Consumer Products, is an all-powerful presence in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Detroit. <i><!--del_lnk--> Until the End of the World</i> (1991) shows another example where cyberpunk provides an assumed background, and a plot device, to an otherwise mood and character-driven story. <i><!--del_lnk--> Gattaca</i> (1997) directed by <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Niccol is a futuristic <i>film noir</i> whose mood-drenched dystopia provides a good example of <!--del_lnk--> biopunk.<p><!--del_lnk--> The <i>Matrix</i> series, which began with 1999&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Matrix</i> (and now also contains <i><!--del_lnk--> The Matrix Reloaded</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Matrix Revolutions</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Animatrix</i>) uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.<p>Cyberpunk style and futuristic design have influenced <!--del_lnk--> anime, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Akira</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ghost in the Shell</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Bubblegum Crisis</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Armitage III</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Silent M&ouml;bius</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Serial Experiments Lain</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Texhnolyze</i>.<p>Anime has also provided examples of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> steampunk&quot; sub-genre, particularly in much of the work of <!--del_lnk--> Hayao Miyazaki, but also notably in <i><!--del_lnk--> Last Exile</i> (2003), created by studio <!--del_lnk--> GONZO and director <!--del_lnk--> Koichi Chigira, which features a curious blend of Victorian society and futuristic battles between ships of the sky. Also of note is 2004&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Steamboy</i> directed by <!--del_lnk--> Katsuhiro Otomo and more recently <!--del_lnk--> Ergo Proxy from <!--del_lnk--> Manglobe.<p><a id="Music_and_fashion" name="Music_and_fashion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Music and fashion</span></h2>
      <p>The term &quot;cyberpunk music&quot; can refer to two rather overlapping categories. First, it may denote the varied range of musical works which cyberpunk films use as soundtrack material. These works occur in genres from <!--del_lnk--> classical music and <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>&mdash;used, in <i><a href="../../wp/b/Blade_Runner.htm" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i> and elsewhere, to evoke a <i>film noir</i> ambiance&mdash;to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> noize&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> electronica. Typically, films draw upon electronica, <!--del_lnk--> electronic body music, <!--del_lnk--> industrial, <!--del_lnk--> noise, <!--del_lnk--> futurepop, <a href="../../wp/a/Alternative_rock.htm" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a>, <!--del_lnk--> goth rock, and <!--del_lnk--> IDM to create the proper &quot;feel&quot;. The same principles apply to computer and video games; see the discussion of <i><!--del_lnk--> Rez</i> below. Of course, while written works may not come with associated soundtracks as frequently as movies do, allusions to musical works are used for the same effect. For example, the graphic novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Kling Klang Klatch</i> (1992), a dark fantasy about a world of living toys, features a hard-bitten <!--del_lnk--> teddy bear detective with a sugar habit and a predilection for <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>.<p>&quot;Cyberpunk music&quot; also describes the works associated with the fashion trend which emerged from the SF developments. The <!--del_lnk--> Detroit techno group <!--del_lnk--> Cybotron, which arose in the early 1980s, drew influences both from European synthesizer pioneers <!--del_lnk--> Kraftwerk and from <!--del_lnk--> Toffler&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Future Shock,</i> producing songs which evoke a distinctly dystopian mood. In the same era, <!--del_lnk--> Styx released the concept album <i><!--del_lnk--> Kilroy Was Here</i> (1983), the story of a rock star living in a dark future where music has been outlawed. <i>Kilroy</i> and in particular its hit single &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; may easily be &quot;appropriated&quot; into the cyberpunk genre, whether or not the term was applied at the time. However, starting around the year 1990, <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> began to include a movement in both music and fashion which called itself &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, and which became particularly associated with the <!--del_lnk--> rave and <!--del_lnk--> techno subcultures. With the new millennium came a new movement of industrial bands making &quot;laptop&quot; music. Homeless traveling squatter punks armed themselves with digital equipment and fused technology into their street sounds- <!--del_lnk--> El-wire and the Vagabond Choir. The <!--del_lnk--> hacker subculture, documented in places like the <!--del_lnk--> Jargon File, regards this movement with mixed feelings, since self-proclaimed cyberpunks are often &quot;trendoids&quot; with affection for black leather and chrome who speak enthusiastically about technology instead of learning about it or becoming involved with it. (&quot;Attitude is no substitute for competence,&quot; quips the File.) However, these self-proclaimed cyberpunks are at least &quot;excited about the right things&quot; and typically respect the people who actually work with it&mdash;those with &quot;the hacker nature&quot;.<p>Certain music genres like drum&#39;n&#39;bass were directly influenced by cyberpunk, even generating a whole subgenre called <!--del_lnk--> neurofunk, where the bass lines, synths and beats try to give the listener the sensation of being inside a sprawl or crawling through cyberspace. Neurofunk was pioneered by artists like <!--del_lnk--> Ed Rush, <!--del_lnk--> Trace and <!--del_lnk--> Optical. In the words of the journalist <!--del_lnk--> Simon Reynolds:<dl>
       <dd><!--del_lnk--> Jungle&#39;s sound-world constitutes a sort of abstract social realism; when I listen to <!--del_lnk--> techstep, the beats sound like collapsing buildings and the bass feels like the social fabric shredding [...] The post-techstep style I call &quot;neurofunk&quot; (clinical and obsessively nuanced production, foreboding ambient drones, blips &#39;n blurts of electronic noise, and chugging, curiously inhibited two-step beats). Neurofunk is the fun-free culmination of jungle&#39;s strategy of &quot;cultural resistance&quot;: the eroticization of anxiety. Immerse yourself in the phobic, and you make dread your element. </dl>
      <p>Arriving toward the tail end of both the inital cyberpunk boom and his own career, pop singer <!--del_lnk--> Billy Idol released an album called <i>Cyberpunk</i>, which included a song called &quot;Neuromancer.&quot; The album was neither a critical nor commercial success.<p><a id="Games" name="Games"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Games</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Computer games have frequently used cyberpunk as a source of inspiration. Some of them, like <i><!--del_lnk--> Blade Runner</i> and the <i>Matrix</i> games, are based upon genre movies, while many others like <i><!--del_lnk--> Deus Ex</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> System Shock</i> are original works.<p>Several <!--del_lnk--> role-playing games (RPGs) called <i>Cyberpunk</i> exist: <i>Cyberpunk (aka Cyberpunk 2013)</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Cyberpunk 2020</i> and <i>Cyberpunk v3</i> (aka Cyberpunk 203X), by <!--del_lnk--> R. Talsorian Games, and <i><!--del_lnk--> GURPS Cyberpunk</i>, published by <!--del_lnk--> Steve Jackson Games as a module of the <!--del_lnk--> GURPS family of RPGs. <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> was designed with the settings of William Gibson&#39;s writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval, unlike the (perhaps more creative) approach taken by <!--del_lnk--> FASA in producing the <i><!--del_lnk--> Shadowrun</i> game (see below). Both games are set in the near future, in a world where <!--del_lnk--> cybernetics are prominent. <i><!--del_lnk--> Netrunner</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> collectible card game introduced in 1996, based on the <i>Cyberpunk 2020</i> role-playing game; it launched with a popular online <!--del_lnk--> alternate reality game called <i>Webrunner</i>, which let players hack into an evil futuristic corporation&#39;s mainframe. In addition, Iron Crown Enterprises released an RPG named <i><!--del_lnk--> Cyberspace</i>, now out of print.<p>In 1990, in an odd reconvergence of cyberpunk art and reality, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Secret Service raided <!--del_lnk--> Steve Jackson Games&#39;s headquarters and confiscated all their computers under <!--del_lnk--> Operation Sundevil, which was a massive crackdown on computer <!--del_lnk--> hackers and <!--del_lnk--> crackers. This was&mdash;allegedly&mdash;because the <i><!--del_lnk--> GURPS Cyberpunk</i> sourcebook could be used to perpetrate computer crime. That was, in fact, not the main reason for the raid, but after the event it was too late to correct the public&#39;s impression. Steve Jackson Games later won a lawsuit against the Secret Service, aided by the freshly minted <!--del_lnk--> Electronic Frontier Foundation. This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of <!--del_lnk--> GURPS Cyberpunk have a tagline on the front cover, which reads &quot;The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service! (See p. 4)&quot;. Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.<p>2004 brought the publication of a number of new cyberpunk RPGs, chief among which was <i><!--del_lnk--> Ex Machina,</i> a more cinematic game including four complete settings and a focus on updating the gaming side of the genre to current themes among cyberpunk fiction. These tropes include a stronger political angle, conveying the alienation of the genre and even incorporating some <!--del_lnk--> transhuman themes. 2006 saw the long-awaited publication of R. Talsorian&#39;s Cyberpunk v3, the followup to Cyberpunk 2020, although many see the new edition as more Transhumanist or Postcyberpunk than truly Cyberpunk.<p>Role-playing games have also produced one of the more original takes on the genre in the form of the 1989 game series <i><!--del_lnk--> Shadowrun</i>. Here, the setting is still that of the dystopian near future; however, it also incorporates heavy elements of <!--del_lnk--> fantasy literature and games, such as magic, spirits, elves, and dragons. <i>Shadowrun</i>&#39;s cyberpunk facets were modeled in large part on William Gibson&#39;s writings, and the game&#39;s original publishers, <!--del_lnk--> FASA, have been accused by some as having directly ripped off Gibson&#39;s work without even a statement of influence. Gibson, meanwhile, has stated his dislike of the inclusion of elements of <!--del_lnk--> high fantasy within setting elements that he helped pioneer. Nevertheless, <i>Shadowrun</i> has introduced many to the genre, and still remains popular among gamers.<p>The trans-genre RPG <i><!--del_lnk--> Torg</i> (published by <!--del_lnk--> West End Games) also included a variant cyberpunk setting (or &quot;cosm&quot;) called the <i>Cyberpapacy</i>. This setting was originally a medieval religious dystopia which underwent a sudden <i>Tech Surge</i>. Instead of corporations or corrupt governments, the Cyberpapacy was dominated by the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> False Papacy of Avignon&quot;. Instead of an <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>, hackers roamed the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> GodNet&quot;, a computer network rife with overtly religious symbolism, home to <!--del_lnk--> angels, <!--del_lnk--> demons, and other biblical figures. Another &quot;cosm&quot; setting that was part of the Torg gameworld was <i>Nippon Tech</i>, which incorporated other aspects of cyberpunk, such as dominant corporations with professional assassins. It did not, however, deal with computer networks as a major part of the setting.<p>Cyberpunk has also been used in computer adventure games, most notably the now freeware <i><!--del_lnk--> Beneath a Steel Sky</i> (published by <!--del_lnk--> Revolution Software), <i><!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer</i> (published by <!--del_lnk--> Interplay in 1988), <i><!--del_lnk--> Bloodnet</i> (published by <!--del_lnk--> Microprose 1993) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Gametek 1994). The action adventure game <!--del_lnk--> Neuromancer, is based directly on the novel&#39;s main theme including Chiba City, some of the characters, hacking of databases and cyberspace decks.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk&quot;</div>
