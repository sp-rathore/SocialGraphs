       <dd><i>This article describes</i> country <i>as a type of geographical or political entity. <b>Country</b> may also refer to the <!--del_lnk--> countryside or the <!--del_lnk--> country music genre, or the <!--del_lnk--> 1984 film of that name.</i></dl>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> political geography and <!--del_lnk--> international politics a <b>country</b> is a geographical territory. A dictionary definition would be &quot;<i>the land of a person&#39;s birth, residence, or citizenship; a political state or nation or its territory</i>&quot;. In common usage, it is used casually in the sense of both <i><!--del_lnk--> nation</i> (a cultural entity; see <a href="#Nation" title="">below</a>) and <i><!--del_lnk--> state</i> (a political entity; see <a href="#State" title="">below</a>). Definitions may vary. It is sometimes used to refer to both states and some other political entities., while in some occasions it refers only to <i>State</i>. It is not uncommon for general information or statistical publications to adopt the wider definition for purposes such as illustration and comparison.<p>This disparity is also reflected in general English usage. Usage within the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> tend to adopt a wider definition of the word <i>country</i>. Furthermore, the word is also used to refer to the constituent parts of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> (see <a href="#Constituent_countries" title="">below</a>). In most usages outside the UK, however, the term <i>country</i> carries with it strong connotations of political independence, and it may be considered politically incorrect by neutral observers to refer to <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a> as a country, for example.<p>There are dozens of non-<!--del_lnk--> sovereign territories which constitute geographical countries, but are not sovereign states. Several States have <!--del_lnk--> overseas dependencies, with territory and citizenry separate from their own. They are sometimes listed together with States on lists of countries.<p>

      <p>A country usually has its own <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, administration and <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">laws</a>; and often a <!--del_lnk--> constitution, <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a>, <!--del_lnk--> military, <!--del_lnk--> tax rules, and a <!--del_lnk--> population who are referred to as one another&#39;s <i>countrymen</i>. Together they form what <!--del_lnk--> Benedict Anderson has referred to as an <i>imagined community</i>.<p><a id="Types" name="Types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types</span></h2>

      <p>A <i>State</i> is an <!--del_lnk--> independent territory with a <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>, a population and <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty over these. The entire <!--del_lnk--> landmass of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> (excluding <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>), along with <!--del_lnk--> coastal seas is considered to be divided among such countries. There are currently 193 States (countries) recognised by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> &mdash; its 192 members and the <!--del_lnk--> Vatican City.<p>In addition to these, there are other non <!--del_lnk--> sovereign territories which, under the philosophy of <!--del_lnk--> self-determination, wish to be considered countries in this sense. Some of these have <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> control over their population and territory, such as <!--del_lnk--> Abkazia, but are not considered States as they are not recognised as having sovereignty. On the other hand, in some internationally-recognised States, there is no functioning central government or there are several <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> States and governments. These are internationally not considered to constitute separate States, but rather to exist on the territory of the internationally recognised State.<p><a id="Nation" name="Nation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nation</span></h3>

      <p>A nation is a &#39;set of people with a common identity who have formed a nation-state or usually aspire to do so&#39; (Viotti and Kauppi, 2001). In this sense of country, the reference is more likely to be to a group that supposedly shares a common <!--del_lnk--> ethnic origin, <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a>, religion, or history (real or imagined). The term has become synonymous with &#39;country&#39; where nations without sovereignty (that is, nations that are not States) have aimed to identify themselves on the same terms as sovereign States. Others, including <!--del_lnk--> nationalists, may consider their single nation (or country) to be divided between different States.<p><a id="Constituent_countries" name="Constituent_countries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Constituent countries</span></h3>

      <p>Four of the constituent parts of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, which itself may be considered a country in the sense of this article, are also called countries: <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> constituent countries of the United Kingdom). <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is also sometimes referred to as a <!--del_lnk--> province of the United Kingdom.<p><a id="Nation.2C_country_and_state:_a_comparison" name="Nation.2C_country_and_state:_a_comparison"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nation, country and state: a comparison</span></h2>
      <p>The casual use of &#39;country&#39;, &#39;State&#39; and &#39;nation&#39; as <!--del_lnk--> synonyms leads to confusion. Confounding this is the often confused official use: for example, the United Nations is actually a body made of &#39;States&#39;; and the countries constituting the United Kingdom are often called the <!--del_lnk--> home nations.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, the terms <!--del_lnk--> nation (cultural), country (geographical) and <!--del_lnk--> State (political) do have precise meanings, but in daily speech and writing they are often used interchangeably, and are open to different interpretations. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall is considered by some to be a nation in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> which is a <!--del_lnk--> constituent country, or <!--del_lnk--> home nation, of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The United Kingdom is an internationally recognised <!--del_lnk--> sovereign <!--del_lnk--> state, which is also referred to as a country and whose inhabitants have British <a href="../../wp/n/Nationality.htm" title="Nationality">nationality</a>. The terminology can be further complicated by the use of the word <i>state</i> to mean a non-sovereign sub-entity of a sovereign state, as is done in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States of America</a> (many of which, however, maintain that they are sovereign and independent states ) and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>. In most English-speaking countries when the terms <i>state</i>, <i>nation</i> and <i>country</i> are used internally, they are understood by the context in which they are used and are not controversial. However, when these terms are used to describe the statehood aspirations of a people who do not currently live in the internationally recognised <!--del_lnk--> independent State they would like to inhabit, these terms can be controversial and open to misunderstanding.<p>In reality, there is often a rough correspondence between both senses of country - this is the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> nation-state. It is one that many <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">governments</a> have attempted to encourage, in order to provide legitimacy to their control over a territory. However, because of historical and modern migration, ethnically homogeneous communities are rare or non-existent (<a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> being the most commonly quoted exceptions).<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country&quot;</div>
