      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Latin word <b>castra</b>, with its singular <b>castrum</b>, was used by the ancient Romans to mean any building or plot of land reserved to or constructed for use as a military defensive position. As the word appears in both <!--del_lnk--> Oscan and <!--del_lnk--> Umbrian (dialects of <!--del_lnk--> Italic) as well as in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, it probably descended from <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European to <!--del_lnk--> Italic.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The best known type of castra is the <!--del_lnk--> camp, a military town designed to house and protect the soldiers and their equipment and supplies when they were not fighting or marching. Regulations required a major unit in the field to retire to a properly constructed camp every day. &quot;...<i>as soon as they have marched into an enemy&#39;s land, they do not begin to fight till they have walled their camp about; nor is the fence they raise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide ill it, nor do those that are in it take their places at random; but if it happens that the ground is uneven, it is first leveled: their camp is also four-square by measure, and carpenters are ready, in great numbers, with their tools, to erect their buildings for them.</i>&quot;  To this end a marching column ported the equipment needed to build and stock the camp in a baggage train of wagons and on the backs of the soldiers.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Camps were the responsibility of engineering units to which specialists of many types belonged, officered by <i>architecti</i>, &quot;chief engineers&quot;, who requisitioned manual labor from the soldiers at large as required. They could throw up a camp under enemy attack in as little as a few hours. Judging from the names, they probably used a repertory of camp plans, selecting the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: <i>tertia castra</i>, <i>quarta castra</i>, etc., &quot;a camp of three days&quot;, &quot;four days&quot;, etc.<p>More permanent camps were <i>castra stativa</i>, &quot;standing camps.&quot; The least permanent of these were <i>castra aestiva</i> or <i>aestivalia</i>, &quot;summer camps&quot;, in which the soldiers were housed <i>sub pellibus</i> or <i>sub tentoriis</i>, &quot;under tents&quot;. Summer was the campaign season. For the winter the soldiers retired to <i>castra hiberna</i> containing barracks of more solid materials, with well-built barracks, public buildings and stone walls.<p>The camp allowed the Romans to keep a rested and supplied army in the field. Neither the Celts nor the Germanics had this capability. Their armies found it necessary to disperse after only a few days; meanwhile, their open camps invited attack when they were least prepared.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> American Heritage Dictionary</i>, following <!--del_lnk--> Julius Pokorny, lists <!--del_lnk--> *kes-, &quot;cut&quot;, as the root. One castrum was a reservation of land &quot;cut off&quot; for military use. It could be an entire base, such as <i>castrum Moguntiacum</i>, or it could be a single fortified building. From the latter use came the English word castle (castellum, a diminutive of castrum).<p>Castra in the plural refers to a collection of structures. Considering that the earliest structures were tents, which were cut out of hide or cloth, one castrum may well be a <!--del_lnk--> tent, with the plural meaning tents. All but the most permanent bases housed the men in barracks of tents placed in quadrangles and separated by numbered streets. From the plural come English place-name suffices such as -caster and -chester; e.g., Winchester, Lancaster.<p><a id="Plan_of_the_base" name="Plan_of_the_base"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plan of the base</span></h2>

      <p>The ideal enforced a linear plan for every single fort. The plan was a square for camps to contain one legion or less, or a rectangle for two legions, each legion being placed back-to-back with headquarters next to each other. Laying it out was a geometric exercise conducted by officers called <i>metatores</i>, or <i>gromatici</i>, who used graduated measuring rods called <i>decempedae</i> (&quot;10-footers&quot;) or <i>gromae</i> (Roman equivalent of a transit, but without the lenses, which they did not have), respectively. The layout process was a well-defined algorithm conducted by experienced men. It started in the centre at the planned site of the headquarters tent. Streets and architectural features were marked with colored pennants or rods.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The base (<i>munimentum</i>, &quot;fortification&quot;) was placed entirely within the <i><!--del_lnk--> vallum</i> (&quot;wall&quot;), which could be constructed under the protection of the legion in battle formation if necessary. The <i>vallum</i> was quadrangular aligned on the cardinal points of the compass. The construction crews dug a trench (<i>fossa</i>), throwing the excavated material inward, to be formed into the rampart (<i>agger</i>). On top of this a palisade of stakes (<i><!--del_lnk--> sudes</i> or <i>valli</i>) was erected. The soldiers had to carry these stakes on the march. Over the course of time, the palisade might be replaced by a fine brick or stone wall, and the ditch serve also as a moat. A legion-sized camp always placed towers at intervals along the wall with positions between for the division artillery.<p><a id="Interval" name="Interval"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Interval</span></h3>
      <p>Around the inside periphery of the <i>vallum</i> was a clear space, the <i>intervallum</i>, which served to catch enemy missiles, as an access route to the <i>vallum</i> and as a storage space for cattle (<i>capita</i>) and booty (<i>praeda</i>). Legionaries were quartered in a peripheral zone inside the <i>intervallum</i>, which they could rapidly cross to take up position on the <i>vallum</i>. Inside of the legionary quarters was a peripheral road, the <i>Via Sagularis</i>, probably &quot;service road&quot;, as the <i>sagum</i>, a kind of cloak, was the garment of slaves.<p><a id="Streets.2C_gates_and_central_plaza" name="Streets.2C_gates_and_central_plaza"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Streets, gates and central plaza</span></h3>
      <p>Every camp included &quot;main street&quot;, which ran unimpeded through the camp in a north-south direction and was very wide. The names of streets in many cities formerly occupied by the Romans suggest that the street was called <i>cardo</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Cardus Maximus</i>. This name applies more to cities than it does to ancient camps.<p>Typically &quot;main street&quot; was the <i>via principalis</i>. The central portion was used as a parade ground and headquarters area. The &quot;headquarters&quot; building was called the <i><!--del_lnk--> praetorium</i> because it housed the <i><!--del_lnk--> praetor</i> or base commander (&quot;first officer&quot;), and his staff. In the camp of a full legion he held the rank of <i><!--del_lnk--> consul</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> proconsul</i> but officers of lesser ranks might command.<p>On one side of the <i>praetorium</i> was the <i>quaestorium</i>, the building of the supply officer, or <i><!--del_lnk--> quaestor</i> (&quot;seeker&quot;). On the other side was the <i><!--del_lnk--> forum</i>, a small duplicate of an urban forum, where public business could be conducted. Along the <i>Via Principalis</i> were the homes or tents of the several <i><!--del_lnk--> tribunes</i> in front of the barracks of the units they commanded.<p>The <i>Via Principalis</i> went through the <i>vallum</i> in the <i>Porta Principalis Dextra</i> (&quot;right principle gate&quot;) and <i>Porta Principalis Sinistra</i> (&quot;left, etc.&quot;), which were gates fortified with <i>turres</i> (&quot;towers&quot;). Which was on the north and which on the south depends on whether the praetorium faced east or west, which remains unknown.<p>The central region of the <i>Via Principalis</i> with the buildings for the command staff was called the <i>Principia</i> (plural of <i>principium</i>). It was actually a square, as across this at right angles to the <i>Via Principalis</i> was the <i>Via Praetoria</i>, so called because the <i>praetorium</i> interrupted it. The <i>Via Principalis</i> and the <i>Via Praetoria</i> offered another division of the camp into four quarters.<p>Across the central plaza (<i>principia</i>) to the east or west was the main gate, the <i>Porta Praetoria</i>. Marching through it and down &quot;headquarters street&quot; a unit ended up in formation in front of the headquarters. The standards of the legion were located on display there, very much like the flag of modern camps.<p>On the other side of the praetorium the <i>Via Praetoria</i> continued to the wall, where it went through the <i>Porta Decumana</i>. In theory this was the back gate. Supplies were supposed to come in through it and so it was also called, descriptively, the <i>Porta Quaestoria</i>. The term Decumena, &quot;of the 10th&quot;, came from the arranging of <i>manipuli</i> or <i>turmae</i> from the first to the 10th, such that the 10th was near the <i>intervallum</i> on that side. The <i>Via Praetoria</i> on that side might take the name <i>Via Decumena</i> or the entire <i>Via Praetoria</i> be replaced with <i><!--del_lnk--> Decumanus Maximus</i>.<p><a id="Canteen" name="Canteen"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Canteen</span></h3>
      <p>In peaceful times the camp set up a marketplace with the natives in the area. They were allowed into the camp as far as the units numbered 5 (half-way to the praetorium). There another street crossed the camp at right angles to the <i>Via Praetoria</i>, called the <i>Via Quintana</i>, &quot;5th street&quot;. If the camp needed more gates, one or two of the <i>Porta Quintana</i> were built, presumably named <i>dextra</i> and <i>sinistra</i>. If the gates were not built, the <i>Porta Decumana</i> also became the <i>Porta Quintana</i>. At &quot;5th street&quot; a public market was allowed. The English word canteen comes from <i>Quintana</i>.<p><a id="Major_buildings" name="Major_buildings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major buildings</span></h3>

      <p>The <i>Via Quintana</i> and the <i>Via Principalis</i> divided the camp into three districts: the <i>Latera Praetorii</i>, the <i>Praetentura</i> and the <i>Retentura</i>. In the <i>latera</i> (&quot;sides&quot;) were the <i>Arae</i> (sacrificial altars), the <i><!--del_lnk--> Auguratorium</i> (for <!--del_lnk--> auspices), the <i>Tribunal</i>, where courts martial and arbitrations were conducted (it had a raised platform), the guardhouse, the quarters of various kinds of staff and the storehouses for grain (<i>horreae</i>) or meat (<i>carnarea</i>). Sometimes the <i>horreae</i> were located near the barracks and the meat was stored on the hoof. Analysis of sewage from latrines indicates the legionary diet was mainly grain. Also located in the <i>Latera</i> was the <i>Armamentarium</i>, a long shed containing the excess or heavy weapons and the artillery if it was not to go on the wall.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <i>Praetentura</i> (&quot;stretching to the front&quot;) contained the <i>Scamnum Legatorum</i>, the quarters of officers who were below general but higher than company commanders (<i>Legati</i>). Near the <i>Principia</i> were the <i>Valetudinarium</i> (hospital), <i>Veterinarium</i> (for horses), <i>Fabrica</i> (&quot;workshop&quot;, metals and wood), and further to the front the quarters of special forces. These included <i><!--del_lnk--> Classici</i> (&quot;marines&quot;, as most European camps were on rivers and contained a river naval command), <i>Equites</i> (&quot;cavalry&quot;), <i><!--del_lnk--> Exploratores</i> (&quot;scouts&quot;), and <i>Vexillarii</i> (carriers of vexillae, the official pennants of the legion and its units). Troops who did not fit elsewhere also were there.<p>The part of the <i>Retentura</i> (&quot;stretching to the rear&quot;) closest to the <i>Principia</i> contained the <i>Quaestorium</i>. By the late empire it had developed also into a safekeep for plunder and a prison for hostages and high-ranking enemy captives. Near the <i>Quaestorium</i> were the quarters of the headquarters guard (<i>Statores</i>), who amounted to two <!--del_lnk--> centuries (companies). If the <i><!--del_lnk--> Imperator</i> was present they served as his bodyguard.<p><a id="Barracks" name="Barracks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Barracks</span></h3>

      <p>Further from the <i>Qaestorium</i> were the tents of the <i>Nationes</i> (&quot;natives&quot;), who were auxiliaries of foreign troops, and the legionaries themselves in double rows of tents or barracks (<i>Strigae</i>). One <i>Striga</i> was as long as required and 60 feet wide. In it were two <i>Hemistrigia</i> of facing tents centered in its 30-foot strip. Arms could be stacked before the tents and baggage carts kept there as well. Space on the other side of the tent was for passage.<p>A tent was 10 by 12 feet (two feet for the aisle), ten men per tent. Ideally a company took 10 tents, arranged in a line of 10 companies, with the 10th near the <i>Porta Decumana</i>. Of the 100 sq. ft. of bunk space each man received 10, or about 2 by 5 feet, which was only practical if they slept with heads to the aisle. The single tent with its men was called <i><!--del_lnk--> contubernium</i>, also used for &quot;squad&quot;. A squad during some periods was 8 men or fewer.<p>The <i>Centurio</i>, or company commander, had a double-sized tent for his quarters, which served also as official company area. Other than there, the men had to find other places to be. To avoid mutiny, it became extremely important for the officers to keep them busy.<p>A covered portico might protect the walkway along the tents. If barracks had been constructed, one company was housed in one barracks building, with the arms at one end and the common area at the other. The company area was used for cooking and recreation, such as gaming. The army provisioned the men and had their bread (<i>panis militaris</i>) baked in outdoor ovens, but the men were responsible for cooking and serving themselves. They could buy meals or supplementary foods at the canteen. The officers were allowed servants.<p><a id="Sanitation" name="Sanitation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sanitation</span></h3>
      <p>For sanitary facilities, a camp had both public and private latrines. A public latrine consisted of a bank of seats situated over a channel of running water. One of the major considerations for selecting the site of a camp was the presence of running water, which the engineers diverted into the sanitary channels. Drinking water came from wells; however, the larger and more permanent bases featured the <i><!--del_lnk--> aquaductus</i>, a structure running a stream captured from high ground (sometimes miles away) into the camp. The praetorium had its own latrine, and probably the quarters of the high-ranking officers. In or near the <i>intervallum</i>, where they could easily be accessed, were the latrines of the soldiers. A public bathhouse for the soldiers, also containing a latrine, was located near or on the <i>Via Principalis</i>.<p><a id="Territory" name="Territory"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Territory</span></h3>
      <p>The influence of a base extended far beyond its walls. The total land required for the maintenance of a permanent base was called its <i>territoria</i>. In it were located all the resources of nature and the terrain required by the base: pastures, woodlots, water sources, stone quarries, mines, exercise fields and attached villages. The central castra might also support various fortified adjuncts to the main base, which were not in themselves self-sustaining (as was the base). In this category were <i>speculae</i>, &quot;watchtowers&quot;, <i>castella</i>, &quot;small camps&quot;, and naval bases.<p>All the major bases near rivers featured some sort of fortified naval installation, one side of which was formed by the river or lake. The other sides were formed by a polygonal wall and ditch constructed in the usual way, with gates and watchtowers. The main internal features were the boat sheds and the docks. When not in use, the boats were drawn up into the sheds for maintenance and protection. Since the camp was placed to best advantage on a hill or slope near the river, the naval base was usually outside its walls. The <i>classici</i> and the <i>optiones</i> of the naval installation relied on the camp for its permanent defense. Naval personnel generally enjoyed better quarters and facilities. Many were civilians working for the military.<p><a id="Modifications_in_practice" name="Modifications_in_practice"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modifications in practice</span></h3>
      <p>This ideal was always modified to suit the terrain and the circumstances. Each camp discovered by archaeology has its own specific layout and architectural features, which makes sense from a military point of view.<p>If, for example, the camp was built on an outcrop, it followed the lines of the outcrop. The terrain for which it was best suited and for which it was probably designed in distant prehistoric times was the rolling plain. The camp was best placed on the summit and along the side of a low hill, with spring water running in rivulets through the camp (<i>aquatio</i>) and pastureland to provide grazing (<i>pabulatio</i>) for the animals. In case of attack, arrows, javelins and sling missiles could be fired down at an enemy tiring himself to come up. For defense troops could be formed in an <i>acies</i>, or &quot;battle-line&quot;, outside the gates, where they could be easily resupplied and replenished, as well as being supported by archery from the palisade.<p>The streets, gates and buildings present depended on the requirements and resources of the camp. The gates might vary from two to six and not be centered on the sides. Not all the streets and buildings might be present.<p><a id="Quadrangular_camps_in_later_times" name="Quadrangular_camps_in_later_times"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Quadrangular camps in later times</span></h3>
      <p>Many villages in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> originated as Roman military camps and still show traces of their original pattern (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Castres in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>). The pattern was also used by <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonizers in America following strict rules by the Spanish monarchy for founding new cities in the <!--del_lnk--> New World.<p>Many of the towns of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> still retain forms of the word <i>castra</i> in their names -- <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster, <!--del_lnk--> Chester and <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, for example.<p><a id="Camp_life" name="Camp_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Camp life</span></h2>
      <p>Activities conducted in a castra can be divided into ordinary and &quot;the duty&quot; or &quot;the watch&quot;. Ordinary activity was performed during regular working hours. The duty was associated with operating the installation as a military facility. For example, all the soldiers were not required to man the walls all the time, but some soldiers were required to be on duty there without a lapse.<p>Duty time was divided into <i>vigilia</i>, the eight watches of three hours each into which the 24-hour day was divided. The Romans used signals on brass instruments to mark time. These were mainly the <i><!--del_lnk--> buccina</i> or <i>bucina</i> (a relative of English <!--del_lnk--> bugle), the <i><!--del_lnk--> cornu</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> tuba</i>. As they did not possess valves for regulating the pitch, the range of these instruments was somewhat limited. Nevertheless the musicians (<i>Aenatores</i>, &quot;brassmen&quot;) managed to define some 40 or so signals for issuing commands. The instrument used to mark the passage of a watch was the <i>buccina</i>, from which the trumpet derives. It was sounded by a <i>buccinator</i>.<p><a id="Ordinary_life" name="Ordinary_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ordinary life</span></h3>
      <p>Ordinary camp life began with a <i>buccina</i> call at daybreak, the first watch of the day. The soldiers arose at this time and shortly after collected in the company area for breakfast and assembly. The <!--del_lnk--> centurions were up before them and off to the <i>Principia</i> where they and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Equites</i> were required to assemble. The regimental commanders, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Tribunes</i>, were already converging on the <i>Praetorium</i>. There the general staff was busily at work planning the day. At a staff meeting the <i>Tribunes</i> received the password and the orders of the day. They brought those back to the <i>Centuriones</i>, who returned to their company areas to instruct the men, already breakfasted.<p>For soldiers, the main item of the agenda was a vigorous training session lasting about a watch long. Recruits received two, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Planning and supervision of training were under a general staff officer, who might manage training at several camps. <!--del_lnk--> Vegetius tells us the men might take a 20-mile hike or a 4- to 5- mile jog under full pack, or swim a river. Marching drill was always in order.<p>Every soldier was taught the use of every weapon and also was taught to ride. Seamanship was not excluded at bases that were also naval bases. Soldiers were generalists in the military and construction arts. They practiced archery, spear-throwing and above all swordmanship against posts (<i>pali</i>) fixed in the ground. Training was taken very seriously and was democratic. Ordinary soldiers would see all the officers training with them including the <i>Praetor</i> or the Emperor if he was in camp.<p>Swordmanship lessons and use of the firing range probably took place on the <i>campus</i>, a &quot;field&quot; outside the <i>castra</i>, from which English camp derives. Its surface could be lightly paved. Winter curtailed outdoor training. The general might in that case have sheds constructed, which served as field houses for training. There is archaeological evidence in one case of an indoors equestrian ring.<p>Apart from the training, each soldier had a regular job on the base, of which there were a large variety from the various kinds of clerks to the craftsmen. Soldiers changed jobs frequently. The commander&#39;s policy was to have all the soldiers skilled in all the arts and crafts so that they could be as interchangeable as possible. Even then the goal was not entirely achievable. The gap was bridged by the specialists, the <i>optiones</i> or &quot;chosen men&quot;, of which there were many different kinds. For example, a skilled artisan might be chosen to superintend a workshop.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The supply administration was run as a business using money as the medium of exchange. The <!--del_lnk--> aureus was the preferred coin of the late republic and early empire; in the late empire the <!--del_lnk--> solidus came into use. The larger bases, such as <i>Moguntiacum</i>, minted their own coins. As does any business, the base quaestorium required careful record keeping, performed mainly by the optiones. A chance cache of tablets from <!--del_lnk--> Vindolanda in Britain gives us a glimpse of some supply transactions. They record, among other things, the purchase of consumables and raw supplies, the storage and repair of clothing and other items, and the sale of items, including foodstuffs, to achieve an income. Vindolanda traded vigorously with the surrounding natives.<p>Another feature of the camp was the military hospital (<i>valetudinarium</i>, later <i>hospitium</i>). Augustus instituted the first permanent medical corps in the Roman army. Its physicians, the <i>medici ordinarii</i>, had to be qualified physicians. They were allowed medical students, practitioners and whatever orderlies they needed; i.e., the military hospitals were medical schools and places of residency as well.<p>Officers were allowed to marry and to reside with their families on base. The army could not extend the same privileges to the men, who were not allowed to marry. They often kept common law families off base in communities nearby. The communities might be native, as the tribesmen tended to build around a permanent base for purposes of trade, but also the base sponsored villages (<i>vici</i>) of dependents and businessmen. Dependents were not allowed to follow an army on the march into hostile territory.<p>An enlistment was for about 25 years. At the end of that time the veteran was given a <i>diploma</i>, or certificate of honorable discharge (<i>honesta missio</i>). Some of these have survived engraved on stone. Typically they certify that the veteran, his wife (one per veteran) and children or his sweetheart were now Roman citizens, which is a good indication that troops, which were used chiefly on the frontier, were from peoples elsewhere on the frontier, who wished to earn Roman citizenship.<p>Veterans often went into business in the communities near a base. They became permanent members of the community and would stay on after the troops were withdrawn, as in the notable case of <!--del_lnk--> St. Patrick&#39;s family.<p><a id="Duties" name="Duties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Duties</span></h3>
      <p>Conducted in parallel with the ordinary activities was &quot;the duty&quot;, the official chores required by the camp under strict military discipline. The <i>Praetor</i> was ultimately responsible for them as he was for the entire camp, but he delegated the duty to a tribune chosen as officer of the day. The line <i>Tribunes</i> were commanders of <i><!--del_lnk--> Cohortes</i> and were approximately the equivalent of colonels. The 6 tribunes were divided into units of two, with each unit being responsible for filling the position of officer of the day for two months. The two men of a unit decided among themselves who would take what day. They could alternate days or each take a month. One filled in for the other in case of illness. On his day, the tribune effectively commanded the camp and was even respected as such by the <i>Praetor</i>.<p>The equivalent concept of the duties performed in modern camps is roughly the detail. The responsibilities (<i>curae</i>) of the many kinds of detail were distributed to the men by all the methods considered fair and democratic: lot, rotation and negotiation. Certain kinds of <i>cura</i> were assigned certain classes or types of troops; for example, wall sentries were chosen only from <i>Velites</i>. Soldiers could be temporarily or permanently exempted: the <i>immunes</i>. For example, a <i>Triarius</i> was <i>immunis</i> from the <i>curae</i> of the <i>Hastati</i>.<p>The duty year was divided into time slices, typically one or two months, which were apportioned to units, typically <!--del_lnk--> maniples or <!--del_lnk--> centuries. They were always allowed to negotiate who took the duty and when. The most common kind of <i>cura</i> were the posts of the sentinels, called the <i>excubiae</i> by day and the <i>vigilae</i> at night. Wall posts were <i>praesidia</i>, gate posts, <i>custodiae</i>, advance positions before the gates, <i>stationes</i>.<p>In addition were special guards and details. One post was typically filled by four men, one sentinel and the others at ease until a situation arose or it was their turn to be sentinel. Some of the details were:<ul>
       <li>guarding, cleaning and maintaining the <i>principia</i>.<li>guarding and maintaining the quarters of each <!--del_lnk--> tribune.<li>tending the horses of each cavalry <i>turma</i>.<li>guarding the <i>praetorium</i>.</ul>
