      <p>A full grown adult male chimpanzee can weigh from 35-70 kg (75-155 pounds) and stand 0.9-1.2 m (3-4 ft) tall, while usually females weigh 26-50 kg (57-110 pounds) and stand 0.66-1 m (2-3.5 ft) tall.<p><a id="Lifespan" name="Lifespan"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Lifespan</span></h2>

      <p>Anatomical differences between Common and Pygmy Chimpanzees are slight, but in <!--del_lnk--> sexual and social behaviour there are marked differences. Common Chimpanzees have an <!--del_lnk--> omnivorous <!--del_lnk--> diet, a troop <!--del_lnk--> hunting culture based on beta males led by a relatively weak <!--del_lnk--> alpha, and highly complex social relationships; <a href="../../wp/b/Bonobo.htm" title="Bonobo">Bonobos</a>, on the other hand, have a mostly <!--del_lnk--> herbivorous diet and an <!--del_lnk--> egalitarian, <!--del_lnk--> matriarchal, sexually receptive behaviour. The exposed skin of the face, hands and feet varies from pink to very dark in both species, but is generally lighter in younger individuals, darkening as maturity is reached. Bonobos have longer arms and tend to walk upright more often than the Common Chimpanzee.<p><a id="History_of_human_interaction" name="History_of_human_interaction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of human interaction</span></h2>
      <p>Africans have had contact with chimpanzees for millennia. The first recorded contact of Europeans with chimps took place in present-day <a href="../../wp/a/Angola.htm" title="Angola">Angola</a> during the 1600s. The diary of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> explorer <!--del_lnk--> Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1506), preserved in the Portuguese National Archive (Torre do Tombo), is probably the first European document to acknowledge that chimpanzees built their own rudimentary tools.<p>The first use of the name &quot;chimpanzee&quot;, however, did not occur until 1738. The name is derived from a <!--del_lnk--> Tshiluba language term &quot;kivili-chimpenze&quot;, which is the local name for the animal and translates loosely as &quot;mockman&quot; or possibly just &quot;ape&quot;. The colloquialism &quot;<i>chimp</i>&quot; was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s. Science would eventually take the &#39;pan&#39; occurring in &#39;chim<i>pan</i>zee&#39; and attribute it to <!--del_lnk--> Pan, a rural ancient Greek god of <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Nature">nature</a>. Biologists would apply <i>Pan</i> as the genus name of the animal. Chimps as well as other apes had also been purported to have existed in ancient times, but did so mainly as myths and legends on the edge of Euro-Arabic societal consciousness, mainly through fragmented and sketchy accounts of European adventurers. Apes are mentioned variously by <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, as well as the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>.<p>When chimpanzees first began arriving on the European continent, European scientists noted the inaccuracy of these ancient descriptions, which often falsely reported that chimpanzees had horns and hooves. The first of these early trans-continental chimpanzees came from Angola and were presented as a gift to <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange in 1640, and were followed by a few of its brethren over the next several years. Scientists who examined these rare specimens were baffled, and described these first chimpanzees as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pygmies&quot;, and noted the animals&#39; distinct similarities to humans. The next two decades would see a number of the creatures imported into Europe, mainly acquired by various zoological gardens as entertainment for visitors.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Darwin.htm" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin&#39;s</a> <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Theory of evolution">theory of evolution</a> (published in 1859) spurred scientific interest in chimpanzees, as in much of <!--del_lnk--> life science, leading eventually to numerous studies of the animals in the wild and captivity. The observers of chimpanzees at the time were mainly interested in <!--del_lnk--> behaviour as it related to that of humans. This was less strictly and disinterestedly scientific than it might sound, with much attention being focused on whether or not the animals had traits that could be considered &#39;good&#39;; the intelligence of chimpanzees was often significantly exaggerated. At one point there was even a scheme drawn up to <!--del_lnk--> domesticate chimpanzees in order to have them perform various menial tasks (i.e. factory work). By the end of the 1800s chimpanzees remained very much a mystery to humans, with very little factual scientific information available.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> saw a new age of scientific research into chimpanzee behaviour. Prior to 1960, almost nothing was known about chimpanzee behaviour in their natural habitat. In July of that year, <!--del_lnk--> Jane Goodall set out to Tanzania&#39;s Gombe forest to live among the chimpanzees. Her discovery of chimpanzees making and using tools was groundbreaking, as it had previously been believed that humans were the only species to do so. The most progressive earlier studies on chimpanzees were spearheaded primarily by <!--del_lnk--> Wolfgang K&ouml;hler and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Yerkes, both of whom were renowned psychologists. Both men and their colleagues established laboratory studies of chimpanzees focused specifically on learning about the intellectual, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> problem-solving, abilities of chimpanzees. This typically involved basic, practical tests on laboratory chimpanzees, which required a fairly high intellectual capacity (such as how to solve the problem of reaching an out-of-reach banana). Notably, Yerkes also made extensive observations of chimpanzees in the wild which added tremendously to the scientific understanding of chimpanzees and their behaviour. Yerkes studied chimpanzees until <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, while K&ouml;hler concluded five years of study and published his famous <i>Mentality of Apes</i> in 1925 (which is coincidentally when Yerkes <i>began</i> his analyses), eventually concluding that &quot;chimpanzees manifest intelligent behaviour of the general kind familiar in human beings ... a type of behaviour which counts as specifically human&quot; (1925).<p>Common Chimpanzees have been known to attack humans on occasion. There have been many attacks in Uganda by chimpanzees against human children; the results are somtimes fatal for the children. Some of these attacks are presumed to be due to chimpanzees being drunk and mistaking human children for the <!--del_lnk--> Western Red Colobus, one of their favorite meals. The dangers of careless human interactions with chimpanzees are only aggravated by the fact that many chimpanzees perceive humans as potential rivals, and by the fact that the average chimpanzee has over 5 times the upper-body strength of a human male. As a result virtually any angered chimpanzee can easily overpower and potentially kill even a fully grown man, as shown by the attack and near death of former <!--del_lnk--> NASCAR driver <!--del_lnk--> Saint James Davis.<p><a id="Studies_of_language" name="Studies_of_language"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Studies of language</span></h2>

      <p>Scientists have long been fascinated with the studies of language, as it was potentially the most uniquely human cognitive ability. To test the hypothesis of the human-uniqueness of language, scientists have attempted to teach several species of <!--del_lnk--> great apes language. One early attempt was performed by Allen and Beatrice Gardner in the 1960s, in which they spent 51 months attempting to teach a chimpanzee named <!--del_lnk--> Washoe American Sign Language. Washoe learned 151 signs in those 51 months. Over a longer period of time, Washoe learned over 800 signs. Linguistic critics challenged the animal trainers to demonstrate that Washoe was actually using language and not symbols. The <i>null hypothesis</i> was that the Gardners were using conditioning to teach the chimpanzee to use hand formations in certain contexts to create desireable outcomes, and that they had not learned the same linguistic rules that humans innately learn.<p>In response to this challenge, the chimpanzee <!--del_lnk--> Nim Chimpsky was taught to communicate using sign language in studies led by Herbert S. Terrace. Similarly, after 44 months, Nim Chimpsky learned 125 signs. However, linguistic analysis of Nim&#39;s communications concluded that Nim&#39;s use was symbolic, and lacked grammar, or rules in the same sense that humans use rules in communicating via language. The average, college-educated English speaker has a vocabulary of greater than 100,000 words, which means humans learn roughly 14 words per day between ages 2 and 22, compared to the chimpanzee vocabulary learning rate of roughly 0.1 words per day.<p><a id="Taxonomic_relationships" name="Taxonomic_relationships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Taxonomic relationships</span></h2>

      <p>The genus <i>Pan</i> is now considered to be part of the subfamily <!--del_lnk--> Homininae to which <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> also belong. <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">Biologists</a> believe that the two species of chimpanzees are the closest living <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> relatives to <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a>. It is thought that humans shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees and gorillas as recently as <a href="../../wp/p/Pliocene.htm" title="Pliocene">four</a> to <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">seven million years ago</a>. Groundbreaking research by <!--del_lnk--> Mary-Claire King in 1973 found 99% identical <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> between human beings and chimpanzees, although research since has modified that finding to somewhere between 95 to 99.4 percent commonality, with at least some of the difference occurring in &#39;junk&#39; DNA. It has even been proposed that <i>troglodytes</i> and <i>paniscus</i> belong with <i>sapiens</i> in the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Homo</i>, rather than in <i>Pan</i>. One argument for this is that other species have been reclassified to belong to the same genus on the basis of less genetic similarity than that between humans and chimpanzees. Indeed cladistic taxonomy, based on both genetic difference and date of likely divergence, is very clear in placing both extant species of <i>Pan</i> in the genus <i>Homo</i>, mainly because the genus <i>Homo</i> takes precedence on account of being coined first. It is very important, however, to consider where the differences in the genome appear. A study published by Clark and Nielsen of <a href="../../wp/c/Cornell_University.htm" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> in the December <!--del_lnk--> 2003 issue of the journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Science</i> highlights differences related to one of humankind&#39;s defining qualities &mdash; the ability to understand <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> and to communicate through speech. These macro-phenotypic differences, however, may owe less to physiology than might be assumed given that <i>Homo sapiens</i> developed modern cultural features long after the modern physiological features were in place and indeed competed averagely against other species of <i>Homo</i> with regard to tools, etc for many millennia. Differences also exist in the genes for smell, in genes that regulate the metabolism of amino acids and in genes that may affect the ability to digest various proteins. See the <!--del_lnk--> history of hominoid taxonomy for more about the history of the classification of chimpanzees. See <!--del_lnk--> Human evolutionary genetics for more information on the speciation of humans and great apes.<p><a id="Fossils" name="Fossils"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fossils</span></h3>
      <p>Many <!--del_lnk--> human fossils have been found, but chimpanzee fossils had not been described until 2005. Existing chimpanzee populations in West and Central Africa do not overlap with the major human fossil sites in East Africa. However, chimpanzee fossils have now been reported from <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>. This would indicate that both humans and members of the <i>Pan</i> <!--del_lnk--> clade were present in the East African <!--del_lnk--> Rift Valley during the Middle <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee&quot;</div>
