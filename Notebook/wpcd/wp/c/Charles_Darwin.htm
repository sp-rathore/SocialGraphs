      <p><b>Charles Robert Darwin</b> <!--del_lnk--> FRS (<!--del_lnk--> 12 February <!--del_lnk--> 1809 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 19 April <!--del_lnk--> 1882) was a <!--del_lnk--> British <!--del_lnk--> naturalist who achieved lasting fame by producing considerable evidence that <!--del_lnk--> species originated through <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> change, at the same time proposing the <!--del_lnk--> scientific theory that <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> is the mechanism by which such change occurs. This theory is now considered a cornerstone of <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>, and has significantly affected other disciplines such as <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>.<p>Darwin developed his interest in natural history while studying first <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, then <!--del_lnk--> theology, at university. His <!--del_lnk--> five-year voyage on the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Beagle</i> brought him eminence as a <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geologist</a> whose work supported <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lyell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> uniformitarian theory of geology, and fame as a popular author. The wildlife distribution he saw on the voyage led him to investigate the <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of species and in 1838 he conceived his theory of natural selection. He had seen others attacked for such &quot;<!--del_lnk--> heretical&quot; ideas and confided only in his closest friends while carrying out extensive research so that anticipated objections were fully covered. However, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay describing a similar theory in 1858, forcing early joint <!--del_lnk--> publication of the theory.<p>His 1859 book <i>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</i> (usually abbreviated to <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i>) established evolution by <!--del_lnk--> common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. He continued his research and wrote a series of books on plants and animals, including humankind, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i>.<p>In recognition of Darwin&#39;s pre-eminence, he was buried in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, close to <!--del_lnk--> John Herschel and <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>.<p>

      <p>Charles Darwin was born in <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury, Shropshire, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 12 February <!--del_lnk--> 1809 at <!--del_lnk--> The Mount, the house his father built in 1800 on the River Severn. He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor <!--del_lnk--> Robert Darwin and <!--del_lnk--> Susannah Darwin (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Wedgwood). He was the grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus Darwin on his father&#39;s side, and of <!--del_lnk--> Josiah Wedgwood on his mother&#39;s side. (Charles later forged another Darwin-Wedgwood link by marrying his Cousin Emma Wedgwood, and his sister also married into the Wedgwoods: see <!--del_lnk--> Darwin &mdash; Wedgwood family). Both families were largely <!--del_lnk--> Unitarian, and Robert Darwin was practically a <!--del_lnk--> Freethinker but for appearances sake adopted the conventional <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a> of his clients. Charles was taken to the Unitarian chapel by his mother, and early in 1817 he joined the day school run by its preacher. In July of that year his mother died when he was still only eight. In September 1818, when he was nine, he entered the nearby Anglican <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury School as a <!--del_lnk--> boarder.<p>In 1825, Darwin spent the summer as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of <!--del_lnk--> Shropshire. In the autumn of that year, Darwin went to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh to study medicine. However, his revulsion at the brutality of surgery led him to neglect his medical studies. He learned <!--del_lnk--> taxidermy from <!--del_lnk--> John Edmonstone, a freed black slave who told him exciting tales of the South American <a href="../../wp/r/Rainforest.htm" title="Rainforest">rainforest</a>. (He would later, in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Descent of Man</i>, use his experience with Edmonstone as evidence that &quot;Negroes and Europeans&quot; were still very closely related despite looking superficially very different from one another.) In Darwin&#39;s second year he joined the <!--del_lnk--> Plinian Society, a student group interested in <!--del_lnk--> natural history. He became an avid pupil of <!--del_lnk--> Robert Edmund Grant, a proponent of evolution by acquired characteristics as proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles&#39; grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus. Darwin took part in Grant&#39;s investigations of the life cycle of marine animals on the shores of the <!--del_lnk--> Firth of Forth which found evidence for <i><!--del_lnk--> homology</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> radical theory that all animals have similar organs, differing only in complexity, showing <!--del_lnk--> common descent. In March 1827, Darwin made a presentation to the Plinian of his own discovery that the black spores often found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. He also sat in on <!--del_lnk--> Robert Jameson&#39;s natural history course, learning about <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphic <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>, receiving training in <!--del_lnk--> how to classify plants, and assisting with work on the extensive collections of the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Edinburgh University, one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.<span class="citation" id=".7B.7B.7Bref.7D.7D.7D">{{{author}}}, <i>{{{title}}}</i>, [[{{{publisher}}}]], [[{{{date}}}]].</span><p>In 1827, his father, unhappy that his younger son had no interest in becoming a physician, shrewdly enrolled him in a <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor of Arts course at <!--del_lnk--> Christ&#39;s College, <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> to qualify as a clergyman. This was a sensible career move at a time when many <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> <!--del_lnk--> parsons were provided with a comfortable income, and most naturalists in England were clergymen who saw it as part of their duties to explore the wonders of God&#39;s creation. However, Darwin preferred riding and shooting to studying. Along with his cousin <!--del_lnk--> William Darwin Fox, he became engrossed in the craze at the time for the competitive collecting of <a href="../../wp/b/Beetle.htm" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, and Fox introduced him to the Reverend <!--del_lnk--> John Stevens Henslow, professor of <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a>, for expert advice on beetles. Darwin subsequently joined Henslow&#39;s natural history course and became his favourite pupil, known to the <!--del_lnk--> dons as &quot;the man who walks with Henslow&quot;. When exams began to loom, Darwin focused more on his studies and received private instruction from Henslow. Darwin became particularly enthused by the writings of <!--del_lnk--> William Paley, including the <!--del_lnk--> argument of divine design in nature. In his finals in January 1831, he performed well in <!--del_lnk--> theology and, having scraped through in <!--del_lnk--> classics, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, came tenth out of a pass list of 178.<p>Residential requirements kept Darwin at Cambridge until June. In keeping with Henslow&#39;s example and advice, he was in no rush to take holy orders. Inspired by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander von Humboldt&#39;s <i>Personal Narrative</i>, he planned to visit the <!--del_lnk--> Madeira Islands to study natural history in the tropics with some classmates after graduation. To prepare himself for this project, Darwin joined the geology course of the Reverend <!--del_lnk--> Adam Sedgwick, a strong proponent of <!--del_lnk--> divine design, then, in the summer, went with him to assist in mapping strata in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>. He returned home to find a letter from Henslow who had recommended Darwin as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for the unpaid position of gentleman&#39;s companion to <!--del_lnk--> Robert FitzRoy, the captain of <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Beagle</i> which was to leave in four weeks on a two-year expedition to chart the coastline of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. His father objected to the voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, <!--del_lnk--> Josiah Wedgwood, to agree to his son&#39;s participation. This voyage became a five-year expedition that would lead to dramatic changes in many fields of science.<p><a id="Journey_on_the_Beagle" name="Journey_on_the_Beagle"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Journey on the Beagle</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>The <i>Beagle</i> survey took five years, two-thirds of which Darwin spent exploring on land. He studied a rich variety of geological features, <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> and living organisms, and met a wide range of people, both native and colonial. He methodically collected an enormous number of specimens, many of them new to science. This established his reputation as a naturalist and made him one of the precursors of the field of <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a>, particularly the notion of <!--del_lnk--> biocoenosis. His extensive detailed notes showed his gift for theorising and formed the basis for his later work, as well as providing social, political and <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropological</a> insights into the areas he visited.<p>Before they set out, FitzRoy gave Darwin volume one of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lyell&#39;s <i>Principles of Geology</i>, which explained landforms as the outcome of gradual processes over huge periods of time. On their first stop ashore at <!--del_lnk--> St Jago Darwin found rock formations which, seen this way, gave him a revolutionary insight into the geological history of the island, inspiring him to think of writing a book on the subject. Subsequently he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells in <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia as raised beaches, experienced an earthquake in <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, noted <!--del_lnk--> mussel-beds stranded above high tide showing that the land had been raised, and ,even high in the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>, found himself able to collect seashells. He theorised that <!--del_lnk--> coral <!--del_lnk--> atolls form on sinking volcanic mountains, and confirmed this when the <i>Beagle</i> surveyed the <a href="../../wp/c/Cocos_%2528Keeling%2529_Islands.htm" title="Cocos (Keeling) Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a>.<p>In <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> Darwin found and excavated rare fossils of gigantic extinct mammals, some in strata which showed no signs of catastrophe or change in climate, including a huge skull he thought was related to the African <!--del_lnk--> rhinoceros. At first he thought that fragments of bony armour came from a gigantic <a href="../../wp/a/Armadillo.htm" title="Armadillo">armadillo</a> like the small creatures common in the area, but was then misled by a text into thinking they belonged to the <!--del_lnk--> megatherium fossils he found nearby. He was sent Lyell&#39;s second volume which decried <!--del_lnk--> evolutionism and explained species distribution by &quot;centres of creation&quot;, but still puzzled over all he saw. He sometimes seemed close to his later ideas.<p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> he found that two species of <!--del_lnk--> rhea had separate but overlapping territories, and the <!--del_lnk--> mockingbirds<i><sup></sup></i> he collected on the <a href="../../wp/g/Gal%25C3%25A1pagos_Islands.htm" title="Gal&aacute;pagos Islands">Gal&aacute;pagos Islands</a> differed from one island to another. When organising his notes on the return journey, Darwin wrote that if his suspicions were correct, &quot;such facts undermine the stability of Species&quot; before cautiously adding &quot;would&quot; before &quot;undermine&quot;. He found the <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> <!--del_lnk--> marsupial <!--del_lnk--> rat-kangaroo and <a href="../../wp/p/Platypus.htm" title="Platypus">platypus</a> such strikingly unusual animals that it was almost as though two distinct Creators had been at work. After the voyage <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen showed that the armour fragments were from the <!--del_lnk--> glyptodon, a huge extinct armadillo, and other remains were of animals related to living creatures in the same area. Darwin<i><sup></sup></i> then found that Gal&aacute;pagos <!--del_lnk--> tortoises and <!--del_lnk--> finches formed distinct species unique to the individual islands they inhabited.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Three native missionaries were returned by the <i>Beagle</i> to <!--del_lnk--> Tierra del Fuego. They had become &quot;civilised&quot; in England over the previous two years, yet their relatives appeared to Darwin to be &quot;miserable, degraded savages&quot;. Within a year, the missionaries had reverted to their harsh previous way of life, yet they said they preferred this and did not want to return to England. This experience, his detestation of the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> he saw elsewhere in South America, and other problems he discovered such as the effect of European settlement on aborigines in <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Australia, persuaded him that there was no moral justification for the mistreating of others based on the concept of race. He now thought that humanity was not as far removed from animals as his clerical friends believed.<p>While on board the ship, Darwin frequently suffered from seasickness. In October 1833 he caught a fever in Argentina, and in July 1834, while returning from the Andes down to <a href="../../wp/v/Valpara%25C3%25ADso.htm" title="Valpara&iacute;so">Valpara&iacute;so</a>, he fell ill and spent a month in bed. From 1837 onwards Darwin was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as when attending meetings or dealing with controversy over his theory. The cause of <!--del_lnk--> this illness was unknown during his lifetime and attempts at treatment had little success; however, Recent speculation has suggested he caught <!--del_lnk--> Chagas disease from insect bites in South America. Other possible causes include psychobiological problems and <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;ni&egrave;re&#39;s disease.<p><a id="Growing_reputation_and_inception_of_theory" name="Growing_reputation_and_inception_of_theory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Growing reputation and inception of theory</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>While Darwin was still on the voyage, <!--del_lnk--> Henslow carefully fostered his former pupil&#39;s reputation by giving selected naturalists access to the fossil specimens and printed copies of Darwin&#39;s geological writings. When the <i>Beagle</i> returned on <!--del_lnk--> 2 October <!--del_lnk--> 1836, Darwin was a celebrity in scientific circles. He visited his home in Shrewsbury and his father organised investments so that Darwin could become a self-funded gentleman scientist. Darwin then went to <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and persuaded Henslow to work on botanical descriptions of modern plants he had collected. Afterwards Darwin went round the <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> institutions to find the best naturalists available. He described his other collections to them, and persuaded them to help with timely publication. <span class="citation" id=".7B.7B.7Bref.7D.7D.7D">{{{author}}}, <i>{{{title}}}</i>, [[{{{publisher}}}]], [[{{{date}}}]].</span><p>An eager <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lyell met Darwin on <!--del_lnk--> 29 October and introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen. After working on Darwin&#39;s collection of fossil bones at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal College of Surgeons, Owen caused great surprise by revealing that some were from gigantic extinct <!--del_lnk--> rodents and <!--del_lnk--> sloths.<span class="citation" id=".7B.7B.7Bref.7D.7D.7D">{{{author}}}, <i>{{{title}}}</i>, [[{{{publisher}}}]], [[{{{date}}}]].</span> This enhanced Darwin&#39;s reputation. With Lyell&#39;s enthusiastic backing, Darwin read his first paper to the <!--del_lnk--> Geological Society of London on <!--del_lnk--> 4 January <!--del_lnk--> 1837, arguing that the South American landmass was slowly rising, and presented his mammal and bird specimens to the <!--del_lnk--> Zoological Society. The Mammalia were taken on by <!--del_lnk--> George R. Waterhouse. Though the birds had seemed almost an afterthought, ornithologist <!--del_lnk--> John Gould revealed that the specimins from the Galapagos that Darwin had presumed to be a mixture of wrens, blackbirds and finches, were, in fact, all finches, each a separate species. Darwin had not kept track of which island his specimens were from, but others on the <i>Beagle</i>, including FitzRoy, had also collected them and had been more careful with their notes, and Darwin was able to work out their geographic distribution.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 17 February <!--del_lnk--> 1837 Lyell used his presidential address at the Geographical Society to present Owen&#39;s findings on Darwin&#39;s fossils, stressing that extinct species were related to current species in the same localities in accordance with his ideas of &quot;Centres of Creation&quot;. At the same meeting Darwin was elected to the Council of the Society.<p>In London, Darwin stayed with his <!--del_lnk--> freethinking brother, <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus, and at dinner parties met inspiring <!--del_lnk--> savants who thought that God preordained life by natural laws rather than <!--del_lnk--> ad hoc miraculous creations. His brother&#39;s lady friend, Miss <!--del_lnk--> Harriet Martineau, was a writer whose stories promoted <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Malthusian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Whig <a href="../../wp/p/Poor_Law.htm" title="Poor Law">Poor Law</a> reforms. Scientific circles were buzzing with ideas of <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of species controversially associated with <!--del_lnk--> <i>Radical</i> unrest. Darwin was a Whig but no political radical, and his sympathies were with the scientific establishment of his friends the Cambridge Dons. However, his observations of nature were pushing him beyond their sincere belief that Creation of species was true and necessary to justify religion and social order. <p>In private, Darwin was speculating on transmutation in his &quot;Red Notebook&quot; which he had begun on the <i>Beagle</i>. In mid-July he began his secret &quot;B&quot; notebook on transmutation, with reference to his earlier observation that every island in the Gal&aacute;pagos had its own different kind of <!--del_lnk--> tortoise. He developed the <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis that each tortoise species had originated from an original species and had adapted to life on the different islands in different ways. <div class="thumb tright">

      <p>While writing secretly about evolution in <!--del_lnk--> 1837, Darwin was busy with publishing information from his expedition. As captain, FitzRoy was required to write an official account of the Beagle voyages. He requested Darwin to contribute the natural history volume in the form of a <i>Journal</i> based on field notes. Darwin finished this around <!--del_lnk--> 20 June when King <a href="../../wp/w/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a> died and the <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Victorian</a> era began.<p>During the writing of his <i>Journal</i>, Darwin had two other projects to deal with: his book on South American Geology, and editing and publishing the expert reports on his fossil collection as a multivolume <i>Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle</i>. Henslow used his contacts to arrange a Treasury grant of &pound;1,000 to sponsor this.<p>Under the pressure of organising <i>Zoology</i> and correcting proofs of his <i>Journal</i>, Darwin&#39;s health waned. On <!--del_lnk--> 20 September <!--del_lnk--> 1837 he suffered &quot;palpitations of the heart&quot; and left for a month of recuperation in the country. Along the way,<i><sup></sup></i> he visitied <!--del_lnk--> Maer Hall where his invalid aunt was being cared for by her spinster daughter <!--del_lnk--> Emma Wedgwood and entertained them and his uncle with tales of his travels. His uncle <!--del_lnk--> Jos pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under <!--del_lnk--> loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms. This led Darwin to the idea for a talk which he gave to the Geological Society on <!--del_lnk--> 1 November, on the unusually mundane subject of worm casts: The first scholarly treatment of <!--del_lnk--> soil forming processes.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Fully recuperated, he returned home to Shrewsbury. Scientifically pondering his career and prospects he drew up a list with columns headed <i>&quot;Marry&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Not Marry&quot;</i>, with entries in the pro-marriage column included &quot;constant companion and a friend in old age ... better than a dog anyhow,&quot; while among the cons were &quot;less money for books&quot; and &quot;terrible loss of time.&quot; The pros won out. He had a discussion with his father about the prospect of marriage then went to visit his cousin Emma on <!--del_lnk--> 29 July <!--del_lnk--> 1838. He did not get around to proposing, but against his father&#39;s advice he told her of his ideas on transmutation, even though Emma had been brought up as a very devout <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>.<p>While his thoughts and work continued in London over the autumn he suffered repeated bouts of illness. On <!--del_lnk--> 11 November he returned and proposed to Emma, once more telling her his ideas. She accepted, but later wrote beseeching him to read from the Gospel of St. John a section on love and following <i>the Way</i> which also states that <i>&quot;If a man abide not in me...they are burned&quot;</i>. He sent a warm reply which eased her concern, but she would continue to worry that his lapses of faith could endanger her hope that they would meet in afterlife.<p>Darwin considered <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Malthus&#39;s</a> argument that human population increases more quickly than food production, leaving people competing for food and making charity useless. He later formulated this in the terms of his biological theory as: &quot;Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his means of subsistence; consequently he is occasionally subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and natural selection will have effected whatever lies within its scope.&quot; He linked this to the findings about species relating to localities, his enquiries into animal breeding, and ideas of Natural &quot;laws of harmony&quot;. Towards the end of November 1838 he compared breeders selecting traits to a Malthusian Nature selecting from variants thrown up by &quot;chance&quot; so that &quot;every part of newly acquired structure is fully practised and perfected&quot;, and thought this &quot;the most beautiful part of my theory&quot; of how species originated. <p>He went house-hunting and eventually found &quot;Macaw Cottage&quot; in Gower Street, London, then moved his &quot;museum&quot; in over Christmas. He was showing signs of stress, and Emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking &quot;So don&#39;t be ill any more my dear Charley till I can be with you to nurse you.&quot; On <!--del_lnk--> 24 January <!--del_lnk--> 1839 he was honoured by being elected as <!--del_lnk--> Fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society and presented his paper on the Roads of Glen Roy.<p><a id="Marriage_and_children" name="Marriage_and_children"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Marriage and children</span></h3>

      <p>Darwin was now an eminent naturalist, settled with a private income, and privately working on his theory. He had a vast amount of work to do, writing up all his findings and supervising the preparation of the multivolume <i>Zoology</i>, which would describe his collections. He embarked on extensive experiments with plants and consultations with <!--del_lnk--> animal husbanders, including pigeon and pig breeders, trying to find soundly based answers to all the arguments he anticipated when he presented his theory in public.<p>When FitzRoy&#39;s account was published in May 1839, Darwin&#39;s <i>Journal and Remarks</i> was a great success. Later that year it was published on its own, becoming the bestseller today known as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Voyage of the Beagle</i>. In December 1839, as Emma&#39;s first pregnancy progressed, Darwin suffered more illness and accomplished little during the following year.<p>Darwin tried to explain his theory to close scientific friends, but they were slow to show interest and thought that selection must need a divine selector. In 1842 the family moved to rural <!--del_lnk--> Down House to escape the pressures of London. Darwin formulated a short &quot;Pencil Sketch&quot; of his theory, and by 1844 had written a 240-page &quot;Essay&quot; that expanded his early ideas on natural selection. Darwin feared putting the theory out in an incomplete form. His ideas about evolution were bound to be highly controversial, if any attention was paid to them at all. Other ideas about evolution &ndash; especially the work of <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Baptiste Lamarck &ndash; had been soundly dismissed by the English scientific community, and were associated with <!--del_lnk--> political radicalism. The anonymous publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation</i> in 1844 created another controversy over radicalism and evolution, and was severely attacked by Darwin&#39;s friends who emphasised that no reputable scientist would want to be associated with such ideas.<p>Darwin completed his third <i>geological</i> book in 1846. Assisted by his friend, the young botanist <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Dalton Hooker, he embarked on a huge study of <!--del_lnk--> barnacles. In 1847, Hooker read the &quot;Essay&quot; and sent notes that provided Darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed.<p>In an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went to a spa in <!--del_lnk--> Malvern in 1849. To his surprise, he found that the two months of water treatment helped. Then his treasured daughter Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary. After a long series of crises, she died and Darwin <!--del_lnk--> lost all faith in a beneficent God.<p>He met the young freethinking naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Huxley who was to become a close friend and ally. Darwin&#39;s work on barnacles (<i>Cirripedia</i>) had found &quot;<!--del_lnk--> homologies&quot; that supported his theory by showing that slightly changed body parts could serve different functions to meet new conditions, and in 1853 it earned him the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society&#39;s Royal Medal, establishing his reputation as a <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biologist</a>. He completed this study in 1854 and turned his attention to his theory of species.<p><a id="Publication_of_theory" name="Publication_of_theory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Publication of theory</span></h3>

      <p>Darwin found an answer to the problem of the forking of <!--del_lnk--> genera in an analogy with industrial ideas of division of labour, with specialised varieties each finding their niche so that species could diverge. He experimented with seeds, testing their ability to survive sea-water to transfer species to isolated islands, and bred pigeons to test his ideas of natural selection being comparable to the &quot;artificial selection&quot; used by pigeon breeders.<p>In the spring of 1856, Lyell read a paper on the <i>Introduction</i> of species by <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist working in <!--del_lnk--> Borneo. Lyell urged Darwin to publish his theory to establish precedence. Despite illness, Darwin began a 3-volume book titled <i>Natural Selection</i>, obtaining specimens and information from naturalists including Wallace and <!--del_lnk--> Asa Gray. In December 1857, as Darwin worked on the book, he received a letter from Wallace asking if it would delve into human origins. Sensitive to Lyell&#39;s fears, Darwin responded that &quot;I think I shall avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest &amp; most interesting problem for the naturalist.&quot; He encouraged Wallace&#39;s theorising, saying &quot;without speculation there is no good &amp; original observation.&quot; Darwin added that &quot;I go much further than you.&quot; His manuscript reached 250,000 words, then on <!--del_lnk--> 18 June <!--del_lnk--> 1858 he received a paper in which Wallace described the evolutionary mechanism and requested him to send it on to Lyell. Darwin did so, shocked that he had been &quot;forestalled&quot;. Though Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin offered to send it to any journal that Wallace chose. He put matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker. They agreed on a joint presentation at the <!--del_lnk--> Linnean Society on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July of <i><!--del_lnk--> On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection</i>. Darwin&#39;s infant son died and he was unable to attend.<p>The initial announcement of the theory gained little immediate attention. It was mentioned briefly in a few small reviews, but to most people it seemed much the same as other varieties of <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary thought. For the next thirteen months Darwin suffered from ill health and struggled to produce an abstract of his &quot;big book on species&quot;. Receiving constant encouragement from his scientific friends, Darwin finally finished his abstract and Lyell arranged to have it published by <!--del_lnk--> John Murray. The title was agreed as <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</a></i>, and when the book went on sale to the trade on <!--del_lnk--> 22 November <!--del_lnk--> 1859, the stock of 1,250 copies was oversubscribed. At the time &quot;Evolutionism&quot; implied creation without divine intervention, and Darwin avoided using the words &quot;evolution&quot; or &quot;evolve&quot;, though the book ends by stating that &quot;endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&quot; The book only briefly alluded to the idea that human beings, too, would evolve in the same way as other organisms. Darwin wrote in deliberate understatement that &quot;light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.&quot;<p><a id="Reaction_to_the_publication" name="Reaction_to_the_publication"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Reaction to the publication</span></h3>

      <p>Darwin&#39;s book set off a public controversy which he monitored closely, keeping press cuttings of thousands of <!--del_lnk--> reviews, <!--del_lnk--> articles, <!--del_lnk--> satires, <!--del_lnk--> parodies and <!--del_lnk--> caricatures. Reviewers were quick to pick out the unstated implications of &quot;men from monkeys&quot;, though a <!--del_lnk--> Unitarian review was favourable and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> published a glowing review by Huxley which included swipes at <!--del_lnk--> Richard Owen, leader of the scientific establishment Huxley was trying to overthrow. Owen initially appeared neutral, but then wrote a review condemning the book.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> scientific establishment including Darwin&#39;s old Cambridge tutors <!--del_lnk--> Sedgwick and <!--del_lnk--> Henslow reacted against the book, though it was well received by a younger generation of professional naturalists. Then <i><!--del_lnk--> Essays and Reviews</i> by seven liberal <!--del_lnk--> Anglican theologians declared that miracles were irrational (and supported the <i>Origin</i>), distracting attention away from Darwin.<p>The most famous confrontation took place at a meeting of the <!--del_lnk--> British Association for the Advancement of Science in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Professor <!--del_lnk--> John William Draper delivered a long lecture about Darwin and social progress, then <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Wilberforce, the <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Oxford, argued against Darwin. In the ensuing debate <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Hooker argued strongly for Darwin and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Huxley established himself as &quot;Darwin&#39;s bulldog&quot; &ndash; the fiercest defender of evolutionary theory on the Victorian stage. The story is that on being asked by Wilberforce whether he was descended from <a href="../../wp/m/Monkey.htm" title="Monkey">monkeys</a> on his grandfather&#39;s side or his grandmother&#39;s side, Huxley muttered: &quot;The Lord has delivered him into my hands&quot; and replied that he &quot;would rather be descended from an ape than from a cultivated man who used his gifts of culture and eloquence in the service of prejudice and falsehood&quot; (this is contested). The story spread around the country: Huxley had said he would rather be an <a href="../../wp/a/Ape.htm" title="Ape">ape</a> than a Bishop.<p>Many people felt that Darwin&#39;s view of nature destroyed the important distinction between man and beast. Darwin himself did not personally defend his theories in public, though he read eagerly about the continuing debates. He was frequently very ill, and mustered support through <!--del_lnk--> letters and correspondence. A core circle of scientific friends &ndash; Huxley, Hooker, <!--del_lnk--> Charles Lyell and <!--del_lnk--> Asa Gray &ndash; actively pushed his work to the fore of the scientific and public stage, defending him against his many critics in this key scientific controversy of the era, and helping to gain him the honour of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society&#39;s Copley Medal in 1864. Darwin&#39;s theory also resonated with various movements at the time and became a key fixture of popular culture. The book was translated into many languages and went through numerous reprints. It became a staple scientific text accessible both to a newly curious middle class and to &quot;working men&quot;, and was hailed as the most controversial and discussed scientific book ever written.<p><a id="Active_into_old_age" name="Active_into_old_age"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Active into old age</span></h3>

      <p>Despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life Darwin pressed on with his work. He had published an abstract of his theory, but more controversial aspects of his &quot;big book&quot; were still incomplete. These included explicit evidence of humankind&#39;s descent from earlier animals, and exploration of possible causes underlying the development of society and of human mental abilities. He had yet to explain features with no obvious utility other than decorative beauty. His experiments, research and writing continued.<p>When Darwin&#39;s daughter fell ill he set aside his experiments with seedlings and domestic animals to go with her to a seaside resort where he became interested in wild <!--del_lnk--> orchids. This developed into an innovative study of how their beautiful flowers served to control insect pollination and ensure cross fertilisation. As with the barnacles, homologous parts served different functions in different species. Back at home he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with experiments on climbing plants. He was visited by a reverent <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Haeckel who had spread the gospel of <i>Darwinismus</i> in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Even at Cambridge, students now supported his ideas. Huxley gave &quot;working-men&#39;s lectures&quot; to widen the audience, and Wallace remained a supporter but increasingly turned to <!--del_lnk--> spiritualism. <i>Variation</i> grew to two huge volumes, forcing him to leave out humankind and sexual selection, but when printed was in huge demand.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The question of <!--del_lnk--> human evolution had been taken up by his supporters (and detractors) shortly after the publication of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Origin_of_Species.htm" title="The Origin of Species">The Origin of Species</a></i>, but Darwin&#39;s own contribution to the subject came more than ten years later with the two-volume <i><!--del_lnk--> The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</i> published in 1871. In the second volume, Darwin introduced in full his concept of <!--del_lnk--> sexual selection to explain the evolution of human culture, the differences between the human sexes, and the differentiation of human <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">races</a>, as well as the beautiful (and seemingly non-adaptive) plumage of birds. A year later Darwin published his last major work, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i>, which focused on the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with to the behaviour of animals. He developed his ideas that the human mind and cultures were developed by natural and sexual selection, an approach which has been revived in the last two decades with the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary psychology. As he concluded in <i>Descent of Man</i>, Darwin felt that despite all of humankind&#39;s &quot;noble qualities&quot; and &quot;exalted powers&quot;:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>His evolution-related experiments and investigations culminated in five books on plants, and then his last book returned to the effect worms have on soil levels.<p>Darwin died in Downe, <!--del_lnk--> Kent, England, on <!--del_lnk--> 19 April <!--del_lnk--> 1882. He had expected to be buried in St Mary&#39;s churchyard at Downe, but at the request of Darwin&#39;s colleagues, <!--del_lnk--> William Spottiswoode (<!--del_lnk--> President of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society) arranged for Darwin to be given a <!--del_lnk--> state funeral and buried in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, close to <!--del_lnk--> John Herschel and <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Isaac Newton</a>. <p><a id="Religious_views" name="Religious_views"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Religious views</span></h2>

      <p>Charles Darwin came from a <!--del_lnk--> Nonconformist background. Though several members of his family were <!--del_lnk--> Freethinkers, openly lacking conventional religious beliefs, he did not initially doubt the literal truth of the Bible. He attended a <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> school, then at Cambridge studied <!--del_lnk--> Anglican theology. He intended to become a clergyman, and was fully convinced by <!--del_lnk--> William Paley&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> teleological argument that design in nature proved the existence of God. However, his beliefs began to shift during his time on board <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Beagle</i>. He questioned what he saw&mdash;wondering, for example, at beautiful deep-ocean creatures created where no one could see them, and shuddering at the sight of a wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs; he saw the latter as contradicting Paley&#39;s vision of beneficent design. While on the <i>Beagle</i> Darwin was quite <!--del_lnk--> orthodox and would quote the Bible as an authority on morality, but had come to see the history in the <!--del_lnk--> Old Testament as being false and untrustworthy.<p>Upon his return, he investigated <!--del_lnk--> transmutation of species. He knew that his clerical naturalist friends thought this a bestial heresy undermining miraculous justifications for the social order and knew that such revolutionary ideas were especially unwelcome at a time when the Church of England&#39;s established position was under attack from <!--del_lnk--> radical <!--del_lnk--> Dissenters and <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheists</a>. While secretly developing his theory of <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a>, Darwin even wrote of religion as a <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribal</a> survival strategy, though he still believed that God was the ultimate lawgiver. His belief continued to dwindle over the time, and with the death of his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Annie in 1851, Darwin finally lost all faith in Christianity. He continued to give support to the local church and help with parish work, but on Sundays would go for a walk while his family attended church. In later life, when asked about his religious views, he wrote that he had never been an <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a> in the sense of denying the existence of a God, and that generally &quot;an <a href="../../wp/a/Agnosticism.htm" title="Agnosticism">Agnostic</a> would be the more correct description of my state of mind.&quot;<p>Charles Darwin recounted in his biography of his grandfather <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus Darwin how false stories were circulated claiming that Erasmus had called for Jesus on his deathbed. Charles concluded by writing &quot;Such was the state of Christian feeling in this country [in 1802].... We may at least hope that nothing of the kind now prevails.&quot; Despite this hope, very similar stories were circulated following Darwin&#39;s own death, most prominently the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lady Hope Story&quot;, published in <!--del_lnk--> 1915 which claimed he had converted on his sickbed. Such stories have been propagated by some Christian groups, to the extent of becoming <!--del_lnk--> urban legends, though the claims were refuted by Darwin&#39;s children and have been dismissed as false by historians. His daughter, Henrietta, who was at his deathbed, said that he did not convert to Christianity. His last words were, in fact, directed at Emma: &quot;Remember what a good wife you have been.&quot;<br clear="both" />

      </div>
      <p>Charles Darwin&#39;s theory that evolution occurred through <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> changed the thinking of countless fields of study from <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> to <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>. His work established that &quot;evolution&quot; had occurred: not necessarily that it was by natural or sexual selection (this particular recognition would not become fully standard until the rediscovery of <a href="../../wp/g/Gregor_Mendel.htm" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>&#39;s work in the early 20th century and the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> modern synthesis). Others before him had outlined the idea of natural selection: in his lifetime Darwin acknowledged the earlier writings of <!--del_lnk--> William Charles Wells and <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Matthew which he (and practically all other naturalists) had been unaware of when publishing his theory. However, it is clear that Darwin was the first to develop and publish a <!--del_lnk--> scientific theory of natural selection, and that the alleged predecessors did not contribute to the development or success of natural selection as a theory in science.<p>Darwin&#39;s work was very controversial at the time he published it and many during his time did not take it seriously. Evolution by natural selection proved to be a significant blow to notions of <a href="../../wp/c/Creationism.htm" title="Creationism">divine creation</a> and <!--del_lnk--> intelligent design prevalent in <!--del_lnk--> 19th-century science, specifically overturning the <!--del_lnk--> Creation biology doctrine of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> created kinds&quot;. The idea that there was no line to be drawn between human beings, races, and animals would forever make Darwin a symbol of iconoclasm who removed humanity&#39;s privileged place in the universe. To some of his detractors, Darwin would be &quot;the monkey man&quot;, often depicted as part ape. His ideas also stood in opposition to the more common beliefs at the time that the human races had developed separately or that one race was superior by virtue of biology to another.<p><a id="Commemoration" name="Commemoration"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Commemoration</span></h3>
      <p>During Darwin&#39;s lifetime many species and geographical features were given his name, including the <!--del_lnk--> Darwin Sound named by <!--del_lnk--> Robert FitzRoy after Darwin&#39;s prompt action saved them from being marooned, and the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Mount Darwin in the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> celebrating Darwin&#39;s 25th birthday. When the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Beagle</i> was surveying <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> in 1839, Darwin&#39;s friend <!--del_lnk--> John Lort Stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship&#39;s captain <!--del_lnk--> Wickham named <i>Port Darwin</i>. The settlement of <!--del_lnk--> Palmerston <!--del_lnk--> founded there in 1869 was officially renamed <!--del_lnk--> Darwin in 1911 and became the capital city of Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Northern Territory, which also boasts <!--del_lnk--> Charles Darwin University and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Darwin National Park.<p>The 14 species of <!--del_lnk--> Finches he researched in the <a href="../../wp/g/Gal%25C3%25A1pagos_Islands.htm" title="Gal&aacute;pagos Islands">Gal&aacute;pagos Islands</a> are affectionately named &quot;Darwin&#39;s Finches&quot; in honour of his legacy. In <!--del_lnk--> 1964, <!--del_lnk--> Darwin College, Cambridge was founded, named in honour of the Darwin family, partially because they owned some of the land it was on. In <!--del_lnk--> 1992, Darwin was ranked #16 on <!--del_lnk--> Michael H. Hart&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> list of the most influential figures in history. Darwin was given particular recognition in <!--del_lnk--> 2000 when his image appeared on the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of England <!--del_lnk--> ten pound note, replacing <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. His impressive, luxuriant beard (which was reportedly difficult to forge) was said to be a contributory factor to the bank&#39;s choice. Darwin came fourth in the <i><!--del_lnk--> 100 Greatest Britons</i> poll sponsored by the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> and voted for by the public.<p>As a humorous celebration of evolution, the annual <!--del_lnk--> Darwin Award is bestowed on individuals who &quot;aid the process of evolution by demonstrating their unfitness through fatally stupid actions.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2006, he was featured in his own &quot;Darwin&quot; exhibition at the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>.<p><a id="Eugenics" name="Eugenics"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Eugenics</span></h3>

      <p>Following Darwin&#39;s publication of the <i>Origin</i> his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Francis Galton applied the concepts to human society, producing ideas to promote &quot;hereditary improvement&quot; starting in <!--del_lnk--> 1865 and elaborated at length in <!--del_lnk--> 1869. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Descent of Man</i> Darwin agreed that Galton had demonstrated that &quot;talent&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; in humans were probably inherited, but thought that the social changes Galton proposed were too &quot;utopian&quot;. Neither Galton nor Darwin supported government intervention and instead believed that, at most, heredity should be taken into consideration by people seeking potential mates. In <!--del_lnk--> 1883, after Darwin&#39;s death, Galton began calling his social philosophy <i><!--del_lnk--> Eugenics</i>. In the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a>, eugenics movements gained popularity in a number of countries and became associated with reproduction control programmes such as <!--del_lnk--> compulsory sterilisation laws, then were stigmatised after their usage in the rhetoric of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in its goals of genetic &quot;purity&quot;.<p><a id="Social_Darwinism" name="Social_Darwinism"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Social Darwinism</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1944 the American historian <!--del_lnk--> Richard Hofstadter applied the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Social Darwinism&quot; to describe 19th- and 20th-century thinking developed from the ideas of <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Spencer, which applied ideas of evolution and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> survival of the fittest&quot; to societies or nations competing for survival in a hostile world. These ideas became discredited by association with <!--del_lnk--> racism and <!--del_lnk--> imperialism. Though the term is anachronistic, in Darwin&#39;s day the difference between what was later called &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; and simple &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Darwinism&quot; was less clear. However, Darwin did not believe that his scientific theory mandated any particular theory of governance or social order. Indeed, he believed that sympathy should be extended to all races and nations.<p>The use of the phrase &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; to describe Malthus&#39;s ideas is particularly disingenuous, since Malthus died in <!--del_lnk--> 1834 before the <!--del_lnk--> inception of Darwin&#39;s theory was spurred by his reading the 6th edition of Malthus&#39; famous <i>Essay on a Principle of Population</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1838. Spencer&#39;s evolutionary &quot;progressivism&quot; and his social and political ideas were largely Malthusian, and his books on economics of <!--del_lnk--> 1851 and on evolution of <!--del_lnk--> 1855 predated Darwin&#39;s publication of the <i>Origin</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1859.<p><a id="Works" name="Works"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Works</span></h2>
