      <p><b>Colditz Castle</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> castle in the town of <!--del_lnk--> Colditz near <!--del_lnk--> Leipzig, <a href="../../wp/d/Dresden.htm" title="Dresden">Dresden</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Chemnitz in the <!--del_lnk--> state of <!--del_lnk--> Saxony in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> (<span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;7&prime;50.82&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">12&deg;48&prime;26.94&Prime;E</span></span>). Used as a <!--del_lnk--> workhouse for the indigent and a <!--del_lnk--> mental institution for over 100 years, it became notorious as <!--del_lnk--> Oflag IV-C a <!--del_lnk--> prisoner-of-war camp for &quot;incorrigible&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Allied officers who had repeatedly escaped from other camps. The <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Schutzstaffel</i> (SS) made Colditz a <i>Sonderlager</i> (high-security <!--del_lnk--> prison camp), the only one of its type within Germany. <!--del_lnk--> Hermann G&ouml;ring &mdash; holder of the singular rank <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichsmarschall</i> (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Field Marshal of the Empire&quot;) &mdash; even declared Colditz &quot;escape-proof&quot;. This was in part because of its lack of escapes during its term as prison camp in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, but mostly due to it being the only German <!--del_lnk--> prisoner-of-war camp with more guards than prisoners. Yet despite this audacious claim, there were multiple escapes by <!--del_lnk--> British, <!--del_lnk--> Canadian, <!--del_lnk--> French, <!--del_lnk--> Polish, <!--del_lnk--> Dutch, and <!--del_lnk--> Belgian inmates.<p>

      <p>In 1046, <!--del_lnk--> Henry III of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> gave the <!--del_lnk--> burgher of Colditz permission to build the first documented <!--del_lnk--> settlement at the site. In 1083, <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV recommended <!--del_lnk--> Markgraf <!--del_lnk--> Wiprecht of Groitzsch to develop the castle site, which Colditz accepted. In 1158, <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Frederick Barbarossa appointed <!--del_lnk--> Thimo I &quot;Lord of Colditz&quot;, and major building works began. Around 1200, the actual city around the market was established. <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">Forests</a>, empty <!--del_lnk--> meadows, and <!--del_lnk--> farmland were settled and organized next to the pre-existing <!--del_lnk--> slavic villages <!--del_lnk--> Zschetzsch, <!--del_lnk--> Zschadra&szlig;, <!--del_lnk--> Zollwitz, <!--del_lnk--> Terpitzsch and <!--del_lnk--> Koltzschen. Around that time the larger villages <!--del_lnk--> Hohnbach, <!--del_lnk--> Thierbaum, <!--del_lnk--> Ebersbach and <!--del_lnk--> Tautenhain also emerged.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the castle played an important role as a watchtower for the <!--del_lnk--> German Emperors and therefore was the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Reich territories of the <!--del_lnk--> Plei&szlig;enland (anti-<!--del_lnk--> Mei&szlig;en <!--del_lnk--> Plei&szlig;e-lands). Around 1404, the nearly 250-year-old dynasty of the Lords of Colditz ended when <!--del_lnk--> Thimo VIII sold Colditz Castle for 15,000 <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> <!--del_lnk--> marks into the possession of the <!--del_lnk--> Wettin family dynasty.<p>As a result of territorial politics in <!--del_lnk--> Saxony, the city and state of Colditz was officially established in the <!--del_lnk--> Margravate (county) of <!--del_lnk--> Mei&szlig;en. In 1430, the <!--del_lnk--> Hussites attacked Colditz and set city and castle on fire. Around 1464, renovation and new building work on the Castle was carried out by <!--del_lnk--> Prince Ernst, who died in Colditz Castle in 1486. Under <!--del_lnk--> Frederick the Wise and <!--del_lnk--> Johann the Gentle, Colditz was a royal residence of the <!--del_lnk--> Electors of Saxony.<p><a id="The_rebuilt_castle" name="The_rebuilt_castle"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The rebuilt castle</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>In 1504, the servant Clemens the baker accidentally set Colditz on fire, and the city hall, church, castle and a large part of the city went up in flames. In 1506, reconstruction began and new buildings were raised around the rear castle courtyard. In 1523 the castle park was turned into one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> zoos in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. In 1524, rebuilding of the upper floors of the castle began. The castle was reconstructed in a fashion that corresponded to the way it was divided up &mdash; into the cellar, the royal house and the banquet hall building. There is nothing more to be seen of the original fortified castle, where the present rear castle is located, but it is still possible to make out where the original divisions were (the Old or Lower House, the Upper House and the Great House).<p>The structure of the castle was changed under the long reign of the <!--del_lnk--> elector <!--del_lnk--> Augustus of Saxony (1553 to 1586), and the complex was reconstructed into a <!--del_lnk--> Renaissance style castle from 1577 to 1591, including the portions that were still in the <!--del_lnk--> gothic architectural style. Architects <!--del_lnk--> Hans Irmisch and <!--del_lnk--> Peter Kummer supervised the further restoration and rebuilding. Later, <!--del_lnk--> Lucas Cranach the Younger was commissioned as an artist in the Castle.<p>During this period the portal at what is known as the church house was created in 1584, made of <!--del_lnk--> porphyry and richly decorated in the <!--del_lnk--> mannerist style by <!--del_lnk--> Andreas Walther II. It was at this time that both the interior and the exterior of &quot;the Holy Trinity&quot; castle <!--del_lnk--> chapel that links the cellar and royal house with one another were redesigned. Shortly thereafter, the castle became an administrative centre for the Office of Colditz and a <!--del_lnk--> hunting <!--del_lnk--> lodge. In 1694, its then-current holder, <!--del_lnk--> Augustus the Strong, began to expand it, resulting in a second courtyard and a total of 700 rooms.<p><a id="The_modern_castle" name="The_modern_castle"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The modern castle</span></h3>

      <p>In the 19th century, the church space was rebuilt in the <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neo-classic architectural</a> style, but its condition was allowed to deteriorate. The castle was used by <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Augustus III, Elector of Saxony as a workhouse to feed the poor, the ill, and persons under arrest. It served this purpose from 1803 to 1829, when its workhouse function was taken over by an institution in <!--del_lnk--> Zwickau. In 1829 the castle became a <!--del_lnk--> mental hospital for the &quot;incurably insane&quot; from <!--del_lnk--> Waldheim. In 1864, a new hospital building was erected in the <!--del_lnk--> Gothic Revival style, on the ground where the <!--del_lnk--> stables and working quarters were previously located. It remained a mental institution until 1924.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the castle was used as a <!--del_lnk--> Prisoner of War camp (see <!--del_lnk--> POW). No escapes were made at this time. When the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> came to power in 1933, they turned the castle into a political prison for <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communists</a>, <!--del_lnk--> homosexuals, <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jews</a>, and other &quot;undesirables&quot;. It was not until 1939 that <!--del_lnk--> allied prisoners were housed there. In April 1945, US troops entered Colditz town and, after a two-day fight, conquered the castle on <!--del_lnk--> April 16.<p>In May 1945, the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> occupation of Colditz began. Following the <!--del_lnk--> Yalta Conference it then became a part of <!--del_lnk--> East Germany. The Soviets turned Colditz castle into a prison camp for local burghers and non-communists. Later the castle was a home for the aged and <!--del_lnk--> nursing home, as well as a <!--del_lnk--> hospital and psychiatric clinic. For many years after the War, forgotten hiding spots and tunnels were found by repairmen.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Today the castle and the church space require a significant amount of <!--del_lnk--> refurbishment and restoration. The last users moved out on <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1996, and since then the castle has been almost empty except for the occasional visitor. The &quot;Gesellschaft Schloss Colditz e.V.&quot; (the Castle Colditz historical society), founded in 1996, has its offices in a portion of the administration building in the front castle court.<p><!--del_lnk--> As of 2005 portions of the castle are closed off to <!--del_lnk--> tourists due to renovation. In particular the chapel, portions of the attic, much of the interior, the tunnels, and at least one exterior face are undergoing refinishing.<p><a id="Colditz_Castle_as_a_mental_institution" name="Colditz_Castle_as_a_mental_institution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Colditz Castle as a mental institution</span></h2>
      <p>For nearly a hundred years, between 1829 and 1924, Colditz was a <!--del_lnk--> sanitarium, generally reserved for the <!--del_lnk--> wealthy and the <!--del_lnk--> nobility of <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The castle thus functioned as a hospital during a long stretch of massive upheaval in Germany, from slightly after the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> destroyed the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and created the <!--del_lnk--> German Confederation, throughout the lifespan of the <!--del_lnk--> North German Confederation, the complete reign of the <!--del_lnk--> German Empire, throughout the First World War, and until the beginnings of the <a href="../../wp/w/Weimar_Republic.htm" title="Weimar Republic">Weimar Republic</a>. Between 1914 and 1918, the castle was home to both psychiatric and <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> patients, 912 of whom died of <!--del_lnk--> malnutrition.<p>Colditz Castle was also home to several notable figures during its time as a mental institution, including Ludwig Schumann, the second youngest son of the famous composer <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Schumann.htm" title="Robert Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Georg August Baumgarten, one of the original inventors of the <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Airship">airship</a>.<p><a id="Colditz_Castle_as_Oflag_IVc" name="Colditz_Castle_as_Oflag_IVc"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Colditz Castle as Oflag IVc</span></h2>
      <p>After the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> the castle was converted into a high security Prisoner of War camp for officers who had become security or escape risks or who were regarded as <i>volksfeindlich</i>, or treasonous against the people. Since the castle is situated on a rocky outcropping above the <!--del_lnk--> Mulde river, the Germans believed it to be an ideal site for a high security prison.<p>The larger outer courtyard, known as the <i>Kommandantur,</i> had only two exits and housed a large German garrison. The prisoners lived in an adjacent courtyard in a 90 foot (27 m) tall building. Outside, the flat <!--del_lnk--> terraces which surrounded the prisoners&#39; accommodation were constantly watched by armed sentries and surrounded by <!--del_lnk--> barbed wire. Although known as Colditz Castle to the locals, its official German designation was <i>Oflag IVc</i> and it was under <!--del_lnk--> Wehrmacht control.<p><a id="Population_changes" name="Population_changes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Population changes</span></h3>

In March 1945, 1200 French prisoners were brought to Colditz Castle, with 600 more being imprisoned in the town below.</dl>

      <p>Among the more famous inmates were British fighter ace <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Bader; <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Reid, the man who made Colditz famous with his post war books; <!--del_lnk--> Airey Neave, the first British officer to escape from Colditz; New Zealand British Army Captain <!--del_lnk--> Charles Upham, the only combat soldier to ever receive the <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_Cross.htm" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Cross</a> twice; and <!--del_lnk--> David Stirling, founder of the wartime <!--del_lnk--> Special Air Service.<p>There were also prisoners called <i>Prominente</i>, relatives of Allied VIPs.

      <p>When the end of the war approached, the number of Prominente increased. Eventually there were Viscount <!--del_lnk--> George Lascelles, nephew to <a href="../../wp/g/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>; <!--del_lnk--> John Alexander Elphinstone, nephew of <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth; Captain <!--del_lnk--> George Haig, son of WWI <!--del_lnk--> field marshal <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Haig; <!--del_lnk--> Charles Hope, son of <!--del_lnk--> Victor Hope, the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroy of India; Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> John Winant Jr., son of <!--del_lnk--> John Gilbert Winant, <!--del_lnk--> US ambassador to Britain; <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz B&oacute;r-Komorowski, commander of the <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Uprising; and four German generals. <!--del_lnk--> British Commando <!--del_lnk--> Michael Alexander, claimed to be a nephew of field marshal <!--del_lnk--> Harold Alexander in order to escape execution, but was merely a distant cousin.<p><!--del_lnk--> Micky Burn, another famous inmate of Colditz, was a British commando captured at <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Nazaire. Burn had been a journalist like Romilly before the war, working for <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i>. Burn had briefly been an admirer of the <!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party and in 1936 had met Adolf Hitler, who signed his copy of <i><!--del_lnk--> Mein Kampf</i>. After the war broke out Burn politically shifted to <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and gave lectures to prisoners at Colditz, however, due to his pre-war interest in Nazi philosophy he was widely regarded with distrust and scorn.<p>Lord <!--del_lnk--> John Francis Arundell, 16th <!--del_lnk--> Baron Arundell of Wardour (1907-1944) was an aristocrat held at Colditz who, despite his pedigree, was not awarded prominente status. Arundell made a habit of exercising in the winter snow, a habit which would lead to his contracting <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and to his eventual death in Chester Military Hospital.<p>At 1:30am on <!--del_lnk--> Friday the 13th, <!--del_lnk--> April <!--del_lnk--> 1945, while the battles approached the area, the Prominente were moved under guard and the cover of darkness. The Allies and prisoners became especially concerned that the Prominente might be used as hostages, bargaining chips, <!--del_lnk--> human shields, or that the SS might try to kill them out of spite; they prepared for resistance and, if possible, to take over the castle. The Germans moved all the Prominente out of the castle, over the protestations of the other prisoners. When US troops reached the area, prisoners convinced the leader of their guards <i>Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer</i> <!--del_lnk--> Gottlob Berger to surrender in secret, so as to save him from the revenge of the SS. With his aid they reached American lines a couple of weeks later. He would later receive a lessened sentence after his hearing in 1949 because of his actions regarding the Prominente.<p><a id="The_German_staff_and_visitors" name="The_German_staff_and_visitors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The German staff and visitors</span></h3>

      <p>Keeping the castle running was a difficult task, the Germans maintained a larger garrison at the castle than at many of their other prison camps. Between the years of 1939 and 1945, more than 70 German officers and enlisted men worked in a wide variety of staff positions as well as overseeing prisoner&#39;s labour.<p>There was also a large contingent of civilians and local townspeople who would be on castle grounds. Some would be in maintenance (<!--del_lnk--> electrician, <!--del_lnk--> carpenter, <!--del_lnk--> plumber, etc...), some in medical roles (<!--del_lnk--> dentist, <!--del_lnk--> doctor, etc...), some would be there in a supervisory role (<!--del_lnk--> Nazi Party leaders, Swiss <!--del_lnk--> Red Cross observers, etc...), others would be on grounds merely because they were family members of the military officers at the camp.<p>

      <p><a id="Life_in_the_camp" name="Life_in_the_camp"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Life in the camp</span></h3>
      <p>In Colditz, the Wehrmacht followed the <!--del_lnk--> Geneva Convention to the letter. Would-be escapees were punished with <!--del_lnk--> solitary confinement, instead of being summarily executed. In principle, the security officers recognized that it was the duty of the POWs to try to escape and that their own job was to stop them. Prisoners could even form <!--del_lnk--> gentlemen&#39;s agreements with the guards, such as not using borrowed tools for escape attempts.<p>Most of the guard company was composed of <!--del_lnk--> WWI veterans and young soldiers not fit for the front. Because Colditz was a high security camp, the Germans organized three and then later four <i><!--del_lnk--> Appells</i> (<!--del_lnk--> roll calls) a day to count the prisoners. If they discovered someone had escaped, they alerted every <a href="../../wp/p/Police.htm" title="Police">police</a> and <!--del_lnk--> train station within a 40 km (25 miles) radius, and all the members of the <!--del_lnk--> Hitler Youth joined the hunt.<p>Due to the number of <!--del_lnk--> Red Cross food parcels, prisoners sometimes ate better than their guards, who had to rely on Wehrmacht rations. Prisoners could use their relative luxuries for trade and, for example, exchange their <!--del_lnk--> cigarettes for <!--del_lnk--> Reichsmark that they hoped could later use in their escape attempts. Occasionally this turned to be a mistake as several of the bills they received were of the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Papiermark varieties that were no longer considered valid. There were also other currencies in circulation, these included the <!--del_lnk--> Registermark, utilized for travelling and investments in Germany; the <!--del_lnk--> Reisemark, for tourists; the <!--del_lnk--> Kreditsperrmark, for sales of property belonging to foreigners; the <!--del_lnk--> Effektensperrmark, arising from the sale of securities in Germany; the <!--del_lnk--> Reichskreditkassenschein in occupied territories; and the <!--del_lnk--> Behelfszahlungsmittel (Auxiliary Payment Certificates) for the German Armed Forces. The Kreditsperrmark and Effektensperrmark were consolidated into the <!--del_lnk--> Handelsperrmark in 1939. Due to the massive variety of currency types and uses, in several escape attempts, escapees with one of these various currencies printed before 1939 were told their money was no good &mdash; leaving them moneyless and easier to recapture.<p>Prisoners had to make their own entertainment. In August 1941 the first camp <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympics</a> were organized by the Polish prisoners. Events were held in football (soccer), volleyball, boxing, and chess, but the closing ceremony was interrupted by a German fire drill. &quot;The British came in last place in every event cheerfully, to the dismay of the other participants who took the competition deadly seriously,&quot; according to the British inmate John Wilkens in a 1986 interview. Prisoners also formed a Polish <!--del_lnk--> choir, a Dutch Hawaiian <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitar</a> band, and a French <!--del_lnk--> orchestra.<p>The British put on homemade revues, classical <!--del_lnk--> plays and <!--del_lnk--> farces including: <i><!--del_lnk--> Gaslight</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Rope</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Man Who Came to Dinner</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pygmalion</i>, and <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest.htm" title="The Importance of Being Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></i>. Several prisoners even intentionally grew their hair long so as to better portray female roles. Prisoner <!--del_lnk--> Jock Hamilton-Baillie even used to shave his legs, rub them in brown shoe polish, and draw a line down the back of his legs in pencil to simulate the appearance of silk stockings. This allowed him special &quot;bath privileges&quot; in the German guards washroom, since the prisoner&#39;s showers were unable to get the polish off his legs. Staging these plays even gained the prisoners access to &quot;parole tools&quot;, tools which were used to build the sets and promised not to be used to escape. During the summer months, the theater&#39;s peak periods, there were new productions every two weeks. The biggest success of the theatre however would be the Christmas themed <i>Ballet Nonsense</i> which premiered on <!--del_lnk--> November 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 and ran until the <!--del_lnk--> November 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 show which Hauptmann Priem (the first prison warden of Colditz) attended.<p>Another pastime which occupied much of the prisoners&#39; time was the production of <!--del_lnk--> moonshine <a href="../../wp/a/Alcohol.htm" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>. Initially started by the Polish contingent using a recipe of <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Yeast">yeast</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>, German <!--del_lnk--> jam and <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> from their Red Cross parcels, and then taken up by other prisoners, it did not take long for <!--del_lnk--> stills to be secreted all across Colditz (one of which remained undiscovered until a tourist trip in 1984). Prisoner Michael Farr, whose family ran <!--del_lnk--> Hawker&#39;s Gin (the sole purveyors of <!--del_lnk--> Sloe gin with a Royal Warrant), even managed to make a sparkling wine dubbed &quot;Ch&acirc;teau Colditz&quot;. Some prisoners would get black teeth or even temporary blindness from consuming this beverage &mdash; a condition known as &quot;jam-happy&quot; &mdash; as it contained many impurities. Although the German guards despised the drunken prisoners, they generally turned a blind eye to the distilling.<p>Officers also studied languages, learning from each other, and told stories. Most popular of these stories were the embellished retelling of BBC broadcasts by Jim Rogers. Since mail was regularly screened by censors, and the German newspapers received by prisoners contained much Nazi propaganda, the only reliable information prisoners could obtain on the progress of the war in Europe was through BBC broadcasts received via one of two radios which were secreted in the castle. These radios were smuggled in by French prisoner <!--del_lnk--> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;rick Guigues and named &quot;Arthur 1&quot; and &quot;Arthur 2&quot;. The first radio was quickly discovered due to a <!--del_lnk--> mole, but the second would remain secreted away until Guigues returned and removed it during a tour of the castle in 1965. The radio hide would not be permanently exposed until 1992 during repairs to the roof. <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Later the most popular way to pass the time was <i>stoolball</i>, a particularly rough version of <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_football.htm" title="Rugby football">rugby</a>, where there were two stools at either end of the prisoners&#39; courtyard and goals were scored by knocking off the goalie who was sitting on the stool. This game served as an outlet for pent-up aggression, and also provided noise to cover the sounds of tunnel-digging.<p>In addition to escape attempts, prisoners also tried to make the life of their guards more miserable by resorting to &quot;goon-baiting&quot;, making nuisances of themselves by harassing the guards. For example, they would drop water and <!--del_lnk--> excrement bombs on the guards. <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Bader even encouraged his junior officers to do that. British Flight Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Pete Tunstall especially tried to cause havoc by disturbing the roll call even if nobody was trying to escape, so that the guards would not become suspicious when somebody was. He went through a total of five <!--del_lnk--> courts martial and suffered a total of 415 days in solitary confinement.<p><a name=".22Thou_shalt_escape_if_you_possibly_can.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Thou shalt escape if you possibly can&quot;</span></h3>

      <p>Prisoners contrived a number of methods to escape. They duplicated keys to various doors, made copies of maps, forged <i>Ausweise</i> (<!--del_lnk--> identity papers), and manufactured their own tools. <!--del_lnk--> MI9, a department of the British <!--del_lnk--> War Office which specialized in escape equipment, communicated with the prisoners in <a href="../../wp/c/Cryptography.htm" title="Cryptography">code</a> and <!--del_lnk--> smuggled them new escape aids disguised in care packages from family or from non-existent charities, although they never tampered with <!--del_lnk--> Red Cross care packages for fear it would force the Germans to stop their delivery to all camps. The Germans became skilled at intercepting these.<p>There was also a form of <!--del_lnk--> black market whereby the prisoners used items from their Red Cross parcels to buy information and tools from the cooperative guards and townsfolk. Since the Germans allowed Douglas Bader to visit the town, he took <a href="../../wp/c/Chocolate.htm" title="Chocolate">chocolate</a> and other luxuries with him for trading. Flight Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Cen&#x113;k Chaloupka traded goods for information and even had a girlfriend in the town. <!--del_lnk--> David Stirling later took control of the black market operations.<p>There was only one fatality during the escape attempts: British Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Michael Sinclair in September 1944. The Germans buried him in Colditz cemetery with full military honours &mdash; his casket was draped with a <!--del_lnk--> Union Jack flag made by the German guards, and he received a 7 gun salute. Post-war he was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Distinguished Service Order, the only one to receive it for escaping during WWII. He is currently buried in grave number 10.1.14 at <!--del_lnk--> Berlin War Cemetery in the <!--del_lnk--> Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>.<p><a id="Unsuccessful_escapes" name="Unsuccessful_escapes"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Unsuccessful escapes</span></h4>
      <p>Most of the escape attempts failed. Pat Reid, who later wrote about his experiences in Colditz, failed to escape at first and then became an &quot;Escape Officer&quot;, charged with coordinating the various national groups so they would not ruin each other&#39;s escape attempts. Escape Officers were generally not themselves permitted to escape. Many tried unsuccessfully to escape in <!--del_lnk--> disguise: <!--del_lnk--> Airey Neave twice dressed as a guard, French Lieutenant Boul&eacute; disguised in <!--del_lnk--> drag, British Lieutenant <!--del_lnk--> Michael Sinclair even dressed as camp Kommandant Rothenberger, when he tried to organize a mass escape, and French Lieutenant Perodeau disguised as regular camp electrician Willi P&ouml;hnert (&quot;Little Willi&quot;):<p>On the night of <!--del_lnk--> December 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, one of the French officers deliberately blew out the fuse on the lights in the courtyard. As they had anticipated P&ouml;hnert was summoned, and while he was still fixing the lights, Lieutenant Perodeau, dressed almost identically to P&ouml;hnert and carrying a tool box, walked casually out of the courtyard gate. He passed the first guard without incident, but the guard at the main gate asked for his token &mdash; tokens were issued to each guard and staff member upon entry of the camp guardhouse specifically to avoid this type of escape &mdash; with no hope of bluffing his way out of this, Perodeau surrendered.<p>Dutch <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculptors</a> made two <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a> heads to stand in for escaping officers in the roll call. Later, &quot;ghosts&quot;, officers who had faked a successful escape and hid in the castle, took the place of escaping prisoners in the roll call in order to delay discovery as long as possible.<p>Camp guards collected so much escape equipment that they established a &quot;Kommandant&#39;s Escape Museum&quot;. Local <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photographer</a> <!--del_lnk--> Johannes Lange took photographs of the would-be escapees in their disguises or re-enacting their attempts for the camera. Along with the Lange photographs, one of the two sculpted clay heads was displayed proudly in the museum. Security officer <!--del_lnk--> Reinhold Eggers made them a regular part of <i>Das Abwehrblatt</i>, a weekly magazine for the German POW camps.<p>There were also several rather inventive escape attempts:<p><a id="The_Mattress" name="The_Mattress"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">The Mattress</span></h5>
      <p>In late 1940, British officer Peter Allan found out that the Germans were moving several <!--del_lnk--> mattresses from the castle to another camp and decided that would be his way out. He let the French officers moving the mattresses know that one would be a little bit heavier. Allan, a fluent German speaker due to his schooling in Germany before the war, dressed himself up in a <i>Hitlerjugend</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Hitler Youth) uniform, stuffed <i><!--del_lnk--> Reichsmark</i> in his pockets, and had himself sewn into one of the mattresses. He managed to get himself loaded into the truck, and unloaded into an empty house within the town. Cutting himself out of the mattress several hours later, when all he could hear was silence, he climbed out of the window into the garden and walked down the road towards his freedom. Along the 100 mi (161 km) way to <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> via <a href="../../wp/s/Stuttgart.htm" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> he got a lift with a senior SS officer. Allan recalled that ride as the scariest moment of his life, &quot;To be vulgar, I nearly needed a new pair of trousers.&quot; Allan had been aiming to reach Poland, but soon after reaching Vienna he found he was out of money. At this time the Americans had not yet entered the war, so Allan decided to ask the American embassy for assistance; he was refused. Allan had been on the run at this point for nine days; broke, exhausted, and hungry, he fell asleep in a park. Upon waking he discovered he could no longer walk due to his <!--del_lnk--> starvation. Soon after he was picked up and returned to Colditz, where he spent the next 3 months in solitary confinement.<p><a id="The_Bed-Sheet_Rope" name="The_Bed-Sheet_Rope"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">The Bed-Sheet Rope</span></h5>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> May 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1941 in a scene seemingly straight out of a film, Polish officers Lieutenants <!--del_lnk--> Miki Surmanowicz and <!--del_lnk--> Mietek Chmiel, attempted to <!--del_lnk--> rappel down a 36 m (120 ft) wall to freedom on a <!--del_lnk--> rope constructed out of <!--del_lnk--> bed sheets. In order to get into position, both men put themselves into solitary confinement. After forcing open the door and picking the locks, they made their way to the courtyard where they climbed up to a narrow ledge. From the ledge they were able to jump to the guard house roof, and climb through an open window on the outer wall. Reusing their bed sheet rope they lowered themselves to the ground, where they were caught by a German guard.<p><a id="The_Canteen_Tunnel" name="The_Canteen_Tunnel"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">The Canteen Tunnel</span></h5>
      <p>Early in 1941, the British prisoners had gained access to the sewers and drains which ran beneath the floors of the castle. Entrance to these was from a <!--del_lnk--> manhole cover in the floor of the canteen. After initial reconnaissance trips, it was decided that the drain should be extended, and an exit made in a small grassy area which was overlooked from the canteen window. From here, they had planned to climb down the hill, and drop down below the steep outside eastern wall of the castle. Knowing which sentry would be on duty during the planned night of the escape, they pooled their resources and collected 500 Reichsmark for a bribe (100 of which were paid up front). This plan took 3 months of preparation. On the evening of <!--del_lnk--> May 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1941, Pat Reid hid in the canteen when it was locked up for the night. He removed the bolt from the lock on the door, and returned to the courtyard. After the evening meeting, the chosen escapers slipped into the canteen unnoticed.<p>They entered the tunnel and waited for the signal to proceed. Unknown to the prisoners, they had been betrayed by the bribed guard. Waiting on the grassy area was <!--del_lnk--> Hauptmann Priem and his guard force.<p>Pat Reid recalls:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;I climbed out on to the grass and Rupert Barry, immediately behind me, started to follow. My shadow was cast on the wall of the Kommandantur, and at that moment I noticed a second shadow beside my own. It held a gun. I yelled to Rupert to get back as a voice behind me shouted, <i>H&auml;nde hoch! H&auml;nde hoch!</i>. I turned to face a German officer levelling his <!--del_lnk--> pistol at me.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>Behind him were 7 British and 4 Polish officers. On his order the remaining men backed up the tunnel to evade detection, but the Germans were waiting for them outside the canteen. Not wanting to give their captors the satisfaction the British burst into laughter as they came out, much to the bemusement of the guards.<p>Hauptmann Priem ends the story:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;And the Guard? He kept his 100 Marks; he got extra leave, promotion and the <!--del_lnk--> War Service Cross.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p><a id="The_French_Tunnel" name="The_French_Tunnel"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">The French Tunnel</span></h5>
      <p>Nine French officers organized a long-term tunnel-digging project, the longest attempted out of Colditz Castle throughout the war. Deciding that the exit should be on the steep drop leading down towards the recreation area, outside the eastern walls of the castle, they began to scout for a possible location for the entrance. The problem was solved by Lieutenants Cazaumayo and Paille, who had gained access to the clock tower in 1940.<p>Their tunnel began at the top of a chapel&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> clock tower and descended 8.6 meters (28.2 ft) into the ground using an old <!--del_lnk--> dumbwaiter shaft. They found that the weights which used to hang down the shaft, and the chains, had been removed. This left an empty shaft which extended from the clock to the cellars below. After the previous escape attempts of Cazaumayo and Paille, the doors (one on each floor) which provided access to the tower had been bricked up in order to prevent further escape attempts. However, by sealing up the tower the Germans had in essence provided a secure location where escape tunnel work could be done without notice. The French this time gained access to the tower from the attics, descended 35 m to the cellars, and began work on a horizontal shaft in June 1941. This shaft work would continue for a further eight months.<p>The horizontal shaft towards the chapel progressed 4 m (13 ft) before they hit rock too hard to dig. They then decided to dig upwards towards the chapel floor. From here the tunnel continued underneath the wooden floor of the chapel for a distance of 13.5 m (44.3 ft). For this to be achieved, seven heavy <!--del_lnk--> oak timbers in the floor, measuring 0.5 m (1.3 ft) square had to be cut through. Homemade saws, assembled out of German table knives, were employed for this task. With this completed, the tunnel dropped vertically from the far corner of the chapel a further 5.2 m (17 ft). The tunnel then proceeded out towards the proposed exit with two further descents, separated by shafts in the tough stone foundations of the castle. The tunnel now ran a horizontal distance of 44 m (144 ft), reaching a final depth of 8.6 m (28.2 ft) below the ground.<p>Tunnelling continued well into 1942. By then Germans knew that the French were digging somewhere, based on the noise of their tunnelling reverberating through the castle at night. The French however were smug that its entrance was totally undetectable. However, on <!--del_lnk--> January 15 the Germans eventually searched the sealed off clock tower. Noises were heard below, and after lowering a small boy down the shaft three French officers were found. After searching the cellar thoroughly, the entrance to the tunnel was eventually discovered a mere 2 m (6.5 ft) short of completion. The French were convinced that they had been betrayed by one of their own countrymen but this was denied by the guards who demanded the French pay to repair the damage (estimated at 12000 Reichsmark).<p>The tunnel itself was a major engineering feat. It had electric lighting along its whole length spliced off of the chapel&#39;s electricity supply. Not only did this allow the tunnellers to see what they were doing, it was also used as a system with which to signal to them the arrival of any sentries. The entrance to the tunnel in the wine cellar was concealed by 5 large stones covering a small door, which left little trace of any hole. Debris was transported from the working area by means of several sacks hoisted up the clock tower and disposed of in the castle&#39;s attics. The wine cellar was regularly cleaned and redusted using dust harvested from the attic, so as to hide the reddish clay dust which was not present in the cellar ordinarily.<p><a id="Successful_escapes" name="Successful_escapes"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Successful escapes</span></h4>
      <p>Pat Reid claims in <i>Colditz: The Full Story</i> that there were 31 &quot;home runs&quot;. It should be noted that he includes prisoners from the hospital and prisoners being transported, who were not directly under Colditz staff control. Henry Chancellor in <i>Colditz: The Definitive History</i> claims 32 escaped but only 15 were &quot;home runs&quot;: 1 Belgian, 11 British, 7 Dutch, 12 French and 1 Polish. The difference is that Reid claims any successful escape by an &quot;official&quot; Colditz POW a &quot;home run&quot; where most other historians only consider escapes from the castle or castle grounds itself as a &quot;home run&quot;. Also a subject of debate is whether or not Millar&#39;s escape should be considered a &quot;home run&quot;, but since he is listed MIA (unofficially he is assumed deceased), Chancellor does not count him as such.<p>At the end of May 1943, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</i> (Armed Forces High Command) decided that Colditz should hold only British and Commonwealth officers. Because of this decision, all of the Dutch and Polish prisoners and most of the French and Belgians were moved to other camps in July. Three British officers tried their luck by impersonating an equal number of French when they were moved out, but they were later returned to Colditz. German security gradually increased and by the end of 1943 most of the potential ways of escape had been plugged. Several officers tried to escape during transit, having first caused themselves to be transferred for that purpose.<p>Some officers even went so far as to fake illness and <!--del_lnk--> mental retardation in order to be <!--del_lnk--> repatriated on medical grounds. A member of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), Captain <!--del_lnk--> Ion Ferguson, wrote a letter to an Irish friend where he suggested that <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a> join the war; the letter was stopped by the <!--del_lnk--> censors but his wish to be moved elsewhere was granted. In <!--del_lnk--> Stalag IV D he certified a number of prisoners as insane, who were consequently repatriated, and then convinced the Germans of his <i>own</i> insanity and returned to Britain the same way. Four other British officers claimed symptoms of stomach <!--del_lnk--> ulcer, insanity, <!--del_lnk--> high blood pressure and back injury in order to be repatriated. However, there were also officers who went genuinely insane.<p><a id="From_Colditz_Castle_and_Grounds" name="From_Colditz_Castle_and_Grounds"></a><h5> <span class="mw-headline">From Colditz Castle and Grounds</span></h5>

      <p>In one of the most ambitious escape attempts from Colditz, the idea of building a <!--del_lnk--> glider was dreamt up by two pilots, <!--del_lnk--> Jack Best and <!--del_lnk--> Bill Goldfinch, who had been sent to Colditz after escaping from another POW camp. They were encouraged by two army officers, <!--del_lnk--> Tony Rolt and David Walker, who had recently arrived in the camp. It would be Tony Rolt who would recommend the chapel roof, since he noticed it was obscured from the view of the Germans.<p>The plan was to construct a two-man glider part by part. The glider was assembled by Bill Goldfinch and Jack Best in the lower attic above the chapel, and was to be launched from the roof in order to fly across the river Mulde, which was about 200 feet (60 m) below. The <!--del_lnk--> runway was to be constructed from tables and the glider was to be launched using a pulley system based on a falling metal <!--del_lnk--> bathtub full of <!--del_lnk--> concrete, using a <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a>-assisted acceleration to 30 mph (50 km/h).<p>The officers who took part in the project built a false wall, to hide the secret space in the attic where they slowly built the glider out of stolen pieces of wood. Since the Germans were accustomed to looking down for <!--del_lnk--> tunnels, not up for secret workshops, they felt rather safe from detection. However, they still placed lookouts, and created an electric alarm system, to warn the builders of approaching guards.<p>Hundreds of <!--del_lnk--> ribs had to be constructed, predominantly formed from bed slats, but also from every other piece of wood the POW&#39;s could surreptitiously obtain. The <!--del_lnk--> wing <!--del_lnk--> spars were constructed from floor boards. Control wires were made from electrical wiring in unused portions of the castle. A glider expert, Lorne Welch, was asked to review the stress diagrams and calculations made by Goldfinch.<p>The glider constructed was a lightweight, two-seater, high wing, monoplane design. It had a Mooney style <!--del_lnk--> rudder and square <!--del_lnk--> elevators. The <!--del_lnk--> wingspan, tip to tip, was 32 ft (9.75 m), and it was 19 ft 9 in (6 m) from nose to tail. Prison <!--del_lnk--> sleeping bags of blue and white checked <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> were used to skin the glider, and German <!--del_lnk--> ration <!--del_lnk--> millet was boiled and used to seal the <!--del_lnk--> cloth <!--del_lnk--> pores. The materials they had to work with caused it to weigh a mere 240 lb (109 kg). However the war ended before the glider was finished.<p>A replica of the Colditz glider was built for the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4 (UK) 3-part (150 minute total) &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; documentary, and flew successfully on its first attempt with Best and Goldfinch in tearful attendance. It is currently housed at the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial War Museum in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. The Channel 4 material was edited to 60 minutes and shown in the US in 2001 as &quot;Nazi Prison Escape&quot; on the <!--del_lnk--> NOVA television series.<table align="center" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" style="border:1px solid black" width="80%">

      <p>Colditz Castle has been the inspiration for both television and film due to the widely popular retellings by Pat Reid and Airey Neave. This started as early as 1955 with the release of <!--del_lnk--> The Colditz Story, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Escape of the Birdmen in 1971, continuing until 2005 with the <i>Colditz</i> mini-series.
