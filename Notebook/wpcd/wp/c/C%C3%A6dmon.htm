      <p><b>C&aelig;dmon</b> (<!--del_lnk--> IPA: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[k&aelig;dm&#x252;n]</span>) is the earliest <!--del_lnk--> English <a href="../../wp/e/English_poetry.htm" title="English poetry">poet</a> whose name is known. An <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon <!--del_lnk--> herdsman attached to the double <!--del_lnk--> monastery of Streon&aelig;shalch (<!--del_lnk--> Whitby Abbey) during the abbacy of <a href="../../wp/h/Hilda_of_Whitby.htm" title="Hilda of Whitby">St. Hilda</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 657&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 680), he was originally ignorant of &quot;the art of song&quot; but supposedly learned to compose one night in the course of a dream. He later became a zealous <!--del_lnk--> monk and an accomplished and inspirational <!--del_lnk--> religious poet.<p>C&aelig;dmon is one of twelve <a href="../../wp/a/Anglo-Saxon_literature.htm" title="Anglo-Saxon literature">Anglo-Saxon poets</a> identified in <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">medieval</a> sources, and one of only three for whom both roughly contemporary biographical information and examples of literary output have survived. His story is related in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</i> (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;) by <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">St. Bede</a> who wrote, &quot;There was in the Monastery of this Abbess a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God, who was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">scripture</a>, he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, which was his native language. By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world, and to aspire to heaven.&quot;<p>C&aelig;dmon&#39;s only known surviving work is <i>C&aelig;dmon&#39;s Hymn</i>, the nine-line <a href="../../wp/a/Alliterative_verse.htm" title="Alliterative verse">alliterative</a> <!--del_lnk--> vernacular praise poem in honour of God he supposedly learned to sing in his initial dream. The poem is one of the earliest attested examples of <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a> and is, with the <!--del_lnk--> runic <!--del_lnk--> Ruthwell Cross and <!--del_lnk--> Franks Casket inscriptions, one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of <a href="../../wp/a/Anglo-Saxon_literature.htm" title="Anglo-Saxon literature">Old English poetry</a>. It is also one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a <!--del_lnk--> Germanic language.<p>

      <p>The sole source of original information about C&aelig;dmon&#39;s life and work is <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Historia ecclesiastica</i>. According to Bede, C&aelig;dmon was a <!--del_lnk--> lay brother who worked as a <!--del_lnk--> herdsman at the monastery Streon&aelig;shalch (now known as <!--del_lnk--> Whitby Abbey). One evening, while the monks were feasting, singing, and playing a harp, C&aelig;dmon left early to sleep with the animals because he knew no songs. While asleep, he had a dream in which &quot;someone&quot; (<i>quidem</i>) approached him and asked him to sing <i>principium creaturarum</i>, &quot;the beginning of created things.&quot; After first refusing to sing, C&aelig;dmon subsequently produced a short <!--del_lnk--> eulogistic poem praising God as the creator of heaven and earth.<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="toccolours" style="width:188px; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; float:right;clear:both; margin: 0 0 1em 1em">

      <p>Upon awakening the next morning, C&aelig;dmon remembered everything he had sung and added additional lines to his poem. He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the <!--del_lnk--> abbess. The abbess and her counsellors asked C&aelig;dmon about his vision and, satisfied that it was a gift from God, gave him a new commission, this time for a poem based on &ldquo;a passage of sacred history or doctrine&rdquo;, by way of a test. When C&aelig;dmon returned the next morning with the requested poem, he was ordered to take <!--del_lnk--> monastic vows. The abbess ordered her scholars to teach C&aelig;dmon sacred history and doctrine, which after a night of thought, Bede records, C&aelig;dmon would turn into the most beautiful verse. According to Bede, C&aelig;dmon was responsible for a large <!--del_lnk--> oeuvre of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics.<p>After a long and zealously pious life, C&aelig;dmon died like a <!--del_lnk--> saint: receiving a premonition of death, he asked to be moved to the abbey&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> hospice for the <!--del_lnk--> terminally ill where, having gathered his friends around him, he expired just before <!--del_lnk--> nocturns. Although often listed as a saint, this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recntly been argued that such assertions are incorrect.<p><a id="Dates" name="Dates"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dates</span></h3>
      <p>Bede gives no specific dates in his story. C&aelig;dmon is said to have taken <!--del_lnk--> holy orders at an advanced age and it is implied that he lived at Streon&aelig;shalch at least in part during Hilda&rsquo;s abbacy (657&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 680). Book IV Chapter 25 of the <i>Historia ecclesiastica</i> appears to suggest that C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s death occurred at about the same time as the fire at <!--del_lnk--> Coldingham Abbey, an event dated in the E text of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> to <!--del_lnk--> 679, but after 681 by Bede. The reference to <i>his temporibus</i> &lsquo;at this time&rsquo; in the opening lines of Chapter 25 may refer more generally to C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s career as a poet. However, the next datable event in the <i>Historia ecclesiastica</i> is King <!--del_lnk--> Ecgfrith&rsquo;s raid on <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 684 (Book IV, Chapter 26). Taken together, this evidence suggests an active period beginning between 657 and 680 and ending between 679 and 684.<p><a id="Modern_discoveries" name="Modern_discoveries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern discoveries</span></h3>
      <p>The only biographical or historical information that modern scholarship has been able to add to Bede&rsquo;s account concerns the Brittonic origins of the poet&rsquo;s name. Although Bede specifically notes that English was C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s &ldquo;own&rdquo; language, the poet&rsquo;s name is of <!--del_lnk--> Celtic origin: from <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Welsh <span class="Unicode">*<i>Cad&#x1E7D;an</i></span> and <!--del_lnk--> Brittonic *<i>Catumandos</i>. Several scholars have suggested that C&aelig;dmon himself may have been bilingual on the basis of this etymology, Hilda&rsquo;s close contact with Celtic political and religious hierarchies, and some (not very close) analogues to the <i>Hymn</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Old Irish poetry. Other scholars have noticed a possible <!--del_lnk--> onomastic allusion to &lsquo;<!--del_lnk--> Adam Kadmon&rsquo; in the poet&rsquo;s name, perhaps suggesting that the entire story is allegorical.<p><a id="Other_medieval_sources" name="Other_medieval_sources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Work</span></h2>
      <p><a id="General_corpus" name="General_corpus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">General corpus</span></h3>
      <p>Bede&rsquo;s account indicates that C&aelig;dmon was responsible for the composition of a large <!--del_lnk--> oeuvre of vernacular religious poetry. In contrast to Saints <!--del_lnk--> Aldhelm and <!--del_lnk--> Dunstan, C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s poetry is said to have been exclusively religious. Bede reports that C&aelig;dmon &ldquo;could never compose any foolish or trivial poem, but only those which were concerned with devotion&rdquo; and his list of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s output includes work on religious subjects only: accounts of creation, translations from the <!--del_lnk--> Old and <!--del_lnk--> New Testaments, and songs about the &ldquo;terrors of future judgment, horrors of hell, &hellip; joys of the heavenly kingdom, &hellip; and divine mercies and judgments.&rdquo; Of this corpus, only the opening lines of his first poem survive. While vernacular poems matching Bede&rsquo;s description of several of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s later works are found in <!--del_lnk--> London, British Library, Junius 11 (traditionally referred to as the &ldquo;Junius&rdquo; or &ldquo;C&aelig;dmon&rdquo; manuscript), the older traditional attribution of these texts to C&aelig;dmon or C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s influence cannot stand. The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s original <i>Hymn</i>, and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede&rsquo;s discussion of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s oeuvre: the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and, while <i><!--del_lnk--> Christ and Satan</i> could be understood as partially fitting Bede&rsquo;s description of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s work on future judgment, pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom, the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition. As Fritz and Day have shown, indeed, Bede&rsquo;s list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the <!--del_lnk--> catechism. Similar influences may, of course, also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume.<p><a id="C.C3.A6dmon.27s_Hymn" name="C.C3.A6dmon.27s_Hymn"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>C&aelig;dmon&#39;s Hymn</i></span></h3>

      <p>The only known survivor from C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s oeuvre is his <i>Hymn</i> (<!--del_lnk--> audio version). The poem is known from twenty-one <!--del_lnk--> manuscript copies, making it the best-attested Old English poem after <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede&rsquo;s <i>Death Song</i></a> (35 <!--del_lnk--> witnesses) and the best attested in the poetic corpus in manuscripts copied or owned in the British Isles during the Anglo-Saxon period. The <i>Hymn</i> also has by far the most complicated known textual history of any surviving Anglo-Saxon poem. It is found in two dialects and five distinct <!--del_lnk--> recensions (Northumbrian <i>aelda</i>, Northumbrian <i>eordu</i>, West-Saxon <i>eor&eth;an</i>, West-Saxon <i>ylda</i>, and West-Saxon <i>eor&eth;e</i>), all but one of which are known from three or more witnesses. It is one of the earliest attested examples of written Old English and one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a <!--del_lnk--> Germanic language. Together with the runic <!--del_lnk--> Ruthwell Cross and <!--del_lnk--> Franks Casket inscriptions, <i>C&aelig;dmon&#39;s Hymn</i> is one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of <a href="../../wp/a/Anglo-Saxon_literature.htm" title="Anglo-Saxon literature">Old English poetry</a>.<p><a id="Manuscript_evidence" name="Manuscript_evidence"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Manuscript evidence</span></h4>
      <p>All copies of <i>Hymn</i> are found in manuscripts of the <i>Historia ecclesiastica</i> or its translation, where they serve as either a <!--del_lnk--> gloss to Bede&rsquo;s Latin translation of the Old English poem, or, in the case of the Old English version, a replacement for Bede&#39;s translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede&rsquo;s work, the <i>Hymn</i> does not appear to have been transmitted with the <i>Historia ecclesiastica</i> regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the <i>Hymn</i> in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, <i>Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243</i>, <i>Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43</i>, and <i>Winchester, Cathedral I</i>, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript&rsquo;s main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin <i>Historia</i>: nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin <i>Historia</i> sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem. With the exception of the Old English translation, no single recension of the <i>Historia ecclesiastica</i> is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.<p><a id="Earliest_text" name="Earliest_text"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Earliest text</span></h4>
      <p>The oldest known version of the poem is the <!--del_lnk--> Northumbrian <i>aelda</i> <!--del_lnk--> recension. The surviving witnesses to this text, <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge, University Library, Kk. 5. 16 (M) and <!--del_lnk--> St. Petersburg, National Library of Russia, lat. Q. v. I. 18 (P), date to at least the mid-<a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8<sup>th</sup> century</a>. <b>M</b> in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede&#39;s own monastery and life time, though there is little evidence to suggest it was copied much before the mid-8<sup>th</sup> century.<p>The following text has been transcribed from <b>M</b> (mid-8<sup>th</sup> century; Northumbria).
