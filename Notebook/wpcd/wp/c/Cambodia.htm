Cambodia is the <!--del_lnk--> successor state of the once powerful <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire, which ruled most of the <!--del_lnk--> Indochinese Peninsula between the 11th and 14th centuries.<p>A citizen of Cambodia is usually identified as &quot;Cambodian&quot; or &quot;Khmer&quot;, which strictly refers to <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Khmers. Most Cambodians are <!--del_lnk--> Theravada Buddhists of Khmer extraction, but the country also has a substantial number of predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Cham, as well as small hill tribes.<p>The country shares a border with <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> to its west and northwest, with <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> to its northeast, and with <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> to its east and southeast. In the south it faces the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Thailand. The geography of Cambodia is dominated by the <a href="../../wp/m/Mekong.htm" title="Mekong">Mekong</a> river (colloquial <!--del_lnk--> Khmer: <i>Tonle Thom</i> or &quot;the great river&quot;) and the <!--del_lnk--> Tonl&eacute; Sap (&quot;the fresh water river&quot;), an important source of fish. Its low geography means much of the country sits near to below sea level, and its main source of water from the Mekong reverses its water flow in the wet season into the neighbouring Tonle Sap River.<p>

      <p>The first advanced civilizations in present day Cambodia appeared in the <!--del_lnk--> 1st millennium <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a>. During the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd, <!--del_lnk--> 4th, and <!--del_lnk--> 5th centuries, the Indianised states of <!--del_lnk--> Funan and <!--del_lnk--> Chenla coalesced in what is now present-day Cambodia and southwestern Vietnam. These states, which are assumed by most scholars to have been Khmer, had close relations with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Their collapse was followed by the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire, a civilization which flourished in the area from the <!--del_lnk--> 9th century to the <!--del_lnk--> 13th century.<p>Though declining after this period, the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer Empire remained powerful in the region until the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>. The empire&#39;s centre of power was <a href="../../wp/a/Angkor.htm" title="Angkor">Angkor</a>, where a series of capitals was constructed during the empire&#39;s zenith. <a href="../../wp/a/Angkor_Wat.htm" title="Angkor Wat">Angkor Wat</a>, the main religious temple at the site, is a symbolic reminder of Cambodia&#39;s past as a major regional power.<p>After a long series of wars with neighbouring kingdoms, Angkor was sacked by the <!--del_lnk--> Thai and abandoned in <!--del_lnk--> 1432. The court moved the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Lovek where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade. The attempt was short-lived, however, as continued wars with the Thai and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnamese</a> resulted in the loss of more territory and the conquering of Lovek in <!--del_lnk--> 1594. During the next three centuries, The Khmer kingdom alternated as a vassal state of the Thai and Vietnamese kings, with short-lived periods of relative independence between.<table style="margin: 1em; border: 1px solid #aaa; font-size:90%; border-collapse:collapse; float:right; clear:right;">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1863 King Norodom, who had been installed by Thailand, sought the protection of France.

      <p>Cambodia has an area of about 181,040 square kilometres (69,900&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi), sharing an 800&nbsp;kilometre (500&nbsp;mi) border with <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> in the north and west, a 541&nbsp;kilometre (336&nbsp;mi) border with <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> in the northeast, and a 1,228&nbsp;kilometre (763&nbsp;mi) border with <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> in the east and southeast. It has 443&nbsp;kilometres (275&nbsp;mi) of coastline along the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Thailand.<p>The most distinctive geographical feature is the <!--del_lnk--> lacustrine plain, formed by the inundations of the <!--del_lnk--> Tonle Sap (Great Lake), measuring about 2,590 square kilometres (1,000&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the dry season and expanding to about 24,605 square kilometres (9,500&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi) during the rainy season. This densely populated plain, which is devoted to wet rice cultivation, is the heartland of Cambodia. Most (about 75%) of the country lies at elevations of less than 100 metres (330&nbsp;ft) above sea level, the exceptions being the <!--del_lnk--> Cardamom Mountains (highest elevation 1,813&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;5,948&nbsp;ft) and their southeast extension the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;mrei Mountains (&quot;Elephant Mountains&quot;) (elevation range 500&ndash;1,000&nbsp;m or 1,640&ndash;3,280&nbsp;ft), as well the steep escarpment of the <!--del_lnk--> D&acirc;ngr&ecirc;k Mountains (average elevation 500&nbsp;m&nbsp;/&nbsp;1,640&nbsp;ft) along the border with Thailand&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Isan.htm" title="Isan">Isan</a> region.

      <p>Despite recent progress, the Cambodian economy continues to suffer from the effects of decades of <!--del_lnk--> civil war, internal strife and rampant corruption. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income is rapidly increasing, but is low compared with other countries in the region. Most rural households depend on agriculture and its related sub-sectors. Rice, fish, timber, garments and rubber are Cambodia&#39;s major exports, and the US, Singapore, Japan, Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia are its major export partners.<p>War and brutal totalitarianism in the 1970s created famine in Cambodia. Desperate farm families consumed their rice seeds and many traditional varieties became difficult to find. In the 1980s the <!--del_lnk--> International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) reintroduced more than 750 traditional rice varieties to Cambodia from its rice seed bank in the Philippines. These varieties had been collected in the 1960s. In 1987, the Australian government funded IRRI to assist Cambodia to improve its rice production. By 2000, Cambodia was once again self-sufficient in rice (Puckridge 2004, Fredenburg and Hill 2006).<p>The recovery of Cambodia&#39;s economy slowed dramatically in 1997&ndash;98, due to the <!--del_lnk--> regional economic crisis, civil violence, and political infighting. <!--del_lnk--> Foreign investment and tourism also fell off drastically. Since then however, growth has been steady. In 1999, the first full year of peace in 30 years, progress was made on economic reforms and <!--del_lnk--> growth resumed at 5.0%. Despite severe flooding, GDP grew at 5.0% in 2000, 6.3% in 2001, and 5.2% in 2002. Tourism was Cambodia&#39;s fastest growing industry, with arrivals increasing from 219,000 in 1997 to 1,055,000 in 2004. During 2003 and 2004 the growth rate remained steady at 5.0%, while in 2004 inflation was at 1.7% and exports at $1.6 billion <!--del_lnk--> US dollars. As of 2005, <!--del_lnk--> GDP per capita was $2,200, which ranked 178th (out of 233) countries.<p>The population often lacks education and productive skills, particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from a lack of basic <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>. Fear of renewed political instability and corruption within the government discourage foreign investment and delay foreign aid, although there has been significant assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors. Donors pledged $504m to the country in 2004, while the Asian Development Bank alone has provided $850m in loans, grants, and technical assistance.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Khmer culture, as developed and spread by the <!--del_lnk--> Khmer empire, has distinctive styles of dance, architecture and sculpture, which have strongly influenced neighbouring <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>. <a href="../../wp/a/Angkor_Wat.htm" title="Angkor Wat">Angkor Wat</a> (<i>Angkor</i> means &quot;city&quot; and <i>Wat</i> &quot;temple&quot;) is the best preserved example of Khmer architecture from the Angkorian era and hundreds of other temples have been discovered in and around the region. The <!--del_lnk--> Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, the infamous prison of the Khmer Rouge, and <!--del_lnk--> Choeung Ek, one of the main <!--del_lnk--> Killing Fields are other important historic sites.<p><i>Bonn Om Teuk</i> (Festival of Boat Racing), the annual boat rowing contest, is the most attended Cambodian national festival. Held at the end of the rainy season when the Mekong river begins to sink back to its normal levels allowing the Tonle Sap River to reverse flow, approximately 10% of Cambodia&#39;s population attends this event each year to play games, give thanks to the moon, watch fireworks, and attend the boat race in a carnival-type atmosphere. Popular games include <!--del_lnk--> cockfighting, <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Soccer">soccer</a>, and kicking a <i>sey,</i> which is similar to a <!--del_lnk--> hacky sack. Notable recent artistic figures include the singers <!--del_lnk--> Sinn Sisamouth, who introduced new musical styles to the country, and later <!--del_lnk--> Meng Keo Pichenda.<p>Rice, as in other South East Asian countries, is the staple grain, while fish from the Mekong and Tonle Sap also form an important part of the diet. The Cambodian per capita supply of fish and fish products for food and trade in 2000 was 20 <!--del_lnk--> kilograms of fish per year or 2&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ounces per day per person. Some of the fish can be made into <!--del_lnk--> prahok (a Khmer delicacy) for longer storage. Overall, the <!--del_lnk--> cuisine of Cambodia is similar to that of its <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asian neighbours. The cuisine is relatively unknown to the world compared to that of its neighbors <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, but has been described not as spicy as <!--del_lnk--> Thai cuisine and similar to other Southeast Asia cuisines.<p>Football (soccer) is one of the more popular sports, although professional organized sports are not as prevelant in Cambodia as in western countries due to the economic conditions. The <!--del_lnk--> Cambodia national football team managed fourth in the <!--del_lnk--> 1972 Asian Cup but development has slowed since the civil war. Western sports such as volleyball, bodybuilding, field hockey, <!--del_lnk--> rugby, and baseball are gaining popularity while traditional boat racing maintains its appeal as a national sport. Martial Arts is also practiced in Cambodia, the most popular being <!--del_lnk--> Pradal Serey, which is similar to Muay Thai and also considered a national sport. Other styles such as <!--del_lnk--> Karate, <!--del_lnk--> Kung Fu and <!--del_lnk--> Taekwondo are rapidly catching on.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>The civil war severely damaged Cambodia&#39;s transport system, despite the provision of <!--del_lnk--> Soviet technical assistance and equipment. Cambodia has two rail lines, totalling about 612 kilometers (380&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) of single, one&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> meter&nbsp;gauge track. The lines run from the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Sihanoukville on the southern coast, and from Phnom Penh to <!--del_lnk--> Sisophon (although trains often run only as far as <!--del_lnk--> Battambang). Currently only one passenger train per week operates, between Phnom Penh and Battambang.<p>The nation&#39;s extensive inland waterways were important historically in domestic trade. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mekong.htm" title="Mekong">Mekong</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Tonle Sap River, their numerous tributaries, and the <!--del_lnk--> Tonle Sap provided avenues of considerable length, including 3,700 kilometers (2,300&nbsp;mi) navigable all year by craft drawing 0.6 meters (2&nbsp;ft) and another 282 kilometers (175&nbsp;mi) navigable to craft drawing 1.8 meters (6&nbsp;ft). Cambodia has two major ports, <!--del_lnk--> Phnom Penh and <!--del_lnk--> Sihanoukville, and five minor ones. Phnom Penh, located at the junction of the <!--del_lnk--> Basak, the <a href="../../wp/m/Mekong.htm" title="Mekong">Mekong</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Tonle Sap rivers, is the only <!--del_lnk--> river port capable of receiving 8,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ton ships during the wet season and 5,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ton ships during the dry season.<p>The country has six commercial airports: <!--del_lnk--> Pochentong International Airport near Phnom Penh is the largest; the others are at <!--del_lnk--> Siem Reap, <!--del_lnk--> Battambang, <!--del_lnk--> Mondulkiri, <!--del_lnk--> Ratanakiri, and <!--del_lnk--> Stung Treng.<p>With increasing economic activity has come an increase in automobile and motorcycle use; as often in developing countries, an associated rise in traffic deaths and injuries is occurring. <!--del_lnk--> Cycle rickshaws (&quot;cyclos&quot;) are an additional option often used by visitors.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia&quot;</div>
