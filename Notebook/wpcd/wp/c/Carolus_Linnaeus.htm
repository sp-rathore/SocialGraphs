      <p>The name of this botanist comes in different variants: &#39;Carl Linnaeus&#39;, &#39;Carolus Linnaeus&#39; and &#39;Carl von Linn&eacute;&#39;, sometimes just &#39;Carl Linn&eacute;&#39;. There is often confusion about his real Swedish name, as opposed to the Latinized form &#39;Carolus Linnaeus&#39; he used most when he published his scientific works in Latin.<p>In Linnaeus&#39; time, most Swedes had no surnames. Linnaeus&#39; grandfather was named Ingemar Bengtsson (son of Bengt), according to Scandinavian tradition. Linnaeus&#39; father was known as Nils Ingemarsson (son of Ingemar). Only for registration purposes, for example when matriculating at a university, one needed a surname. In the academic world, Latin was the language of choice, so when Linnaeus&#39; father went to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Lund, he coined himself a Latin surname: Linnaeus, referring to a large <!--del_lnk--> linden (lime) tree, the <!--del_lnk--> warden tree of the family property Linnag&aring;rd (<i>linn</i> being an <!--del_lnk--> archaic form of Swedish <i>lind</i>, the linden). Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus gave his son the name Carl. So the Swedish name of the boy was Carl Linnaeus.<p>When Carl Linnaeus enrolled as student at the University of Lund, he was registered as &#39;Carolus Linnaeus&#39;. This Latinized form was the name he used when he published his works in Latin. After he was ennobled, in 1761, he took the name Carl von Linn&eacute;. &#39;Linn&eacute;&#39; is thus a shortened version of &#39;Linnaeus&#39;, &#39;von&#39; is added to signify his ennoblement.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>When referring to or citing the author Linnaeus, it is appropriate to use &#39;Carl Linnaeus&#39;, &#39;Carolus Linnaeus&#39; or just &#39;Linnaeus&#39;. &#39;Carl von Linn&eacute;&#39; seems to be less suitable, especially for the works he published before 1762. On the title page of the second edition of <i>Species plantarum</i> (1762) the author&#39;s name is still printed as &#39;Carolus Linnaeus&#39; (or rather the <!--del_lnk--> genitive form &#39;Caroli Linnaei&#39;) but from then on, his name is quite consistently printed as &#39;Carolus <b>a</b> Linne&#39; or &#39;Carl von Linn&eacute;&#39;. Stafleu uses &#39;Carl Linnaeus&#39; as the author&#39;s name for all his works.<p>The adjective of his name is usually &#39;Linnaean&#39;, but the prestigious <!--del_lnk--> Linnean Society of London has a journal <i>The Linnean</i>, awards the <!--del_lnk--> Linnean Medal, and so on.<p><a id="Biography" name="Biography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>

      <p>Carl Linnaeus was born on the farm <!--del_lnk--> R&aring;shult, located in <!--del_lnk--> &Auml;lmhult Municipality, in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Sm&aring;land in southern <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1707. He was groomed as a youth to be a churchman, walking in his fathers path, but showed little enthusiasm for it. In 1717 he was sent to the primary school at the city <!--del_lnk--> V&auml;xj&ouml;, and in 1724 he passed to the gymnasium there, but with meager results in the clerical faculty. Instead his interest in <a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">botany</a> made an impression on a local physician, realizing there might be a bright future in the field for Carl, and on his recommendation Carl&#39;s father sent Carl to study at the closest university, <!--del_lnk--> Lund University. Carl studied in Lund and tried to make something of the botanical garden there, but because it had been neglected, it was suggested to him that he would have better prospects at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Uppsala; Carl left for Uppsala within a year.<p>His first time in Uppsala was financially rough, until he was acquainted with the renowned scientist <!--del_lnk--> Olof Celsius in 1729. Celsius, impressed with Linnaeus&#39;s knowledge and botanical collections, offered him board and lodging.<p>During this period, he came upon a work which ultimately led to the establishment of his artificial system of plant classification. This was a review of <!--del_lnk--> Sebastien Vaillant&#39;s <i>Sermo de Structura Florum</i> (Leiden, 1718), a thin quarto in French and Latin. Through this, he became convinced of the importance of the <!--del_lnk--> stamens and <!--del_lnk--> pistils, on which he in 1729 wrote a short treatise on the sexes of plants. It caught the attention of <!--del_lnk--> Olof Rudbeck the Younger (1660-1740), the professor of botany in the university, who subsequently appointed him his <!--del_lnk--> adjunct. In 1730, Carl began giving lectures in the faculty.<p>In 1732 the Academy of Sciences at <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala financed Linnaeus on an expedition to <!--del_lnk--> Lapland in northernmost Sweden, then virtually unknown. The result of this was first <i>The Florula Lapponica</i> (the first work to use the Sexual System) and later the <i>Flora Lapponica</i> published in 1737. His journey to sub-Arctic Lapland is notable for exotic and adventurous episodes.<p>He married Sara Elisabeth Morea and had seven children, <!--del_lnk--> Carolus, Elisabeth, Sara Magdalena, Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes, Sophia.<p><a id="Travels_and_research" name="Travels_and_research"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Travels and research</span></h3>

      <p>In 1735 Linnaeus moved to the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, where he was to spend the next three years. Here he earned his one and only academic degree, it being in Medicine. He met with botanist <!--del_lnk--> Jan Frederik Gronovius and showed him a draft of his work on taxonomy, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Systema Naturae</i>. This was published in the Netherlands the same year, as an eleven page work.<p>Linnaeus stayed put in the Netherlands for 12 months, until he in 1736 made a journey to London, where he visited the <!--del_lnk--> Oxford University and met several highly regarded people, such as the physicist <!--del_lnk--> Hans Sloane, the botanic <!--del_lnk--> Philip Miller and the professor of botany J. J. Dillenius. The journey lasted a few months, after which he returned to Amsterdam, and continued the printing of his <i><!--del_lnk--> Genera Plantarum</i>, the starting point of his taxonomy. In 1738, the work was done, and he started his journey back home. On his way he stayed in <!--del_lnk--> Leiden for a year, during which he had his <i>Classes Plantarum</i> printed; then travelling to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, before setting sail for <a href="../../wp/s/Stockholm.htm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>.<p>Arriving in Stockholm, he settled as a <!--del_lnk--> physicist in September that year. In 1739 Linnaeus married Sara Morea in Stockholm, and in the same year he was one of the founders of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1741 he ascended to the chair of medicine at Uppsala and moved there. The position was soon exchanged for the chair of botany.<p>Throughout the 1740s he conducted numerous field trips to many locations in Sweden to classify plants and animals: in 1741 to the <!--del_lnk--> Stora Alvaret on <!--del_lnk--> &Ouml;land and also to <!--del_lnk--> Gotland; in 1746 to <!--del_lnk--> V&auml;sterg&ouml;tland; and in 1749 to <!--del_lnk--> Scania including visits to the <!--del_lnk--> Kullaberg. The reports of each travel were published in the Swedish language to be accessible for the general public. Apart from containing many important reports of common life of that time, they have in recent years been appreciated for its fine treatment of the Swedish language, indeed putting Linnaeus as one of the foremost Swedish writers of the 18th century.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>When not on travels, Linnaeus worked on his classifications, extending them to the kingdom of animals and the kingdom of minerals. The last may seem somewhat odd, but the theory of <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> was still a long time away.

      <p>After his ennoblement, he continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people.

Only the boy, <!--del_lnk--> Carolus Linnaeus the Younger, was allowed to study. He did not have the same passion as his father, but managed to make a reputation in botany. At the father&#39;s death, the son succeeded him as professor; however, he died only five years later. The son is commonly referred to as <i>filius</i> (abbreviated &quot;L. f.&quot;) to distinguish him from his famous father.<p>Linnaeus last years were troubled by weak health, and he was troubled by <!--del_lnk--> gout and tooth aches. A <a href="../../wp/s/Stroke.htm" title="Stroke">stroke</a> in 1774 greatly weakened him, and two years later he suffered another, losing the use of his right side. He died on January 1778 in Uppsala, during a ceremony in the <!--del_lnk--> Uppsala Cathedral.

      <p>Taxonomists, in almost any biological field, have heard of Carolus Linnaeus. His prime contribution was to establish conventions for the naming of living organisms that became universally accepted in the scientific world (binomial names, scientific names): the work of Linnaeus represents the starting point of <a href="../../wp/b/Binomial_nomenclature.htm" title="Binomial nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>. In addition Linnaeus developed, during the great 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, what became known as the <i>Linnaean taxonomy</i>; the system of <a href="../../wp/s/Scientific_classification.htm" title="Scientific classification">scientific classification</a> now widely used in the <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biological sciences</a>.<p>The Linnaean system classified nature within a <!--del_lnk--> hierarchy, starting with three <!--del_lnk--> kingdoms. Kingdoms were divided into Classes and they, in turn, into Orders, which were divided into Genera (singular: genus), which were divided into Species (singular: species). Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank (for plants these are now called &quot;varieties&quot;).<p>His groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics. Although only his groupings for animals remain to this day, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since Linnaeus&#39; conception, as well as the principles behind them, he is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics. While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid &#39;observable characteristics&#39; has changed with expanding knowledge (for example, <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus&#39; time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their relationships to each other), the fundamental principle remains sound.<p><a id="Mankind" name="Mankind"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mankind</span></h2>
      <p>Linnaeus was also a pioneer in defining the now discredited concept of &quot;<a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>&quot; as applied to humans. Within <i>Homo sapiens</i> he proposed four taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank. These categories are, <i>Americanus</i>, <i>Asiaticus</i>, <i>Africanus</i>, and <i>Europeanus</i>. They were based on place of origin at first, and later skin colour. Each race had certain characteristics that were endemic to individuals belonging to it. Native Americans were reddish, stubborn, and angered easily. Africans were black, relaxed and negligent. Asians were sallow, avaricious, and easily distracted. Europeans were white, gentle, and inventive. Linnaeus&#39;s races were clearly skewed in favour of Europeans. Over time, this classification led to a racial hierarchy, in which Europeans were at the top. Members of many European countries use the classification scheme to validate their conquering or subjugation of members of the &quot;lower&quot; races. In particular the invented concept of race was used to enforce the inhumane institution of slavery, particularly in the new world European colonies.<p>In addition, in <i>Amoenitates academicae</i> (1763), he defined <i>Homo anthropomorpha</i> as a catch-all race for a variety of human-like mythological creatures, including the troglodyte, satyr, hydra, and phoenix. He claimed that not only did these creatures actually exist, but were in reality inaccurate descriptions of real-world ape-like creatures.<p>He also, in <i>Systema Natur&aelig;</i>, defined <i>Homo ferus</i> as &quot;four-footed, mute, hairy.&quot; It included the subraces <i>Juvenis lupinus hessensis</i> (wolf-boys), whom he thought were raised by animals, and <i>Juvenis hannoveranus</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Peter of Hanover) and <i>Puella campanica</i> (Wild-girl of Champaigne). He likewise defined <i>Homo monstrosous</i> as agile and fainthearted, and included in this race the Patagonian giant, the dwarf of the Alps, and the monorchid Hottentot.<div align="left">

         <p><i>Non placet, quod Hominem inter ant[h]ropomorpha collocaverim, sed homo noscit se ipsum. Removeamus vocabula. Mihi perinde erit, quo nomine utamur. Sed quaero a Te et Toto orbe differentiam genericam inter hominem et Simiam, quae ex principiis Historiae naturalis. Ego certissime nullam novi. Utinam aliquis mihi unicam diceret! Si vocassem hominem simiam vel vice versa omnes in me conjecissem theologos. Debuissem forte ex lege artis.</i></td>

         <p><i>It is not pleasing to me that I must place <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Humans">humans</a> among the <!--del_lnk--> primates, but man is intimately familiar with himself. Let&#39;s not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name is applied. But I desperately seek from you and from the whole world a general difference between men and <!--del_lnk--> simians from the principles of <!--del_lnk--> Natural History. I certainly know of none. If only someone might tell me one! If I called man a <!--del_lnk--> simian or vice versa I would bring together all the <!--del_lnk--> theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to, in accordance with the law of the discipline [of Natural History].</i></td>
