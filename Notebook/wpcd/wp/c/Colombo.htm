Traveller <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Batuta in the 14th century referred to it as <i>Kalanpu</i>. Today&#39;s Colombo is a busy vibrant city with a mixture of modern life and colonial ruins.<p>

      <p>Since Colombo was a natural harbour, it was known to <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> traders from more than 2,000 years ago . Arabian <!--del_lnk--> Muslims whose prime interests were trade, settled in Colombo in the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th century</a> mostly because the port helped their business and controlled much of the trade between the <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese kingdoms and the outside world..<p><a id="Portuguese_Era" name="Portuguese_Era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Portuguese Era</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> first arrived in Sri Lanka in <!--del_lnk--> 1505. On their first visit they made a treaty with the king of Kandy enabling them to trade in the islands crop of cinnamon, which lay along the coastal areas including Colombo. They were given full authority of the coast line with the promise of guarding the coast against invaders. The Portuguese expelled the Muslim inhabitants and built a fort there to protect their spice trade. The land between the fortress and the interior was unoccupied and covered with trees. The Portuguese were compelled to reinforce the garrison to resist attacks by the indigenous leaders Mayadunne, Vidiya Bandara and Rajasinghe I. This part of Colombo is still known as <i>Fort</i> and houses the presidential palace and the majority of Colombo&#39;s five star hotels. The area immediately outside Fort is known as Pettah (or &quot;pita kotuwa&quot; in Singhalese which means outer fort) and is a commercial hub.<p><a id="Dutch_Era" name="Dutch_Era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dutch Era</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> captured the city in 1656 after an epic siege, at the end of which a mere 93 Portuguese survivors were given safe conduct out of the fort. It served as the capital of the maritime provinces under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East India Company until 1796.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> made the city the capital of their crown colony of <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon in <!--del_lnk--> 1802. They were responsible for much of the planning of the present city. In some parts of the city tramcar tracks and granite flooring laid during the era are still visible.<p><a id="Post_Independence" name="Post_Independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post Independence</span></h3>
      <p>This era of colonialism ended peacefully in <!--del_lnk--> 1948 when Ceylon gained independence from Britain. Because of the tremendous impact on the city&#39;s inhabitants and the country at large, the changes that resulted at the end of the colonial period were drastic. An entire new culture took root. Changes in laws and customs, clothing styles, religions and proper names were a significant result of the colonial era. These cultural changes were followed by the strengthening of the island&#39;s economy. Even today, the influence of the Portuguese, Dutch and British is clearly visible in Colombo&rsquo;s architecture, names, clothing, food, language and attitudes. Buildings from all three regimes stand in their glory as reminders of the turbulent past. The city and its people show an interesting mix of European clothing and lifestyles together with local customs. The city is by far more modern than most others in the neighbouring countries and continues to be a blossoming metropolis of the East. Its growth and prosperity has been hampered only by the effects of the protracted conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Tiger rebels in the northeast, which has produced economic effects throughout the island.<p>Historically, Colombo referred to the area around the <i><!--del_lnk--> Fort</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Pettah Market</i> which is famous for the variety of products available as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Khan Clock Tower, a local landmark. At present, it refers to the city limits of the <!--del_lnk--> Colombo Municipal Council. More often, the name is used for the <!--del_lnk--> Conurbation known as <!--del_lnk--> Greater Colombo, which encompasses several <!--del_lnk--> Municipal councils. It may also refer to the <!--del_lnk--> Colombo District. Colombo lost its status as the capital of Sri Lanka in the 1980s, but continues to be the island&#39;s commercial centre. Despite the official capital of Sri Lanka moving to nearby <!--del_lnk--> Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte (sometimes referred to as the administrative capital), most countries maintain their <!--del_lnk--> diplomatic missions in Colombo.<p><a id="Economic_history" name="Economic_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Economic history</span></h3>
      <p>In the past the city has included <!--del_lnk--> cinnamon and <a href="../../wp/c/Coconut.htm" title="Coconut">coconut</a> cultivation, but mostly throughout the history the city has been a port city. Colombo port is one of the busiest ports in Asia.<p>Colombo has a history of <!--del_lnk--> boom and bust, or at least boom and quiescence. Colombo was sent into decline by the aftermath of <!--del_lnk--> bomb blasts by the <!--del_lnk--> Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)rebel group. However the city remains a regional economic hub and a centre of supplies for the rest of the island.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h3>
      <p>Colombo&#39;s geography is a mix of hilly, flat and marshy land. The north and the south parts of the city are hilly and the east, and south east areas are bordered by marshy land. The city has many canals and the <i>Beira Lake</i> in the heart of the city. North and the North-East borders of the city flows the <i>Kelani river</i>, the river meets the sea in part of the city known as the <i>Modera</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Sinhala which literally means <i><!--del_lnk--> Delta</i>.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Colombo&rsquo;s climate is fairly temperate all throughout the year. During the March - April the temperature averages around 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) maximum. The only major change in the Colombo weather occurs during the <!--del_lnk--> monsoon seasons from May to August and October to January, this is the time of year where heavy rains can be expected. Colombo sees little relative diurnal range of temperature, although this is more marked in the drier winter months, where minimum temperatures average 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit). Rainfall in the city averages around 2,400 mm a year.<div class="thumb tright">

Colombo houses the countrys largest jail known as the Magazine Prison. And headquarters of the Police, Army, Navy, Air Force and many other judicial offices including the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court are in Colombo.

      <p>The great majority of Sri Lankan corporations have their head offices in Colombo. Some of the industries include chemicals, textiles, glass, cement, leather goods, furniture, and jewelry. In the city centre is located South Asia&#39;s second tallest building - The World Trade Centre. The 40 storeyed Twin Tower complex is the centre of important commerial establishments, situated in the Fort district, the city&#39;s nerve centre. Right outside the <i>Fort</i> area is <i>Pettah</i> which is derived from the Sinhala word <i>pita</i> which means <i>out</i> or <i>outside</i> as it is outside the <i>Fort</i>.<p>Pettah is more crowded than the fort area. Its a place you can buy almost anything you want, Pettah&#39;s roads are always packed and pavements are full of small stalls selling from delicious <!--del_lnk--> Sherbats to Shirts.

      <p>The two World Trade Centre towers have become the most recognized landmarks of the city in recent years. Before these towers were completed in 1997, the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Ceylon tower was the tallest structure and the most prominent landmark of the city. Before the skyscrapers were built it was the Old Parliament Building that stood majestically in the Fort district.<p>Even before the parliament was built some claim that the <i>Jami Ul Alfar</i> mosque was recognized as the landmark of Colombo by <!--del_lnk--> sailors approaching the <!--del_lnk--> port. The <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> is still one of the most visited tourist sites in Colombo.<p>The Fort district also has the famous <i>Cargills &amp; Millers</i> complex that is protected by a special government law from demolition.

The Hotel has played host to distinguished guests including the <!--del_lnk--> British Royal Family and other <!--del_lnk--> Royal Guests and Celebrities.
