      <p><b>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 29 September <!--del_lnk--> 1571 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 18 July <!--del_lnk--> 1610) was an <!--del_lnk--> Italian <!--del_lnk--> artist active in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Naples, <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily between <!--del_lnk--> 1593 and <!--del_lnk--> 1610. He is commonly placed in the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a> school, of which he was the first great representative.<p>Even in his own lifetime Caravaggio was considered enigmatic, fascinating, and dangerous. He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600, and thereafter never lacked for commissions or patrons, yet handled his success atrociously. An early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle some three years previously, tells how &quot;after a fortnight&#39;s work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.&quot; In <!--del_lnk--> 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price on his head. In <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1608 he was involved in another brawl, and yet another in Naples in 1609, possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. By the next year, after a career of little more than a decade, he was dead.<p>Huge new churches and palazzi were being built in Rome in the decades of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and paintings were needed to fill them. The <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation Church searched for authentic religious art with which to counter the threat of Protestantism, and for this task the artificial conventions of <!--del_lnk--> Mannerism, which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate. Caravaggio&#39;s novelty was a radical <!--del_lnk--> naturalism which combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, approach to <!--del_lnk--> chiaroscuro, the use of light and shadow. In Caravaggio&#39;s hands this new style was the vehicle for authentic and moving spirituality.<p>Famous and extremely influential while he lived, Caravaggio was almost entirely forgotten in the centuries after his death, and it was only in the 20th century that his importance to the development of Western art was rediscovered. Yet despite this his influence on the common style which eventually emerged from the ruins of Mannerism, the new <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a>, was profound. Andre Berne-Joffroy, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Val&eacute;ry&rsquo;s secretary, said of him: &quot;What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.&quot;<p>

      <p>Caravaggio&rsquo;s father, Fermo Merisi, was a household administrator and architect-decorator to Francesco Sforza, Marchese of <!--del_lnk--> Caravaggio, a town some thirty kilometers from <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a>. His mother, Lucia Aratori, came from a propertied family of the same district. None of the Merisi children &mdash; Michelangelo was Lucia&#39;s eldest &mdash; are listed on the baptismal records from Caravaggio, and all were probably born in Milan, where the Marchese had his court and where their father lived. In 1576 the family moved to Caravaggio to escape a plague which ravaged Milan. Caravaggio&rsquo;s father died there in 1577. It is assumed that the artist grew up in Caravaggio, but his family kept up connections with the <!--del_lnk--> Sforzas and with the powerful <!--del_lnk--> Colonna family, who were allied by marriage with the Sforzas and destined to play a major role in Caravaggio&#39;s later life.<p>In 1584 he was apprenticed for four years to the painter Simone Peterzano of Milan, described in the contract of apprenticeship as a pupil of <!--del_lnk--> Titian. Caravaggio appears to have stayed in the Milan-Caravaggio area after his apprenticeship ended, but it is possible that he visited <!--del_lnk--> Venice and saw the works of <!--del_lnk--> Giorgione, whom he was later accused of aping, and of Titian. Certainly he would have become familiar with the art treasures of Milan, including <!--del_lnk--> Leonardo&rsquo;s <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Last_Supper_%2528Leonardo%2529.htm" title="The Last Supper (Leonardo)">Last Supper</a></i>, and with the regional Lombard art, a style which valued &quot;simplicity and attention to naturalistic detail&quot; and was closer to the <!--del_lnk--> naturalism of Germany than to the stylised formality and grandeur of Roman <!--del_lnk--> Mannerism.<p><a id="Rome_.281592-1600.29" name="Rome_.281592-1600.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rome (1592-1600)</span></h3>

      <p>In mid-1592 he arrived in Rome, &ldquo;naked and extremely needy ... without fixed address and without provision ... short of money.&rdquo; A few months later he was doing hack-work for the highly successful <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Cesari, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Clement VIII&rsquo;s favourite painter, &ldquo;painting flowers and fruit&rdquo; in his factory-like workshop. Known works from this period include a small <i><!--del_lnk--> Boy Peeling a Fruit</i> (his earliest known painting), a <i><!--del_lnk--> Boy with a Basket of Fruit</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Young Sick Bacchus</i>, supposedly a self-portrait done during convalescence from a serious illness that ended his employment with Cesari. All three demonstrate the physical particularity &mdash; one aspect of his realism &mdash; for which Caravaggio was to become renowned: the fruit-basket-boy&rsquo;s produce has been analysed by a professor of horticulture, who was able to identify individual cultivars right down to &quot;... a large fig leaf with a prominent fungal scorch lesion resembling <!--del_lnk--> anthracnose (<i>Glomerella cingulata</i>).&quot;.<p>Caravaggio left Cesari in January 1594, determined to make his own way. His fortunes were at their lowest ebb, yet it was now that he forged some extremely important friendships, with the painter <!--del_lnk--> Prospero Orsi, the architect <!--del_lnk--> Onorio Longhi, and the sixteen year old <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian artist <!--del_lnk--> Mario Minniti. Orsi, established in the profession, introduced him to influential collectors; Longhi, more balefully, introduced him to the world of Roman street-brawls; and Minniti served as a model and, years later, would be instrumental in helping Caravaggio to important commissions in Sicily. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Fortune Teller</i>, his first composition with more than one figure, shows Mario being cheated by a gypsy girl. The theme was quite new for Rome, and proved immensely influential over the next century and beyond. This, however, was in the future: at the time, Caravaggio sold it for practically nothing. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cardsharps</i> &mdash; showing another unsophisticated boy falling the victim of card cheats &mdash; is even more psychologically complex, and perhaps Caravaggio&rsquo;s first true masterpiece. Like the <i><!--del_lnk--> Fortune Teller</i> it was immensely popular, and over 50 copies survive. More importantly, it attracted the patronage of <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Maria Del Monte, one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For Del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces &mdash; <i><!--del_lnk--> The Musicians</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Lute Player</i>, a tipsy <i><!--del_lnk--> Bacchus</i>, an allegorical but realistic <i><!--del_lnk--> Boy Bitten by a Lizard</i> &mdash; featuring Minniti and other boy models. The allegedly homoerotic ambience of these paintings has been the centre of considerable dispute amongst scholars and biographers since it was first raised in the later half of the 20th century.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The realism returned with Caravaggio&rsquo;s first paintings on religious themes, and the emergence of remarkable spirituality. The first of these was the <i><!--del_lnk--> Penitent Magdalene</i>, showing <!--del_lnk--> Mary Magdalene at the moment when she has turned from her life as a courtesan and sits weeping on the floor, her jewels scattered around her. &ldquo;It seemed not a religious painting at all ... a girl sitting on a low wooden stool drying her hair ... Where was the repentance ... suffering ... promise of salvation?&rdquo; It was understated, in the Lombard manner, not histrionic in the Roman manner of the time. It was followed by others in the same style: <i><!--del_lnk--> Saint Catherine</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Martha and Mary Magdalene</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Judith Beheading Holofernes</i>, a <i><!--del_lnk--> Sacrifice of Isaac</i>, a <i><!--del_lnk--> Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy</i>, and a <i><!--del_lnk--> Rest on the Flight into Egypt</i>. The works, while viewed by a comparatively limited circle, increased Caravaggio&#39;s fame with both connoisseurs and his fellow-artists. But a true reputation would depend on public commissions, and for these it was necessary to look to the Church.<p><a name=".27Most_famous_painter_in_Rome.27_.281600-1606.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">&#39;Most famous painter in Rome&#39; (1600-1606)</span></h3>

      <p>In 1599, presumably through the influence of Del Monte, Caravaggio contracted to decorate the <!--del_lnk--> Contarelli Chapel in the church of <!--del_lnk--> San Luigi dei Francesi. The two works making up the commission, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Martyrdom of Saint Matthew</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Calling of Saint Matthew</i>, delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation. Caravaggio&rsquo;s heightened <!--del_lnk--> chiaroscuro brought high drama to his subjects, while his acutely observed realism brought a new level of emotional intensity. This heightened form of chiaroscuro is known as <!--del_lnk--> tenebrism, and he is credited with popularizing it. Opinion among Caravaggio&rsquo;s artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as the saviour of art: &quot;The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Caravaggio went on to secure a string of prestigious commissions for religious works featuring violent struggles, grotesque decapitations, torture and death. For the most part each new painting increased his fame, but a few were rejected by the various bodies for whom they were intended, at least in their original forms, and had to be re-painted or find new buyers. The essence of the problem was that while Caravaggio&rsquo;s dramatic intensity was appreciated, his realism was seen by some as unacceptably vulgar. His first version of <i><!--del_lnk--> Saint Matthew and the Angel</i>, featured the saint as a bald peasant with dirty legs attended by a lightly-clad over-familiar boy-angel, was rejected and had to be repainted as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Inspiration of Saint Matthew</i>. Similarly, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Conversion of Saint Paul</i> was rejected, and while another version of the same subject, the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Conversion of Saint Paul</i>, was accepted, it featured the saint&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s haunches far more prominently than the saint himself, prompting this exchange between the artist and an exasperated official of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Maria del Popolo: &ldquo;Why have you put a horse in the middle, and <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_of_Tarsus.htm" title="Paul of Tarsus">Saint Paul</a> on the ground?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because!&rdquo; &ldquo;Is the horse God?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but he stands in God&rsquo;s light!&rdquo;<p>Other works included the deeply moving <i><!--del_lnk--> Entombment</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Madonna di Loreto</i> (<i>Madonna of the Pilgrims</i>), the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Grooms&#39; Madonna</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Death of the Virgin</i>. The history of these last two paintings illustrate the reception given to some of Caravaggio&#39;s art, and the times in which he lived. The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Grooms&#39; Madonna</i>, also known as <!--del_lnk--> Madonna dei palafrenieri, painted for a small altar in st.Peter&#39;s Basilica in Rome, remained there for just two days, and was then taken off. A cardinal&#39;s secretary wrote: &quot; In this painting there are but vulgarity, sacrilege, impiousness and disgust...One would say it is a work made by a painter that can paint well, but of a dark spirit, and who has been for a lot of time far from God, from His adoration, and from any good thought...&quot;. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Death of the Virgin</i>, then, commissioned in 1601 by a wealthy jurist for his private chapel in the new Carmelite church of Santa Maria della Scala, was rejected by the Carmelites in 1606. Caravaggio&#39;s contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Giulio Mancini records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin; <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Baglione, another contemporary, tells us it was because of Mary&#39;s bare legs: a matter of decorum in either case. But Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio&#39;s version fails to assert the doctrine of the <!--del_lnk--> Assumption of Mary, the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven. The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio&#39;s most able followers, <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Saraceni), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work which showed the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. The <i>Death of the Virgin</i> was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Rubens</a>, and later acquired by <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I of England</a> before entering the French royal collection in 1671.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>One secular piece from these years is <i><!--del_lnk--> Amor Victorious</i>, painted in 1602 for <!--del_lnk--> Vincenzo Giustiniani, a member of Del Monte&rsquo;s circle. The model was named in a memoir of the early 17th century as &quot;Cecco&quot;, the diminutive for Francesco. He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610-1625 and known as <!--del_lnk--> Cecco del Caravaggio (&#39;Caravaggio&#39;s Cecco&#39;), carrying a bow and arrows and trampling symbols of the warlike and peaceful arts and sciences underfoot. He is unclothed, and it is difficult to accept this grinning urchin as the Roman god <!--del_lnk--> Cupid &ndash; as difficult as it was to accept Caravaggio&rsquo;s other semi-clad adolescents as the various angels he painted in his canvases, wearing much the same stage-prop wings. The point, however, is the intense yet ambiguous reality of the work: it is simultaneously Cupid and Cecco, as Caravaggio&rsquo;s Virgins were simultaneously the Mother of Christ and the Roman courtesans who modeled for them.<p><a id="Exile_and_death_.281606-1610.29" name="Exile_and_death_.281606-1610.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exile and death (1606-1610)</span></h3>

      <p>Caravaggio led a tumultuous life. He was notorious for brawling, even in a time and place when such behaviour was commonplace, and the transcripts of his police records and trial proceedings fill several pages. On <!--del_lnk--> 29 May <!--del_lnk--> 1606, he killed, possibly unintentionally, a young man named Ranuccio Tomassoni. Previously his high-placed patrons had protected him from the consequences of his escapades, but this time they could do nothing. Caravaggio, outlawed, fled to <!--del_lnk--> Naples. There, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples. His connections with the Colonnas led to a stream of important church commissions, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Madonna of the Rosary</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Seven Works of Mercy</i>.<p>Despite his success in Naples, after only a few months in the city Caravaggio left for <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>, the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Knights of Malta, presumably hoping that the patronage of <!--del_lnk--> Alof de Wignacourt, Grand Master of the Knights, could help him secure a pardon for Tomassoni&#39;s death. De Wignacourt proved so impressed at having the famous artist as official painter to the Order that he inducted him as a knight, and the early biographer Bellori records that the artist was well pleased with his success. Major works from his Malta period include a huge <i><!--del_lnk--> Beheading of Saint John the Baptist</i> (the only painting to which he put his signature) and a <i><!--del_lnk--> Portrait of Alof de Wignacourt and his Page</i>, as well as portraits of other leading knights. Yet by late August of 1608 he was arrested and imprisoned. The circumstances surrounding this abrupt change of fortune have long been a matter of speculation, but recent investigation has revealed it to have been the result of yet another brawl, during which the door of a house was battered down and a knight seriously wounded. By December he had been expelled from the Order &quot;as a foul and rotten member.&quot;<div class="thumb tleft">

       <br /> After only nine months in Sicily Caravaggio returned to Naples. According to his earliest biographer he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now <!--del_lnk--> Paul V) and return to Rome. In Naples he painted <i><!--del_lnk--> The Denial of Saint Peter</i>, a final <i><!--del_lnk--> John the Baptist (Borghese)</i>, and, his last picture, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula</i>. His style continued to evolve - <!--del_lnk--> Saint Ursula is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the <!--del_lnk--> Huns strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings which had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was much freer and more impressionistic. Had Caravaggio lived, something new would have come.<p>In Naples an attempt was made on his life, by persons unknown. At first it was reported in Rome that the &quot;famous artist&quot; Caravaggio was dead, but then it was learned that he was alive, but seriously disfigured in the face. He painted a <i><!--del_lnk--> Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)</i>, showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to de Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time he painted also a <i><!--del_lnk--> David with the Head of Goliath</i>, showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing on the wounded head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio&#39;s. This painting he may have sent to the unscrupulous art-loving cardinal-nephew Scipione Borghese, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons.<p>In the summer of 1610 he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, gifts for Cardinal Scipione. What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture. The bare facts are that on <!--del_lnk--> 28 July an anonymous <i>avviso</i> (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later another <i>avviso</i> said that he had died of fever. These were the earliest, brief accounts of his death, which later underwent much elaboration. No body was found. A poet friend of the artist later gave <!--del_lnk--> 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in Porto Ercole, near <!--del_lnk--> Grosseto in <!--del_lnk--> Tuscany.<p><a id="Caravaggio_the_artist" name="Caravaggio_the_artist"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Caravaggio the artist</span></h2>

      <p>Caravaggio &ldquo;put the oscuro (shadows) into chiaroscuro.&rdquo; Chiaroscuro was practiced long before he came on the scene, but it was Caravaggio who made the technique definitive, darkening the shadows and transfixing the subject in a blinding shaft of light. With this went the acute observation of physical and psychological reality which formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions. He worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle. The approach was anathema to the skilled artists of his day, who decried his refusal to work from drawings and to idealise his figures. Yet the models were basic to his realism. Some have been identified, including <!--del_lnk--> Mario Minniti and <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Boneri, both fellow-artists, Mario appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Francesco as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include <!--del_lnk--> Fillide Melandroni, <!--del_lnk--> Anna Bianchini, and Maddalena Antognetti (&quot;Lena&quot; mentioned in court documents (the &quot;Artichoke&quot; case) as Caravaggio&#39;s concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints. Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Martyrdom of Saint Ursula</i>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Caravaggio had a noteworthy ability to express in one scene of unsurpassed vividness the passing of a crucial moment. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Supper at Emmaus</i> depicts the recognition of Christ by his disciples: a moment before he is a fellow traveler, mourning the passing of the Messiah, as he never ceases to be to the inn-keeper&rsquo;s eyes, the second after, he is the Saviour. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Calling of St Matthew</i>, the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying &ldquo;who, me?&rdquo;, while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, &ldquo;Yes, I will follow you&rdquo;. With <i><!--del_lnk--> The Resurrection of Lazarus</i>, he goes a step further, giving us a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection. The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of rigor mortis, but his hand, facing and recognizing that of Christ, is alive. Other major Baroque artists would travel the same path, for example <!--del_lnk--> Bernini, fascinated with themes from Ovid&rsquo;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Metamorphoses</i>.<p><a id="The_Caravaggisti" name="The_Caravaggisti"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Caravaggisti</i></span></h3>

      <p>The installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni Baglione (although his Caravaggio phase was short-lived) and <!--del_lnk--> Orazio Gentileschi. In the next generation there were <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Saraceni, <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeo Manfredi and <!--del_lnk--> Orazio Borgianni. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620, and ended up as court painter to Charles I in England. His daughter <!--del_lnk--> Artemisia Gentileschi was also close to Caravaggio, and one of the most gifted of the movement. Yet in Rome and in Italy it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of <!--del_lnk--> Annibale Carraci, blending elements from the <!--del_lnk--> High Renaissance and Lombard realism, which ultimately triumphed.<p>Caravaggio&rsquo;s brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including <!--del_lnk--> Battistello Caracciolo and <!--del_lnk--> Carlo Sellitto. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection &ndash; Naples was a possession of Spain &ndash; was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.<p>A group of Catholic artists from <a href="../../wp/u/Utrecht_%2528city%2529.htm" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Utrecht Caravaggisti&quot;, travelled to Rome as students in the first years of the 17th century and were profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio, as Bellori describes. On their return to the north this trend had a short-lived but influential flowering in the 1620s among painters like <!--del_lnk--> Hendrick ter Brugghen, <!--del_lnk--> Gerrit van Honthorst, <!--del_lnk--> Andries Both and <!--del_lnk--> Dirck van Baburen. In the following generation the affects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Rubens</a> (who purchased one of his paintings for the Gonzaga of Mantua and painted a copy of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Entombment of Christ</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Vermeer, <!--del_lnk--> Rembrandt, and <!--del_lnk--> Velazquez, the last of whom presumably saw his work during his various sojourns in Italy.<p><a id="Death_and_rebirth_of_a_reputation" name="Death_and_rebirth_of_a_reputation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death and rebirth of a reputation</span></h3>

      <p>Caravaggio&rsquo;s fame scarcely survived his death. His innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism. He directly influenced the style of his companion <!--del_lnk--> Orazio Gentileschi, and his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Artemisia Gentileschi, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen <!--del_lnk--> Georges de La Tour and <!--del_lnk--> Simon Vouet, and the Spaniard <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Ribera. Yet within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. Largely this was a matter of changing fashion &mdash; the Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had moved on. And partly it was due to critical demolition-jobs done by two of his earliest biographers, Giovanni <!--del_lnk--> Baglione, a rival painter with a personal vendetta, and the influential 17th century critic <!--del_lnk--> Giovan Bellori, who had not known him but was under the influence of the French <!--del_lnk--> Classicist <!--del_lnk--> Poussin, who had not known him either but hated his work.<p>In the 1920s art critic Roberto Longhi brought Caravaggio&#39;s name once more to public attention, and placed him in the European tradition: &ldquo;Ribera, <!--del_lnk--> Vermeer, La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him. And the art of <!--del_lnk--> Delacroix, <!--del_lnk--> Courbet and <a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589douard_Manet.htm" title="Manet">Manet</a> would have been utterly different.&rdquo; The influential <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Berenson agreed: &ldquo;With the exception of <!--del_lnk--> Michaelangelo, no other Italian painter exercised so great an influence.&rdquo;<p><a id="Modern_tradition" name="Modern_tradition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern tradition</span></h3>

      <p>Many large museums of art, for example those in <!--del_lnk--> Detroit and <!--del_lnk--> New York, contain rooms where dozens of paintings by as many artists display the characteristic look of the work of Caravaggio &mdash; nighttime setting, dramatic lighting, ordinary people used as models, honest description from nature. In modern times, painters like the Norwegian <!--del_lnk--> Odd Nerdrum and the Hungarian <!--del_lnk--> Tibor Csernus make no secret of their attempts to emulate and update him, and the contemporary American artist <!--del_lnk--> Doug Ohlson pays homage to Caravaggio&#39;s influence on his own work. Filmmaker <!--del_lnk--> Derek Jarman turned to the Caravaggio legend when creating his movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Caravaggio</i>; and Dutch art forger <!--del_lnk--> Han van Meegeren used genuine Caravaggios when creating his ersatz Old Masters.<p>Only about 50 works by Caravaggio survive. One, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Calling of Saints Peter and Andrew</i>, was recently authenticated and restored. It had been in storage in <!--del_lnk--> Hampton Court, mislabeled as a copy. At least a couple of his paintings have been or may have been lost in recent times. <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Francis_Burton.htm" title="Richard Francis Burton">Richard Francis Burton</a> writes of a &quot;picture of St. Rosario (in the museum of the Grand Duke of Tuscany), showing a circle of thirty men <i>turpiter ligati&quot;</i> which is not known to have survived.
