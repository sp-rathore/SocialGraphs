      <p>Cairo is located on the banks and islands of the Nile River in the north of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, immediately south of the point where the river leaves its desert-bound valley and breaks into two branches into the low-lying <!--del_lnk--> Nile Delta region.<p>The oldest part of the city is somewhat east of the river. There, the city gradually spreads west, engulfing the agricultural lands next to the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a>. These western areas, built on the model of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Ismail the Magnificent in the mid-19th century, are marked by wide boulevards, public gardens, and open spaces. The older eastern section of the city is very different: having grown up haphazardly over the centuries it is filled with small lanes and crowded tenements. While western Cairo is dominated by the government buildings and modern architecture, the eastern half is filled with hundreds of ancient <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosques</a> that act as landmarks.<p>Extensive water systems have also allowed the city to expand east into the desert. Bridges link the Nile islands of <!--del_lnk--> Gezira and <!--del_lnk--> Roda, where many government buildings are located and government officials live. Bridges also cross the Nile attaching the city to the suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Giza and <!--del_lnk--> Imbabah (part of the Cairo conurbation).<p>West of Giza, in the desert, is part of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> necropolis of Memphis on the Giza plateau, with its three large <a href="../../wp/p/Pyramid.htm" title="Pyramid">pyramids</a>, including the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza.htm" title="Great Pyramid of Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> Approximately 11 miles (18 km) to the south of modern Cairo is the site of the ancient Egyptian city of <!--del_lnk--> Memphis and adjoining necropolis of <!--del_lnk--> Saqqara. These cities were Cairo&#39;s ancient predecessors, when Cairo was still in this approximate geographical location.<p><a id="History_of_Cairo" name="History_of_Cairo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of Cairo</span></h2>

      <p>The current location of Cairo was too far from the ancient course of the Nile to support a city. Just to the south of the modern city&#39;s location are the ruins of <!--del_lnk--> Memphis, which was the capital of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and was founded in around 3100 BC by <!--del_lnk--> Menes of <!--del_lnk--> Tanis after he had united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt, although the capital later moved to <!--del_lnk--> Heliopolis, further south to <!--del_lnk--> Thebes, and, under the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic dynasty, <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria.<p>The first settlement on the location of modern Cairo was a <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> fort, known as <!--del_lnk--> Babylon Fort, built about <!--del_lnk--> AD 150, built near the settlement known as <!--del_lnk--> Babylon-in-Egypt, which lay close to an ancient Egyptian canal from the Nile to the Red Sea.<p>A small town mostly of <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Christians slowly grew around the fort. Arab invaders, lead by <!--del_lnk--> Amr ibn al-As, took the fort town in 642 and also established their army in the location, rebuilding its defenses. The Arab tented camp outside the fortress, known as <!--del_lnk--> Al-Fustat, slowly became the permanent base of the Arab forces in Egypt under the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads and <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasids</a>, and contains the first <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> in Africa.<p>Slowly, the settlement grew into a small city. The <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North African</a> <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;i <!--del_lnk--> Fatimid Dynasty conquered Egypt in 972 and built a new capital, <!--del_lnk--> al-Mansuriyyah, north of the old settlement.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Al-Azhar mosque was founded the same year, and along with its accompanying <!--del_lnk--> university it made Cairo a centre of learning and philosophy. The school remains a major centre for <!--del_lnk--> Islamic study today. The <!--del_lnk--> Seljuks captured Cairo in the mid 1100s, and <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a> and his successors expanded the city further, including the construction of its massive <!--del_lnk--> citadel.<p>The sack of <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in 1258 heightened the importance of the city and it became the leading intellectual and artistic centre in the Middle East, and perhaps the world, for the next 250 years. It is believed that Cairo was the largest city in the world from 1315 to 1348 <!--del_lnk--> (years of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a>), though, as has been shown by Andre Raymond (<i>Cairo: City of History</i>. Cairo: AUC, 2001. P. 136-137), this is a gross exaggeration, and Cairo&#39;s population did not exceed 200,000 at this time. But power was shifting from the Arab world north to the <!--del_lnk--> Turks and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">Europeans</a>.<p>The city was taken by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> under <!--del_lnk--> Selim I in 1517, but in the 17th and 18th centuries the ruling <!--del_lnk--> Mameluks returned to power as nominal vassals to the Ottoman Sultan.<p>The family of 26th Ottoman sultan <!--del_lnk--> Selim III died on the way to <!--del_lnk--> Medina. They have been buried in an impressive Ottoman mausoleum in the old quarter of Cairo. The mausoleum is still a favorite place to visit for Turkish tourists.<p><a id="Era_of_westernization" name="Era_of_westernization"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Era of westernization</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> conquered Egypt in 1798, and Cairo was quickly surrendered to him by its Mameluk rulers. Napoleon left Egypt after his fleet was destroyed at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Aboukir Bay in August 1798, leaving <!--del_lnk--> General Kl&eacute;ber in charge. Kl&eacute;ber was <!--del_lnk--> assassinated in 1800 and the three-year <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> occupation had little lasting effect.<p>The first hints of westernization began under the successors to <!--del_lnk--> Mehemet Ali with the introduction of a railway connection to <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria in 1851. Significant change, however, did not occur until the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Isma&#39;il Pasha when, in 1863, construction of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> brought significant numbers of westerners to Egypt. A network of gas lighting was installed by a <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> company and the railway lines were greatly expanded.<p>In 1867, Isma&#39;il visited <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> to attend the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Exposition of 1867. There he saw the newly redesigned city of <!--del_lnk--> Haussmann and, funded by a booming <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> trade, decided to rebuild Cairo on the model of a European capital. He hoped to have this done by 1869 when representatives from around the world came to Egypt for the opening of the Suez Canal.<p>Rather than rebuild the old city, Isma&#39;il elected to add a new quarter to the western section along the bank of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a>. The project was carried out by <!--del_lnk--> Ali Pasha Mubarak and designed by the French urban planner <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Grand. A new area of luxurious villas and apartments was constructed and new government ministries were erected. Grand boulevards were opened through the old town and tram lines soon followed.<p>The era of colonization in 1882 saw the rebuilding of Cairo continuing. A modern sewer system was installed and new suburbs such as <!--del_lnk--> Heliopolis were constructed in the desert. Cairo&#39;s population exploded, increasing from 374,000 in 1882 to 1,312,000 by 1937. The city was dominated by westerners, however, and city planners tended to emphasize <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> churches over mosques.<p><a id="Modern_Cairo" name="Modern_Cairo"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Cairo</span></h3>

      <p>Cairo remained the central city of Egypt throughout the period of British rule and afterwards.

The city was especially burdened by refugees from the various wars with <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>: much of the population of the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai peninsula and the cities along the Suez Canal left for Cairo between 1967 and 1978.<p>Today, Cairo is Africa&#39;s most populous city and the <!--del_lnk--> Arab world&#39;s cultural centre.<p>Since the 19th century Cairo has also become a centre for <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a> as people from around the world have come to see the monuments and artifacts of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, especially the <a href="../../wp/p/Pyramid.htm" title="Pyramid">Pyramids</a>.

      <p>Cairo has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and regional leagues. The best known teams are <!--del_lnk--> Al-Zamalek and <!--del_lnk--> Al-Ahly, whose annual football <!--del_lnk--> Local derby is perhaps the most watched sports event in Egypt as well as the Africa and Arab World. Both teams are known as the giants of Egyptian football, and are champions in the African continent and the Arab World. Both teams play their home games at <!--del_lnk--> Cairo International Stadium, which is Cairo&#39;s and Egypt&#39;s largest stadium and one of the largest in Africa<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cairo International Stadium was built in 1960 and its multipurpose sports complex that houses the main Soccer stadium, an indoor stadium, several satellite fields that held several regional, continental and global games, including the African Games, U17 Football World Championship and was one of the stadiums scheduled that hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 African Nations Cup which was played on January, 2006, which Egypt won its title for the record number of five times in African Continental Competition&#39;s history.<p>Cairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, which will be hosted in Beijing China. Egypt was unsuccessful in bidding to host the 2010 Football World Cup, which will be held in South Africa. However, Egypt will host the Pan-Arab Games in 2007.<p>There are several other sports teams in the city that participate in several sports including <!--del_lnk--> Al Gezeera Sporting Club, <!--del_lnk--> Al Shams Club, <!--del_lnk--> Shooting club, <!--del_lnk--> Heliopolis Club and several smaller clubs, but the biggest clubs in Egypt (not in area but in sports) are <!--del_lnk--> Al Ahly &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Al-Zamalek. They have the two biggest football teams in Egypt.<p>Most of the sports federations of the country are also located in the city suburbs, including the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Football Association. The headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Confederation of African Football(CAF) was previously located in Cairo, before relocating to its new headquarters in <!--del_lnk--> 6th October City.<p><a id="Pollution" name="Pollution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pollution</span></h2>
      <p>Cairo is a rapidly expanding city which has lead to many environmental problems. There are over 2,000,000 cars on the streets of Cairo, 60% of which are over 10 years old, and therefore lack modern emission cutting features like catalytic converters. Cairo also has many unregistered lead and copper smelters which heavily pollute the city. The results of this has been a permanent haze over the city with particulate matter in the air reaching over three times normal levels. It is estimated that 10,000 to 25,000 people a year in Cairo die due to air pollution-related diseases. It is also estimated that the high lead content of the air can reduce a child&#39;s IQ on average by 4 points. In 1995, the first environmental acts were introduced and the situation has seen some improvement with 36 air monitoring stations and emissions tests on cars. 20,000 buses have also been commissioned to the city to improve congestion levels, which are very high.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The city also suffers from a level of land pollution. Cairo produces 10,000 tonnes of rubbish each day, 4,000 tonnes of which is not collected or managed. This once again is a huge health hazard and the Egyptian Government is looking for ways to combat this. The Cairo Cleaning and Beautification Agency was founded to collect and recycle the rubbish; however, they also work with the <!--del_lnk--> Zabbaleen, a Christian community that has been collecting and recycling Cairo&#39;s rubbish since the turn of the 20th century <!--del_lnk--> . Both are working together to pick up as much rubbish as possible within the city limits, though it remains a pressing problem.<p>The city also suffers from water pollution as the sewer system tends to fail and overflow. On occasion, sewage has escaped onto streets creating a health hazard. This problem is hoped to be solved by a new sewer system funded by the European Union, which could cope with the demand of the city. The dangerously high levels of mercury in the city&#39;s water system has global health officials concerned over related health risks.<p><a id="Housing" name="Housing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Housing</span></h2>
      <p>Cairo is facing a housing problem. The lack of satisfactory and affordable housing for the rapidly growing population has forced many poor Egyptians to make cemeteries in the <!--del_lnk--> city of the Dead as their permanent homes. Among these cemeteries live a community of Egypt&rsquo;s urban poor, forming an illegal but tolerated, separate society. More than five million Egyptians live in these cemeteries, and have formed their own enterprises. The population of the City of the Dead is growing rapidly because of rural migration and its complicated housing crisis is getting worse.<p><a id="Famous_Cairenes" name="Famous_Cairenes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous Cairenes</span></h2>
