      <p>The name <i>Madras</i> is derived from <i>Madraspatnam</i>, the site chosen by the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> for a permanent settlement in 1639. Another small town, <i>Chennapatnam</i>, lay to the south of it. In due course the two towns were merged, and the term <i>Madras</i> was favoured by the British. However locals used to refer to it as <i>Chennapatnam</i> or <i>Chennapuri</i>. The city was <!--del_lnk--> renamed <i>Chennai</i> in August 1996 as the name <i>Madras</i> was perceived to be of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> origin. (A number of other Indian cities have enacted <!--del_lnk--> similar name changes.) It is believed that the original Portuguese name is <i>Madre de Sois</i>, named after a Portuguese high authority who was one among the early settlers in 1500. There have been however been suggestions that <i>Chennai</i> may not be a Tamil name while <i>Madras</i> may be of <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> origin.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military, and economic centre dating back to the 1st century. It has been ruled by <!--del_lnk--> South Indian <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">kingdoms</a>, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Pallava, the <a href="../../wp/c/Chola_dynasty.htm" title="Chola dynasty">Chola</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Pandya, and <!--del_lnk--> Vijaynagar empires. The town of <!--del_lnk--> Mylapore, now part of the metropolis, was once a major port of the Pallava kingdom.<p>When the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> arrived in 1522, they built a port and named it S&atilde;o Tom&eacute;, after the <!--del_lnk--> Christian <!--del_lnk--> apostle <!--del_lnk--> St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached there between the years 52 and 70. The region then passed into the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch, who established themselves near <!--del_lnk--> Pulicat just north of the city in 1612.<p>On 22 August 1639, the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> was granted land by the Damerla Venkatadri, <!--del_lnk--> Nayak of <!--del_lnk--> Vandavasi, as a base for a permanent settlement, believed to be called <i>Madrasemen</i>. A year later, <!--del_lnk--> Fort St George was built, which subsequently became the nucleus around which the colonial city grew. In 1746, Fort St George and Madras were captured by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> under General <!--del_lnk--> La Bourdonnais, the <!--del_lnk--> Governor of <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritius.htm" title="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, who plundered the town and its outlying villages.<p>The British regained control of the town in 1749 through the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and subsequently fortified the base to withstand further attacks from the French and <!--del_lnk--> Hyder Ali, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Mysore. By the late 18th century, the British had conquered most of the region around Tamil Nadu and the northern modern-day states of <!--del_lnk--> Andhra Pradesh and <!--del_lnk--> Karnataka to establish the <!--del_lnk--> Madras Presidency, whose capital was Madras.<p>Under British rule the city grew into a major urban centre and naval base. With the advent of <!--del_lnk--> railways in India in the late 19th century, it was connected to other important cities such as <a href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (formerly known as Bombay) and <a href="../../wp/k/Kolkata.htm" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> (formerly Calcutta), facilitating communication and trade with the <!--del_lnk--> hinterland. It was the only Indian city to be attacked by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, when an oil depot was shelled by the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> light cruiser <!--del_lnk--> SMS Emden. After <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence">independence</a> in 1947, the city became the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Madras State, which was <!--del_lnk--> renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969.<p>From 1965 to 1967, Chennai was an important base for the Tamil agitation against the imposition of <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>. Chennai had witnessed some political violence due to the <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lankan_Civil_War.htm" title="Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka">ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka</a>, after 33 people were killed by a bomb planted by the <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Eelam Army at the airport in 1984 and following the assassination of thirteen members of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lankan</a> separatist group <!--del_lnk--> EPRLF, and two Indian civilians by the rival <!--del_lnk--> LTTE in 1991. Strong measures were taken and the city has not faced any major terrorist activity since then. The city was <!--del_lnk--> renamed <i>Chennai</i> in August 1996 as the name <i>Madras</i> was perceived to be of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> origin.<p>In 2004 the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Ocean tsunami lashed the shores of Chennai, killing many and permanently altering the coastline.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Chennai is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 13.04&deg;&nbsp;N 80.17&deg;&nbsp;E</span> on the southeast coast of India and in the northeast corner of <!--del_lnk--> Tamil Nadu. It is located on a flat coastal plain known as the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Coastal Plains. The city has an average elevation of 6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (20&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> feet), its highest point being 60&nbsp;m (200&nbsp;ft). Two rivers meander through Chennai, the <!--del_lnk--> Cooum River (or <i>Koovam</i>) in the central region and the <!--del_lnk--> Adyar River in the southern region. Both rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and trash from domestic and commercial sources. The Adyar, which is much less polluted than the Cooum, is de-silted and cleaned periodically by the state government. A protected <!--del_lnk--> estuary of the Adyar forms the natural habitat of several species of birds and animals. The <!--del_lnk--> Buckingham Canal, 4&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (3&nbsp;miles) inland, travels parallel to the coast, linking the two rivers. The <!--del_lnk--> Otteri Nullah, an east-west stream runs through north Chennai and meets the Buckingham Canal at <!--del_lnk--> Basin Bridge.<p>Several lakes of varying size are located on the western fringes of the city. <!--del_lnk--> Red Hills, <!--del_lnk--> Sholavaram and <!--del_lnk--> Chembarambakkam Lake supply Chennai with <!--del_lnk--> potable water. <!--del_lnk--> Groundwater sources are mostly <!--del_lnk--> brackish. The city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> water supply has proved inadequate for its population, and an over-reliance on annual <!--del_lnk--> monsoon rains to replenish water <!--del_lnk--> reservoirs has compounded problems. There had been some attempts to pipe in water from other sources, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Veeranam, a water-rich place in Tamil Nadu or from the <!--del_lnk--> Krishna River in Andhra Pradesh. Water is a precious commodity in Chennai and this has given rise to private water tankers supplying many areas. Alternative measures such as <!--del_lnk--> reverse osmosis and rainwater harvesting have been taken up. Chennai Metrowater has currently finalised a bid to construct a reverse osmosis plant with a capacity of 100 million litres per day (about 15 litres per person per day).<p>The <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> of Chennai comprises of mostly <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a>, <!--del_lnk--> shale and <!--del_lnk--> sandstone. The city is classified into three regions based on geology, sandy areas, clayey areas and hard-rock areas. Sandy areas are found along the river banks and the coasts. Clayey regions cover most of the city. Hard rock areas are <!--del_lnk--> Guindy, <!--del_lnk--> Velachery, <!--del_lnk--> Adambakkam and a part of <!--del_lnk--> Saidapet. In sandy areas such as Tiruvanmiyur, Adyar, Kottivakkam, Santhome, George Town and the rest of coastal Chennai, rainwater run-off percolates very quickly. In clayey and hard rock areas, rainwater percolates slowly, but it is held by the soil for a longer time. The city&#39;s clayey areas include <!--del_lnk--> T.Nagar, West Mambalam, <!--del_lnk--> Anna Nagar, Kolathur and Virugambakkam.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Chennai lies on the <!--del_lnk--> thermal equator, and thus sees little variation in seasonal temperature. Its proximity to the sea gives it a hot and <!--del_lnk--> humid climate for most of the year. The highest temperatures are experienced in late May and early June and usually vary between 38&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (100.4&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) and 42&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (107.6&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F) though it sometimes nearly touches 45&nbsp;&deg;C (113&nbsp;&deg;F) for a few days. Average daily temperature in Chennai during January is around 24&nbsp;&deg;C (75&nbsp;&deg;F), though the temperature rarely falls below 18&nbsp;&deg;C (64&nbsp;&deg;F). The lowest temperature recorded is 15.8&nbsp;&deg;C (60.4&nbsp;&deg;F) and highest 47.1&nbsp;&deg;C (116.8&nbsp;&deg;F).<p>The average annual <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a> is about 1,300&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm (47.2&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches). The city gets most of its <a href="../../wp/s/Season.htm" title="Season">seasonal</a> rainfall from the north-east <!--del_lnk--> monsoon winds, from Mid October to Mid December. <!--del_lnk--> Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal sometimes hit the city.<p><a id="Layout" name="Layout"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Layout</span></h3>

The stadium is famous for its list of records, including the first ever test match victory that <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> recorded in 1951-52 when they defeated England. But more than the records, what stands out at Chepauk is the atmosphere and the crowd, reputed to be the most knowledgeable and appreciative in the country. This was proved when those present gave a standing ovation to Saeed Anwar after his record breaking 194 against India in the Independence Cup match in 1997 and again when Pakistan won the Test match in 1999. A truly overwhelmed Pakistani team even made a lap of honour in appreciation of the spectators&#39; sporting behaviour.
