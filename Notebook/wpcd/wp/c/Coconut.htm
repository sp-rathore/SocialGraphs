      <p>The origins of this plant are the subject of controversy with some authorities claiming it is native to southeast <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, while others claim its origin is in northwestern <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>. Fossil records from <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> indicate that small, coconut-like plants grew there as far back 15 million years ago. Even older fossils have been uncovered in <!--del_lnk--> Rajasthan and <!--del_lnk--> Maharashtra, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Regardless of its origin, the coconut has spread across much of the tropics, probably aided in many cases by sea-faring peoples. The fruit is light and buoyant and presumably spread significant distances by marine currents: fruits collected from the sea as far north as Norway have been found to be viable (subsequently germinated under the right conditions). In the <!--del_lnk--> Hawaiian Islands, the coconut is regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian introduction, first brought to the Islands by early Polynesian voyagers from their homelands in the <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">South Pacific</a>.<p>The coconut palm thrives on sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salinity. It prefers areas with abundant sunlight and regular rainfall (750 to 2,000 mm annually), which makes colonising shorelines of the tropics relatively straightforward. Coconuts also need high humidity (70&ndash;80%+) for optimum growth, which is why they are rarely seen in areas with low humidity (e.g. the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>), even where temperatures are high enough (regularly above 24&deg;C). They are very hard to establish and grow in dry climates without frequent irrigation. The only two states in the U.S. where coconut palms can be grown and reproduce outdoors without irrigation are <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii and <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The farthest north a coconut palm has been known to grow outdoors is in <!--del_lnk--> Newport Beach, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> along the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Coast Highway. In order for coconut palm to survive in <!--del_lnk--> Southern California they need sandy soil, minimal water in the winter to prevent root rot and would benefit from root heating coils.<p>The flowers of the coconut palm are <!--del_lnk--> polygamomonoecious, with both male and female flowers in the same inflorescence. Flowering occurs continuously, with female flowers producing seeds. Coconut palms are believed to be largely cross-<!--del_lnk--> pollinated, although some dwarf varieties are self-pollinating.<p><a id="Pests_and_diseases" name="Pests_and_diseases"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pests and diseases</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/b/Botany.htm" title="Botany">Botanically</a>, a coconut is a <i>simple dry <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a></i> known as a <b>fibrous <!--del_lnk--> drupe</b> (not a true <!--del_lnk--> nut). The husk (<!--del_lnk--> mesocarp) is composed of <!--del_lnk--> fibres called <i><!--del_lnk--> coir</i> and there is an inner &quot;stone&quot; (the <!--del_lnk--> endocarp). This hard endocarp (the outside of the coconut as sold in the shops of non-tropical countries) has three <!--del_lnk--> germination <!--del_lnk--> pores that are clearly visible on the outside surface once the husk is removed. It is through one of these that the <!--del_lnk--> radicle emerges when the <!--del_lnk--> embryo germinates. Adhering to the inside wall of the endocarp is the <!--del_lnk--> testa, with a thick albuminous <!--del_lnk--> endosperm (the coconut &quot;meat&quot;), the white and fleshy edible part of the seed. The endosperm surrounds a hollow interior space, filled with air and often a liquid referred to as <!--del_lnk--> coconut water, not to be confused with <!--del_lnk--> coconut milk. <!--del_lnk--> Coconut milk is made by grating the <!--del_lnk--> endocarp and mixing it with (warm) water. This produces a thick, white liquid called <!--del_lnk--> coconut milk that is used in much Asian cooking, for example, in curries. <!--del_lnk--> Coconut water from the unripe coconut, on the other hand, is drunk fresh as a refreshing drink.<p>When viewed on end, the endocarp and germination pores resemble the face of a <a href="../../wp/m/Monkey.htm" title="Monkey">monkey</a>, the <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> word for which is <i>macaco</i>, sometimes abbreviated to <i>coco</i>, hence the name of the fruit. The specific name <i>nucifera</i> is Latin for <i>nut bearing</i>.<p>When the coconut is still green, the endosperm inside is thin and tender, a favourite snack. But the main reason to pick the nut at that stage is to drink its water; a big nut contains up to one litre of refreshing drink. When the nut has ripened and the outer husk has turned brown, a couple of months later, it will fall from the tree of its own accord. At that time the endosperm has thickened and hardened, while the coconut water has become somewhat bitter.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>To open a coconut, remove the outer husk (if not purchased already removed) and pierce two of the three <i>eyes</i> of the fruit (one for the juice to come out of, one to enable air to go in); drain the <a href="../../wp/j/Juice.htm" title="Juice">juice</a> from the fruit. Since coconuts have a naturally-forming fracture point, they can be opened by taking a heavy knife, such as a meat cleaver, and striking the coconut with the flat edge of the knife. Or you can use a flat-bladed screwdriver and a hammer (which is easier, and may be safer than using a cleaver). After inserting the screwdriver slightly, twist it to crack the shell. The coconut should then be turned, and this process repeated until there is a contiguous crack in the shell around the entire fruit. Afterwards, the fruit can be separated at this fracture point.<p>When the nut is still green the husk is very hard, but green nuts rarely fall, only when they have been attacked by moulds, etc. By the time the nut naturally falls, the husk has become brown, the coir has become dryer and softer, and the nut is less likely to cause damage when it drops. Still, there have been instances of coconuts falling from trees and injuring people, and claims of some fatalities. This was the subject of a paper published in 1984 that won the <!--del_lnk--> Ig Nobel Prize in 2001. Falling coconut deaths are often used as a comparison to <a href="../../wp/s/Shark.htm" title="Shark">shark</a> attacks, making the claim that it is more likely to be killed by a falling coconut than by a shark. There is no evidence of people being killed in this manner. However William Wyatt Gill, an early <!--del_lnk--> LMS missionary on <!--del_lnk--> Mangaia recorded a story in which Kaiara, the concubine of King Tetui, was killed by a falling, green nut. The offending tree was immediately cut down. This was around 1777, the time of <!--del_lnk--> Captain Cook&#39;s visit.<p>In some parts of the world, trained <!--del_lnk--> pig-tailed macaques are used to harvest coconuts. Training schools for pig-tailed macaques still exist in southern <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a> and in the Malaysian state of Kelantan. Competitions are held each year to discover the fastest harvester.<p><a id="Uses" name="Uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uses</span></h2>

      <p>All parts of the coconut palm are useful, and the trees have a comparatively high yield (up to 75 fruits per year); it therefore has significant <!--del_lnk--> economic value. The name for the coconut palm in <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> is <i>kalpa vriksha</i>, which translates as &quot;the tree which provides all the necessities of life&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> Malay, the coconut is known as <i>pokok seribu guna</i>, &quot;the tree of a thousand uses&quot;. In the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, the coconut is commonly given the title &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tree of Life&quot;.<p>Uses of the various parts of the palm include:<p><a id="Culinary_uses" name="Culinary_uses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Culinary uses</span></h3>
      <ul>
       <li>The white, fleshy part of the seed is edible and used fresh or dried in cooking.<li>The cavity is filled with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> coconut water&quot; containing sugars, fibre, proteins, anti-oxidants, <a href="../../wp/v/Vitamin.htm" title="Vitamins">vitamins</a> and minerals, which provide excellent <!--del_lnk--> isotonic <!--del_lnk--> electrolyte balance, and an exceptional nutritional food source, which is why it is used as a refreshing drink throughout the humid tropics. It is also used in the making of the gelatinous dessert <!--del_lnk--> nata de coco. Mature fruits have significantly less liquid than young immature coconuts. Coconut water is sterile until the coconut is opened (unless the coconut is spoiled).<li><!--del_lnk--> Sport fruits are also harvested, primarily in the Philippines, where they are known as <i>macapuno</i>.<li><!--del_lnk--> Coconut milk (which is approximately 17% fat) is made by processing grated coconut with hot water or hot milk which extracts the oil and aromatic compounds from the fibre, and should not be confused with the juice found naturally in young coconuts, called coconut water or coconut juice.<li><!--del_lnk--> Coconut cream is what rises to the top when coconut milk is refrigerated and left to set.<li>The leftover fibre from coconut milk production is used as livestock feed.<li>The sap derived from incising the flower clusters of the coconut is fermented to produce palm wine, also known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> toddy&quot; or, in the Philippines, <i>tuba</i>. The sap can also be reduced by boiling to create a sweet syrup or candy.<li><!--del_lnk--> Apical buds of adult plants are edible and are known as &quot;palm-cabbage&quot; (though harvest of this kills the tree).<li>The interior of the growing tip may be harvested as <!--del_lnk--> heart-of-palm and is considered a rare delicacy. Harvesting this also kills the tree. Hearts of palm are often eaten in salads; such a salad is sometimes called &quot;millionaire&#39;s salad&quot;.<li>Newly germinated coconuts contain an edible fluff of marshmallow-like consistency called coconut sprout, produced as the endosperm nourishes the developing embryo.</ul>

      <ul>
