      <p>Little is known about C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire before the arrival of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> <!--del_lnk--> ships in the 1460s. The major <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> came relatively recently from neighbouring areas: the <!--del_lnk--> Kru people came from <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> around 1600; the <!--del_lnk--> Senoufo and <!--del_lnk--> Lobi moved southward from <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mali.htm" title="Mali">Mali</a>; in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the <!--del_lnk--> Akan people, including the <!--del_lnk--> Baoul&eacute;, migrated from <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a> into the eastern area of the country, and the <!--del_lnk--> Malink&eacute; from <a href="../../wp/g/Guinea.htm" title="Guinea">Guinea</a> into the northwest.<p><a id="French_colonial_era" name="French_colonial_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">French colonial era</span></h3>
      <p>Compared to neighbouring Ghana, C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire suffered little from the <!--del_lnk--> slave trade. European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast with better harbours. France took an interest in the 1840s, enticing local chiefs to grant French commercial traders a monopoly along the coast. Thereafter, the French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior. They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against <!--del_lnk--> Mandinka forces, mostly from Gambia. <!--del_lnk--> Guerrilla warfare by the Baoul&eacute; and other eastern groups continued until 1917.<p>France&#39;s main goal was to stimulate the production of <!--del_lnk--> exports. <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">Coffee</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Palm_oil.htm" title="Palm oil">palm oil</a> crops were soon planted along the coast. C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of &#39;settlers&#39;; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, the French and <!--del_lnk--> English were largely bureaucrats. As a result, a third of the cocoa, coffee and <a href="../../wp/b/Banana.htm" title="Banana">banana</a> <!--del_lnk--> plantations were in the hands of French citizens and a hated forced-labour system became the backbone of the <!--del_lnk--> economy.<p><a id="Independence" name="Independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Independence</span></h3>
      <p>The son of a Baoul&eacute; chief, <!--del_lnk--> F&eacute;lix Houphou&euml;t-Boigny, was to become C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire&#39;s father of independence. In 1944 he formed the country&#39;s first agricultural <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">trade union</a> for African cocoa farmers like himself. Annoyed that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphou&euml;t-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in Paris. A year later the French abolished forced labour. Houphou&euml;t-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that that the country would benefit from it, which it did, for many years. France made him the first African to become a minister in a European government.<p>In 1958, C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire became an autonomous member of the French Community (which replaced the French Union).<p>At the time of C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire&#39;s independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1960, the country was easily French West Africa&#39;s most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region&#39;s total exports. When Houphou&euml;t-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices to further stimulate production. Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire into third place in total output behind <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>. By <!--del_lnk--> 1979 the country was the world&#39;s leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa&#39;s leading exporter of <!--del_lnk--> pineapples and palm oil. French technicians contributed to the &#39;Ivoirian miracle&#39;. In the rest of Africa, Europeans were driven out following independence; but in C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire, they poured in. The French community grew from 10,000 to 50,000, most of them <!--del_lnk--> teachers and advisers. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10% - the highest of Africa&#39;s non-oil-exporting countries.<p><a id="Houphou.C3.ABt-Boigny_administration" name="Houphou.C3.ABt-Boigny_administration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Houphou&euml;t-Boigny administration</span></h3>
      <p>Politically, Houphou&euml;t-Boigny ruled with a strength that some would call an &quot;iron hand&quot; while others characterize as &quot;paternal.&quot; The press was not free and only one political party existed although some accepted this as a consequence of Houphou&euml;t-Boigny&#39;s broad appeal to the population that continually elected him. He was also criticized for his emphasis on developing large scale projects. Some felt that the millions of dollars were spent transforming his village, <a href="../../wp/y/Yamoussoukro.htm" title="Yamoussoukro">Yamoussoukro</a>, into the new capital that it became, was a waste, but others support his vision to develop a centre for peace, education and religion in the heart of the country. But by the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shockwaves through the Ivoirian economy. Thanks also to the overcutting of <!--del_lnk--> timber and collapsing <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a> prices, the country&#39;s external debt increased threefold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan.<p>In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption. The unrest forced the government to support multiparty democracy. Houphou&euml;t-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured <!--del_lnk--> Henri Konan B&eacute;di&eacute; as his successor.<p><a id="B.C3.A9di.C3.A9_administration" name="B.C3.A9di.C3.A9_administration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">B&eacute;di&eacute; administration</span></h3>
      <p>In October 1995, B&eacute;di&eacute; overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, sending several hundred opposition supporters to jail. In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt.<p>Unlike Houphou&euml;t-Boigny, who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions wide-open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedi&eacute; emphasized the concept of &quot;Ivority&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> Ivoirit&eacute;</i>) to exclude his rival <!--del_lnk--> Alassane Ouattara, having only one parent of Ivory Coast nationality, to run for future presidential election. As people originating from <a href="../../wp/b/Burkina_Faso.htm" title="Burkina Faso">Burkina Faso</a> are a large part of the Ivorian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivorian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained.<p><a name="1999_coup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1999 coup</span></h3>
      <p>Similarly, B&eacute;di&eacute; excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General <!--del_lnk--> Robert Gu&eacute;i in power. B&eacute;di&eacute; fled into exile in France. The coup had reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.<p><a id="Gbagbo_administration" name="Gbagbo_administration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gbagbo administration</span></h3>
      <p>A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which <!--del_lnk--> Laurent Gbagbo vied with Gu&eacute;i, but it was neither peaceful nor democratic. The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest. Gu&eacute;i&#39;s attempt to rig the election led to a public uprising, resulting in around 180 deaths and his swift replacement by the election&#39;s likely winner, Gbagbo. <!--del_lnk--> Alassane Ouattara was disqualified by the country&#39;s Supreme Court, due to his alleged Burkinab&eacute; nationality. The existing and later reformed constitution did not allow non-citizens to run for president. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Muslim north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.<p><a name="2002_mutiny"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2002 mutiny</span></h3>
      <p>In the early hours of <!--del_lnk--> September 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, there was an attempted assassination of the president. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities. By lunchtime the French interjected to assist the Government; it is disputed as to whether their interjection into the situation helped or hindered the situation - but by the end of the day, they had lost control of the north of the country, which is still divided from the south today. The fight for the south had also been tough. The battle for the main Gendarmerie Barracks in Abidjan lasted till mid-morning. What exactly happened that night is disputed. The government said that former president Robert Gu&eacute;i had led a coup attempt, and state tv showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims said that he and fifteen others had been murdered at his home and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy, his home burned down.<p>President Gbagbo cut short a foreign trip to Italy, and on his return said some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers live. Gendarmes and vigiliantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousand, attacking the residents.<p>An early ceasefire with the rebels, who had the backing of the northern populace, proved short-lived, and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed. France sent in troops to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sierra_Leone.htm" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.<p><a name="2003_unity_government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2003 unity government</span></h3>
      <p>In January 2003, President Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a &quot;government of national unity&quot;. Curfews were lifted and French troops cleaned up the lawless western border of the country. But the central problems remained, and neither side achieved its goals.<p>Since then, the unity government has proven extremely unstable. In March 2004, 120 people were killed in an opposition rally. A later report concluded the killings were planned.

Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan, although some (including the United Kingdom) have closed their missions because of the continuing violence and attacks on Europeans. The aforementioned population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war. International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production.<p>Since the incident on September 19, 2002 (refer to the history section), a civil war broke out, and the north part of the country has been seized by the rebels, the <i>New Forces</i> (FN). A new presidential election was expected to be held in October, 2005. However, this new election could not be held on time due to delay in preparation and has been postponed to October 2006 after an agreement was reached among the rival parties.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Maintaining close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment, has made C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African states. However, in recent years C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for their primary agricultural crops coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower and those exporting into foreign markets.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>77% of the population are considered Ivorians. They represent several different people and language groups. An estimated 65 languages are spoken in the country. One of the most common is Djoula, which acts as a trade language as well as a language commonly spoken by the Muslim population. <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, the official language, is taught in schools and serves as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca in urban areas (particularly Abidjan).<p>Since Cote d&#39;Ivoire has established itself as one of the most successful West African nations, about 20% of the population consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso and Guinea. This fact has created steadily increasing tension in recent years, especially since most of these workers are <!--del_lnk--> Muslims while the native-born population is largely <!--del_lnk--> Christian (primarily <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic) and <!--del_lnk--> animist. 4% of the population is of non-African ancestry. Many are <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> citizens, as well as Protestant missionaries of American and Canadian background. In November 2004, around 10,000 French and other foreign nationals evacuated Cote d&#39;Ivoire due to attacks from pro-government youth militias.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>In October 1985 the government requested that the country be known as <b>C&ocirc;te d&#39;Ivoire</b> in every language, without a hyphen between the two words (thereby contravening the standard rule in French that geographical names with several words must be written with hyphens).<p><a id="Usage" name="Usage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Usage</span></h3>
