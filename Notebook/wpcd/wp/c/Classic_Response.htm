<h2>Classic Response 2006</h2><p><strong>23/02/2006</strong></p>
<p>Following the tremendous success of the <a href="../../wp/c/Classic_Response_2005.htm">first 'Classic Response'</a> concert, the organisers are holding the second Classic Response concert on Easter Saturday 2006. Saturday 15 April will see a host of stars from the classical world perform at the Royal Albert Hall to support work in Africa.</p><img src="../../wp/c/Classic_Response_2.jpg" width="396" height="264" alt="classic response 2 with Aled Jones outside the Royal Albert Hall" class="centre" /><p>G4 confirmed to perform as classical stars join together to raise money for orphaned children. G4 returned from visiting Ghana in early March, where they were able to see our work with orphans affected by HIV/AIDS. See <a href="../../wp/g/G4_Classic_Response.htm">the Diary</a> and more pictures of G4's visit to SOS Ghana. Aled Jones and Myleene Klass will host Classic Response 2006 on Saturday 15 April which sees G4 added to the list of performers which also features (in alphabetical order):<br /><ul><li><p>Alex Prior</p></li><li><p>Amici Forever</p></li><li><p>Amy Nuttall</p></li><li><p>Becky Jane Taylor</p></li><li><p>Cantamus</p></li><li><p> The Choirboys</p></li><li><p>Emma Johnson</p></li><li><p>Harry Harris</p></li><li><p>Joseph McManners</p></li><li><p>Julian Lloyd Webber</p></li><li><p>Nicky Spence</p></li><li><p>Operbabes</p></li><li><p>Russell Watson</p></li></ul><p>All of these performers will be accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Owain Arwel Hughes.</p><p>Aled Jones, who visited Sri Lanka for SOS in 2005, will visit Ghana this year to make a film about SOS Children projects which will be shown on the night. SOS Ambassador, Aled Jones said &ldquo;Everything is suddenly put sharply in perspective when you see the suffering, but these children are given practical and emotional help by SOS Children. Nothing could have prepared me for visiting Sri Lanka last year, but I hope that the film we make this year will persuade even more people that sponsorship can make a huge difference to a child&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; </p><p>Over &pound;155,000 was raised by last year&rsquo;s concert, where SOS Children were able to reconstruct many family homes in Murthypudukuppam. They lost everything from houses, boats to fishing equipment in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami but SOS Children continues to support children and families in many villages in the region enabling survivors to look forward to the future once more. </p><p>The concert was launched on Wednesday 25 January 2006 with a photo call at the Royal Albert Hall with Aled Jones and the 40 strong girls&rsquo; choir Cantamus. Andrew Cates, Chief Executive of SOS Children UK was delighted by the response to last year&rsquo;s concert and hopes this years concert will be even better. &ldquo;The Classic Response audience this year will be helping SOS Children to support AIDS orphans in Africa, but we would ask people not only to enjoy the concert, but also consider sponsoring a child so that your help for these children continues for the long-term.&rdquo; </p><p>SOS Children is working in partnership with Playing Alive, to bring together a night of performers... to support SOS Children&rsquo;s work in Africa with AIDS orphans and Playing Alive&rsquo;s projects with displaced young people in Sudan. </p><p>After the <a href="../../wp/c/Classic_Response_2005.htm">first Classic Response</a> concert new homes were constructed in the Pondicherry province of southern India support families whose homes were devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. You can read more about our work in the tsunami affected region <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami_One_Year_On.htm">here</a>.</p><p>To join us next Easter at the Royal Albert Hall you can order your tickets at the Box Office 020 7589 8212 or via the website www.royalalberthall.com </p><p>IF you wish to support our ongoing work for orphans everywhere, then you could become a <a href="../../wp/s/Sponsor_A_Child.htm">sponsor</a> or regular donor.</p>
