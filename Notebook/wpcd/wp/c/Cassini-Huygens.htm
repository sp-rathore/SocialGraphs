      <p>The <i>Cassini-Huygens</i> spacecraft was launched on <!--del_lnk--> October 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1997 from <!--del_lnk--> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Launch Complex 40 using a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Air Force <!--del_lnk--> Titan IVB/<!--del_lnk--> Centaur launch vehicle. The launch vehicle was made up of a two-stage Titan IV <!--del_lnk--> booster rocket, two strap-on solid <!--del_lnk--> rocket motors, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing. The complete <i>Cassini</i> flight system was composed of the launch vehicle and the spacecraft.<p>The spacecraft is composed of the <i>Cassini</i> <!--del_lnk--> orbiter and the <i>Huygens</i> probe. The <i>Cassini</i> orbiter is planned to orbit Saturn and its moons for four years, and the plan sees the <i>Huygens</i> probe dive into the atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. <i>Cassini-Huygens</i> is an international collaboration between three space agencies. Seventeen nations contributed to building the spacecraft. The <i>Cassini</i> orbiter was built and managed by NASA/<!--del_lnk--> CalTech&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The <i>Huygens</i> probe was built by the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Space_Agency.htm" title="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Italian Space Agency provided <i>Cassini&#39;s</i> high-gain <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communication</a> <!--del_lnk--> antenna, and a revolutionary compact and light-weight multimode radar (synthetic aperture radar, radar altimeter, radiometer).<p>The total cost of the Cassini-Huygens mission is about <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>3.26 <!--del_lnk--> billion, including $1.4 billion for pre-launch development, $704 <!--del_lnk--> million for mission operations, $54 million for tracking and $422 million for the launch vehicle. The U.S. contributed $2.6 billion, the European Space Agency $500 million and the Italian Space Agency $160 million.<p>Normally spoken, Cassini mission would end in 2008, but it is quite certain that further funding will be granted.<dl>

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Cassini-Huygens&#39; origins date to 1982, when the <!--del_lnk--> European Science Foundation and the American <!--del_lnk--> National Academy of Sciences formed a <!--del_lnk--> working group to investigate future cooperative missions. Two European scientists suggested a paired Saturn Orbiter and Titan Probe as a possible joint mission. In 1983, NASA&#39;s Solar System Exploration Committee recommended the same Orbiter and Probe pair as a core NASA project. NASA and the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Space_Agency.htm" title="European Space Agency">European Space Agency</a> (ESA) performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985. ESA continued with its own study in 1986, while American astronaut <!--del_lnk--> Sally Ride, in her influential 1987 report &quot;<!--del_lnk--> NASA Leadership and America&#39;s Future in Space,&quot; also examined and approved of the Cassini mission.<p>While Ride&#39;s report described the Saturn orbiter and probe as a NASA solo mission, in 1988 the Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications of NASA Len Fisk returned to the idea of a joint NASA and ESA mission. He wrote to his counterpart at the ESA, Roger Bonnet, strongly suggesting that the ESA choose the Cassini mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that NASA would commit to the mission as soon as ESA did.<p>At the time, NASA was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the American and European space programs as a result of European perceptions that NASA had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations. NASA officials and advisors involved in promoting and planning Cassini-Huygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission. In part, this newfound spirit of cooperation with Europe was driven by a sense of competition with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, which had begun to cooperate more closely with Europe as the ESA drew further away from NASA.<p>The collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped Cassini-Huygens survive congressional budget cuts in the US. Cassini-Huygens came under fire in both 1992 and 1994, but NASA successfully persuaded the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after the ESA had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations. The project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994, although, as noted below, citizens groups concerned about its potential environmental impact attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch.<p><a id="Spacecraft_design" name="Spacecraft_design"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Spacecraft design</span></h2>

      <p>The spacecraft was originally planned to be the second three-axis stabilized, <!--del_lnk--> RTG-powered <!--del_lnk--> Mariner Mark II, a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of <!--del_lnk--> Mars. <i>Cassini</i> was being developed together with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby</i> (<i>CRAF</i>) spacecraft, but various budget cuts and rescopings of the project forced NASA to terminate <i>CRAF</i> development in order to save <i>Cassini</i>. As a result, the <i>Cassini</i> spacecraft became a more specialized design, cancelling the implementation of the Mariner Mark II series.<p>The <i>Cassini</i> spacecraft, including the orbiter and the <i>Huygens</i> probe, is the largest and most complex <!--del_lnk--> interplanetary spacecraft built to date. The orbiter alone has a mass of 2150 <!--del_lnk--> kilograms. When the 350-kilogram <i>Huygens</i> probe, launch vehicle adapter, and 3132 kilograms of propellants were loaded at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of about 5600 kilograms. Only the two <!--del_lnk--> Phobos spacecraft sent to <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a> by the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> were heavier. The <i>Cassini</i> spacecraft stood more than 6.8 <!--del_lnk--> metres (22.3 <!--del_lnk--> feet) high, and was more than 4 metres (13.1 feet) wide. The complexity of the spacecraft is necessitated both by its <!--del_lnk--> trajectory, or flight path, to Saturn, and by the ambitious program of scientific observations to be undertaken once the spacecraft reaches its destination. It functions with 1,630 interconnected <!--del_lnk--> circuits, 22,000 wire connections, and over 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) of cabling.<p>Now that <i>Cassini</i> is at Saturn, it is between 8.2 and 10.2 <!--del_lnk--> astronomical units from <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>. Because of this, it takes between 68 to 84 <!--del_lnk--> minutes for signals to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and vice versa. In practical terms, this means that ground controllers are not able to give &quot;<!--del_lnk--> real-time&quot; instructions to the spacecraft, either for day-to-day operations or in cases of unexpected in-flight events. Even if controllers respond immediately after becoming aware of a problem, nearly three <!--del_lnk--> hours will have passed before they receive a response from the spacecraft.<p><a id="Instruments" name="Instruments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Instruments</span></h3>
      <p><i>Cassini&#39;</i>s instrumentation consists of: a synthetic aperture <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">RADAR</a> mapper, a <!--del_lnk--> CCD imaging system, a visible/<!--del_lnk--> infrared mapping <!--del_lnk--> spectrometer, a composite infrared spectrometer, a <!--del_lnk--> cosmic dust analyzer, a <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> wave experiment, a plasma spectrometer, an <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> imaging spectrograph, a <!--del_lnk--> magnetospheric imaging instrument, a <!--del_lnk--> magnetometer, an <!--del_lnk--> ion/neutral <!--del_lnk--> mass spectrometer. Telemetry from the communications <!--del_lnk--> antenna as well as other special transmitters (an <!--del_lnk--> S-band transmitter and a dual-frequency <!--del_lnk--> K<sub>a</sub>-band system) will also be used to make observations of the atmospheres of Titan and Saturn and to measure the <a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">gravity</a> fields of the planet and its satellites.<dl>
       <dt><b><i>Cassini</i> Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The <i>Cassini</i> Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) is a direct sensing instrument that measures the energy and electrical charge of particles such as electrons and protons that the instrument encounters. CAPS will measure the molecules originating from Saturn&#39;s ionosphere and also determine the configuration of Saturn&#39;s magnetic field. CAPS will also investigate <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a> in these areas as well as the solar wind within Saturn&#39;s magnetosphere.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) is a direct sensing instrument that measures the size, speed, and direction of tiny dust grains near Saturn. Some of these particles are orbiting Saturn, while others may come from other solar systems. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer onboard the <i>Cassini</i> orbiter is ultimately designed to help discover more about these mysterious particles, and significantly add to the knowledge of the materials in other celestial bodies and potentially more about the origins of the universe.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) is a remote sensing instrument that measures the infrared light coming from an object (such as an atmosphere or moon surface) to learn more about its temperature and what it&#39;s made of. Throughout the Cassini-Huygens mission, CIRS will measure infrared emissions from atmospheres, rings and surfaces in the vast Saturn system to determine their composition, temperatures and thermal properties. It will map the atmosphere of Saturn in three dimensions to determine temperature and pressure profiles with altitude, gas composition, and the distribution of aerosols and clouds. This instrument will also measure thermal characteristics and the composition of satellite surfaces and rings.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) is a direct sensing instrument that analyzes charged particles (like protons and heavier ions) and neutral particles (like atoms) near Titan and Saturn to learn more about their atmospheres. INMS is intended also to measure the positive ion and neutral environments of Saturn&#39;s icy satellites and rings.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) is a remote sensing instrument that captures images in visible light, and some in infrared and ultraviolet light. The ISS has a camera that can take a broad, wide-angle picture and a camera that can record small areas in fine detail. Scientists anticipate that Cassini will be able to use ISS to return hundreds of thousands of images of Saturn and its rings and moons. ISS includes two cameras; a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC). Each uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its detector. Each CCD consists of a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12 <!--del_lnk--> &mu;m on a side. The camera&#39;s system allows for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel&mdash;to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1 &mu;m.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Dual Technique Magnetometer (MAG)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Dual Technique Magnetometer (MAG) is a direct sensing instrument that measures the strength and direction of the magnetic field around Saturn. The magnetic fields are generated partly by the intensely hot molten core at Saturn&#39;s centre. Measuring the magnetic field is one of the ways to probe the core, even though it is far too hot and deep to actually visit. MAG&#39;s goals are to develop a three-dimensional model of Saturn&#39;s magnetosphere, as well as determine the magnetic state of Titan and its atmosphere, and the icy satellites and their role in the magnetosphere of Saturn.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) is both a direct and remote sensing instrument that produces images and other data about the particles trapped in Saturn&#39;s huge magnetic field, or magnetosphere. This information will be used to study the overall configuration and dynamics of the magnetosphere and its interactions with the solar wind, Saturn&#39;s atmosphere, Titan, rings, and icy satellites.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Radio Detection and Ranging Instrument (RADAR)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Radio Detection and Ranging Instrument (<a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">RADAR</a>) is a remote active and remote passive sensing instrument that will produce maps of Titan&#39;s surface and measures the height of surface objects (like mountains and canyons) by bouncing radio signals off of Titan&#39;s surface and timing their return. Radio waves can penetrate the thick veil of haze surrounding Titan. In addition to bouncing radio waves, the RADAR instrument will listen for radio waves that Saturn or its moons may be producing.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument (RPWS) is a direct and remote sensing instrument that receives and measures the radio signals coming from Saturn, including the radio waves given off by the interaction of the solar wind with Saturn and Titan. The major functions of the RPWS are to measure the electric and magnetic wave fields in the interplanetary medium and planetary magnetospheres. The instrument will also determine the electron density and temperature near Titan and in some regions of Saturn&#39;s magnetosphere. RPWS studies the configuration of Saturn&#39;s magnetic field and its relationship to Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR), as well as monitoring and mapping Saturn&#39;s ionosphere, plasma, and lightning from Saturn&#39;s (and possibly Titan&#39;s) atmosphere.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Radio Science Subsystem (RSS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) is a remote sensing instrument that uses radio antennas on Earth to observe the way radio signals from the spacecraft change as they are sent through objects, such as Titan&#39;s atmosphere or Saturn&#39;s rings, or even behind the sun. The RSS also studies the compositions, pressures and temperatures of atmospheres and ionospheres, radial structure and particle size distribution within rings, body and system masses and gravitational waves. The instrument uses the spacecraft X-band communication link as well as S-band downlink and K<sub>a</sub>-band uplink and downlink.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) is a remote sensing instrument that captures images of the ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, to learn more about their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190 nm, this instrument is also a valuable tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. This sensitive instrument is different from other types of spectrometers because it can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 60 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Additionally, it is capable of taking so many images that it can create movies to show the ways in which this material is moved around by other forces.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt><b>Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS)</b>&nbsp;<dd>The Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) is a remote sensing instrument that is actually made up of two cameras in one: one is used to measure visible wavelengths, the other infrared. VIMS captures images using visible and infrared light to learn more about the composition of moon surfaces, the rings, and the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. VIMS also observes the sunlight and starlight that passes through the rings to learn more about ring structure. VIMS is designed to measure reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres, rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100 nm. It will also help determine the compositions, temperatures and structures of these objects. With VIMS, scientists also plan to perform long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the Saturn system, to determine the planet&#39;s weather patterns.</dl>

The PSE includes the electronics necessary to track the probe, to recover the data gathered during its descent, and to process and deliver the data to the orbiter, from which it was transmitted or &quot;downlinked&quot; to Earth. The Probe Data Relay Subsystem (PDRS) for the radio link between Huygens and Cassini to transmit the scientific data collected during the descent on Titan, and the Command Data Management Subsystem (CDMS), that will automatically manage the entire mission of the probe that cannot be telecommanded because of the distance from Earth, were provided by the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Space Agency (<!--del_lnk--> ASI).<p><a id="Important_events_and_discoveries" name="Important_events_and_discoveries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Important events and discoveries</span></h2>

      <p><i>Cassini</i> made its closest approach to <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter on <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2000, and performed many scientific measurements. About 26,000 images were taken of Jupiter during the course of the months-long flyby. The most detailed global colour portrait of Jupiter ever was produced (see image at right), in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km (40 miles) across.<p>A major finding of the Jupiter flyby, announced on <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, was of the nature of Jupiter&#39;s atmospheric circulation. Dark &quot;belts&quot; alternate with light &quot;zones&quot; in the atmosphere. Scientists had long considered the zones, with their pale clouds, to be areas of upwelling air, partly because many clouds on Earth form where air is rising. Analysis of Cassini imagery, however, told a new story. Individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds, too small to see from Earth, pop up almost without exception in the dark belts. According to <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Del Genio of <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Goddard Institute for Space Studies, &quot;We have a clear picture emerging that the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on Jupiter, with the implication that the net motion in the zones has to be sinking.&quot;<p>Other atmospheric observations made included a swirling dark oval of high-atmosphere haze, about the size of the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Red_Spot.htm" title="Great Red Spot">Great Red Spot</a>, near Jupiter&#39;s north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions.<p>The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings revealed the particles were irregularly shaped (as opposed to being spherical) and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter&#39;s moons, probably <!--del_lnk--> Metis and <!--del_lnk--> Adrastea.<p><a id="Test_of_Einstein.27s_theory_of_general_relativity" name="Test_of_Einstein.27s_theory_of_general_relativity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Test of Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the Cassini science team announced the results of a test of <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein&#39;s</a> theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, using radio signals from the <i>Cassini</i> probe. The researchers observed a <!--del_lnk--> frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft, as those signals traveled close to the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. According to the theory of general relativity, a massive object like the Sun causes space-time to curve, and a beam of radio waves (or light) that passes by the Sun has to travel further because of the curvature. The extra distance that the radio waves travel from <i>Cassini</i> past the Sun to the Earth delays their arrival; the amount of the delay provides a sensitive test of the predictions of Einstein&#39;s theory. Although deviations from general relativity are expected in some cosmological models, none were found in this experiment. Past tests were in agreement with the theoretical predictions with an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The <i>Cassini</i> experiment improved this to about 20 parts in a million, with the data still supporting Einstein&#39;s theory.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <i>Cassini</i> flew by the moon <!--del_lnk--> Phoebe. This was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon since the <i><!--del_lnk--> Voyager 2</i> flyby. It also was <i>Cassini&#39;</i>s only possible flyby for Phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around Saturn.<p>First close up images were received on <!--del_lnk--> June 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of Phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft. Parts of the heavily cratered surfaces look very bright in those pictures, and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface.<p><a id="Saturn_rotation" name="Saturn_rotation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Saturn rotation</span></h3>
      <p>In an announcement on <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 <i>Cassini</i> scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of Saturn. Since there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. These new data agree with the latest values measured from Earth, and constitute a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period has changed since it was first measured in <!--del_lnk--> 1980 by <i>Voyager</i>, and that it is now 6 minutes longer. This doesn&#39;t indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet, but is thought to be due to movement of the source of the radio emissions to a different latitude, at which the rotation rate is different.<p><a id="Orbiting_Saturn" name="Orbiting_Saturn"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Orbiting Saturn</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the spacecraft flew through the gap between the <!--del_lnk--> F and G rings and achieved <!--del_lnk--> orbit, after a seven year voyage. It is the first spacecraft to ever orbit Saturn.<p>The Saturn Orbital Insertion (SOI) maneuver performed by <i>Cassini</i> was notably complex, requiring the craft to orient its High-Gain Antenna away from Earth and along its flight path, in order to shield its instruments from particles in Saturn&#39;s rings. Once the craft crossed the ring plane, it then had to rotate again so that its engine was pointed along its flight path, and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft and allow Saturn to capture it. <i>Cassini</i> was captured by Saturn&#39;s gravity at around 8:54 p.m. <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Daylight Time on <!--del_lnk--> June 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2004. During the maneuver <i>Cassini</i> passed within 20,000 km (13,000 miles) of Saturn&#39;s cloud tops.<p><a id="Titan_flybys" name="Titan_flybys"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Titan flybys</span></h3>

      <p><i>Cassini</i> had its first distant flyby of <!--del_lnk--> Saturn&#39;s largest moon, <!--del_lnk--> Titan, on <!--del_lnk--> July 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, only a day after orbit insertion, when it approached to within 339,000 kilometers (211,000 miles) of Titan and provided the best look at the moon&#39;s surface to date. Images taken through special filters (able to see through the moon&#39;s global haze) showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of <!--del_lnk--> methane and surface features with widely differing brightness. On <!--del_lnk--> October 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of Titan when it flew a mere 1,200 kilometers above the moon. Almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to Earth, including the first <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a> images of the moon&#39;s haze-enshrouded surface. Radar imagery observed no conclusive evidence of lakes of liquid <!--del_lnk--> hydrocarbons, though it did not dismiss the possibility such lakes could exist. It also revealed the surface of Titan (at least the area covered by radar) to be relatively level, with topography reaching no more than about 50 meters in altitude. The flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage. Images with up to 100 times higher resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent Titan flybys.<p><a id="Huygens_encounter_with_Titan" name="Huygens_encounter_with_Titan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Huygens</i> encounter with Titan</span></h3>

Other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as being its main constituent. Cassini also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of Enceladus giving more credibility to the idea that Enceladus is supplying the particles of Saturn&#39;s E ring. Mission scientists hypothesize that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions, making Enceladus one of the few bodies in our solar system to have liquid water present.<p><a id="Radio_occultations_of_Saturn.27s_rings" name="Radio_occultations_of_Saturn.27s_rings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Radio occultations of Saturn&#39;s rings</span></h3>
      <p>In May 2005, Cassini began a series of <!--del_lnk--> occultation experiments, designed to measure the size-distribution of particles in <!--del_lnk--> Saturn&#39;s rings, and to measure the atmosphere of Saturn itself. For over 4 months, Cassini will complete orbits specifically designed for this purpose. During these occultation experiments, Cassini will fly behind the ring plane of Saturn, as seen from Earth, and transmit radio waves through the particles. The radio signals are received on Earth, where the frequency, phase, and power of the signal is analyzed to help determine the structure of the rings.<p><a id="Lakes_of_Titan" name="Lakes_of_Titan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lakes of Titan</span></h3>
