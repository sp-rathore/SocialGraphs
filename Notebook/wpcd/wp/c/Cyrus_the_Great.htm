      <p>Cyrus the Great was the son of the Persian king <!--del_lnk--> Cambyses I and a Mede princess from the Achaemenid dynasty, which ruled the kingdom of Anshan, in what is now southwestern <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. The dynasty had been founded by <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenes (ca. <!--del_lnk--> 700 BC), who was succeeded by his son <!--del_lnk--> Teispes of Anshan. Inscriptions indicate that when the latter died, two of his sons shared the throne as <!--del_lnk--> Cyrus I of Anshan and <!--del_lnk--> Ariaramnes of Persia. They were succeeded by their respective sons Cambyses I of Anshan and <!--del_lnk--> Arsames of Persia. However, the authenticity of these inscriptions has been called into question, thus blurring the history of Cyrus&#39; predecessors.<p>Cambyses is considered by <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and Ctesias to be of humble origin, but they further note his marriage to Princess <!--del_lnk--> Mandane of Media, who was the daughter of Princess <!--del_lnk--> Aryenis of Lydia and <!--del_lnk--> Astyages, king of the Medes. From their union, Mandane bore only one son, Cyrus II, better known today as Cyrus the Great, whom Cambyses named after the child&#39;s grandfather.<p>According to Ctesias, Cyrus the Great married a daughter of Astyages, which seems unlikely, as his wife would also be his aunt. A possible explanation is that Astyages married again, and his second wife bore him this daughter. Cyrus&#39; first wife, <!--del_lnk--> Cassandane, is equally obscure. According to Herodotus and the Behistun Inscription, she bore Cyrus at least two sons, <!--del_lnk--> Cambyses II and <!--del_lnk--> Smerdis. Both sons later separately ruled Persia for a short period of time. Cyrus also had several daughters, of which two would marry Darius the Great, <!--del_lnk--> Artystone and <!--del_lnk--> Atossa. The latter is significant, as she gave birth to of <!--del_lnk--> Xerxes I, Darius&#39; successor.<p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>

      <p>Cyrus was born in either 576 BC or 590 BC. Little is known of his early years, as the sources detailing that part of his life are few, and have been damaged or lost.<p>Herodotus&#39;s story of Cyrus&#39; early life belongs to a genre of legends in which abandoned children of <!--del_lnk--> noble birth, such as <!--del_lnk--> Oedipus and <!--del_lnk--> Romulus and Remus, return to claim their royal positions. His overlord was his own grandfather, <!--del_lnk--> Astyages, ruler of the powerful Median kingdom.<p>After the birth of Cyrus, Astyages had a dream that his <!--del_lnk--> Magi interpreted as a sign that his grandson would eventually overthrow him. He then ordered his steward <!--del_lnk--> Harpagus to kill the infant. Harpagus, morally unable to kill a newborn, summoned a herdsman of the king named <!--del_lnk--> Mithridates and ordered him to dispose of the child. Luckily for the young boy, the herdsman took him in and raised him as his own.<p>When Cyrus was ten years old, Herodotus claims that it was obvious that Cyrus was not a herdsman&#39;s son, stating that his behaviour was too noble. Astyages interviewed the boy and noticed that they resembled each other. Astyages ordered Harpagus to explain what he had done with the baby, and after confessing that he had not killed the boy, the king forced him to eat his own son. Astyages was more lenient with Cyrus, and allowed him to return to his biological parents, Cambyses and Mandane. While Herodotus&#39; description may be a legend, it does give insight into the figures surrounding Cyrus the Great&#39;s early life.<p><a id="Rise_and_military_campaigns" name="Rise_and_military_campaigns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise and military campaigns</span></h2>

      <p>The exact dates of the Lydian conquest are unknown, but it is generally suggested to have begun in 547 BC. The Lydians first attacked the Achaemenid Empire&#39;s city of <!--del_lnk--> Pteria in <!--del_lnk--> Cappadocia. Croesus laid siege to the city, and captured its inhabitants as slaves. Meanwhile, The Persians invited the citizens of <!--del_lnk--> Ionia, who were part of the Lydian kingdom, to revolt against their ruler. The offer was rebuffed, and thus Cyrus levied an army and marched against the Lydians, increasing his numbers while passing through nations in his way. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Pteria was effectively a stalemate, with both sides suffering heavy casualties by nightfall. Croesus retreated to Sardis the following morning.<p>While in Sardis, Croesus sent out requests for his allies to send aid to Lydia. However, near the end of winter, before the allies could unite, Cyrus pushed the war into Lydian territory and besieged Croesus in his capital, <!--del_lnk--> Sardis. Shortly before the final battle between the two rulers, Harpagus advised Cyrus to place his <!--del_lnk--> dromedaries in front of his warriors; the Lydian horses, not used to the dromedaries&#39; smell, would be very afraid. The strategy worked; the Lydian cavalry was routed. Cyrus defeated and captured Croesus. Cyrus occupied the capital at Sardis, conquering the Lydian kingdom in 546 BC. According to Herodotus, Cyrus spared Croesus&#39; life and kept him as an advisor, but this account conflicts with some translations of the contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Nabonidus Chronicle, which interpret that the king of Lydia was slain.<p>Before returning to the capital, a Lydian named Pactyes was entrusted by Cyrus to send Croesus&#39; treasury to Persia. However, soon after Cyrus&#39; departure, Pactyes hired mercenaries and caused an uprising in Sardis, revolting against the Persian <!--del_lnk--> satrap of Lydia, Tabalus. With recommendations from Croesus that he should turn the minds of the Lydian people to luxury, Cyrus sent <!--del_lnk--> Mazares, one of his commanders, to subdue the insurrection, but demanded that Pactyas be returned alive. Upon Mazares&#39; arrival, Pactyas fled to <!--del_lnk--> Ionia, where he had hired mercenaries. Mazares marched his troops into the <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> country and captured the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Magnesia and <!--del_lnk--> Priene, where Pactyas was captured and sent back to Persia for punishment.<p>Mazares continued the conquest of Asia Minor, but died of unknown causes during his campaign in Ionia. Cyrus sent Harpagus to complete Mazares&#39; conquest of Asia Minor. Harpagus captured <!--del_lnk--> Lycia, <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia and <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicia, using the technique of building <!--del_lnk--> earthworks to breach the walls of besieged cities, a method unknown to the Greeks. He ended his conquest of the area in 542 BC, and returned to Persia.<p><a id="Babylonia" name="Babylonia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Babylonia</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 539 BC, towards the end of September, Cyrus&#39; armies, under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Gubaru, the governor of <!--del_lnk--> Gutium, attacked <!--del_lnk--> Opis on the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> river and defeated the Babylonians after a minor uprising. With Opis subjugated, the Persians took control of the vast <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> system of Babylonia.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 10, the city of <!--del_lnk--> Sippar was seized without a battle, with little to no resistance from the populace. It is probable that Cyrus engaged in negotiations with the Babylonian generals to obtain a compromise on their part and therefore avoid an armed confrontation. Nabonidus was staying in the city at the time, and soon fled to the capital, Babylon, which he had not visited in years.<p>Two days later, on <!--del_lnk--> October 12, Gubaru&#39;s troops entered Babylon, again without any resistance from the Babylonian armies. Herodotus explains that to accomplish this feat, the Persians diverted the <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> river into a canal so that the water level dropped &quot;to the height of the middle of a man&#39;s thigh,&quot; which allowed the invading forces to march directly through the river bed to enter at night. On <!--del_lnk--> October 29, Cyrus himself entered the city of Babylon and arrested Nabonidus. He then assumed the titles of &quot;king of Babylon, king of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumer</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Akkad, king of the four sides of the world.&quot;<p>Prior to Cyrus&#39; invasion of Babylon, the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian Empire had conquered many kingdoms. In addition to Babylonia itself, Cyrus incorporated its subnational entities into his Empire, including <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Palestine.<p>Before leaving Babylon, Cyrus also freed the <!--del_lnk--> Israelites by allowing them to return to their native land, effectively ending the <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian captivity. The return of the exiles reinforced the Jewish population in their homeland, which had been waning since the start of the Babylonian rule.<p>According to the <a href="../../wp/b/Behistun_Inscription.htm" title="Behistun Inscription">Behistun Inscription</a> of Darius the Great, Cyrus&#39; dominions must have comprised the largest empire the world had ever seen. At the end of Cyrus&#39; rule, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from <!--del_lnk--> Asia Minor and <!--del_lnk--> Judah in the west to the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus River</a> in the east.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Ctesias reports only that Cyrus met his death while warring against tribes north-east of the headwaters of the Tigris. In Herodotus&#39; account, Cyrus met his fate in a fierce battle with the <!--del_lnk--> Massagetae, a tribe from the southern deserts of <!--del_lnk--> Kharesm and <!--del_lnk--> Kizilhoum in the southernmost portion of the <!--del_lnk--> steppe region, after ignoring advice from his advisor, Croesus, to not continue forward. The Massagetae were related to the <!--del_lnk--> Scythians in their dress and mode of living; they fought on horseback and on foot.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The queen of the Massagetae, <!--del_lnk--> Tomyris, who had assumed control after Cyrus had defeated Tomyris&#39; son Spargapises, led the attack. The Persian forces suffered heavy casualties, including Cyrus himself. After the battle, Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus to be found, and then dipped his head in blood (or ordered his head to put into a wine-skin filled with human blood) to avenge the death of her son at his hands.<p>Cyrus was buried in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Pasargadae, where his tomb remains today. Both <!--del_lnk--> Strabo and <!--del_lnk--> Arrian give descriptions of his tomb, based on eyewitness reports from the time of Alexander the Great&#39;s invasion. Though the city itself is now in ruins, the burial place of Cyrus the Great has remained largely intact; and the tomb has been partially restored to counter its natural deterioration over the years. According to Plutarch, his epitaph said,<dl>
       <dd>&quot;O man, whoever you are and wherever you come from, for I know you will come, I am Cyrus who won the Persians their empire. Do not therefore grudge me this little earth that covers my body.&quot;</dl>
      <p>Cuneiform evidence from Babylon (letters dated to regnal years) prove that Cyrus was dead in December 530 BCE, and that his son <!--del_lnk--> Cambyses II was king. His younger son, Smerdis, died before Cambyses left to invade the eastern front. From Herodotus&#39; account, Cambyses killed his brother to avoid a rebellion in his absence. Cambyses continued his father&#39;s policy of expansion, and managed to capture <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Egypt</a> for the Empire, but soon died, after only seven years of rule. An imposter named <!--del_lnk--> Gaumata, claiming to be Smerdis, became the sole ruler of Persia for seven months, until he was killed by Darius the Great, the grandson of Arsames, who ruled Persia before Cyrus&#39; rise.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

      <p>Cyrus was distinguished equally as a <!--del_lnk--> statesman and as a soldier. By pursuing a policy of generosity instead of repression, and by favoring local religions, he was able to make his newly conquered subjects into enthusiastic supporters.

      <p>During his reign, Cyrus maintained control over a vast region of kingdoms, but it is not clear how. The organizing of the empire into provinces called <!--del_lnk--> satrapies, ruled by provincial admnistrators, <!--del_lnk--> vassal kings called <i>satraps</i>, dates to the reign of Darius. Cyrus demanded only <!--del_lnk--> tribute and <!--del_lnk--> conscripts from many parts of the realm.<p>Cyrus&#39; conquests continued the process, started by the Assyrians and continued by the Babylonians, of empire building where a large <!--del_lnk--> superstate, comprising many dozens of countries, races, and languages, were ruled under a single administration headed by a central government. This system of <!--del_lnk--> satrapies lasted for centuries, and was retained both by the Greek <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid dynasty during their control of Iran and later by the Persian <!--del_lnk--> Parthians and <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">Sassanids</a>.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Cyropaedia</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Xenophon, a novel about the Great King&#39;s life, forms a treatise on politics, much read through the Renaissance, and indeed through the eighteenth century. The book influenced Sir <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Browne, who named his <!--del_lnk--> hermetic 1658 discourse, entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Garden of Cyrus</i>, after the ruler. With its abundant use of <!--del_lnk--> metaphors, Browne characterizes many ancients as &quot;vegetables&quot;, with Cyrus as &quot;the splendid and regular planter&quot;.<p>Even today, Cyrus is still cited as an important figure. Much of this is due to the policy of <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who boasted that the Iranian monarchy was 2,500 years old, and used Cyrus as some sort of secular model on which he could base his rule. In 1992, he was ranked #87 on <!--del_lnk--> Michael H. Hart&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> list of the most influential figures in history. On <!--del_lnk--> December 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, in her acceptance of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Shirin Ebadi evoked Cyrus, saying:<dl>
       <dd><i>I am an Iranian, a descendant of Cyrus the Great. This emperor proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that he &#39;would not reign over the people if they did not wish it.&#39; He promised not to force any person to change his religion and faith and guaranteed freedom for all. The Charter of Cyrus the Great should be studied in the history of human rights.</i></dl>

      <p>Upon taking Babylon, Cyrus issued a declaration inscribed on a clay barrel, known today as the Cyrus Cylinder. It recounts his victories and merciful acts, and documents his royal lineage. It was discovered in 1879 in Babylon, and today is kept in the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum.<p>While the cylinder reflects a long tradition in <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> where, as early as the <!--del_lnk--> third millennium BC, kings such as <!--del_lnk--> Urukagina began their reigns with declarations of reforms, the Cyrus Cylinder has been referred to as the &quot;first charter of <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a>&quot;; though such a concept would have been alien to Cyrus and his contemporaries.  The cylinder decrees the normal themes of Persian rule: respect for the gods of all peoples, just and peaceful rule, and the power and glory of the empire.<table class="wikitable" style="margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both; font-size:95%;">
