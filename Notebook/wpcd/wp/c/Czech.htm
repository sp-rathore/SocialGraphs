<h2>SOS Children in Czech Republic</h2>
<img src="../../wp/m/Map_czech_republic_en_HR1.jpg" width="500" height="346" alt="SOS Children sponsorship locations in the Czech Republic" class="left" /><p>The Czech Republic came into being in 1993 (along with Slovakia) following the dissolution of the former state of Czechoslovakia. It has two main regions, Bohemia in the west and Moravia in the east. Prague, the capital city, is considered one of the most important cultural centres in Europe and is a major tourist centre. Today, the Czech Republic is one of the most successful of the former communist countries, along with Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. </p><p>The charity began working in the former Czechoslovakia in the 1960s when the first community opened in Doubi, a suburb of the spa town of Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad). This was followed by the SOS Children Chvalcov in Moravia which opened in 1973. In 1974 the state took over the management and administration of both villages and it wasn't until 1989 when the Communist government was overthrown that they were returned to SOS Children and a renovation programme began. </p><p>The SOS Children community in Doubi is about 10 km from the centre of Karlovy Vary. It has twelve family houses and there are two youth houses for the older children in Karolovy Vary where they can take their first guided steps towards independence while they finish their studies or vocational training. </p><p>SOS Children Chvalcov is 90 km northeast of Brno, near the towns of Bystrice and Kromeriz. Like Doubi, children attend local schools. The charity built a third village was built in Medlanky, near Brno, in June 2002 which has nine family houses and a youth house.</p><h3>Local Contact</h3>
