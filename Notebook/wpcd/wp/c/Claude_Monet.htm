      <p>Monet was born to Adolphe and Louise-Justine Monet, both of them second-generation Parisians, of 90 Rue Laffitte, in the 9th arrondissement of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, but his family moved in 1845 to <!--del_lnk--> Le Havre in <!--del_lnk--> Normandy when he was five. He was christened as Oscar-Claude at the church of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. His father wanted him to go into the family (grocery store) business, but Claude Monet wanted to become an artist. His mother was a singer.<p>On the first of April 1851 Monet entered the Le Havre secondary school. He first became known locally for his charcoal caricatures, which he would sell for ten to twenty <!--del_lnk--> francs. Monet also undertook his first drawing lessons from Jacques-Francois Ochard, a former student of Jacques-Louis David (1748 - 1825). On the beaches of Normandy in about 1856/1857, he met fellow artist <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Boudin, who became his mentor and taught him to use oil paints. Boudin taught Monet <i><!--del_lnk--> en plein air</i> (outdoor) techniques for painting.<p>On 28 January, 1857 his mother died. Now 16 years old, he left school and his widowed, childless aunt Marie-Jeanne took him into her home.<p><a id="Paris" name="Paris"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Paris</span></h2>
      <p>When Monet travelled to Paris to visit <!--del_lnk--> The Louvre, he witnessed painters copying from the old masters. Monet, having brought his paints and other tools with him, would instead go and sit by a window and paint what he saw. Monet was in Paris for several years and met several friends who were painters. They all painted in the <a href="../../wp/i/Impressionism.htm" title="Impressionism">impressionism</a> style. One of those friends was <a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589douard_Manet.htm" title="&Eacute;douard Manet">&Eacute;douard Manet</a>.<p>In June of 1861 Monet joined the First Regiment of African Light Cavalry in <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a> for two years of a seven-year commitment, but upon his contracting typhoid his aunt Madame Lecadre intervened to get him out of the army if he agreed to complete an art course at a university. It is possible that the Dutch painter <!--del_lnk--> Johan Barthold Jongkind, whom Monet knew, may have prompted his aunt on this matter. Disillusioned with the traditional art taught at universities, in <!--del_lnk--> 1862 Monet was a student of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Gleyre in Paris, where he met <!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Auguste Renoir, <!--del_lnk--> Frederic Bazille, and <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Sisley. Together they shared new approaches to art, painting the effects of light <!--del_lnk--> en plein air with broken colour and rapid brushstrokes, in what later came to be known as <a href="../../wp/i/Impressionism.htm" title="Impressionism">Impressionism</a>.<p>Monet&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1866 <i>Camille</i> or <i>The Woman in the Green Dress</i> (<i>La Femme &agrave; la Robe Verte</i>), which brought him recognition, was one of many works featuring his future wife, <!--del_lnk--> Camille Doncieux. Shortly thereafter Doncieux became pregnant and bore their first child, Jean. In 1868, Monet attempted suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.<p><a id="Franco-Prussian_War" name="Franco-Prussian_War"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Franco-Prussian War</span></h2>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War (<!--del_lnk--> 1870&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1871), Monet took refuge in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> to avoid the conflict. While there he studied the works of <a href="../../wp/j/John_Constable.htm" title="John Constable">John Constable</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Mallord William Turner, both of whose landscapes would serve to inspire Monet&#39;s innovations in the study of colour.<p>From 1871 to 1878 Monet lived at <!--del_lnk--> Argenteuil, a village on the Seine near Paris, and here were painted some of his best known works.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Upon returning to France, in <!--del_lnk--> 1872 (or <!--del_lnk--> 1873) he painted <i><!--del_lnk--> Impression, Sunrise (Impression: soleil levant)</i> depicting a <!--del_lnk--> Le Havre landscape. It hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in <!--del_lnk--> 1874 and is now displayed in the <!--del_lnk--> Mus&eacute;e Marmottan-Monet, Paris. From the painting&#39;s title, art critic Louis Leroy coined the term &quot;Impressionism&quot;, which he intended to be derogatory.<p><a id="Later_life" name="Later_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later life</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1870, Monet and Doncieux married and in <!--del_lnk--> 1873 moved into a house in <!--del_lnk--> Argenteuil near the <!--del_lnk--> Seine River. They had another son, Michel, on <!--del_lnk--> March 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1878. Madame Monet died of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1879.<p><!--del_lnk--> Alice Hosched&eacute; decided to help Monet by bringing up his two children together with her own. They lived in <!--del_lnk--> Poissy. In April <!--del_lnk--> 1883 they moved to a house in <!--del_lnk--> Giverny, <!--del_lnk--> Eure, in <!--del_lnk--> Haute-Normandie, where he planted a large garden which he painted for the rest of his life. Monet and Alice Hosched&eacute; married in <!--del_lnk--> 1892.<p>In the 1880s and 1890s, Monet began &quot;series&quot; painting: paintings of one subject in varying light and weather conditions. His first series was of <!--del_lnk--> Rouen Cathedral from different points of view and at different times of the day. Twenty views of the cathedral were exhibited at the <!--del_lnk--> Durand-Ruel in <!--del_lnk--> 1895. He also painted a series of paintings of <!--del_lnk--> haystacks at different times of day.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Monet was exceptionally fond of painting controlled nature: his own garden in Giverny, with its <!--del_lnk--> water lilies, pond, and bridge. He also painted up and down the banks of the Seine.<p>Between <!--del_lnk--> 1883 and <!--del_lnk--> 1908, Monet traveled to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, where he painted landmarks, landscapes, and seascapes, such as <i>Bordighera</i>. He painted an important series of paintings in <!--del_lnk--> Venice, Italy, and in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> he painted two important series - views of <!--del_lnk--> Parliament and views of Charing Cross Bridge. His wife Alice died in <!--del_lnk--> 1911 and his son Jean died in <!--del_lnk--> 1914. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> Monet painted a series of <!--del_lnk--> Weeping Willow trees as homage to the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> fallen soldiers. <!--del_lnk--> Cataracts formed on Monet&#39;s eyes, for which he underwent two surgeries in <!--del_lnk--> 1923. It is interesting to note that the paintings done while the cataracts affected his vision have a general reddish tone, which is characteristic of the vision of cataract victims. It may also be that after surgery he was able to see certain <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> wavelengths of light that are normally excluded by the lens of the eye <!--del_lnk--> ; this may have had an effect on the colors he perceived. After his operations he even repainted some of these paintings.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Monet died <!--del_lnk--> December 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1926 at the age of 86 and is buried in the <!--del_lnk--> Giverny church cemetery. His famous home and garden with its waterlily pond and bridge at Giverny are a popular drawcard for tourists. In the house there are many examples of Japanese woodcut prints on the walls.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <i><a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, the Parliament, Effects of Sun in the Fog (Le Parlement, Effet de Brouillard)</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1904), sold for over <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">U.S. $</a>20 million. Interestingly, in 2006, the journal <!--del_lnk--> Proceedings of the Royal Society A published a paper providing evidence that these were painted in situ at <!--del_lnk--> St Thomas&#39; Hospital over the river <!--del_lnk--> Thames.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet&quot;</div>
