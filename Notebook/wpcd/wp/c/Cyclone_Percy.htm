      <p><b>Cyclone Percy</b> was the seventh named storm of the 2004-05 South Pacific cyclone season (which is the part of the <!--del_lnk--> 2004-05 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season) and the fourth and final cyclone to form during the <!--del_lnk--> February 2005 outbreak in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>.<p>Percy was also the most damaging of the February cyclones as it battered the <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>, which were still recovering from the impacts of Cyclones Meena, Nancy and <!--del_lnk--> Olaf. Percy then devastated the island of <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, leaving many homeless and millions in dollars in property damages (although exact damage figures are unavailable). Because of warnings in anticipation of the storm, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries.<p>

      </div>
      <p>A discernible area of low pressure formed east of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuvalu.htm" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a> on <!--del_lnk--> February 23. The area of low pressure moved eastward, where it strengthened into Tropical Depression 10F a day later. Since the depression was located in an area of low <!--del_lnk--> wind shear and warm water temperatures, it was able to quickly strengthen into Tropical Storm Percy. At this point in time, Percy was located 120 miles east of <a href="../../wp/t/Tuvalu.htm" title="Tuvalu">Fongafale, Tuvalu</a>, and was moving towards the east-southeast at 14 <!--del_lnk--> kt (16 <!--del_lnk--> mph, 26 <!--del_lnk--> km/h). On <!--del_lnk--> February 26, Percy reached <!--del_lnk--> Category 1 status, while located 400 miles (644 km) north of <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a>. While Percy moved east-southeast, a shortwave trough developed southwest of the storm. The trough caused the cyclone to intensify even further to a Category 3 storm as it passed between <!--del_lnk--> Fakaofa and <!--del_lnk--> Swains Island. Percy then reached Category 4 status north of <!--del_lnk--> Pago Pago as it winds reached over 135 mph (115 kt, 213 km/h) and the <!--del_lnk--> barometric pressure at its centre fell to 925 millibars. on <!--del_lnk--> February 27, Cyclone Percy encountered a high pressure ridge which slowed its forward speed. Because of this, the cyclone&#39;s structure became elliptical, which caused the cyclone to weaken back to Category 3 status.  By <!--del_lnk--> February 28, Percy bypassed the Pukapuka and Nassau Islands as a Category 3 cyclone as it continued to move east-southeast.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>By then, the cyclone was re-organizing as the storm steered to the southeast. On <!--del_lnk--> March 2, Percy reached its second peak intensity. Its winds reached 160 mph (140 kt, 265 km/h) on the <!--del_lnk--> Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and an estimated barometric pressure of 900 millibars. Cyclone Percy maintained Category 5 status for 18 hours, while located 110 mi (177 km) west of <!--del_lnk--> Palmerston Island. After reaching Category 5 status, Percy began to weaken, due to increasing <!--del_lnk--> wind shear. During its weakening phase, Cyclone Percy passed south of Tropical Depression 20S. Pulled by an upper level trough, Percy swung to the east, passing Tropical Depression 24S in the process, before being caught up by another trough. By <!--del_lnk--> March 4, the centre of Percy became detached from the main area of convection and Percy quickly weakened to a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Percy then quickly accelerated to 20 kt (23 mph, 37 km/h) as it became an <!--del_lnk--> extratropical storm. <p>Percy briefly entered the <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> area of responsibility before becoming <!--del_lnk--> extratropical at 1200 UTC. By <!--del_lnk--> March 5, the remnants of Percy finally dissipated 700 mi (1127 km) southwest of <!--del_lnk--> Rarotonga. <div style="clear: both">

      <p><a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>
      <p>When Percy quickly reached <!--del_lnk--> cyclone strength, forecasters began to issue watches and warnings for the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> areas, which were impacted by earlier storms Nancy and Olaf.  As Percy continued to move eastward, forecasters predicted the storm to strengthen into a Category 2 or Category 3 storm within 12-24 hours. meanwhile, forecasters issued gale warnings for <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>.  On <!--del_lnk--> February 26, forecasters predicted Percy would stay on its current track and miss the island of <!--del_lnk--> Atafu by 50-70 miles (80-113 km), even though the storm could bring damaging gale force winds and heavy rains to the island. However, forecasters predicted Percy would make landfall on <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>. In <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a>, hurricane warnings were issued for <!--del_lnk--> Swains Island, while the rest of American Samoa remained under a hurricane watch.  Later, the gale warnings for <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> were changed to hurricane warnings as Percy moved to within 75 miles (121 km) north of <!--del_lnk--> Atafu. In <!--del_lnk--> Nukunou and <!--del_lnk--> Fakaofo, forecasters predicted that the cyclone would bring 60-70 mph (95-111 km/h) winds, heavy rains and possible flooding in low lying areas. <p>Forecasters predicted that Cyclone Percy was going to turn to the southeast and hit the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Pukapuka and <!--del_lnk--> Nassau directly. Because of this, evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in <!--del_lnk--> Rarotonga. Forecasters also predicted that Percy was going to cause a strong <!--del_lnk--> storm surge. The <!--del_lnk--> Joint Typhoon Warning Centre and <!--del_lnk--> NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12-24 hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like <!--del_lnk--> Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a> to order evacuations. <p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Like the earlier cyclones Meena, Nancy and Olaf, Percy left widespread damage across <!--del_lnk--> Swains Island, <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> and the southern <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>. However, because of well executed warnings, there were no deaths and there were only a few injuries. Percy was the worst cyclone to strike <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> since a similar cyclone hit the area in <!--del_lnk--> 1966.<p><a id="American_Samoa_and_Tokelau" name="American_Samoa_and_Tokelau"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">American Samoa and Tokelau</span></h3>
      <p>The strong winds from Percy knocked out power and communications infrastructure in <!--del_lnk--> Swains Island. Efforts to re-establish contact with the island were unsuccessful for a week. After the storm, however, all eight people who rode out the storm survived, though nine of the eleven buildings on the islands were destroyed or severely damaged. Damage in <a href="../../wp/a/American_Samoa.htm" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a> was minimal.  In <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, Percy damaged trees and knocked down powerlines.  During the height of the storm, one person was injured by flying debris, and two others were swept out to sea, but all three survived. In <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Nokonunu</a>, the cyclone destroyed the only school and damaged 80% of the structures. The local hospital completely lost power during the storm and its emergency generator was overwhelmed by the flooding.  <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Fakaofo, the <!--del_lnk--> storm surge from Percy partially damaged a <!--del_lnk--> sea wall and caused major beach erosion. One house was destroyed while others were severely damaged. Percy also damaged much of the <a href="../../wp/c/Coconut.htm" title="Coconut">coconut</a> harvest and 50% of the livestock were killed by the cyclone. <!--del_lnk--> Atafu also suffered similar damage as the storm damaged a <!--del_lnk--> UHF tower and several storage sheds. Damage to crops was also significant as the storm damaged much of the <a href="../../wp/b/Banana.htm" title="Banana">banana</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pandanus.htm" title="Pandanus">pandanus</a> harvests. The schools in <!--del_lnk--> Atafu suffered only minimal damage (mostly wind damage). <p><a id="Cook_Islands" name="Cook_Islands"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cook Islands</span></h3>
      <p>The northern <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a> were hardest hit by Percy as the storm left 640 people homeless, of which 600 were in <!--del_lnk--> Pukapuka, and 40 were in <!--del_lnk--> Nassau. Of the buildings and houses destroyed or severely damaged, only ten were left standing.  One person was rescued when his fishing boat stalled during the storm.  Percy also damaged a solar power station, making it inoperable.  Percy also battered the southern <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a> while weakening, although the damage there was minimal. <p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>Relief efforts followed after Cyclone Percy. In <!--del_lnk--> Swains Island, a rescue plane dropped food and supplies.  In <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a> and northern <a href="../../wp/c/Cook_Islands.htm" title="Cook Islands">Cook Islands</a>, the governments of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> offered over $200,000 dollars (2005 <!--del_lnk--> USD) in relief aid. <p>In <a href="../../wp/t/Tokelau.htm" title="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, many of the local officials feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash and other debris in the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of <!--del_lnk--> mosquitoes and other insects, increasing the threat of a <!--del_lnk--> dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged many of the hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In <!--del_lnk--> Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier. <p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Percy&quot;</div>
