<h2>Photographic Expression</h2>
<img src="../../wp/s/Sbv_photopart_ind_8_1.jpg" width="423" height="321" alt="SOS Children photographic expression" class="left" /><p><strong>Case Studies: India </strong><br />134<br />children's comments :</p><p>Fun Park: The Breakdance<br />I was scared because when it started I thought we would fall off the edge. I feel like crying because I am scared but instead of crying I am laughing, then I am crying, then I am laughing again. When it finished I was happy but I did not go on the second time. </p><p>The games were all different. Some made you scared and some made you happy. I enjoyed them all but I think I liked the Breakdance best. I felt a little scared but I was enjoying it the second time. I enjoyed feeling scared and enjoying it but I was waiting for it to stop.<br />The first time everyone was scared. I told everyone to come but the first time they didn't enjoy it. Since Shobha told them they went the second time and this time it made me enjoy it a lot. Shobha was telling my friend not to get scared also Shobha was very brave in it so we would not be scared. This is why I love this picture. </p><p>The first time it was very scary. The second time I tried it I enjoyed it and liked it a lot. </p><p><em>All these photographs and text come from research conducted by SOS Children's Village Hermann Gmeiner Academy.
