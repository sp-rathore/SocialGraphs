Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B .<p>About one million <i>V. cholerae</i> bacteria must be ingested to cause cholera in normally healthy adults, although increased susceptibility may be observed in those with a weakened <!--del_lnk--> immune system, individuals with decreased gastric acidity (as from the use of <!--del_lnk--> antacids), or those who are <!--del_lnk--> malnourished.<p><a id="Transmission" name="Transmission"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transmission</span></h3>

      <p><i>V. cholerae</i> occurs naturally in the <!--del_lnk--> plankton of <a href="../../wp/f/Fresh_water.htm" title="Fresh water">fresh</a>, <!--del_lnk--> brackish, and <a href="../../wp/s/Seawater.htm" title="Seawater">salt water</a>, attached primarily to <!--del_lnk--> copepods in the <!--del_lnk--> zooplankton. Coastal cholera outbreaks typically follow <!--del_lnk--> zooplankton blooms. This makes cholera a <!--del_lnk--> zoonosis. Cholera is then transmitted through ingestion of <!--del_lnk--> feces contaminated with the bacterium. The contamination usually occurs when untreated <!--del_lnk--> sewage is released into waterways or into <!--del_lnk--> groundwater, affecting the water supply, any foods washed in the water, and shellfish living in the affected <!--del_lnk--> waterway &mdash; it is rarely spread directly from person to person.<p>The resulting <!--del_lnk--> diarrhea allows bacteria to spread to other people under unsanitary conditions.<p><a id="Symptoms" name="Symptoms"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Symptoms</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Symptoms include those of general GI tract upset, including <!--del_lnk--> profuse diarrhea. Symptoms are caused by the <!--del_lnk--> enterotoxins that <i>V. cholerae</i> produces. The main enterotoxin, known as <b>cholera toxin</b>, interacts with <!--del_lnk--> G proteins and <!--del_lnk--> cyclic AMP in the intestinal lining to open <!--del_lnk--> ion channels. As ions flow into the intestinal <!--del_lnk--> lumen, water follows due to <!--del_lnk--> osmosis.<p><a id="Famous_cholera_victims" name="Famous_cholera_victims"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Famous cholera victims</span></h3>

      <p>Most of the <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> bacteria in the water that a potential host drinks do not survive the very acidic conditions of the <!--del_lnk--> human stomach  But the few bacteria that manage to survive the stomach&#39;s acidity conserve their <!--del_lnk--> energy and stored nutrients during the perilous passage through the stomach by shutting down much protein production. When the surviving bacteria manage to exit the stomach and reach the favorable conditions of the <!--del_lnk--> small intestine, they need to propel themselves through the thick <!--del_lnk--> mucus that lines the small intestine to get to the intestinal wall where they can thrive. So they start up production of the hollow cylindrical protein <!--del_lnk--> flagellin to make <!--del_lnk--> flagella, the curly whip-like tails that they rotate to propel themselves through the pasty mucus that lines the small intestine.<p>But when the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they do not need the flagella propellers to move themselves any more, so they stop producing the protein flagellin, thus again conserving energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they manufacture, responding to the changed chemical surroundings. And on reaching the intestinal wall, they start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery <!--del_lnk--> diarrhea which carries the multiplying and thriving new generations of <i>V. cholerae</i> bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host&mdash;if proper sanitation measures are not in place.<p>Microbiologists have studied the <!--del_lnk--> genetic mechanisms by which the <i>V. cholerae</i> bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that pull <!--del_lnk--> chloride ions and accompanying <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> from the host&#39;s blood supply into the small intestine to create the sickening diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated if an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is not taken to replace the blood&#39;s water and salts lost in the diarrhea.<p>By inserting separately successive sections of <i>V. cholerae</i> DNA into the DNA of other bacteria such as <i><!--del_lnk--> E. Coli</i> that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers could find out the separate pieces of the mechanisms by which <i>V. cholerae</i> respond to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers discovered that there is a complex cascade of regulatory proteins that control expression of <i>V. cholerae</i> virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the <i>V. cholerae</i> bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins that cause diarrhea in the infected person and that permit the bacteria to colonize the intestine. Current research aims at discovering &quot;the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.&quot;<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Cholera was originally <!--del_lnk--> endemic to the Indian subcontinent, with the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges River</a> likely serving as a contamination reservoir. It spread by trade routes (land and sea) to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, then to <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, and from Europe to <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. It is now no longer considered an issue in Europe and North America, due to <!--del_lnk--> filtering and <!--del_lnk--> chlorination of the water supply.<ul>
       <li>1816-1826 - <b>First pandemic</b>: Previously restricted, the pandemic began in <!--del_lnk--> Bengal, then spread across <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> by 1820. It extended as far as <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a> before receding.<li>1829-1851 - <b>Second pandemic</b> reached Europe, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1832. In London, it claimed 6536 victims; in Paris, 20,000 succumbed (out of a population of 650,000) with 100,000 victims in all of France <!--del_lnk--> . It reached Russia (<!--del_lnk--> Cholera Riots), <!--del_lnk--> Quebec, <!--del_lnk--> Ontario and <!--del_lnk--> New York in the same year and the Pacific coast of North America by 1834.<li>1849 - Second outbreak in Paris. In London, it was the worst outbreak in the city&#39;s history, claiming 14,137 lives. An outbreak in North America took the life of former <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="../../wp/j/James_K._Polk.htm" title="James K.

From <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a> it spread into Italy by 1973. In the late 1970s there were small outbreaks in Japan and in the South Pacific. There were also many reports of a cholera outbreak near <!--del_lnk--> Baku in 1972, but information of this was suppressed in the USSR.<li>January 1991 to September 1994 - Outbreak in <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, apparently initiated by discharged ballast water. Beginning in <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> there were 1.04 million identified cases and almost 10,000 deaths. The causative agent was a non-O1, <!--del_lnk--> nonagglutinable vibrio (NAG) named O139 Bengal. It was first identified in <!--del_lnk--> Tamilnadu, India and for a while displaced El Tor in southern Asia before decreasing in prevalence from 1995 to around 10% of all cases. It is considered to be an intermediate between El Tor and the classic strain and occurs in a new serogroup. There is evidence as to the emergence of wide-spectrum resistance to drugs such as <!--del_lnk--> trimethoprim, <!--del_lnk--> sulfamethoxazole and <!--del_lnk--> streptomycin.</ul>
      <p><a id="Research" name="Research"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Research</span></h3>
      <p>The scientists with major contributions to fighting cholera were <!--del_lnk--> John Snow, who found the link between cholera and drinking water in <!--del_lnk--> 1854, and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Koch, who identified <i>V. cholerae</i> as the bacillus causing the disease. The bacterium was originally isolated thirty years earlier by Italian anatomist <!--del_lnk--> Filippo Pacini, but his results were not widely known around the world. However John Snow and Robert Koch didn&#39;t know of Pacini&#39;s previous success and so were widely credited for the breakthrough.<p>Cholera has been a laboratory for the study of evolution of virulence. The province of Bengal in British India was partitioned into West Bengal (a state in India) and the nation of Bangladesh in 1947. Prior to partition, both regions had Cholera pathogens with similar characteristics. After 1947, India made more progress on public health than Bangladesh. As a consequence, the strains of the pathogen which succeeded in India had a greater incentive in the longevity of the host, and are less virulent than the strains prevailing in Bangladesh, which uninhibitedly draw upon resources of the host thus rapidly killing him.<p><a id="Other_historical_information" name="Other_historical_information"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other historical information</span></h3>

      <p>Although cholera can be life-threatening, it is easily prevented. In the United States and Western Europe, because of advanced water and sanitation systems, cholera is not a major threat. The last major outbreak of cholera in the United States was in <!--del_lnk--> 1911. However, everyone, especially travellers, should be aware of how the disease is transmitted and what can be done to prevent it.<p>Simple sanitation is usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the transmission path at which the spread may be halted:<ul>
       <li>Sickbed: Proper disposal and treatment of waste produced by cholera victims.<li>Sewage: Treatment of general sewage before it enters the waterways.<li>Sources: Warnings about cholera contamination posted around contaminated water sources.<li>Sterilization: Boiling, filtering, and chlorination of water before use.</ul>
      <p>Filtration and boiling is by far the most effective means of halting transmission. <!--del_lnk--> Cloth filters, though very basic, have greatly reduced the occurrence of cholera when used in poor villages in Bangladesh that rely on untreated surface water.<p>In general, education and sanitation are the limiting factors in prevention of cholera epidemics.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
