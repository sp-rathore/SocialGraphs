      <p>The collective term <b>Crown Jewels</b> denotes the regalia and vestments worn by the sovereign of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> coronation ceremony and at various other state functions. The term refers to the following objects: the <!--del_lnk--> crowns, <!--del_lnk--> sceptres (with either the cross or the dove), <!--del_lnk--> orbs, <!--del_lnk--> swords, <a href="../../wp/j/Jewellery.htm" title="Jewellery">rings</a>, <!--del_lnk--> spurs, <i><!--del_lnk--> colobium sindonis</i>, <!--del_lnk--> dalmatic, <!--del_lnk--> armill, and the royal robe or pall, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony itself.<p>Many of these descend directly from the pre-<!--del_lnk--> Reformation period and have a religious and sacral connotation. The vestures donned by the sovereign following the <i>unction</i>, for instance, closely resemble the <!--del_lnk--> alb and dalmatic worn by <!--del_lnk--> bishops, although the contention that they are meant to confer upon the sovereign an ecclesiastical character is in disrepute among <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> scholars.<p>The oldest set of Crown Jewels dating from the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon period were lost by <a href="../../wp/j/John_of_England.htm" title="John of England">John of England</a> near <!--del_lnk--> The Wash in <!--del_lnk--> 1216. A replacement set were made shortly afterwards which were later joined by the addition of <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a> prince <!--del_lnk--> Llywelyn&#39;s coronet in <!--del_lnk--> 1284. This replacement set was stolen from <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1303 although most, if not all, were recovered days later from the window of a London jeweller&#39;s shop with dire consequences for the owner.<p><a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> melted down most of the Crown Jewels of his time after the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth in <!--del_lnk--> 1649. Upon the <!--del_lnk--> Restoration of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a> most of the regalia were replaced. The only pieces to survive from before the Civil War are three swords and a spoon.<p>The Crown Jewels are considered to be the most valuable and one of the largest jewellery collections in existence.<p>

      <p>The collection of Crown Jewels contains various crowns, some of which are used by every Sovereign, others being made personally for Sovereigns or for Queens Consort. Typically the crown of a King has a slightly pointed arched top, while that of a Queen has a slightly bowed top.<p><b><!--del_lnk--> St. Edward&#39;s Crown</b> was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1661. Made of gold, its design consists of four crosses pattee and four fleurs-de-lis, with two arches on top. Surmounting the arches is a jewelled cross pattee. The Crown includes 444 semi-precious stones. It is used through most of the coronation ceremony. <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> opted to use a stylised representation of this crown in images of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Imperial State Crown</b> was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1937 for <a href="../../wp/g/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">King George VI</a>, and was similar to the one made in <!--del_lnk--> 1838 for <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. The present Crown is made of gold and includes four crosses pattee and four fleurs-de-lis, with two arches on top, surmounted by a cross pattee. The Crown includes many jewels: 2,868 <a href="../../wp/d/Diamond.htm" title="Diamond">diamonds</a>, 273 <a href="../../wp/p/Pearl.htm" title="Pearl">pearls</a>, 17 <!--del_lnk--> sapphires, 11 <!--del_lnk--> emeralds, and five <!--del_lnk--> rubies. Among the stones are several famous ones, including the <!--del_lnk--> Black Prince&#39;s Ruby (actually a <!--del_lnk--> spinel) and the <!--del_lnk--> Cullinan II diamond, also known as the Lesser Star of Africa. It is worn after the conclusion of the Coronation ceremony when the monarch leaves <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, and also at the annual <!--del_lnk--> State Opening of Parliament.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Imperial Crown of India</b> was created when <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> visited <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> as <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of India. In order to prevent the pawning of the Crown Jewels, British law prohibited the removal of a Crown Jewel from the country. Thus, a new crown was made. Set with more than 6,000 diamonds, it was one of the heaviest crowns in the collection. It has since not been used.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> George IV State Diadem</b> was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1820 for the coronation of <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>, and was worn during the coronation processions of <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.<p>Queens consort, that is, wives of Kings, traditionally wore the <!--del_lnk--> Crown of Mary of Modena, queen of King <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James II</a>. By the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> that small crown was in a decrepit state. A new European-style <!--del_lnk--> crown, flatter and with more arches than was traditional in British crowns, was manufactured for Queen <!--del_lnk--> Alexandra, consort of King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">Edward VII</a>. A new <!--del_lnk--> crown, more akin to traditional British crowns, was manufactured for <!--del_lnk--> Queen Mary, consort of King <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V</a>, who was crowned in <!--del_lnk--> 1911. The final new consort&#39;s crown in the 20th century was manufactured for <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth, consort of King <a href="../../wp/g/George_VI_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George VI of the United Kingdom">George VI</a>, who along with her husband was crowned in <!--del_lnk--> 1937. All three consorts&#39; crowns in turn included the famous <!--del_lnk--> Koh-i-Noor diamond. This latter <!--del_lnk--> Crown of Queen Elizabeth was also worn, minus its arches, by the by-then Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother during Elizabeth II&#39;s coronation. It rested on top of the Queen Mother&#39;s coffin during her funeral in <!--del_lnk--> 2002.<p><a id="Mary_of_Modena.27s_Crowns" name="Mary_of_Modena.27s_Crowns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><!--del_lnk--> Mary of Modena&#39;s Crowns</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Two Sceptres used by the Sovereign form a part of the regalia:<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Sceptre with the Cross</b> was made in <!--del_lnk--> 1661, and is so called because it is surmounted by a cross. In <!--del_lnk--> 1905, it was redesigned to incorporate the <!--del_lnk--> Cullinan I, also known as the Great Star of Africa, which at over 530 carats (106 g) is the second largest cut diamond in the world after <!--del_lnk--> The Golden Jubilee. During the coronation, the monarch bears the Sceptre with the Cross in the right hand.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Sceptre with the Dove</b> was also made in 1661, and atop it is a dove symbolising the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Ghost. While the Sceptre with the Cross is borne in the right hand, the Sceptre with the Dove is borne in the left. At the same time as the Sovereign holds both Sceptres, he or she is crowned with St. Edward&#39;s Crown.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Sovereign&#39;s Orb</b>, a type of <!--del_lnk--> globus cruciger, is a hollow golden sphere made in 1661. There is a band of jewels running along the centre, and a half-band on the top hemisphere. Surmounting the orb is a jewelled Cross representing the Sovereign&#39;s role as <!--del_lnk--> Defender of the Faith. For a part of the coronation, it is borne in the Sovereign&#39;s left hand.<p><a id="Swords" name="Swords"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Swords</span></h2>
      <p>Five Swords are used during the coronation.<p>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Jewelled Sword of Offering</b> was made for the Coronation of <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">King George IV</a>. Its jewels are in the shapes of the floral symbols of the United Kingdom: the rose for England, the thistle for Scotland, and the shamrock for Ireland. It is the only sword actually presented to the Sovereign during the Coronation; the others are merely borne in front of the Sovereign.<p>The <b>Sword of State</b> is the largest sword in the collection, and is borne in front of the Monarch by the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Great Chamberlain both at the coronation and at the <!--del_lnk--> State Opening of Parliament.<p>The other three swords used are the <b>Sword of Spiritual Justice</b>, the <b>Sword of Temporal Justice</b>, and the <b><!--del_lnk--> Sword of Mercy</b>. The latter has a blunt point and is known as Curtana.<p><a id="Other_Elements" name="Other_Elements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other Elements</span></h2>
      <p>The <b>Ring</b> was made for <a href="../../wp/w/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>&#39;s coronation in 1831. Previously, each Sovereign received a new ring to symbolise their &quot;marriage&quot; to the nation, though no new rings have been used since <!--del_lnk--> 1831.<p>When the Sovereign is anointed by the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the anointing oil is poured from the <b>Ampulla</b> into the <b>Anointing Spoon</b>. The Ampulla is a hollow gold vessel shaped like an eagle, and the Spoon is a silver-gilt spoon set with pearls. Both were spared when Cromwell ordered the destruction of the new regalia; the Spoon, probably dating from the thirteenth century, is thus the oldest element of the Regalia.<p>The <b>Armills</b> are gold bracelets said to symbolise sincerity and wisdom. Upon Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s coronation, a new set of gold armills was produced and presented on the behalf of various <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth governments, namely: the United Kingdom, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon, and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Rhodesia.<p><a id="The_Tower_of_London" name="The_Tower_of_London"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Tower of London</span></h2>
      <p>The Crown Jewels have been kept at the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a> since <!--del_lnk--> 1303 after they were stolen from <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. It is thought that most, if not all, were recovered shortly afterwards. After the coronation of Charles II, they were locked away and shown for a viewing fee paid to a custodian. However, this arrangement ended when Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Blood stole the Crown Jewels after having bound and gagged the custodian. Thereafter, the Crown Jewels were kept in a part of the Tower known as <!--del_lnk--> Jewel House, where armed guards defend them. They were temporarily taken out of the Tower in the Second World War. It was reported that they were secretly kept in the basement vaults of the Sun Life Insurance company in <a href="../../wp/m/Montreal.htm" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Canada, during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, along with the <!--del_lnk--> gold bullion of the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of England. However it has also been said that they were kept in the Round Tower of <a href="../../wp/w/Windsor_Castle.htm" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, or the <!--del_lnk--> Fort Knox Bullion Depository. The Windsor Castle suggestion is the most probably, since by ancient custom the Crown is not supposed to leave the country, and in any event the risk of transporting the Crown Jewels broad would have outwayed any advantage.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
      <p>The Crown Jewels were featured in the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Ernest Rides Again</i>. The jewels were residing in a barrel on a giant Revolutionary War cannon named Goliath. The inept Ernest had to try to protect the jewels from scheming criminals.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Jewels_of_the_United_Kingdom&quot;</div>
