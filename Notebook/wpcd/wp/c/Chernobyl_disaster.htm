The power plant is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;23&prime;23&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">30&deg;5&prime;58&Prime;E</span></span>, near <!--del_lnk--> Pripyat, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, at the time part of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. It is regarded as the worst <!--del_lnk--> accident ever in the history of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>. A plume of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, <!--del_lnk--> Eastern and <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia, the <!--del_lnk--> UK, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and eastern <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>. Large areas of <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> were badly contaminated, resulting in the evacuation and resettlement of over 336,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, according to official post-Soviet data.<p>The accident raised concerns about the <!--del_lnk--> safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry, slowing its expansion for a number of years, while forcing the Soviet government to become less secretive. The now-independent countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have been burdened with continuing and substantial <!--del_lnk--> decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident. It is difficult to tally accurately the number of deaths caused by the events at Chernobyl, as the Soviet-era cover-up made it difficult to track down victims. Lists were incomplete, and Soviet authorities later forbade doctors to cite &quot;radiation&quot; on death certificates. Most of the expected long-term fatalities, especially those from <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, have not yet actually occurred, and will be difficult or even impossible to attribute specifically to the accident. Dr Peter Boyle, director of the <!--del_lnk--> International Agency for Research on Cancer, put the discussion of the figures into perspective: &quot;Tobacco smoking will cause several thousand times more cancers in the same (European) population.&quot; Estimates and figures vary widely. The 2005 report prepared by the Chernobyl Forum, led by the <!--del_lnk--> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), attributed 56 direct deaths (47 accident workers, and nine children with <!--del_lnk--> thyroid cancer), and estimated that as many as 9,000 people among the approximately 6.6 million most highly exposed, may die from some form of cancer (one of the induced diseases). Nearly 20 years after the disaster, according to the Chernobyl Forum, no evidence of increases in the solid cancers and, possibly more significantly, none of the widely expected increases in <!--del_lnk--> leukemia have been found in the population.<p>

The station consisted of four <!--del_lnk--> reactors of type <!--del_lnk--> RBMK-1000, each capable of producing 1 <!--del_lnk--> GW of <!--del_lnk--> electric power (3.2 GW of thermal power), and the four together produced about 10% of Ukraine&#39;s <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> at the time of the accident. Construction of the plant began in the 1970s, with reactor no. 1 commissioned in 1977, followed by no. 2 (1978), no. 3 (1981), and no. 4 (1983). Two more reactors, no. 5 and 6, capable of producing 1 GW each, were under construction at the time of the accident.<p><a id="The_accident" name="The_accident"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The accident</span></h2>
      <p>On Saturday <!--del_lnk--> April 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1986 at 1:23:58 a.m. reactor 4 suffered a catastrophic <!--del_lnk--> steam explosion that resulted in a fire, a series of additional explosions, and a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear meltdown. The accident can be thought of as an extreme version of the <!--del_lnk--> SL-1 accident where the core of a reactor was destroyed (killing three men) spreading radioactivity through the inside of the building that SL-1 was in.<p><a id="Causes" name="Causes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Causes</span></h2>
      <p>There are two conflicting official theories about the cause of the accident. The first was published in August 1986 and effectively placed the blame solely on the <!--del_lnk--> power plant operators. The second theory, proposed by <!--del_lnk--> Valeri Legasov and published in 1991, attributed the accident to flaws in the <!--del_lnk--> RBMK reactor design, specifically the <!--del_lnk--> control rods. Both commissions were heavily <!--del_lnk--> lobbied by different groups, including the reactor&#39;s designers, power plant personnel, and by the Soviet and Ukrainian governments.<p>Another important factor contributing to the accident was that the operators were not informed about problems with the reactor. According to one of them, Anatoliy Dyatlov, the designers knew that the reactor was dangerous in some conditions but intentionally concealed this information. Contributing to this was that the plant&#39;s management was largely composed of non-RBMK-qualified personnel: the director, V.P. Bryukhanov, had experience and training in a coal-fired power plant. His chief engineer, Nikolai Fomin, also came from a conventional power plant. Dyatlov, deputy chief engineer of reactors 3 and 4, had only &quot;some experience with small nuclear reactors&quot;, namely smaller versions of the <!--del_lnk--> VVER nuclear reactors that were designed for the Soviet Navy&#39;s nuclear <!--del_lnk--> submarines.<p>In particular:<ul>
       <li>The reactor had a dangerously large positive <!--del_lnk--> void coefficient. The void coefficient is a measurement of how the reactor responds to increased <!--del_lnk--> steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs produce less energy as they get hotter, because if the coolant contains steam bubbles, fewer <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> are slowed down. Faster neutrons are less likely to split <a href="../../wp/u/Uranium.htm" title="Uranium">uranium</a> atoms, so the reactor produces less power. Chernobyl&#39;s RBMK reactor, however, used solid <!--del_lnk--> graphite to slow down the neutrons, and neutron-absorbing <!--del_lnk--> light-water to cool the core. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam absorbs neutrons much less readily than water, increasing an RBMK reactor&#39;s temperature means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor&#39;s power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly produce a lot more energy if the temperature rises. This was counter-intuitive and unknown to the crew.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>A more significant flaw was in the design of the control rods that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the control rod end tips were made of graphite and the extenders (the end areas of the control rods above the end tips, measuring 1 m in length) were hollow and filled with water, while the rest of the rod &ndash; the truly functional part which absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction &ndash; was made of <!--del_lnk--> boron carbide. With this design, when the rods are initially inserted into the reactor, the graphite ends displace some coolant. This greatly increases the rate of the fission reaction, since graphite is a more potent neutron <!--del_lnk--> moderator (a material that enables a nuclear reaction) and also absorbs much fewer neutrons than the boiling light water. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor&#39;s power output increases, rather than reducing as desired. This behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The water channels run through the core vertically, meaning that the water&#39;s temperature increases as it moves up and thus creates a temperature gradient in the core. This effect is exacerbated if the top portion turns completely to steam, since the topmost part of the core is no longer being properly moderated and reactivity greatly increases. By contrast, the <!--del_lnk--> CANDU reactor&#39;s water channels run through the core horizontally, with water flowing in opposite directions among adjacent channels. Hence, the core has a much more even temperature distribution.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The operators were careless and violated plant procedures, partly due to their lack of knowledge of the reactor&#39;s design, and lack of experience and training. Several procedural irregularities also contributed to cause the accident. One was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of an experiment being run that night. The operators switched off many of the safety systems, which was generally prohibited by the plant&#39;s published technical guidelines.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>To reduce costs, and because of its large size, the reactor had been constructed with only partial <!--del_lnk--> containment. This allowed the radioactive contaminants to escape into the atmosphere after the steam explosion burst the primary pressure vessel.</ul>
      <p>The IAEA&#39;s 1986 analysis attributed the main cause of the accident to the operators&#39; actions. But in January 1993, the IAEA issued a revised analysis, attributing the main cause to the reactor&#39;s design.<p><a id="Test_plan" name="Test_plan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Test plan</span></h3>
      <p>During the daytime of <!--del_lnk--> April 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1986, reactor 4 was scheduled to be shut down for maintenance. It had been decided to use this occasion as an opportunity to test the ability of the reactor&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> turbine generator to generate sufficient electricity to power the reactor&#39;s safety systems (in particular, the water pumps) in the event of a loss of external electric power. This type of reactor requires water being continuously circulated through the core, as long as the nuclear fuel is present. Chernobyl&#39;s reactors have a pair of <!--del_lnk--> diesel generators available as standby, but these do not activate instantaneously&mdash;the reactor was, therefore, to be used to spin up the turbine, at which point the turbine would be disconnected from the reactor and allowed to spin under its own rotational <a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a>, and the aim of the test was to determine whether the turbines in the rundown phase could power the pumps while the generators were starting up. The test was successfully carried out previously on another unit (with all safety provisions active) with negative results - the turbines did not generate sufficient power, but additional improvements were made to the turbines, which prompted the need for another test.<p><a id="Prior_to_accident" name="Prior_to_accident"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prior to accident</span></h3>
      <p>As conditions to run this test were prepared during the daytime of <!--del_lnk--> April 25, and the reactor electricity output had been gradually reduced to 50%, a regional power station unexpectedly went offline. The <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> grid controller demanded to postpone the further reduction of output as electricity was needed to satisfy the evening peak demand. The plant director agreed and postponed the test to comply. The ill-advised safety test was then left to be run by the night shift of the plant, a skeleton crew who would be working Reactor 4 that night and the early part of the next morning.<p>At 11:00pm, April 25, the grid controller allowed the reactor shut-down to continue. The power output of reactor 4 was to be reduced from its nominal 3.2 GW thermal to 0.7 &mdash; 1.0 GW thermal in order to conduct the test at a safer, lower level of power. However, due to a delay in starting the experiment the reactor operators reduced the power level too rapidly, and the actual power output fell to 30 MW thermal. According to operators, the rapid fall in output was due to malfunctioning of one of the automatic power regulators. As a result of output decline, the concentration of the <!--del_lnk--> nuclear poison product <a href="../../wp/x/Xenon.htm" title="Xenon">xenon</a>-135 increased (the <!--del_lnk--> xenon production rate:<!--del_lnk--> xenon loss rate ratio goes initially higher during a reactor power down). Though the scale of the power drop was close to the maximum allowed by safety regulations, the crew&#39;s management chose not to shut down the reactor, and to continue the experiment. Further, it was decided to &#39;shortcut&#39; the experiment and raise power output to only 200 MW. In order to overcome the neutron absorption of the excess xenon-135, the control rods were pulled out of the reactor somewhat further than normally allowed under safety regulations. As part of the experiment, at 1:05 a.m. on <!--del_lnk--> April 26 the water pumps that were to be driven by the turbine generator were turned on; the water flow generated by this action exceeded that specified by safety regulations. The water flow increased at 1:19 a.m. &mdash; since water also absorbs neutrons, this further increase in the water flow necessitated the removal of the manual control rods, producing a very unstable and dangerous operating condition.<p><a id="Fatal_experiment" name="Fatal_experiment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fatal experiment</span></h3>
      <p>At 1:23:04 the experiment began. The unstable state of the reactor was not reflected in any way on the control panel, and it does not appear that anyone in the reactor crew was fully aware of any danger. Electricity to the water pumps was shut off and, as the momentum of the turbine generator drove them, the water flow rate decreased. The turbine was disconnected from the reactor, increasing the level of steam in the reactor core. As the coolant heated, pockets of steam formed voids in the coolant lines. Due to the <!--del_lnk--> RBMK reactor-type&#39;s large positive <!--del_lnk--> void coefficient, the power of the reactor increased rapidly, and the reactor operation became progressively less stable and more dangerous. At 1:23:40 the operators pressed the AZ-5 (&quot;Rapid Emergency Defense 5&quot;) button that ordered a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> SCRAM&quot; &mdash; a shutdown of the reactor, fully inserting all control rods, including the manual control rods that had been incautiously withdrawn earlier. It is unclear whether it was done as an emergency measure, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon the completion of an experiment (the reactor was scheduled to be shut down for routine maintenance). It is usually suggested that the SCRAM was ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase. On the other hand, <!--del_lnk--> Anatoly Dyatlov, chief engineer at the nuclear station at the time of the accident, writes in his book:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Prior to 01:23:40, systems of centralized control ... didn&#39;t register any parameter changes that could justify the SCRAM. Commission ... gathered and analyzed large amount of materials and, as stated in its report, failed to determine the reason why the SCRAM was ordered. There was no need to look for the reason. The reactor was simply being shut down upon the completion of the experiment.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>Due to the slow speed of the control rod insertion mechanism (18&ndash;20 seconds to complete), the hollow tips of the rods and the temporary displacement of coolant, the SCRAM caused the reaction rate to increase. Increased energy output caused the deformation of control rod channels. The rods became stuck after being inserted only one-third of the way, and were therefore unable to stop the reaction. By 1:23:47 the reactor jumped to around 30 GW, ten times the normal operational output. The fuel rods began to melt and the steam pressure rapidly increased, causing a large <!--del_lnk--> steam explosion. Generated steam traveled vertically along the rod channels in the reactor, displacing and destroying the reactor lid, rupturing the coolant tubes and then blowing a hole in the roof. After part of the roof blew off, the inrush of <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a>, combined with the extremely high temperature of the reactor fuel and <!--del_lnk--> graphite moderator, sparked a graphite fire. This fire greatly contributed to the spread of radioactive material and the <!--del_lnk--> contamination of outlying areas.<p><a id="Radioactive_release_.28Source_term.29" name="Radioactive_release_.28Source_term.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The effects of the disaster</span></h2>

      <p>Right after the accident, the main health concern involved radioactive iodine, with a <!--del_lnk--> half-life of eight days. Today, there is concern about contamination of the soil with <a href="../../wp/s/Strontium.htm" title="Strontium">strontium</a>-90 and <a href="../../wp/c/Caesium.htm" title="Caesium">caesium</a>-137, which have half-lives of about 30 years. The highest levels of caesium-137 are found in the surface layers of the soil where they are absorbed by plants, insects and mushrooms, entering the local food supply. However, in 2006, hedgehogs from the area, an insectivorous species seem to have absorbed little if any radioactive material, whilst rodents are strongly radiating (20 millisieverts per day), although seem to suffer no ill effects.<p>Some persons in the contaminated areas were exposed to large thyroid doses of up to 50 <!--del_lnk--> grays (Gy) because of an intake of radioactive <a href="../../wp/i/Iodine.htm" title="Iodine">iodine-131</a>, a relatively short-lived isotope with a half-life of eight days, but which concentrates in the thyroid gland. This would have been absorbed from contaminated milk produced locally, particularly in children. Several studies have found that the incidence of <!--del_lnk--> thyroid cancer in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia has risen sharply, however there have barely been more than a handful of deaths. Some scientists think that most of the increase is caused by greatly increased monitoring.<p>So far, no increase in <!--del_lnk--> leukemia in the general population is discernible.<p>Some scientists fear that radioactivity will affect the local population for the next several generations. However, there is little evidence so far of this.<p>Soviet authorities started evacuating people from the area around the Chernobyl reactor 36 hours after the accident. By May 1986, about a month later, all those living within a 30-kilometre (18 mile) radius of the plant&mdash;about 116,000 people&mdash;had been relocated. This region is often referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Zone of alienation. However, radiation affected the area in a much wider scale than this 30 km radius.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The issue of long-term effects of Chernobyl disaster on civilians is controversial. Over 300,000 people were resettled because of the accident; millions lived and continue to live in the contaminated area. On the other hand, most of those affected received relatively low doses of radiation, there is little evidence of increased mortality &ndash; cancers or birth defects among them &ndash; and, when such evidence is present, existence of a causal link to radioactive contamination is uncertain.<p>Aside from obstacles posed by Soviet policies during and after the <!--del_lnk--> catastrophe, scientific studies may still be limited by a lack of democratic transparency. In Belarus, <!--del_lnk--> Yuri Bandazhevsky, a scientist who questioned the official estimates of Chernobyl&#39;s consequences and the relevance of the official maximum limit of 1000 Bq/kg, has allegedly been a victim of <!--del_lnk--> political repression. He was imprisoned from 2001 to 2005 on a bribery conviction, after his 1999 publication of reports critical of the official research being conducted into the Chernobyl incident.<p><a id="Farming" name="Farming"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Farming</span></h4>

      <p>In April 1986 several European countries, excluding <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, had enforced food restrictions, most notably on <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms and <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a>. Twenty years after the catastrophe, restriction orders remain in place in the production, transportation and consumption of food contaminated by Chernobyl fallout, in particular caesium-137, in order to prevent them from entering the human <!--del_lnk--> food chain.

The average level is 6800 Bq/kg, more than ten times the EU limit of 600 Bq/kg&quot;, according to the TORCH 2006 report. The <!--del_lnk--> European Commission has stated that &quot;The restrictions on certain foodstuffs from certain Member States must therefore continue to be maintained for many years to come&quot;.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, under powers in the 1985 <!--del_lnk--> Food and Environment Protection Act (FEPA), Emergency Orders have been used since 1986 to impose restrictions on the movement and sale of sheep exceeding the limit of 1000 Bq/kg. This safety limit was introduced in the UK in 1986 based on advice from the European Commission&#39;s Article 31 group of experts. However, the area covered by these restrictions has decreased by 95% since 1986: while it covered at first almost 9000 farms and over 4 million sheep, as of 2006 it covers 374 farms covering 750 km<sup>2</sup> and 200,000 sheep.

      <p>After the disaster, four square kilometres of <!--del_lnk--> pine forest in the immediate vicinity of the reactor went ginger brown and died, earning the name of the Red Forest, according to the BBC.<!--del_lnk-->  Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing. Mice <!--del_lnk--> embryos simply dissolved, while horses left on an island 6 km from the power plant died when their <!--del_lnk--> thyroid glands disintegrated. Cattle on the same island were stunted due to thyroid damage, but the next generation were found to be surprisingly normal.<p>In the years since the disaster, the exclusion zone abandoned by humans has become a haven for wildlife, with <!--del_lnk--> nature reserves declared (Belarus) or proposed (Ukraine) for the area. Many species of wild animals and birds, which were never seen in the area prior to the disaster, are now plentiful, due to the absence of humans in the area.<p><a id="Chernobyl_after_the_disaster" name="Chernobyl_after_the_disaster"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chernobyl after the disaster</span></h2>

      <p>Following the accident, questions arose on the future of the plant and its eventual fate. All work on the unfinished reactors 5 and 6 were immediately halted. However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in <!--del_lnk--> reactor 4. The damaged reactor was sealed off and 200 metres of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings. The <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukrainian</a> government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> shortage in the country. A fire broke out in reactor 2 in 1991; the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair and had it taken offline. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 as part of a deal between the Ukrainian government and international organizations such as the IAEA to end operations at the plant. On December 15th, 2000, then-President Leonid Kuchma personally turned off Reactor 3 in an official ceremony, effectively shutting down the entire plant. This transformed the Chernobyl plant from energy producer to energy consumer.<p><a id="The_need_for_future_repairs" name="The_need_for_future_repairs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The need for future repairs</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> sarcophagus is not an effective permanent enclosure for the destroyed reactor. Its hasty construction, in many cases conducted remotely with industrial <!--del_lnk--> robots, is aging badly. If it collapses another cloud of <!--del_lnk--> radioactive dust could be released.

      <p>According to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel (about 180 <!--del_lnk--> tonnes) in the reactor at the time of the accident remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million <!--del_lnk--> curies (670 <!--del_lnk--> PBq). The radioactive material consists of <!--del_lnk--> core fragments, dust, and lava-like &quot;fuel-containing materials&quot; (FCM) that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a <!--del_lnk--> ceramic form.<p>It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. By conservative estimates, there is at least four tons of radioactive dust inside the shelter. However, more recent estimates have strongly questioned the previously held assumptions regarding the quantity of fuel remaining in the reactor. Some estimates now place the total quantity of fuel in the reactor at only about 70% of the original fuel load, however the IAEA maintains that less than 5% of the fuel was lost due to the explosion. Moreover, some liquidators estimate that only 5&ndash;10% of the original fuel load remains inside the sarcophagus.<p>Water continues to leak into the shelter, spreading radioactive materials throughout the wrecked <!--del_lnk--> reactor building and potentially into the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> groundwater. The basement of the reactor building is slowly filling with water that is contaminated with nuclear fuel and is considered high-level radioactive waste. Though repairs were undertaken to fix some of the most gaping holes that had formed in the roof, it is by no means watertight, and will only continue to deteriorate.<p>The sarcophagus, while not airtight, heats up much more readily than it cools down. This is contributing to rising <!--del_lnk--> humidity levels inside the shelter. The high humidity inside the shelter continues to erode the <!--del_lnk--> concrete and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> of the sarcophagus.<p>Further, dust is becoming an increasing problem within the shelter. Radioactive particles of varying size, most of similar consistency to ash makes up a large portion of the debris inside the shelter. <!--del_lnk--> Convection currents compounded with increasing intrusion of outside airflow are increasingly stirring up and suspending the particles in the air inside the shelter. The installation of <!--del_lnk--> air filtration systems in 2001 has reduced the problem, but not eliminated it.<p>Some signs of a <!--del_lnk--> criticality were observed in June 24, 1990 - July 1, 1990 inside room 304/3; to avoid any further <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a> reaction, a <!--del_lnk--> neutron poison was added to this room.<p><a id="Consequences_of_further_collapse" name="Consequences_of_further_collapse"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Consequences of further collapse</span></h3>
      <p>The present shelter is constructed atop the ruins of the reactor building. The two &quot;Mammoth Beams&quot; that support the roof of the shelter are resting upon the structurally unsound west wall of the reactor building that was damaged by the accident. If the wall of the reactor building and subsequently the roof of the shelter were to collapse, then large amounts of radioactive dust and particles would be released directly into the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, resulting in a large new release of <!--del_lnk--> radiation into the environment.<p>A further threat to the shelter is the concrete slab that formed the &quot;Upper Biological Shield&quot; (UBS), and rested atop the reactor prior to the accident. This concrete slab was thrown upwards by the <!--del_lnk--> explosion in the reactor core and now rests at approximately 15&deg; from vertical. The position of the upper bioshield is considered inherently unsafe, in that only debris is supporting it in a nearly upright position. The collapse of the bioshield would further exacerbate the dust conditions in the shelter, would probably spread some quantity of radioactive materials out of the shelter, and could damage the shelter itself.<p>The sarcophagus was never designed to last for the 100 years needed to contain the radioactivity found within the remains of reactor 4. While present designs for a new shelter anticipate a lifetime of up to 100 years, that time is minuscule compared to the lifetime of the radioactive materials within the reactor. The construction and maintenance of a permanent sarcophagus that can completely contain the remains of reactor 4 will present a continuing task to engineers for many generations to come.<p><a id="Grass_and_forest_fires" name="Grass_and_forest_fires"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Grass and forest fires</span></h3>

      <p>The majority of premature deaths caused by Chernobyl are expected to be the result of cancers and other diseases induced by radiation in the decades after the event. This will be the result of a large population (some studies have considered the entire population of Europe) exposed to relatively low doses of radiation increasing the risk of cancer across that population. It will be impossible to attribute specific deaths to Chernobyl, and many estimates indicate that the rate of excess deaths will be so small as to be statistically undetectable, even if the ultimate number of extra premature deaths is large. Furthermore, interpretations of the current health state of exposed population is subject vary. Therefore, estimates of the ultimate human impact of the disaster have relied on numerical models of the effects of radiation on health. Furthermore, the effects of low-level radiation on human health are not well understood, and so the models used, notably the <!--del_lnk--> linear no threshold model, are open to question.<p>Given these factors, several different studies of Chernobyl&#39;s health effects have come up with substantially different conclusions and are the subject of considerable scientific and political controversy. The following section presents some of the major studies on this topic.<p><a id="The_Chernobyl_Forum_report" name="The_Chernobyl_Forum_report"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Chernobyl Forum report</span></h3>
      <p>In September 2005, a draft summary report by the Chernobyl Forum, comprising a number of UN agencies including the <!--del_lnk--> International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> (WHO), the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), other UN bodies and the Governments of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, put the total predicted number of deaths due to the accident at 4000. This death toll predicted by the WHO included the 47 workers who died of <!--del_lnk--> acute radiation syndrome as a direct result of radiation from the disaster and nine children who died from thyroid cancer, in the estimated 4000 excess cancer deaths expected among the 600,000 with the highest levels of exposure. The full version of the WHO health effects report adopted by the UN, published in April 2006, included the prediction of 5000 additional fatalities from significantly contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine and predicted that, in total, 9000 will die from cancer among the 6.8 million most-exposed Soviet citizens. This report is not free of controversy, and has been accused of trying to minimize the consequences of the accident.<p><a id="The_TORCH_report" name="The_TORCH_report"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The TORCH report</span></h3>

The report included areas not covered by the Chernobyl forum report, and also lower radiation doses. It predicted about 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths and warned that predictions of excess cancer deaths strongly depend on the risk factor used, and urged more research stating that large uncertainties made it difficult to properly asses the full scale of the disaster.<p><a id="Greenpeace" name="Greenpeace"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greenpeace</span></h3>

In its report, Greenpeace suggested there will be 270,000 cases of cancer attributable to Chernobyl fallout, and that 93,000 of these will probably be fatal, but state in their report that &ldquo;The most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine alone the accident could have resulted in an estimated 200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004.&rdquo; Blake Lee-Harwood, campaigns director at Greenpeace, believes that cancer was likely to be the cause of less than half of the final fatalities and that &quot;intestinal problems, heart and circulation problems, respiratory problems, <!--del_lnk--> endocrine problems, and particularly effects on the <!--del_lnk--> immune system,&quot; will also cause fatalities. However, concern has been expressed about the methods used in compiling the Greenpeace report.<p><a id="The_April_2006_IPPNW_report" name="The_April_2006_IPPNW_report"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The April 2006 IPPNW report</span></h3>

Indeed, results of analyses of time trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Europe do not, at present, indicate any increase in cancer rates - other than of thyroid cancer in the most contaminated regions - that can be clearly attributed to radiation from the Chernobyl accident.&quot; However, while undetectable, they estimate, based on the <!--del_lnk--> linear no threshold model of cancer effects, that 16,000 excess cancer deaths could be expected from the effects of the Chernobyl accident up to 2065.
