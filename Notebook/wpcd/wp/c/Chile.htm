</script><a id="Origin_of_the_name" name="Origin_of_the_name"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Origin of the name</span></h2>
      <p>There are various theories about the origin of the word <i>Chile.</i> According to one theory the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Incas</a> of Peru, who had failed to conquer the <!--del_lnk--> Araucanians, called the valley of the <!--del_lnk--> Aconcagua &quot;Chili&quot; by corruption of the name of a <!--del_lnk--> tribal chief (&quot;cacique&quot;) called <i>Tili</i>, who ruled the area at the time of the Incan conquest. Another theory points to the similarity of the valley of the Aconcagua with that of the <!--del_lnk--> Casma Valley in Peru, where there was a town and valley named <i>Chili.</i> Other theories say Chile may derive its name from the indigenous Mapuche word <i>chilli,</i> which may mean &quot;where the land ends,&quot; &quot;the deepest point of the Earth,&quot;, or &quot;sea gulls;&quot;  or from the <!--del_lnk--> Quechua <i>chin</i>, &quot;cold,&quot; or the Aymara <i>tchili</i> meaning &quot;snow.&quot; Another meaning attributed to <i>chilli</i> is the onomatopoeic <i>cheele-cheele</i>&mdash;the Mapuche imitation of a bird call. The Spanish <!--del_lnk--> conquistadors heard about this name from the Incas and the few survivors of <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Almagro&#39;s first Spanish expedition south from Peru in 1535-36 called themselves the &quot;men of Chilli.&quot;<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>About 10,000 years ago, migrating <!--del_lnk--> Native Americans settled in fertile valleys and along the coast of what is now Chile. The <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Incas</a> briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the area&#39;s barrenness prevented extensive settlement.<p>In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the earth, the Portuguese <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>, discovered the southern passage now named after him, the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Magellan. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of Spanish conquistadors, who came from Peru in 1535 seeking <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>. The Spanish encountered hundreds of thousands of Indians from various cultures in the area that modern Chile now occupies. These cultures supported themselves principally through slash-and-burn <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> hunting. The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by <!--del_lnk--> Pedro de Valdivia, one of <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro&#39;s lieutenants, who founded the city of <a href="../../wp/s/Santiago%252C_Chile.htm" title="Santiago, Chile">Santiago</a> on <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile&#39;s central valley, and Chile became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Conquest of the land that is today called Chile took place only gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks at the hands of the local population. A massive <!--del_lnk--> Mapuche insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia&#39;s death and the destruction of many of the colony&#39;s principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> in 1683 defused tensions on the frontier between the colony and the Mapuche land to the south, and permitted increased trade between colonists and the Mapuche.<p>The drive for independence from Spain was precipitated by usurpation of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish throne by <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>&#39;s brother Joseph in 1808. A national junta in the name of Ferdinand&mdash;heir to the deposed king&mdash;was formed on <!--del_lnk--> September 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1810. The <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>. A movement for total independence soon won a wide following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Reconquista&quot; led to a prolonged struggle.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Intermittent warfare continued until 1817, when an army led by <!--del_lnk--> Bernardo O&#39;Higgins, Chile&#39;s most renowned patriot, and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; de San Mart&iacute;n, hero of the <!--del_lnk--> Argentine War of Independence, crossed the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> into Chile and defeated the royalists. On <!--del_lnk--> February 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1818, Chile was proclaimed an independent republic under O&#39;Higgins&#39; leadership. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

      <p>Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by ruthlessly suppressing the <!--del_lnk--> Mapuche Indians. In 1881, it signed a treaty with Argentina confirming Chilean sovereignty over the <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Magellan. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879&ndash;83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia&#39;s access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. The <!--del_lnk--> Chilean Civil War in 1891 brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a parliamentary style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Hence the Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and <!--del_lnk--> working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, <!--del_lnk--> Arturo Alessandri Palma, whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. Alessandri Palma&#39;s reformist tendencies were partly tempered later by an admiration for some elements of <!--del_lnk--> Mussolini&#39;s Italian Corporate State. In the 1920s, <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> groups with strong popular support arose.<p>A military coup led by General <!--del_lnk--> Luis Altamirano in 1924 set off a period of great political instability that lasted until 1932. The longest lasting of the ten governments between those years was that of General <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez del Campo, who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a de facto dictatorship, although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, and certainly not comparable to the violent and repressive regime of <!--del_lnk--> Augusto Pinochet decades later. By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of <!--del_lnk--> Radical Party dominance (1932&ndash;52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez del Campo, now reincarnated as a sort of Chilean <!--del_lnk--> Per&oacute;n, to office for another six years. <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Alessandri succeeded Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.<p>The 1964 presidential election of <!--del_lnk--> Christian Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Frei Montalva by an <!--del_lnk--> absolute majority initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan &quot;Revolution in Liberty,&quot; the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and <!--del_lnk--> agrarian reform, including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had accomplished many noteworthy objectives, but he had not fully achieved his party&#39;s ambitious goals.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>In 1970, Senator <!--del_lnk--> Salvador Allende Gossens, a Marxist physician and member of Chile&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Party, who headed the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Popular Unity&quot; (UP or &quot;Unidad Popular&quot;) coalition of the Socialist, Communist, Radical, and Social-Democratic Parties, along with dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement (MAPU), and the Independent Popular Action, won a <!--del_lnk--> plurality of votes in a three-way contest. Despite pressure from the government of the United States, the <!--del_lnk--> Chilean Congress, keeping with tradition, conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president <!--del_lnk--> Jorge Alessandri and chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers party and could not make common cause with the oligarchs.<p>Allende&#39;s program included advancement of workers&#39; interests; a thoroughgoing implementation of agrarian reform; the reorganization of the national economy into socialized, mixed, and private sectors; a foreign policy of &quot;international solidarity&quot; and national independence; and a new institutional order (the &quot;people&#39;s state&quot; or &quot;poder popular&quot;), including the institution of a unicameral congress. The Popular Unity platform also called for nationalization of foreign (U.S.) ownership of Chile&#39;s major <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a> mines.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> economic depression that began in 1967 peaked in 1970, exacerbated by <!--del_lnk--> capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits by those opposed to Allende&#39;s socialist program. Production fell and <!--del_lnk--> unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private <!--del_lnk--> public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the <!--del_lnk--> banking sector was <!--del_lnk--> nationalized. Many enterprises within the <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nitrate, and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> industries were <!--del_lnk--> expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration&#39;s first year.<p>Other reforms undertaken during the early Allende period included redistribution of millions of hectares of land to landless agricultural workers as part of the agrarian reform program, giving the armed forces an overdue pay increase, and providing free <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a> to children. The Indian Peoples Development Corporation and the Mapuche Vocational Institute were founded to address the needs of Chile&#39;s indigenous population.<p>The nationalization of U.S. and other foreign-owned companies led to increased tensions with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Nixon</a> administration brought international financial pressure to bear in order to restrict economic credit to Chile. Simultaneously, the <!--del_lnk--> CIA funded opposition media, politicians, and organizations, helping to accelerate a campaign of domestic destabilization. By 1972, the economic progress of Allende&#39;s first year had been reversed and the economy was in crisis. Political polarization increased, and large mobilizations of both pro- and anti-government groups became frequent, often leading to clashes.<p>By early 1973, <!--del_lnk--> inflation was out of control. The crippled economy was further battered by prolonged and sometimes simultaneous <!--del_lnk--> strikes by physicians, teachers, students, truck owners, copper workers, and the small business class. A <!--del_lnk--> military coup overthrew Allende on <!--del_lnk--> September 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1973. As the armed forces bombarded the <!--del_lnk--> presidential palace (Palacio de La Moneda), Allende reportedly committed suicide . A military government, led by General <!--del_lnk--> Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, took over control of the country. The first years of the regime were marked by serious <!--del_lnk--> human rights violations. On October 1973, at least 70 persons were murdered by the <!--del_lnk--> Caravan of Death. At least a thousand people were executed during the first six months of Pinochet in office, and at least two thousand more were killed during the next sixteen years, as reported by the Rettig Report. Some 30,000 were forced to flee the country, and tens of thousands of people were detained and tortured, as investigated by the 2004 Valech Commission. A new <!--del_lnk--> Constitution was approved by a highly irregular and undemocratic <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite characterized by the absence of registration lists, on <!--del_lnk--> September 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1980, and General Pinochet became President of the Republic for an 8-year term.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the late 1980s, the regime gradually permitted greater freedom of assembly, <!--del_lnk--> speech, and association, to include trade union and limited political activity. The right-wing military government pursued decidedly <i><!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire</i> economic policies. During its nearly 17 years in power, Chile moved away from economic statism toward a largely <!--del_lnk--> free market economy that saw an increase in domestic and foreign private investment, although the copper industry and other important mineral resources were not returned to foreign ownership. In a plebiscite on <!--del_lnk--> October 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1988, General Pinochet was denied a second 8-year term as president (56% against 44%). Chileans elected a new president and the majority of members of a two-chamber congress on <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1989. Christian Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Patricio Aylwin, the candidate of a coalition of 17 political parties called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Concertaci&oacute;n</i>, received an absolute majority of votes (55%). President Aylwin served from 1990 to 1994, in what was considered a transition period.<p>In December 1993, Christian Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, the son of previous president <!--del_lnk--> Eduardo Frei Montalva, led the Concertaci&oacute;n coalition to victory with an absolute majority of votes (58%). Frei Ruiz-Tagle was succeeded in 2000 by Socialist <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo Lagos, who won the presidency in a unprecedented <!--del_lnk--> runoff election against <!--del_lnk--> Joaqu&iacute;n Lav&iacute;n of the rightist <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for Chile. In January 2006 Chileans elected their first woman president, <!--del_lnk--> Michelle Bachelet Jeria, of the Socialist Party. She was sworn in on <!--del_lnk--> March 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, continuing the <i>Concertaci&oacute;n</i> coalition governance for another four years.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Chile&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Constitution was approved in a highly irregular national <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite in September 1980, under the <!--del_lnk--> military <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet&#39;s defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the Constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and <!--del_lnk--> senators for life, granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<p>Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. None of the four presidential candidates won more than 50% of the vote. As a result, the top two vote-getters&mdash;centre-left Concertaci&oacute;n coalition&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Michelle Bachelet and centre-right Alianza coalition&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era&mdash;competed in a run-off election on <!--del_lnk--> January 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, which Michelle Bachelet won. She was sworn in on <!--del_lnk--> March 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. This was Chile&rsquo;s fourth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All four have been judged free and fair. The President is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.<p>Chile&#39;s bicameral <!--del_lnk--> Congress has a 38-seat <!--del_lnk--> Senate and a 120-member <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies. Senators serve for 8 years with staggered terms, while Deputies are elected every 4 years. The current Senate has a 20-18 split in favour of pro-government Senators. The last congressional elections were held in <!--del_lnk--> December 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, concurrently with the presidential election. The current lower house&mdash;the Chamber of Deputies&mdash;contains 63 members of the governing center-left coalition and 57 from the centre-right opposition. The Congress is located in the port city of <a href="../../wp/v/Valpara%25C3%25ADso.htm" title="Valpara&iacute;so">Valpara&iacute;so</a>, about 140 kilometers (84 mi.) west of the capital, <a href="../../wp/s/Santiago%252C_Chile.htm" title="Santiago, Chile">Santiago</a>.<p>Chile&#39;s congressional elections are governed by a binomial system that rewards large representations. Therefore, there are only Senate and two Deputy seats apportioned to each electoral district, parties are forced to form wide coalitions and historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci&oacute;n and Alianza) split most of the seats in a district. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second-place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats. In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative <!--del_lnk--> Independent Democratic Union surpassed the <!--del_lnk--> Christian Democrats for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In 2005, both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the <!--del_lnk--> UDI lost representation in favour of their respective allies <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Party (which became the biggest party in the Concertaci&oacute;n block) and <!--del_lnk--> National Renewal in the right-wing alliance. The <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party again failed to gain any seats in the election. (<i>See</i> <!--del_lnk--> Chilean parliamentary election, 2005.)<p>Chile&#39;s judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court. In June 2005, Chile completed a nation-wide overhaul of its criminal justice system. The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Chile is divided into 13 <!--del_lnk--> regions, each of which is headed by an <i>intendente</i> appointed by the President. Every region is further divided into <!--del_lnk--> provinces with a <i>Gobernador Provincial</i>, also appointed by the President. Finally each province is divided into <!--del_lnk--> municipalities. which are sometimes referred to as <!--del_lnk--> comunas, each with its own mayor, and <!--del_lnk--> councilors, known as <i>concejales</i> elected by their inhabitants.<p>Each region is designated by a name and a <!--del_lnk--> Roman numeral, assigned from north to south. In general, the Roman numeral is used, rather than the name. The only exception is the region where Santiago is situated, which is designated <i>RM</i>, that stands for <i>Regi&oacute;n Metropolitana</i>, <i>Metropolitan Region</i>.<p>In 2005, the Chilean congress passed a reform to create two new regions, one in the north, around the city of <!--del_lnk--> Arica, and one in the south centered around <!--del_lnk--> Valdivia (aka Region of the Rivers). Being designated by numerals XIV and XV, both break the geographical numerical order from north to south. There is speculation that the numeral system will be dropped in favour of their formal names.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>A long and narrow coastal <!--del_lnk--> Southern Cone country on the west side of the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> Mountains, Chile stretches over 4,630 <!--del_lnk--> kilometers (2,880&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) north to south, but only 430 kilometers (265&nbsp;mi) at its widest point east to west.

It is comparable in size to <a href="../../wp/z/Zambia.htm" title="Zambia">Zambia</a>, and is somewhat larger than the US state of <!--del_lnk--> Texas.<p>The northern <!--del_lnk--> Atacama desert contains great mineral wealth, primarily copper and <!--del_lnk--> nitrates. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes <a href="../../wp/s/Santiago%252C_Chile.htm" title="Santiago, Chile">Santiago</a>, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area also is the historical centre from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a> and <!--del_lnk--> lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of <!--del_lnk--> fjords, <!--del_lnk--> inlets, <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a>, twisting <!--del_lnk--> peninsulas, and <!--del_lnk--> islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border. Chile is the longest (N-S) country in the world (over 4,200&nbsp;km&nbsp;/&nbsp;2,600&nbsp;mi), and also claims 1,250,000 square kilometers (482,628&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> sq. mi) of <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> as part of its territory.

      <p>After a decade of impressive growth rates, Chile experienced a moderate downturn in 1999, brought on by the global economic slowdown. The economy remained sluggish until 2003, when it began to show clear signs of recovery, achieving 3.3% real <!--del_lnk--> GDP growth. The Chilean economy finished 2004 with growth of 6.1%. Chile was on track to achieve real GDP growth of around 6% in 2005, mainly due to record-level copper prices.<p>Chile has pursued generally sound economic policies for nearly three decades. The 1973-90 military government sold many state-owned companies, and the three democratic governments since 1990 have continued <!--del_lnk--> privatization, though at a slower pace. The government&#39;s role in the economy is mostly limited to regulation, although the state continues to operate copper giant <!--del_lnk--> CODELCO and a few other enterprises. Chile is strongly committed to free trade and has welcomed large amounts of <!--del_lnk--> foreign investment. Chile has signed <!--del_lnk--> free trade agreements (FTAs) with several important economies, including an FTA with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, which was signed in 2003 and implemented in January 2004. Over the last several years, Chile has signed FTAs with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>.

High domestic savings and investment rates also helped propel Chile&#39;s economy to average growth rates of 8% during the 1990s. The privatized national <!--del_lnk--> pension system (AFP) has encouraged domestic investment and contributed to an estimated total domestic savings rate of approximately 21% of GDP. However, the AFP is not without its critics, who cite low coverage rates (only 55% of the working population is covered) with whole groups such as the self-employed outside the system. There has also been criticism of the inefficiency and high costs due to a lack of competition among pension funds. Critics cite loopholes in the use of pension savings through lump sum withdraws for the purchase of a second home or payment of university fees as fundamental weaknesses of the AFP.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Unemployment has hovered in the 8%-10% range in recent years, well above the 5%-6% average for the 1990s. Unemployment remained at 8.8% at the end of 2004 in spite of strong economic growth. Most international observers blame the high unemployment rate on Chile&rsquo;s complicated and restrictive <!--del_lnk--> labor laws. Wages have risen faster than <!--del_lnk--> inflation as a result of higher productivity, boosting national <!--del_lnk--> living standards. The percentage of Chileans with incomes below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line&mdash;defined as twice the cost of satisfying a person&#39;s minimal nutritional needs&mdash;fell from 46% in 1987 to around 18.8% in 2005 as proclaimed by the then president <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo Lagos. Critics in Chile, however, argue true poverty figures are considerably higher than those officially published. In 2006, according to statistics released by Chile&#39;s CAS Inform&aacute;tica, around 58% of Chileans lived near or below poverty levels; 20.6% in extreme poverty. Despite enjoying a comparatively higher GDP and more robust economy compared to most other countries of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, Chile also suffers from one of the most uneven <!--del_lnk--> distributions of wealth in the world, ahead only of <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> in the Latin American region and lagging behind even of most developing <a href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan African</a> nations. Chile&#39;s top 10 richest percentile possesses 47 percent of the country&#39;s wealth. In relation to income distribution, some 6.2% of the country populates the upper economic income bracket, 15% the middle bracket, 21% the lower middle, 38% the lower bracket, and 20% the extreme poor.<p>Chile&#39;s independent <!--del_lnk--> Central Bank pursues a policy of maintaining inflation between 2% and 4%. Inflation has not exceeded 5% since 1998. Chile registered an inflation rate of 2.4% in 2004. In 2005, inflation reached an estimated 3.7%. Stronger than expected domestic demand coupled with higher worldwide energy prices led to most of the inflationary rise in 2005. The Chilean peso&rsquo;s rapid appreciation against the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2005 helped keep down inflation while at the same time the strengthening peso played a role in the stronger than expected domestic consumption. Most wage settlements and spending decisions are indexed, reducing inflation&#39;s volatility. Under the compulsory private pension system, most formal sector employees pay 10% of their salaries into privately managed funds.<p>Total foreign direct investment rose to $7.1 billion in 2004, up from $2.5 billion in 2003. Both foreign and domestic investment in Chile had declined during the country&rsquo;s period of slower economic growth from 1999-2003, but both now appear to be recovering strongly. The Chilean Government committed in early 2002 to undertake a series of <!--del_lnk--> microeconomic reforms designed to create new incentives for private investment. The government also has encouraged the use of Chile as an &quot;investment platform&quot; for multinational corporations planning to operate in the region. Chile&#39;s welcoming attitude toward foreign direct investment is codified in the country&#39;s Foreign Investment Law, which gives foreign investors the same treatment as Chileans. Registration is simple and transparent, and foreign investors are guaranteed access to the official foreign exchange market to repatriate their profits and capital. The U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement offers a number of other investor protections.<p><a id="Foreign_Trade" name="Foreign_Trade"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Foreign Trade</span></h3>

      <p>Chile&#39;s economy is highly dependent on international trade. In 2005, exports accounted for about 39% of GDP. That figure was somewhat distorted by world-record copper prices. Chile&rsquo;s overall trade profile has traditionally been dependent upon copper exports, and the rise in copper prices has reinforced it further. The state-owned firm CODELCO is the world&#39;s largest copper-producing company with recorded copper reserves of 200 years. Chile has made an effort to expand nontraditional exports. In 1975, non-mineral exports made up just over 30% of total exports, whereas now they account for about 60%. The most important non-mineral exports are <!--del_lnk--> forestry and wood products, fresh fruit and <!--del_lnk--> processed food, fishmeal and seafood, and wine. The trade balance for 2005 showed a surplus of $8 billion. Total exports in 2005 were $38 billion, up nearly 20% from 2004. Chile&#39;s export markets are fairly balanced among <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> (25.1%), <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> (33.1%), <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> (15.7%), and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> (19%). The U.S., the largest national market, takes in 17.3% of Chile&#39;s exports. Since the implementation of the U.S.-Chile FTA in January 2004, bilateral trade has increased 85%.<p>Asia has been the fastest-growing export market in recent years. For example, Chile&rsquo;s number two, three, and four trading partners are China, Japan, and South Korea, respectively. Chile&rsquo;s recent FTAs with Asian trading partners and plans to sign more in 2006 underscore the growing importance of Asia to Chile&rsquo;s trade portfolio.<p>Chilean imports increased 32% in 2005, to $30 billion (est.), reflecting a positive change in consumer demand and overall economic recovery. Capital goods made up about 66% of total imports. The United States provided 13.7% (est.) of Chilean imports in 2005. Chile unilaterally lowered its across-the-board import tariff&mdash;for all countries with which it does not have a trade agreement&mdash;to 6% in 2003.<p>Higher effective tariffs are charged only on imports of wheat, wheat flour, and sugar as a result of a system of import price bands. The price bands were ruled inconsistent with Chile&#39;s <a href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) obligations in 2002, and the government has introduced legislation to modify them. Also, Chile will have to phase out the price bands within 12 years under the terms of the U.S.-Chile FTA.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Successive Chilean governments have actively pursued trade-liberalizing agreements. During the 1990s, Chile signed FTAs with Canada, Mexico, and Central America. Chile also concluded preferential trade agreements with <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>.

Continuing its export-oriented development strategy, Chile completed landmark free trade agreements in 2002 with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>. Chile, as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization, is seeking to boost commercial ties to Asian markets. To that end, it has signed FTAs in recent years with <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, and most recently the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>. In 2006, Chile has begun FTA negotiations with <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>After two years of negotiations, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and Chile signed an agreement in June 2003. The agreement will lead to completely duty-free bilateral trade within 12 years. The U.S.-Chile FTA entered into force January 1, 2004 following approval by the U.S. and Chilean congresses. The bilateral FTA has inaugurated greatly expanded U.S.-Chilean trade ties. Chile is a strong proponent of pressing ahead on negotiations for a <!--del_lnk--> Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) and active in the WTO&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> Doha round of negotiations, principally through its membership in the <!--del_lnk--> G-20 and <!--del_lnk--> Cairns Group.<p><a id="Finance" name="Finance"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Finance</span></h3>

      <p>Chile&#39;s financial sector has grown faster than other areas of the economy over the last few years; a banking reform law approved in 1997 broadened the scope of permissible foreign activity for Chilean banks. The Chilean Government implemented a further liberalization of <!--del_lnk--> capital markets in 2001. Chileans have enjoyed the recent introduction of new financial tools such as home <!--del_lnk--> equity loans, currency futures and options, <!--del_lnk--> factoring, <!--del_lnk--> leasing, and <!--del_lnk--> debit cards. The introduction of these new products has also been accompanied by an increased use of traditional instruments such as loans and <!--del_lnk--> credit cards. Chile&#39;s private pension system, with assets worth roughly $54 billion at the end of 2004, has been an important source of investment capital for the capital market.<p>Chile maintains one of the best credit ratings (S&amp;P A+) in Latin America. There are three main ways for Chilean firms to raise funds abroad: bank loans, issuance of bonds, and the selling of stocks on U.S. markets through American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Nearly all of the funds raised through these means go to finance domestic Chilean investment. The government continues to pay down its foreign debt. Combined public and private foreign debt was roughly 50% of GDP at the end of 2004&mdash;low by Latin American standards.<p><a id="Defense" name="Defense"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Defense</span></h2>

      <p>Relative to its overall population, Chile never experienced any large scale wave of immigrants. The total number of immigrants to Chile, both originating from other Latin American countries and all other (mostly European) countries, never surpassed 4% of its total population. This is not to say that immigrants were not important to the evolution of Chilean society and the Chilean nation. Some non-Spanish <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> immigrants arrived in Chile - mainly to the northern and southern extremities of the country - during the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> and <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th</a> centuries, including <!--del_lnk--> English, <!--del_lnk--> Germans <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_people.htm" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Italians, <!--del_lnk--> French, <!--del_lnk--> Croatians and other former <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavians</a>.

      <p>Northern Chile was an important centre of culture in the medieval and early modern <!--del_lnk--> Inca empire, while the central and southern regions were areas of <!--del_lnk--> Mapuche cultural activities. Throught the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country&#39;s culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English and French, began in the 19th century and have continued until today.<p>The national dance is the <!--del_lnk--> cueca. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the <!--del_lnk--> Parra family with the <!--del_lnk--> Nueva Canci&oacute;n Chilena, which was associated with political activists and reformers, and by the <!--del_lnk--> folk <!--del_lnk--> singer and <!--del_lnk--> researcher on <a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">folklore</a> and Chilean <!--del_lnk--> ethnography, <!--del_lnk--> Margot Loyola.<p>Chileans call their country <i>pa&iacute;s de poetas</i> &#39;land of poets&#39;. <!--del_lnk--> Gabriela Mistral was the first Chilean to win a Nobel Prize for Literature (1945). Chile&#39;s most famous poet, however, is <!--del_lnk--> Pablo Neruda, who also won the Nobel Prize (1971) and is world-renowned for his extensive library of works on romance, nature, and politics.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Chilean Spanish is notoriously difficult for foreigners to understand due to the dropping of final syllables and &#39;s&#39; sounds, the very soft pronunciation of some consonants and the high levels of slang employed, particularly in Santiago and the surrounding areas. Chileans also tend to speak much faster than natives of neighboring countries. These factors all contribute to newly arrived visitors to the country, even proficient Spanish speakers, hearing no more than indecipherable mumbles in early encounters with locals. Books have been written (such as &#39;How to survive in the Chilean Jungle&#39; by John Brennan and Alvaro Taboada) which attempt to detail and explain the difficulties and idiosyncrasies of Chilean Spanish.<p><!--del_lnk--> English language learning and teaching is popular among students and higher professions, although with varying degrees of success.
