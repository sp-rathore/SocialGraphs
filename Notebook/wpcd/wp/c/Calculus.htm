      <p><b>Calculus</b> is an important branch of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>. The word stems from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks&#39;</a> use of pebbles arranged in patterns to study <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. The <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> word for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pebble&quot; is &quot;calculus.&quot; Two complementary disciplines comprise calculus, both of which rely on the concept of a <b><!--del_lnk--> limit</b>. The first is <b><!--del_lnk--> differential calculus</b>, which is concerned with the instantaneous, as opposed to average, rate of change of a quantity. This can be illustrated by the <!--del_lnk--> slope of a function&#39;s graph at a particular point. The second is <b><!--del_lnk--> integral calculus</b>, which studies the accumulation of infinitely small quantities, summing to areas under a <!--del_lnk--> curve, linear <!--del_lnk--> distance travelled, or <!--del_lnk--> volume displaced. These two processes act inversely to each other, as shown by the <!--del_lnk--> fundamental theorem of calculus.<p>Differential calculus typically provides a way to derive the <a href="../../wp/a/Acceleration.htm" title="Acceleration">acceleration</a> and <!--del_lnk--> velocity of a body at a particular moment while integral calculus problems are used to compute <!--del_lnk--> areas and <!--del_lnk--> volumes, to find the amount of a liquid pumped by a pump with a set power input but varying conditions of pumping losses and pressure, or to find the amount of parking lot plowed by a snowplow of given power with varying rates of snowfall.<p>In <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, fundamental advances in calculus during the 17th and 18th century had a deep impact on the ensuing development of <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>. Today, calculus is used in every branch of the <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_science.htm" title="Physical science">physical sciences</a>, in <a href="../../wp/c/Computer_science.htm" title="Computer science">computer science</a>, in <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, and in <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>; in <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">business</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>; and as a general method whenever the goal is an <!--del_lnk--> optimal solution to a problem that can be given in mathematical form.<p>

      <p>Historians generally regard integral calculus as going back no further than to the time of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greeks</a>, circa 200 BC. Modern sources generally credit <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> mathematician <!--del_lnk--> Eudoxus with the <!--del_lnk--> method of exhaustion, which made it possible to compute the areas of regions and the volumes of solids. <a href="../../wp/a/Archimedes.htm" title="Archimedes">Archimedes</a> developed this idea further, inventing <!--del_lnk--> heuristics which resemble <!--del_lnk--> integral calculus. After him, the development of calculus did not advance appreciably for over 500 years.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> India, the mathematician-astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Aryabhata in <!--del_lnk--> 499 used <!--del_lnk--> infinitesimals and expressed an astronomical problem in the form of a basic <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a>. Manjula, in the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a>, elaborated on this differential equation in a commentary. This equation eventually led <!--del_lnk--> Bhaskara in the 12th century to develop independently a number of fundamental ideas in calculus, perhaps including an early form of the theorem now known as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Rolle&#39;s theorem&quot;. He was also the first to define the notion of the <!--del_lnk--> derivative as a <!--del_lnk--> limit. In the 14th century, <!--del_lnk--> Madhava, along with other mathematician-astronomers of the <!--del_lnk--> Kerala School, studied <!--del_lnk--> infinite series, <!--del_lnk--> power series, <!--del_lnk--> Taylor series, <!--del_lnk--> differentiation, <!--del_lnk--> integration, and the mean value theorem. <i><!--del_lnk--> Yuktibhasa</i>, which some consider to be the first text on calculus, summarizes these results. These developments would not be duplicated in Europe until much later.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Calculus started making great strides in Europe towards the end of the <!--del_lnk--> early modern period and into the first years of the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century. This was a time of major innovation in Europe. Calculus provided a new method in <!--del_lnk--> mathematical physics to solve long-standing problems. Several mathematicians contributed to these breakthroughs, notably <!--del_lnk--> John Wallis and <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Barrow. <!--del_lnk--> James Gregory proved a special case of the <!--del_lnk--> second fundamental theorem of calculus in 1668. In <!--del_lnk--> Japan at around this time, <!--del_lnk--> Seki Kowa expanded further upon <!--del_lnk--> Eudoxus&#39;s method of exhaustion.<p><a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> pulled these ideas together into a coherent whole and they are usually credited with the probably independent and nearly simultaneous &quot;invention&quot; of calculus. Newton was the first to apply calculus to general <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and Leibniz developed much of the notation used in calculus today; he often spent days determining appropriate symbols for concepts. The fundamental insight that both Newton and Leibniz had was the <!--del_lnk--> fundamental theorem of calculus. Virtually all modern methods of symbolic integration follow from this theorem, and it proved indispensable in the development of modern mathematics and physics. For example, see <!--del_lnk--> Integration by parts and <!--del_lnk--> Integration by substitution.<p>When Newton and Leibniz first published their results, whether Leibniz&#39;s work was independent of Newton&#39;s was somewhat controversial. While Newton had derived his results years before Leibniz, Newton published only some time after Leibniz published in 1684. Later, Newton would claim that Leibniz got the idea from Newton&#39;s notes on the subject; however examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton show they arrived at their results independently, with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation. This controversy between Leibniz and Newton divided English-speaking mathematicians from those in Europe for many years, which slowed the development of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematical_analysis.htm" title="Mathematical analysis">mathematical analysis</a>. Today, both Newton and Leibniz are given credit for developing calculus independently. It is Leibniz, however, who is credited with giving the new discipline the name it is known by today: &quot;calculus&quot;. Newton&#39;s name for it was &quot;the science of fluxions&quot;. Some others who contributed important ideas are <a href="../../wp/r/Ren%25C3%25A9_Descartes.htm" title="Ren&eacute; Descartes">Descartes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Barrow, <!--del_lnk--> Fermat, <!--del_lnk--> Huygens, and <!--del_lnk--> Wallis.<p>Since the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing development of calculus. In the 19th century, calculus was put on a much more rigorous footing by <!--del_lnk--> Cauchy, <!--del_lnk--> Riemann, <!--del_lnk--> Weierstrass, and others. It was also during this time period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to <!--del_lnk--> Euclidean space and the <!--del_lnk--> complex plane. Calculus continues to be further generalized, such as with the development of the <!--del_lnk--> Lebesgue integral in 1900.<p><a id="Derivatives_and_Differentiation" name="Derivatives_and_Differentiation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Derivatives and Differentiation</span></h2>

      <p>The derivative measures the sensitivity of one variable to small changes in another variable. Consider the formula:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\mathrm{Speed} = \frac{\mathrm{Distance}}{\mathrm{Time}}" class="tex" src="../../images/195/19540.png" /></dl>
      <p>for an object moving at constant speed. The speed of a car, as measured by the <!--del_lnk--> speedometer, is the derivative of the car&#39;s distance traveled as a function of time. Calculus is a mathematical tool for dealing with this complex but natural and familiar situation.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Differential calculus can be used to determine the instantaneous speed at any given instant, while the formula &quot;speed = distance divided by time&quot; only gives the average speed, and cannot be applied to an instant in time because it then gives an undefined quotient <!--del_lnk--> zero divided by zero. Calculus avoids division by zero by using the concept of the <!--del_lnk--> limit which, roughly speaking, is a method of controlling an otherwise uncontrollable output, such as division by zero or multiplication by infinity. More formally, differential calculus defines the instantaneous rate of change (the <b>derivative</b>) of a <!--del_lnk--> mathematical function&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> value, with respect to changes of the <!--del_lnk--> variable. The derivative is defined as a limit of a <!--del_lnk--> difference quotient.<p>The derivative of a function, if it exists, gives information about its graph. It is useful for finding optimum solutions to problems, called <!--del_lnk--> maxima and minima of a function. It is proved mathematically that these optimum solutions exist either where the <!--del_lnk--> tangent of the graph is flat, so that the slope is zero; or where the graph has a sharp turn (<!--del_lnk--> cusp) where the derivative does not exist; or at the endpoints of the graph. Another application of differential calculus is <!--del_lnk--> Newton&#39;s method, a powerful equation solving <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a>. Differential calculus has been applied to many questions that were first formulated in other areas, such as business or medicine.<p>The derivative lies at the heart of the <a href="../../wp/p/Physical_science.htm" title="Physical science">physical sciences</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Newton&#39;s second law of motion expressly uses the term &quot;rate of change&quot; which is the derivative: <i>The</i> <b>rate of change</b> <i>of momentum of a body is equal to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.</i> Even the common expression of Newton&#39;s second law as: Force&nbsp;=&nbsp;Mass&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;Acceleration, involves differential calculus because acceleration is the derivative of velocity. (See <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">Differential equation</a>.) Maxwell&#39;s theory of <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetism and <a href="../../wp/a/Albert_Einstein.htm" title="Albert Einstein">Einstein&#39;s</a> theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity are also expressed in the language of differential calculus, as is the basic theory of <!--del_lnk--> electrical circuits and much of <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>. It is also applied to problems in <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a>, and many other areas.<p>The derivative of a function <i>y = f(x)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> is usually expressed as either <i>y</i> &prime; (read &quot;<i>y</i>-prime&quot;), <i>f &#39; (x)</i> (read &quot;<i>f</i>-prime of x&quot;) or using <!--del_lnk--> Leibniz notation to write:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\frac{d}{dx}(y)" class="tex" src="../../images/195/19541.png" /></dl>

      <p>There are two types of integral in calculus, the indefinite and the definite. The indefinite integral is simply the antiderivative. That is, F is an antiderivative of f when f is a derivative of F. (This use of capital letters and lower case letters is common in calculus. The lower case letter represents the derivative of the capital letter.)<p>The definite integral evaluates the cumulative effect of many small changes in a quantity. The simplest instance is the formula<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\mathrm{Distance} = \mathrm{Speed} \cdot \mathrm{Time}" class="tex" src="../../images/195/19543.png" /></dl>
      <p>for calculating the distance a car moves during a period of time when it is traveling at <i>constant</i> speed. The distance moved is the cumulative effect of the small distances moved in each instant. Calculus is also able to deal with the natural situation in which the car moves with changing speed.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Integral calculus determines the exact distance traveled during an interval of time by creating a series of better and better <!--del_lnk--> approximations, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Riemann sums</i>, that approach the exact distance as a limit. More formally, we say that the definite integral of a function on an interval is a <!--del_lnk--> limit of Riemann sum approximations.<p>Applications of integral calculus arise whenever the problem is to compute a number that is in principle (approximately) equal to the sum of a large number of small quantities. The classic geometric application is to area computations. In principle, the area of a region can be approximated by chopping it up into many pieces (typically <!--del_lnk--> rectangles, or, in <a href="../../wp/p/Polar_coordinate_system.htm" title="Polar coordinate system">polar coordinates</a>, <!--del_lnk--> circular sectors), and then adding the areas of those pieces. The length of an <!--del_lnk--> arc, the <!--del_lnk--> area of a surface, and the volume of a solid can also be expressed as definite integrals. <!--del_lnk--> Probability, the basis for <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, provides another important application of integral calculus.<p>The symbol of integration is <b>&int;</b>, a stretched <i>s</i> (which stands for &quot;sum&quot;). The precise meanings of expressions involving integrals can be found in the main article <!--del_lnk--> Integral. The definite integral, written as:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\int_a^b f(x)\, dx" class="tex" src="../../images/195/19545.png" /></dl>
      <p>is read &quot;the integral from a to b of f-of-x dx&quot;.<p><a id="Foundations" name="Foundations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foundations</span></h2>
      <p>There is more than one <!--del_lnk--> rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. The usual one is via the concept of <!--del_lnk--> limits defined on the <!--del_lnk--> continuum of <!--del_lnk--> real numbers. An alternative is <!--del_lnk--> nonstandard analysis, in which the real number system is augmented with <!--del_lnk--> infinitesimal and <!--del_lnk--> infinite numbers. The tools of calculus include techniques associated with <a href="../../wp/e/Elementary_algebra.htm" title="Elementary algebra">elementary algebra</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> mathematical induction. The foundations of calculus are included in the field of <!--del_lnk--> real analysis, which contains all full definitions and <!--del_lnk--> proofs of the theorems of calculus as well as generalisations such as <!--del_lnk--> measure theory and <!--del_lnk--> distribution theory.<p><a id="Fundamental_theorem" name="Fundamental_theorem"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fundamental theorem</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> fundamental theorem of calculus states that differentiation and integration are, in a certain sense, inverse operations. More precisely, if one defines one function as the integral of another continuous function, then differentiating the newly defined function returns the function you started with. Furthermore, if you want to find the value of a definite integral, you usually do so by evaluating an antiderivative.<p>Here is the mathematical formulation of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: If a function <i>f</i> is <!--del_lnk--> continuous on the interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>] and if <i>F</i> is a function whose derivative is <i>f</i> on the interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>], then<dl>
       <dd><img alt="\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)." class="tex" src="../../images/195/19546.png" /></dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>Also, for every <i>x</i> in the interval [<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>],</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><img alt="\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\, dt = f(x)." class="tex" src="../../images/195/19547.png" /></dl>
      <p>This realization, made by both <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Gottfried_Leibniz.htm" title="Gottfried Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, was key to the massive proliferation of analytic results after their work became known. The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic method of computing many definite integrals&mdash;without performing limit processes&mdash;by finding formulas for <!--del_lnk--> antiderivatives. It is also a prototype solution of a <a href="../../wp/d/Differential_equation.htm" title="Differential equation">differential equation</a>. Differential equations relate an unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.<p><a id="Applications" name="Applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>
      <p>The development and use of calculus has had wide reaching effects on all areas of modern living. It underlies nearly all of the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">sciences</a>, especially <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>. Virtually all modern developments such as <!--del_lnk--> building techniques, <!--del_lnk--> aviation, and other <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technologies</a> make fundamental use of calculus. Many algebraic formulas now used for ballistics, heating and cooling, and other practical sciences were worked out through the use of calculus. In a handbook, an algebraic formula based on calculus methods may be applied without knowing its origins.
