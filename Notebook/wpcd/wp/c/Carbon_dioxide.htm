      <p>Atmospheric carbon dioxide derives from multiple natural sources including <!--del_lnk--> volcanic outgassing, the <!--del_lnk--> combustion of <!--del_lnk--> organic matter, and the <!--del_lnk--> respiration processes of living aerobic organisms; man-made sources of carbon dioxide come mainly from the burning of various fossil fuels for <!--del_lnk--> power generation and <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a> use. It is also produced by various <!--del_lnk--> microorganisms from <!--del_lnk--> fermentation and <!--del_lnk--> cellular respiration. <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">Plants</a> convert carbon dioxide to oxygen during a process called <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, using both the carbon and the oxygen to construct <!--del_lnk--> carbohydrates. In addition, plants also release oxygen to the atmosphere, which is subsequently used for respiration by <!--del_lnk--> heterotrophic organisms, forming a <!--del_lnk--> cycle.<p><a id="Chemical_and_physical_properties" name="Chemical_and_physical_properties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical and physical properties</span></h2>
      <p>Carbon dioxide is a <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colorless</a> gas which, when inhaled at high concentrations (a dangerous activity because of the associated <!--del_lnk--> asphyxiation risk), produces a sour taste in the mouth and a stinging sensation in the nose and throat. These effects result from the gas dissolving in the <!--del_lnk--> mucous membranes and <!--del_lnk--> saliva, forming a weak solution of <!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid. You may notice this sensation if you attempt to stifle a burp after drinking a carbonated beverage.<p>Its density at 25 &deg;C is 1.98 kg m<sup>-3</sup>, about 1.65 times that of <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">air</a>. The carbon dioxide molecule (O=C=O) contains two <!--del_lnk--> double bonds and has a linear shape. It has no electrical <!--del_lnk--> dipole. As it is fully oxidized, it is not very reactive and, in particular, not <!--del_lnk--> flammable.<p>At temperatures below &minus;78 &deg;C, carbon dioxide changes directly from a gas to a white solid called <!--del_lnk--> dry ice through a process called <!--del_lnk--> deposition. <!--del_lnk--> Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at <!--del_lnk--> pressures above 5.1 <!--del_lnk--> atm; at atmospheric pressure, it passes directly between the solid phase and the gaseous phase in a process called <!--del_lnk--> sublimation.<p>Carbon dioxide is <!--del_lnk--> soluble in <!--del_lnk--> water, in which it spontaneously interconverts between CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (<!--del_lnk--> carbonic acid). The relative concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and the deprotonated forms HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (<!--del_lnk--> bicarbonate) and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>(<!--del_lnk--> carbonate) depend on <!--del_lnk--> pH. In neutral or slightly alkaline water (pH &gt; 6.5), the bicarbonate form predominates (&gt;50%) becoming the most prevalent (&gt;95%) at the pH of seawater, while in very alkaline water (pH &gt; 10.4) the predominant (&gt;50%) form is carbonate. The bicarbonate and carbonate forms are very soluble, such that air-equilibrated ocean water (mildly alkaline with typical pH = 8.2-8.5) contains about 120 mg of bicarbonate per liter.<p><a id="Uses" name="Uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Uses</span></h2>

      <p>Carbon dioxide is used to produce <!--del_lnk--> carbonated <!--del_lnk--> soft drinks and <!--del_lnk--> soda water. Traditionally, the carbonation in <a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">beer</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sparkling wine comes about through natural fermentation, but some manufacturers carbonate these drinks <!--del_lnk--> artificially. A <!--del_lnk--> candy called <!--del_lnk--> Pop Rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about 40 bar (600 psi). When placed in the mouth, it dissolves (just like other hard candy) and releases the gas bubbles with an audible &quot;pop.&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Leavening agents produce carbon dioxide to cause dough to rise. <a href="../../wp/y/Yeast.htm" title="Baker&#39;s yeast">Baker&#39;s yeast</a> produces carbon dioxide by fermentation within the dough, while chemical leaveners such as <!--del_lnk--> baking powder and <!--del_lnk--> baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to <!--del_lnk--> acids.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Carbon dioxide is often used as an inexpensive, nonflammable pressurized gas. <!--del_lnk--> Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. Steel capsules are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for <!--del_lnk--> airguns, <!--del_lnk--> paintball markers, for inflating <a href="../../wp/b/Bicycle.htm" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> tires, and for making <!--del_lnk--> seltzer. Rapid vaporization of liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is used for blasting in <!--del_lnk--> coal mines.<p>Carbon dioxide is the most commonly used compressed gas for pneumatic systems in <!--del_lnk--> combat robots. Carbon dioxide is ideal for this application because at room temperature it becomes a liquid at a pressure of 60 <!--del_lnk--> bar. A tank of liquid carbon dioxide provides a constant 60 bar pressure until the tank is close to being empty. A tank of compressed air would gradually reduce in pressure as it was used.<p>Carbon dioxide extinguishes flames, and some <!--del_lnk--> fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide also finds use as an atmosphere for <a href="../../wp/w/Welding.htm" title="Welding">welding</a>, although in the welding arc, it reacts to <!--del_lnk--> oxidize most metals. Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are <!--del_lnk--> brittler than those made in more inert atmospheres, and that such weld joints deteriorate over time because of the formation of carbonic acid. It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as <a href="../../wp/a/Argon.htm" title="Argon">argon</a> or <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>.<p>Liquid carbon dioxide is a good <!--del_lnk--> solvent for many <!--del_lnk--> organic compounds, and is used to remove <!--del_lnk--> caffeine from <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a>. First, the green <!--del_lnk--> coffee beans are soaked in water. The beans are placed in the top of a column seventy feet (21 meters) high. The carbon dioxide <!--del_lnk--> fluid at about 93 degrees Celsius enters at the bottom of the column. The caffeine diffuses out of the beans and into the carbon dioxide.<p>Carbon dioxide has begun to attract attention in the <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as <!--del_lnk--> organochlorides. It&#39;s used by some <!--del_lnk--> dry cleaners for this reason. (See <!--del_lnk--> green chemistry.)<p>Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, and greenhouses may enrich their atmospheres with additional CO<sub>2</sub> to boost plant growth. It has been proposed that carbon dioxide from power generation be bubbled into ponds to grow <!--del_lnk--> algae that could then be converted into <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> fuel<!--del_lnk--> . High levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere effectively exterminate many pests. Greenhouses will raise the level of CO<sub>2</sub> to 10,000 ppm (1%) for several hours to eliminate pests such as whiteflies, spider mites, and others.<p>In medicine, up to 5% carbon dioxide is added to pure <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> for stimulation of breathing after <!--del_lnk--> apnea and to stabilize the O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> balance in blood.<p>A common type of industrial gas <!--del_lnk--> laser, the <!--del_lnk--> carbon dioxide laser, uses carbon dioxide as a medium.<p>Carbon dioxide can also be combined with limonene from orange peels or other epoxides to create polymers and plastics.<p>Carbon dioxide is commonly injected into or adjacent to producing <!--del_lnk--> oil wells. It will act as both a pressurizing agent and, when dissolved into the underground <!--del_lnk--> crude oil, will significantly reduce its viscosity, enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the earth to the removal well. In mature oil fields, extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points.<p><a id="Refrigerant" name="Refrigerant"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Refrigerant</span></h3>
      <p>Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important <!--del_lnk--> refrigerants, especially in the <!--del_lnk--> food industry, where they are employed during the transportation and storage of <!--del_lnk--> ice cream and other <!--del_lnk--> frozen foods. Solid carbon dioxide is called &quot;dry ice&quot; and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical.<p>Liquid carbon dioxide was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of <!--del_lnk--> R-12 and may be enjoying something of a renaissance <!--del_lnk-->  due to environmental concerns. Its physical properties are not favorable, having a low <!--del_lnk--> critical temperature of 88&deg;F/31&deg;C (the maximum temperature at which it will condense from gas to liquid) and high critical pressure of 1070 <!--del_lnk--> psi (the pressure required for phase change at the critical temperature). These properties necessitate the use of very strong refrigeration plumbing to contain the operating pressure of ~1400 psi, in contrast to pressures of ~300 psi for <!--del_lnk--> R-134a systems. Although carbon dioxide is non-inflammable and non-toxic it is an <!--del_lnk--> asphyxiant, which raises safety concerns in the case of leaks in enclosed spaces or system rupture in the case of vehicle accident. Despite these issues Coca-Cola has fielded CO<sub>2</sub>-based <!--del_lnk--> beverage coolers and the <!--del_lnk--> US Army and others have expressed interest <!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Solid_CO2" name="Solid_CO2"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Solid CO<sub>2</sub></span></h2>

      <p><b>Dry ice</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> genericized trademark for solid (&quot;frozen&quot;) carbon dioxide. The term was coined in 1925 by Prest Air Devices, founded in Long Island City, New York in 1923. The name refers to the fact that under normal atmospheric pressure, solid CO<sub>2</sub> <!--del_lnk--> sublimates, or changes directly into a gas without passing through a &quot;wet&quot; liquid phase. As a general rule, dry ice will sublimate at a rate of five to ten pounds every 24 hours in a typical ice chest.<p>Dry ice is produced by compressing carbon dioxide gas to a liquid form, removing the heat produced by the compression (see <!--del_lnk--> Charles&#39;s law), and then letting the liquid carbon dioxide expand quickly. This expansion causes a drop in <!--del_lnk--> temperature so that some of the CO<sub>2</sub> freezes into &quot;snow&quot;, which is then compressed into pellets or blocks. The freezing point of CO<sub>2</sub> is -109.3&deg;F or -78.5&deg;C.<p>Dry ice has many industrial uses, including<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Dry ice requires special precautions when handling. It is extremely cold, requiring proper insulating gloves to handle. It constantly produces carbon dioxide gas, so it cannot be stored in a light duty sealed container as the pressure buildup will quickly cause the container to explode (see <!--del_lnk--> dry ice bomb). The sublimated gas must be ventilated; otherwise, it may fill the enclosed space and create a <!--del_lnk--> suffocation hazard. Special care for ventilating vehicles is needed as well because of the small space. People who handle dry ice should also be aware that carbon dioxide is heavier than air and will sink to the floor.

      <p>In June 2006, an Italian-French science team <!--del_lnk--> announced the synthetic production of solid <!--del_lnk--> amorphous CO<sub>2</sub> <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a>. This form of glass, called <i>carbonia</i>, was produced by supercooling heated CO<sub>2</sub> at extreme pressure (40&ndash;48 <!--del_lnk--> GPa or about 400,000 atmospheres) in a <!--del_lnk--> diamond anvil. This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family, like <a href="../../wp/s/Silicon.htm" title="Silicon">silicon</a> (<!--del_lnk--> silica glass) and <a href="../../wp/g/Germanium.htm" title="Germanium">germanium</a>.

      <p>Carbon dioxide is an end product in organisms that obtain energy from breaking down <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugars</a> or <!--del_lnk--> fats with <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> as part of their <!--del_lnk--> metabolism, in a process known as <!--del_lnk--> cellular respiration. This includes all plants, <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>, many <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> and some <a href="../../wp/b/Bacteria.htm" title="Bacterium">bacteria</a>. In higher animals, the carbon dioxide travels in the <!--del_lnk--> blood from the body&#39;s tissues to the <!--del_lnk--> lungs where it is exhaled. In plants using photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is absorbed from the atmosphere.<p>Carbon dioxide content in fresh <a href="../../wp/e/Earth%2527s_atmosphere.htm" title="Earth&#39;s atmosphere">air</a> varies and is between 0.03% (300 ppm) to 0.06% (600 ppm), depending on location and in exhaled air approximately 4.5%. When inhaled in high concentrations (greater than 5% by volume), it is immediately dangerous to the life and health of plants, humans and other animals. The current threshold limit value (TLV) or maximum level that is considered safe for healthy adults for an 8-hour work day is 0.5% (5000 ppm). The maximum safe level for infants, children, the elderly and individuals with cardio-pulmonary health issues would be significantly less. Acute carbon dioxide toxicity is sometimes known as <!--del_lnk--> choke damp, an old mining industry term, and was the cause of death at <!--del_lnk--> Lake Nyos in <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, where an upwelling of CO<sub>2</sub>-laden lake water in 1986 covered a wide area in a blanket of the gas, killing nearly 2000. The lowering of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is largely due to absorption by plants, which convert it to sugars through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton photosynthesis absorbs dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere (Falkowski P. Scholes RJ. Boyle E.

The decreased binding to oxygen in the blood due to increased carbon dioxide levels is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Haldane Effect, and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin. This is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Bohr Effect.<p>According to a study by the USDA, an average person&#39;s respiration generates approximately 450 liters (roughly 900 grams) of carbon dioxide per day.<p>CO<sub>2</sub> is carried in blood in three different ways. Most of it (about 80%&ndash;90%) is converted to bicarbonate ions HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> by the enzyme <!--del_lnk--> carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells. 5%&ndash;10% is dissolved in the plasma and 5%&ndash;10% is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds. The exact percentages vary depending whether it is arterial or venous blood.<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen; rather it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of <!--del_lnk--> allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> does decrease the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen.<p>Carbon dioxide may be one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply. If it is high, the <!--del_lnk--> capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.<p>Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. As breathing rate influences the level of CO<sub>2</sub> in blood, too slow or shallow breathing causes <!--del_lnk--> respiratory acidosis, while too rapid breathing, <!--del_lnk--> hyperventilation, leads to <!--del_lnk--> respiratory alkalosis.<p>It is interesting to note that although it is oxygen that the body requires for metabolism, it is not low oxygen levels that stimulate breathing, but is instead higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (e.g., pure nitrogen) leads to loss of consciousness without subjective breathing problems. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots, and is also the reason why the instructions in commercial airplanes for case of loss of cabin pressure stress that one should apply the <!--del_lnk--> oxygen mask to oneself before helping others&mdash;otherwise one risks going unconscious without being aware of the imminent peril.<p>Plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, which uses light energy to produce organic plant materials by combining carbon dioxide and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>. This releases free oxygen gas. Sometimes carbon dioxide gas is pumped into <!--del_lnk--> greenhouses to promote plant growth. Plants can potentially grow up to twice as fast in conditions where extra CO<sub>2</sub> is available, although there is no additional benefit at concentrations beyond 1200 ppm. Plants also emit CO<sub>2</sub> during respiration, but on balance they are net sinks of CO<sub>2</sub>.<p>Carbon dioxide is a surrogate for indoor pollutants that may cause occupants to grow drowsy, get headaches, or function at lower activity levels. To eliminate most <!--del_lnk--> Indoor Air Quality complaints, total indoor carbon dioxide must be reduced to below 600 ppm. <!--del_lnk--> NIOSH considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation (1,000 ppm equals 0.1%). <!--del_lnk--> ASHRAE recommends that CO<sub>2</sub> levels not exceed 1000 ppm inside a space. <!--del_lnk--> OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 0.5% for prolonged periods. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health limits brief exposures (up to ten minutes) to 3% and considers concentrations exceeding 4% as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> immediately dangerous to life and health.&quot; People who breathe 5% carbon dioxide for more than half an hour show signs of acute <!--del_lnk--> hypercapnia, while breathing 7%&ndash;10% carbon dioxide can produce unconsciousness in only a few minutes. Carbon dioxide, either as a gas or as dry ice, should be handled only in well-ventilated areas.<p><a id="Concentrations_of_CO2_in_atmosphere" name="Concentrations_of_CO2_in_atmosphere"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> in atmosphere</span></h2>

      <p>The most direct method for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations for periods before direct sampling is to measure bubbles of air (<!--del_lnk--> fluid or gas inclusions) trapped in the <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> or <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> ice caps. The most widely accepted of such studies come from a variety of Antarctic cores and indicate that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels were about 260&ndash;280&micro;L/L immediately before industrial emissions began and did not vary much from this level during the preceding 10,000 years.<p>The longest <!--del_lnk--> ice core record comes from East Antarctica, where ice has been sampled to an age of 800,000 years before the present <!--del_lnk--> . During this time, the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration has varied between 180&ndash;210 &micro;L/L during <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice ages</a>, increasing to 280&ndash;300 &micro;L/L during warmer <!--del_lnk--> interglacials <!--del_lnk--> . The data can be accessed at <!--del_lnk--> http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok_data.html.<p>Some studies have disputed the claim of stable CO<sub>2</sub> levels during the present interglacial (the last 10 kyr). Based on an analysis of fossil leaves, Wagner et al. argued that CO<sub>2</sub> levels during the period 7&ndash;10 kyr ago were significantly higher (~300 &micro;L/L) and contained substantial variations that may be correlated to climate variations. Others have disputed such claims, suggesting they are more likely to reflect calibration problems than actual changes in CO<sub>2</sub>. Relevant to this dispute is the observation that Greenland ice cores often report higher and more variable CO<sub>2</sub> values than similar measurements in Antarctica. However, the groups responsible for such measurements (e.g., Smith et al.) believe the variations in Greenland cores result from <i>in situ</i> decomposition of <!--del_lnk--> calcium carbonate dust found in the ice. When dust levels in Greenland cores are low, as they nearly always are in Antarctic cores, the researchers report good agreement between Antarctic and Greenland CO<sub>2</sub> measurements.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>On longer timescales, various proxy measurements have been used to attempt to determine atmospheric carbon dioxide levels millions of years in the past. These include <a href="../../wp/b/Boron.htm" title="Boron">boron</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a> <!--del_lnk--> isotope ratios in certain types of marine sediments, and the number of <!--del_lnk--> stomata observed on fossil plant leaves. While these measurements give much less precise estimates of carbon dioxide concentration than ice cores, there is evidence for very high CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations (&gt;3,000 &micro;L/L) between 600 and 400 Myr BP and between 200 and 150 Myr BP.<!--del_lnk-->  On long timescales, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content is determined by the balance among geochemical processes including organic carbon burial in sediments, silicate rock <!--del_lnk--> weathering, and vulcanism. The net effect of slight imbalances in the <!--del_lnk--> carbon cycle over tens to hundreds of millions of years has been to reduce atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The rates of these processes are extremely slow; hence they are of limited relevance to the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> response to emissions over the next hundred years. In more recent times, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration continued to fall after about 60 Myr BP, and there is geochemical evidence that concentrations were &lt;300 &micro;L/L by about 20 Myr BP. Low CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations may have been the stimulus that favored the evolution of <!--del_lnk--> C4 plants, which increased greatly in abundance between 7 and 5 Myr BP. Although contemporary CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were exceeded during earlier geological epochs, present carbon dioxide levels are likely higher now than at any time during the past 20 million years <!--del_lnk-->  and at the same time lower than at any time in history if we look at time scales longer than 50 million years.

      <p>The Earth&#39;s <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">oceans</a> contain a huge amount of carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate and carbonate ions&mdash;much more than the amount in the atmosphere.

       <dd>CaCO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O <span class="Unicode">&#x21CC;</span> Ca<sup>2+</sup> + 2 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup></dl>
      <p>Reactions like this tend to buffer changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Reactions between carbon dioxide and non-carbonate rocks also add bicarbonate to the seas, which can later undergo the reverse of the above reaction to form carbonate rocks, releasing half of the bicarbonate as CO<sub>2</sub>.

If all the carbonate rocks in the earth&#39;s crust were to be converted back into carbon dioxide, the resulting carbon dioxide would weigh 40 times as much as the rest of the atmosphere.<p>The vast majority of CO<sub>2</sub> added to the atmosphere will eventually be absorbed by the oceans and become bicarbonate ion, but the process takes on the order of a hundred years because most seawater rarely comes near the surface.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

He found that <!--del_lnk--> limestone (<!--del_lnk--> calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with <!--del_lnk--> acids to yield a gas he termed &quot;fixed air.&quot; He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. He also found that it would, when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (<!--del_lnk--> calcium hydroxide), precipitate calcium carbonate, and used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation. In 1772, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Priestley used carbon dioxide produced from the action of sulfuric acid on limestone to prepare soda water, the first known instance of an artificially carbonated drink.<p>Carbon dioxide was first liquefied (at elevated pressures) in 1823 by <a href="../../wp/h/Humphry_Davy.htm" title="Humphry Davy">Humphry Davy</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a>. The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide was given by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Thilorier, who in 1834 opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide, only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a &quot;snow&quot; of solid CO<sub>2</sub>.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide&quot;</div>
