      <p>Chew Magna is the largest village in the district, and can trace its importance back to <!--del_lnk--> Saxon times. It was a thriving woollen centre in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The manor of Chew was held by the <!--del_lnk--> Bishop of Bath and Wells, from 1062 to 1548, and for that reason the village was called Chew Episcopi or Bishop&#39;s Chew. The Bishops built a palace near the church of St. Andrews, which was visited by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_III_of_England.htm" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1250. Chew Court is a surviving part of the palace. More recently, since about 1600, the name has been Chew Magna because this has been the most important of the several villages along the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> River Chew.<p>Around 1700 the Lord of the Manor was Sir William Jones the Attourney General of England and in the 1820s it was the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Lord Lyttelton. Until about 1880 the village had <!--del_lnk--> toll roads and a toll house to collect the fees.<p>During the 19th and 20th centuries the importance of the wool trade in the village declined and it became largely a <!--del_lnk--> dormitory area for the cities of <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Bath, although it has continued to be the commercial centre of the valley. The building of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s has brought further opportunities for <a href="../../wp/l/Leisure.htm" title="Leisure">leisure</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>
      <p>Chew Magna has its own <!--del_lnk--> Parish council which has some responsibility for local issues, and is part of the Chew Valley North Ward which is represented by one councillor on the <!--del_lnk--> Bath and North East Somerset <!--del_lnk--> Unitary Authority which has wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism, etc. The village is a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Wansdyke constituency which elects one <!--del_lnk--> MP to the Westminster Parliament and part of the <!--del_lnk--> South West England constituency which elects 7 members to the European Parliament.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>According to the 2001 Census the Chew Valley North Ward (which includes Chew Magna and Chew Stoke), had 2,307 residents, living in 911 households, with an average age of 42.3 years. Of these 77% of residents describing their health as &#39;good&#39;, 21% of 16&ndash;74 year olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.3% of all economically active people aged 16&ndash;74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.<p><a id="Schools" name="Schools"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Schools</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>St Andrew&#39;s Church dates from the 12th century with a large 15th-century pinnacled <!--del_lnk--> sandstone tower, a <!--del_lnk--> Norman <!--del_lnk--> font and a <!--del_lnk--> rood screen that is the full width of the church. In the church are several memorials to the Stracheys of <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Court together with a wooden <!--del_lnk--> effigy of a <!--del_lnk--> Knight cross-legged and leaning on one elbow, in 15th century <!--del_lnk--> armour, thought to be of Sir John de Hauteville or a descendant, and possibly transferred from a church at Norton Hautville before it was demolished . Another effigy in the north chapel is of Sir John Loe and his lady. The armoured figure is 7 feet 4 inches long and his feet rest on a <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lion</a>, while those of his lady rest on a <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dog</a>. The church was restored in 1860 and has a register commencing in 1562. The tower is about one hundred feet tall and was probably built about 1440 . There has been a clock on the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight <!--del_lnk--> bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt in C. The original five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the <!--del_lnk--> Diamond Jubilee of <!--del_lnk--> Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the <!--del_lnk--> octave, which does still contain two of the Bilbie bells. The present <a href="../../wp/c/Clock.htm" title="Clock">clock</a>, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a <!--del_lnk--> hymn every four hours, at 8 am, noon, 4 and 8 pm, with a different hymn tune for every day of the week.  It is a Grade I listed building. The <!--del_lnk--> churchyard contains several monuments which are Grade II listed buildings in their own right; Churchyard cross, Edgell monument, Fowler monument  and a group of three unidentified monuments. Within the church are wooden <!--del_lnk--> plaques commemorating the nineteen people from the village who died in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and seven from <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and a <!--del_lnk--> bronze plaque to an individual soldier who died in 1917.<p><a id="Church_House.2FOld_School_Room" name="Church_House.2FOld_School_Room"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Church House/Old School Room</span></h3>
