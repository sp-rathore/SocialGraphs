      <p>The Chicago and North Western Railway was chartered on <!--del_lnk--> June 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1859. It had purchased the assets of the bankrupt Chicago, St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad five days earlier. On <!--del_lnk--> February 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1865, it officially merged with the <!--del_lnk--> Galena and Chicago Union Railroad, which had been chartered on <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1836. Since the Galena &amp; Chicago Union started operating in December, 1848, and the Fond du Lac railroad started in March, <!--del_lnk--> 1855, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad is considered to be the origin of the North Western railroad system.<p>The North Western had owned a majority of the stock of the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway (Omaha Road) since <!--del_lnk--> 1882. On <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1957, it officially leased the company, and merged it into the North Western in <!--del_lnk--> 1972. The Omaha Road&#39;s main line ran from an interchange with the North Western at <!--del_lnk--> Elroy, Wisconsin, to the Twin Cities, down to <!--del_lnk--> Sioux City, Iowa, and then finally to <!--del_lnk--> Omaha, Nebraska. The North Western picked up several important short railroads during its later years. It finalized acquisition of the Litchfield and Madison railroad on <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1958. The Litchfield and Madison railroad was a 44-mile bridge road from <!--del_lnk--> East St. Louis to <!--del_lnk--> Litchfield, Illinois. On <!--del_lnk--> July 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1968, the North Western acquired two former interurbans &ndash; the 36-mile <!--del_lnk--> Des Moines and Central Iowa Railway (DM&amp;CI), and the 110-mile <!--del_lnk--> Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railway (FDDM&amp;S). The DM&amp;CI gave access to the Firestone plant in <!--del_lnk--> Des Moines, Iowa, and the FDDM&amp;S provided access to gypsum mills in <!--del_lnk--> Fort Dodge, Iowa.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1960, the North Western acquired the rail properties of the 1,500-mile <!--del_lnk--> Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. In spite of its name, it ran only from <a href="../../wp/m/Minneapolis%252C_Minnesota.htm" title="Minneapolis, Minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</a>, to <!--del_lnk--> Peoria, Illinois. This acquisition provided traffic and modern rolling stock, and eliminated competition.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1968, the 1,500 mile (2,400 km) <!--del_lnk--> Chicago Great Western Railway was merged into the North Western. This railroad went from Chicago to <!--del_lnk--> Oelwein, Iowa. From there, separate lines went to the Twin Cities, Omaha, Nebraska, and <a href="../../wp/k/Kansas_City%252C_Missouri.htm" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. A connection from <!--del_lnk--> Hayfield, Minnesota, to <!--del_lnk--> Clarion, Iowa, provided a Twin Cities to Omaha main line. The Chicago Great Western duplicated the North Western&#39;s routes from Chicago to the Twin Cities and Omaha, but went the long way. This merger provided access to Kansas City, Missouri, and eliminated competition. After abandoning a plan to merge with the <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee Road in <!--del_lnk--> 1970, <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin W. Heineman, who had headed the CNW and parent <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Industries since <!--del_lnk--> 1956, arranged the sale of the railroad to its employees in <!--del_lnk--> 1972. The words &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Employee Owned&quot; were part of the company logo in the ensuing period.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>After the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad (Rock Island) stopped operating on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1980, the North Western won a bidding war with the <!--del_lnk--> Soo Line for purchase of the roughly 800-mile &quot;Spine Line&quot; from the Twin Cities to Kansas City, Missouri, via Des Moines, Iowa. The North Western&#39;s bid of $93 million was approved on <!--del_lnk--> June 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1983, by the <!--del_lnk--> ICC. The line was well-engineered, but because of deferred maintenance on the part of the bankrupt Rock Island, a major rehabilitation was undertaken in <!--del_lnk--> 1984. The North Western then began to abandon the Oelwein to Kansas City section of its former Chicago Great Western trackage, which duplicated Spine Line service.<p>In April, <!--del_lnk--> 1995, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company was merged into the <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad.<p>Chicago and North Western locomotives continued to operate in their paint schemes for several years after the merger. As of <!--del_lnk--> June 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, only two engines were left in full C&amp;NW paint (C&amp;NW 8646 and 8701), but many others were wearing &quot;patch&quot; Union Pacific numbers over their C&amp;NW scheme.<p>Union Pacific continues to follow its new tradition of releasing &quot;Heritage&quot; units to represent the paint schemes of companies absorbed by UP. After completion of painting at the Wisconsin &amp; Southern Railroad&#39;s Horicon, Wisconsin shop, <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific 1995, an EMD SD70ACe locomotive painted in a &quot;Heritage&quot; Chicago &amp; North Western paint scheme, was unveiled on <!--del_lnk--> July 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, at <!--del_lnk--> Ogilvie Transportation Centre in Chicago, IL. OTC is the former North Western Station now serving as UP&#39;s Metra terminus. The unit was then placed in dedicated service on the former C&amp;NW main line, paired with the C&amp;NW 8646 and 8701.<p><a id="Passenger_train_service" name="Passenger_train_service"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Passenger train service</span></h2>
      <p>Chicago and Northwestern operated some notable <!--del_lnk--> passenger trains, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Los Angeles</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Denver</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Challenger</i>.

      <p>The CNW&#39;s most famous train, the Chicago-Twin Cities <i>400</i> was introduced in <!--del_lnk--> 1935 to compete with the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago, Burlington and Quincy&#39;s <i>Zephyr</i>s and the <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee Road&#39;s <i>Hiawatha</i>s. This train was named because it traveled the 400 <!--del_lnk--> miles between the cities in 400 minutes. CNW was the first system to start a high-speed Chicago-Twin Cities schedule because it used refurbished instead of new equipment, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1939, modernized the <i>400</i> with new <!--del_lnk--> E3A diesel locomotive pairs and streamlined cars.<p>CNW eventually renamed the first <i>400</i> to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Twin Cities 400</i> as the CNW stuck almost all of its passenger trains with the <i>400</i> moniker, including the <i><!--del_lnk--> Flambeau 400</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Rochester 400</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kate Shelley 400</i>. CNW ceased running the <i>Twin Cities 400</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1963, and all intercity passenger service on CNW ended with the formation of <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1971.<br style="clear:both;" />
