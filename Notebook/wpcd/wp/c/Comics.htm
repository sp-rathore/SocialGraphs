      <p><b>Comics</b> (or, less commonly, <b>sequential art</b>) is a form of <!--del_lnk--> visual art consisting of images which are commonly combined with text, often in the form of <!--del_lnk--> speech balloons or image captions. Originally used to illustrate <!--del_lnk--> caricatures and to entertain through the use of amusing and trivial stories, it has by now evolved into a literary medium with many subgenres.<p>The most common forms of printed comics are <!--del_lnk--> comic strips (most commonly four <!--del_lnk--> panels long) in <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspapers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> magazines, and longer comic stories in <!--del_lnk--> comic books, <!--del_lnk--> graphic novels and comic albums. In the first two forms the comics are secondary material usually confined to the entertainment sections, while the latter consist either entirely or primarily of comics.<p>Depending on the definition of the term, the origin of comics can be traced back to 15th century <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. However, today&#39;s form of comics (with panels, and using text within the image in speech balloons, etc.), as well as the term <i>comics</i> itself, originated in the late 19th century.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>Note: Although it takes the form of a plural noun, the common usage when referring to</i> comics <i>as a medium is to treat it as singular.</i><p>Scholars disagree on the definition of comics; some claim its printed format is crucial, some emphasize the interdependence of image and text, and others its sequential nature. The term as a reference to the medium has also been disputed.<p>In 1996, <!--del_lnk--> Will Eisner published <i>Graphic Storytelling</i>, in which he defined comics as &quot;the printed arrangement of art and <!--del_lnk--> balloons in sequence, particularly in comic books.&quot; Eisner&#39;s earlier, more influential definition from 1985&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Comics and Sequential Art</i> described the technique and structure of comics as <i>sequential art</i>, &quot;...the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate a story or dramatize an idea.&quot;<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Understanding Comics</i> (1993) <!--del_lnk--> Scott McCloud defined sequential art and comics as: &quot;juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer&quot;; this definition excludes single-panel illustrations such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Far Side</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Family Circus</i>, and most <!--del_lnk--> political cartoons from the category, classifying those as <!--del_lnk--> cartoons. By contrast, <!--del_lnk--> The Comics Journal&#39;s <i>&quot;100 Best Comics of the 20th Century&quot;</i>, included the works of several single panel cartoonists and a caricaturist, and academic study of comics has included political cartoons<!--del_lnk--> .<p>R.C. Harvey, in his essay <i>Comedy At The Juncture Of Word And Image</i>, offered a competing definition in reference to McCloud&#39;s: &quot;...comics consist of pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute to the meaning of the pictures and vice versa.&quot; This, however, ignores the existence of wordless comics.<p><!--del_lnk--> Eddie Campbell offered the term <i>graphic storytelling</i>, defining it as &quot;the art of using pictures in sequence and its attendant language of forms and techniques, refined over many centuries.&quot; He contrasted this term with comics, which he defines as &quot;humorous art...but with the proviso that in our own times it has come to embrace not only <!--del_lnk--> cartoons but <!--del_lnk--> comic strips and <!--del_lnk--> comic books which are not necessarily humorous due to their own evolutionary patterns, but they remain under this rubric as they evolved from it.&quot;<p>Most agree that <a href="../../wp/a/Animation.htm" title="Animation">animation</a>, which creates the optical illusion of movement within a static physical frame, is a separate form, although ImageTexT, a peer-reviewed academic journal focusing on comics, accepts submissions relating to animation as well<!--del_lnk--> , and the third annual Conference on Comics at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Florida focused on comics and animation<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>When and where comics originated is another matter of debate, largely dependent on its definition. The majority view, represented by many authors and academic sources, <!--del_lnk--> Scott McCloud being the most recent, is that the comic format observes precedents in <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphics, Japanese <!--del_lnk--> emaki, European <a href="../../wp/s/Stained_glass.htm" title="Stained glass">stained glass</a> windows, pre-Columbian Central American manuscripts, and the <!--del_lnk--> Bayeux Tapestry., <p>An alternative view is represented by <!--del_lnk--> Roger Sabin who argues that the definition is predicated on the printed comic form.  This perspective is increasingly being challenged as electronic distribution of movies, music, books and art emphasizes content over the delivery mechanism.<p><a name="15th.E2.80.9318th_centuries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">15th&ndash;18th centuries</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>Sabin cites the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> printing press as the moment when the modern form began to crystalise, arguing that the medium of comics has been intrinsically linked with printing. <p>An early surviving work which is recognisable as being in the form of printed comics is Francis Barlow&#39;s <i>A True Narrative of the Horrid Hellish Popish Plot</i> (c.1682). <i>The Punishments of Lemuel Gulliver</i> by <a href="../../wp/w/William_Hogarth.htm" title="William Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, (1726), is another early work that bears similarities of form, although Eddie Campbell has argued that these may be more a collection of cartoons rather than actual comics. Other notable artists producing work in this period are <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Rowlandson, Jan Vandergucht, <!--del_lnk--> James Gillray and <!--del_lnk--> George Cruikshank. Rowlandson and Gillray are credited with having codified the speech balloon in its present form, from the previous convention of having speech represented by banners.<p>An example of Rowlandson&#39;s work from 1782, satirising the politics of the day, shows it to be an early variation of the strip cartoon. His work popularised the strip form as a pictorial narrative.<p><a id="The_19th_century" name="The_19th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The 19th century</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rodolphe T&ouml;pffer, a Francophone Swiss artist, is the key figure of the early part of the 19th century. His work is reprinted throughout Europe and in the U.S., creating a market on both continents for similar works.<p>In 1845 T&ouml;pffer formalised his thoughts on the <i>picture story</i> in his <i>Essay on Physiognomics</i>: &quot;To construct a picture-story does not mean you must set yourself up as a master craftsman, to draw out every potential from your material &mdash;often down to the dregs! It does not mean you just devise caricatures with a pencil naturally frivolous. Nor is it simply to dramatize a proverb or illustrate a <!--del_lnk--> pun. You must actually invent some kind of play, where the parts are arranged by plan and form a satisfactory whole. You do not merely pen a joke or put a refrain in couplets. You make a book: good or bad, sober or silly, crazy or sound in sense.&quot;<p>Sir <!--del_lnk--> Ernst Gombrich certainly felt T&ouml;pffer to have evolved a new pictorial language, that of an abbreviated art style, which worked by allowing the audience to fill in gaps with their own imagination.<p><!--del_lnk--> Satirical drawings in newspapers were popular through much of the 19th century. In Britain, in 1841, <i><!--del_lnk--> Punch</i>, a magazine containing such drawings launched. In 1843 <i>Punch</i> referred to its &#39;humorous pencilings&#39; as cartoons in satirical reference to <a href="../../wp/p/Palace_of_Westminster.htm" title="Palace of Westminster">Parliament</a>, who were organising an exhibition of cartoons at the time. This usage became common parlance and has lasted into the present day. Similar magazines containing cartoons in continental <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> included <i>Fliegende Bl&auml;tter</i> and <i>Charivari</i>, whilst in the U.S. <i>Judge</i> and <i>Puck</i> were popular.<p>In Germany in 1865 <!--del_lnk--> Max and Moritz by <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm Busch was published within a newspaper. This strip is thought to be a significant fore-runner of the comic strip.<p>It is around this time that <!--del_lnk--> Manhua, the <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> form of comics, started to formalise, a process that lasted up until 1927.<p>In 1884, <i><!--del_lnk--> Ally Sloper&#39;s Half Holiday</i> was published, reputed to be the first comic strip magazine to feature a recurring character. In 1890 two more comic magazines debuted to the British public, <i><!--del_lnk--> Comic Cuts</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Illustrated Chips</i>. These magazines also republished American material, previously published in newspapers in the U.S.. They established the tradition of the <!--del_lnk--> British comic as being a periodical containing comic strips.<p>Depending on the criteria used, the first successful comics series featuring regular characters was either <!--del_lnk--> R.F. Outcault&#39;s single-panel cartoon series <i><!--del_lnk--> Hogan&#39;s Alley</i> (1895) or Rudolph Dirks&#39; multi-panel strip <!--del_lnk--> The Katzenjammer Kids (1897). The Yellow Kid, the star of <i>Hogan&#39;s Alley</i>, became so popular as to drive newspaper sales, and in doing so prompted the creation of other strips. This boom marks the beginning of comics as an ongoing popular art form.<p><a id="The_20th_century" name="The_20th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The 20th century</span></h3>
      <p>The term <i>comics</i> in the U.S. came to define early <!--del_lnk--> newspaper strips, which initially featured <a href="../../wp/h/Humour.htm" title="Humour">humorous</a> narratives , hence the adjective <i>comic</i>. In 1929, strips started to broaden their content, with <i>Buck Rogers</i> and <i>Tarzan</i> launching the action genre. More strips followed, with the term &quot;comic&quot; quickly adopting through popular usage to refer to the form rather than the content, .<p>1929 also saw the first appearance of <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Adventures_of_Tintin.htm" title="The Adventures of Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a></i> published as a <!--del_lnk--> black-and-white strip in <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Petit Vingti&egrave;me</i>, a supplement to <i>Le Vingti&egrave;me Si&egrave;cle</i>, a <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgian</a> newspaper. The strip was collected as <i>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</i> in 1930, being published in the <!--del_lnk--> European <!--del_lnk--> comic album format.<p>Another notable publication of 1929 was <i><!--del_lnk--> The Funnies</i>, a reprint collection of newspaper strips. Reputed to be the first four-colour comic newsstand publication in the United States, it was published in tabloid size, a size which left it easily confused with the Sunday supplements of the time and so harmed sales to the extent that publication ceased after 36 issues.<p>The first publication to use a format recognisable today as a <!--del_lnk--> comic book was <i><!--del_lnk--> Funnies on Parade</i> which took the tabloid size used for the Sunday supplements and folded it in half. Published in 1933 by two workers for the Eastern Colour Printing Company of New York, <!--del_lnk--> Harry Wildenberg and <!--del_lnk--> Max Gaines as an advertising giveaway, its success led to similar giveaways being published. On a hunch, Gaines distributed extra copies to newstands, with a ten cent cover price, returning to find them all sold. This led to Eastern publishing <i><!--del_lnk--> Famous Funnies</i> in May 1934 for sale through the newsstands.<p>By 1935 comic books were commissioning original material, mostly influenced by the pulp magazines of the day, whilst also repackaging foreign material. <!--del_lnk--> Will Eisner was one who supplied foreign material, and in his retooling of the material to fit the comic book format Eisner is credited with inventing the grammar of the comic book. Techniques devised by Eisner whilst adapting the material for this new format include the &quot;jump cut&quot;.<p>In 1938 <i><!--del_lnk--> Action Comics</i> #1 was published, featuring the first appearance of <a href="../../wp/s/Superman.htm" title="Superman">Superman</a> and ushering in what is now referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Age of Comic Books. Also in 1938, <i><!--del_lnk--> Spirou</i> first appeared in Belgium, starting the typical custom of weekly magazines featuring mostly Franco-Belgian comics.<p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> the form in Japan, known as <!--del_lnk--> manga started to modernise. The lifting of a ban on non-propaganda publications, allowed <!--del_lnk--> Osamu Tezuka to re-energise both the content of manga and the style of its presentation Tezuka&#39;s first book work was an updating of <i>Treasure Island</i>, appropriately titled <i>New Treasure Island</i> (1947).<p>During the latter half of the 20th century comics have become a very popular item for collectors and from the 1970s comics publishers have actively encouraged collecting and shifted a large portion of comics publishing and production to appeal directly to the collector&#39;s community. The collecting of comics is today known by a separate term known as <!--del_lnk--> panelology.<p>The modern double usage of the term <i>comic</i>, as an adjective describing a genre, and a noun designating an entire medium, has been criticised as confusing and misleading. In the 1960s and 1970s, underground cartoonists used the spelling <i>comix</i> to distinguish their work from mainstream newspaper strips and juvenile comic books; ironically, although their work was written for an adult audience, it was usually comedic in nature as well, so the &quot;comic&quot; label was still appropriate. The term <i><a href="../../wp/g/Graphic_novel.htm" title="Graphic novel">graphic novel</a></i> was popularised in the late 1970s, having been coined at least two decades previous, to distance the material from this confusion.<p>In the 1980s comics scholarship started to blossom in the U.S., and a resurgance in the popularity of comics was seen, with <!--del_lnk--> Alan Moore and <!--del_lnk--> Frank Miller producing notable superhero works and <!--del_lnk--> Bill Watterson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Calvin &amp; Hobbes</i> being syndicated.<p>In 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Robert Crumb&#39;s work was exhibited in galleries both sides of the Atlantic, and <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper devoted its tabloid supplement to a week long exploration of his work and idioms.<p><a id="Artistic_medium" name="Artistic_medium"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Artistic medium</span></h2>

      <p>Comics artists will generally sketch a drawing in pencil before going over the drawing again in ink, using either a <!--del_lnk--> dip pen or a <a href="../../wp/b/Brush.htm" title="Brush">brush</a>. Artists will also make use of a lightbox when creating the final image in ink. Some artists, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Bolland being a notable example, are now using digital means to create artwork, with the published work being the first physical appearance of the artwork.<p>By many definitions (including McCloud&#39;s, above) the definition of comics extends to <!--del_lnk--> digital media such as <!--del_lnk--> webcomics.<p><a id="Art_styles" name="Art_styles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Art styles</span></h2>
      <p>Whilst almost all comics art is in some sense <!--del_lnk--> abbreviated, and also whilst every artist who has produced comics work brings their own individual approach to bear, some broader art styles have been identified.<p>The basic styles have been identified as <!--del_lnk--> realistic and cartoony, with a huge middle ground for which R. Fiore has coined the phrase liberal. Fiore has also expressed distaste with the terms realistic and cartoony, preferring the terms literal and freestyle, respectively.<p>Scott McCloud has created <!--del_lnk--> The Big Triangle as a tool for thinking about comics art. He places the realistic representation in the bottom left corner, with <!--del_lnk--> iconic representation, or cartoony art, in the bottom right, and a third identifier, <!--del_lnk--> abstraction of image, at the apex of the triangle. This allows the placement and grouping of artists by <!--del_lnk--> triangulation. This approach to artistic analysis where comics are concerned was parodied by Penny Arcade in <!--del_lnk--> this comic.<ul>
       <li>The cartoony style is one which utilises comic effects and a variation of line widths as a means of expression. Noted exponents of this style are <!--del_lnk--> Carl Barks, Will Eisner and <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Smith.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The realistic style, also referred to as the adventure style is the one developed for use within the adventure strips of the 1930s. They required a less cartoony look, and used the <!--del_lnk--> illustrations found in <!--del_lnk--> pulp magazines as a basis. This style became the basis of the superhero comic book style, since <!--del_lnk--> Joe Shuster and <!--del_lnk--> Jerry Siegel originally worked <a href="../../wp/s/Superman.htm" title="Superman">Superman</a> up for publication as an adventure strip.</ul>
      <p><a id="The_language" name="The_language"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The language</span></h2>
      <p>As noted above, two distinct definitions have been used to define comics as an art form: the combination of both word and image; and the placement of images in sequential order. Both definitions are lacking, in that the first excludes any sequence of wordless images; and the second excludes single panel cartoons such as editorial cartoons. The purpose of comics is certainly that of <!--del_lnk--> narration, and so that must be an important factor in defining the art form.<p>Comics, as sequential art, emphasise the pictorial representation of a narrative. This means comics are not an illustrated version of standard <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>, and whilst some critics argue that they are a hybrid form of <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and literature, others contend comics are a new and separate art; an integrated whole, of words and images both, where the pictures do not just depict the story, but are part of the telling. In comics, creators transmit <!--del_lnk--> expression through arrangement and <!--del_lnk--> juxtaposition of either pictures alone, or word(s) and picture(s), to build a narrative.<p>The narration of a comic is set out through the layout of the images, and whilst there may be many people who work on one work, like <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a>, there is one vision of the narrative which guides the work. The layout of images on a page can be utilised by artists to convey the passage of time, to build suspense or to highlight action.<p>
      <p><a id="Forms_within_comics" name="Forms_within_comics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Forms within comics</span></h2>

      <p>The cartoon, originally an artist&#39;s prepartory drawings, is considered by some scholars, notably R.C. Harvey, as a form of comics. Although a singular image, it has been argued that since the cartoon both combines words with image and constructs a narrative, it merits inclusion as a form of comics. Cartoons typically take one of three forms, that of the <!--del_lnk--> gag cartoon, the <!--del_lnk--> editorial cartoon or the <!--del_lnk--> political cartoon.<p><a id="Comic_strip" name="Comic_strip"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comic strip</span></h3>

      <p>The comic strip, also known as a strip cartoon, is a sequence of images. The term has currently become most commonly used when referring to the shortened <!--del_lnk--> newspaper comic strip, but historically the term was designed to apply to any strip, there being no upper limit on the length of a strip, the minimum length being two. This usage is still fairly common in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> the term &quot;comics&quot; is sometimes used to describe the page of a newspaper upon which comic strips are found, and through this usage has also grown to be used as a definition for comic strips.<p>Newspaper comic strips come in two formats, <!--del_lnk--> daily strips and <!--del_lnk--> Sunday strips. Daily strips usually run Monday through Saturday, and historically have been presented in black and white, although color is used more often since the early nineties. Sunday strips are much larger and have always tended to be in colour.<p>Note: In the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; The &quot;Sunday&quot; comics are on Saturday.<p><a id="Comic_book" name="Comic_book"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comic book</span></h3>

      <p>The comic book is predominantly a <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> term, with the term comic or comic magazine preferred in Europe. Comic books are often called comics for short. Although the term implies otherwise, the subject matter in comic books is not necessarily humorous, and in fact its dramatic seriousness varies widely. The term &quot;comics&quot; in this context does not refer to comic strips (such as <i>Peanuts</i> or <i>Dilbert</i>).<p><a id="Comic_magazine" name="Comic_magazine"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Comic magazine</span></h4>
      <p>The primary format for first publication of <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Belgian comics, and also the format used in the United Kingdom, where it is commonly referred to as a &quot;comic&quot;, plurally as &quot;comics&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> British comic dates back to before 1884, a year which saw the publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Ally Sloper&#39;s Half Holiday</i>. Over the next century many different titles have been published, with <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Dandy.htm" title="The Dandy">The Dandy</a></i>, the longest running comic in the United Kingdom, debuting in 1937 and <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Beano.htm" title="The Beano">the Beano</a></i> in 1938.

      <p><b>Graphic novel</b> is a term for a kind of <!--del_lnk--> comic book, usually with long and fairly complex storylines and often aimed at more mature audiences. However, the term is not strictly delimited, and can be notoriously difficult to pin down. It is often used to imply subjective distinctions in artistic quality between graphic novels and other kinds of comics which can be quite controversial. Graphic novels often encompass several separate issues of comic books and can be published over a period of several months or years and then republished in larger volumes.<p><a id="Comic_annual" name="Comic_annual"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Comic annual</span></h4>

Marvel Comics (makers of Spider-Man, X-Men and more) did annuals for many of its comics throughout the 1980s and 1990s.<p><a id="Comic_album" name="Comic_album"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Comic album</span></h4>
      <p>In <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, a <b>comic album</b> is the equivalent to a graphic novel, being of <!--del_lnk--> A4 size and hardcover, typically with 48 pages. They contain either new stories or collections of previously serialised <!--del_lnk--> strips.<p>In <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> terminology, a <b>graphic album</b> is an anthology-format <!--del_lnk--> comic book with multiple stories that is published and distributed as a book rather than a periodical as distinguished from a <i><a href="../../wp/g/Graphic_novel.htm" title="Graphic novel">graphic novel</a></i> which has similar format but tells a single story.<p><a id="Webcomic" name="Webcomic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Webcomic</span></h3>

      <p><b>Webcomics</b>, also known as <b>online comics</b> and <b>web comics</b>, are comics that are available on the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">Internet</a>. Many webcomics are exclusively <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">published</a> <!--del_lnk--> online, while some are published in print but maintain a web <!--del_lnk--> archive for either commercial or artistic reasons. With the Internet&#39;s easy access to an audience, webcomics run the gamut from traditional <!--del_lnk--> comic strips to <a href="../../wp/g/Graphic_novel.htm" title="Graphic novel">graphic novels</a> and beyond.<p>Webcomics are similar to self-published print comics in that almost anyone can create their own webcomic and publish it on the Web. Currently, there are thousands of webcomics available online. Some webcomics have gained popular, critical, or commercial success.<p><a id="Instructional_comics" name="Instructional_comics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Instructional comics</span></h3>
      <p>The instructional comic is a strip designed for educative or informative purposes, notably the instructions upon an aeroplane&#39;s safety card.<p><a id="Storyboard" name="Storyboard"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Storyboard</span></h3>

      <p><b>Storyboards</b> are like <!--del_lnk--> illustrations displayed in sequence for the purpose of previsualizing an animated or live-action <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a>. A storyboard is essentially a large <strong class="selflink">comic</strong> of the film or some section of the film produced beforehand to help the directors and cinematographers visualize the scenes and find potential problems before they occur. Often storyboards include arrows or instructions that indicate movement.<p><a id="Minicomic" name="Minicomic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Minicomic</span></h3>

      <p>A <b>minicomic</b> is a small, creator-published <!--del_lnk--> comic book, often <!--del_lnk--> photocopied and stapled or with a handmade binding. These are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of <!--del_lnk--> distribution. A number of <!--del_lnk--> cartoonists have started this way and gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other more established artists continue to produce minicomics on the side. Minicomics are even less mainstream than <!--del_lnk--> alternative comics.<p>The term was originally used in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and has a somewhat confusing history. Originally, it referred only to size: a <i>digest comic</i> measured 5.5 <!--del_lnk--> inches wide by 8.5 inches tall, while a <i>minicomic</i> was 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. These sizes were convenient for artists using standard office supplies: a <!--del_lnk--> US letter page could be folded in half to make a digest, or in quarters for a minicomic. These comics were generally photocopied, although some that were produced in larger quantities used <!--del_lnk--> offset printing. An early and unusually popular example of this minicomic format was <!--del_lnk--> Matt Feazell&#39;s <i>Cynicalman</i>, which began in 1980. (The earliest and most popular comics in mini- and digest sizes&mdash;predating not only the term <i>minicomic</i>, but even the standard comic-book format&mdash;were the anonymous and pornographic <!--del_lnk--> Tijuana bibles of the 1920s.)<p>Currently, the term is used in a more general sense which emphasizes the handmade, informal aspect rather than the format. By this loose definition, a single photocopied page folded in quarters would still be a minicomic, but so would a thicker digest-sized comic, or even a large, elaborate, and relatively expensive photocopied booklet with a <!--del_lnk--> silkscreened cover. Even some professionally printed and bound booklets are referred to as minicomics, as long as they are published by the artist and marketed in minicomic venues, but this usage is controversial.<p><a id="The_creation_of_comics" name="The_creation_of_comics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The creation of comics</span></h2>
      <p>The nature of the comics work being created determines the number of people who work upon its creation, with successful <!--del_lnk--> comic strips and <!--del_lnk--> comic books being produced through a <!--del_lnk--> studio system, in which an artist will assemble a team of assistants to help in the creation of the work. However, works from independent companies, <!--del_lnk--> self-publishers or those of a more personal nature can be produced by as little as one creator.<p><a id="Comic_book_creation" name="Comic_book_creation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comic book creation</span></h3>

      <p>Within the comic book industry of the United States, the studio system has come to be the main method of creation. Through its use by the industry, the roles have become heavily codified, and the managing of the studio has become the company&#39;s responsibility, with an editor discharging the management duties. The editor will assemble a number of creators and oversee the work to publication.<p>Any number of people can assist in the creation of a comic book in this way, from a <!--del_lnk--> plotter, a <!--del_lnk--> breakdown artist, a <!--del_lnk--> penciller, an <!--del_lnk--> inker, a <!--del_lnk--> scripter, a <!--del_lnk--> letterer, and a <!--del_lnk--> colorist, with some roles being performed by the same person.<p>See also <!--del_lnk--> Creation of a Tintin album for a description of a comic book creation steps by <!--del_lnk--> Herg&eacute;.<p><a id="Comic_strip_creation" name="Comic_strip_creation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comic strip creation</span></h3>

      <p>A comic strip tends to be the work of a sole creator, usually termed a cartoonist. However it is not unusual for a cartoonist to employ the studio method, particularly when a strip become successful. <!--del_lnk--> Mort Walker is one such creator who employed a studio, whilst <!--del_lnk--> Bill Watterson was one such cartoonist who eschewed the studio method, preferring to create the strip himself.<p><a id="Cartoon_creation" name="Cartoon_creation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cartoon creation</span></h3>
      <p>A <!--del_lnk--> cartoonist in this instance typically works alone, although again it is not unheard of for a cartoonist to use assistants.<p><a id="Tools_of_the_trade" name="Tools_of_the_trade"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tools of the trade</span></h3>
      <p>An artist will use a variety of pencils, paper, typically <!--del_lnk--> Bristol board, and a waterproof <!--del_lnk--> ink. When inking, an artist may choose to use a variety of <!--del_lnk--> brushes, <!--del_lnk--> dip pens, a <!--del_lnk--> fountain pen or a variety of <!--del_lnk--> technical pens or <!--del_lnk--> markers. <!--del_lnk--> Mechanical tints can be employed to add <!--del_lnk--> gray tone to an image. An artist might also choose to create his work in paints; either <!--del_lnk--> acrylics; <!--del_lnk--> gouache; <!--del_lnk--> poster paints; or <a href="../../wp/w/Watercolor_painting.htm" title="Watercolor painting">watercolors</a>. Colour can also be achieved through crayons, pastels or colored pencils.<p><!--del_lnk--> Erasers, <!--del_lnk--> rulers, <!--del_lnk--> templates, <!--del_lnk--> set squares and a <!--del_lnk--> T-square assist in creating lines and shapes. A <!--del_lnk--> drawing board gives a good angled surface to work from, with lamps supplying necessary lighting. A <!--del_lnk--> light box allows an artist to trace his pencil work when inking, allowing for a looser finish. <!--del_lnk--> Knives and <!--del_lnk--> scalpels will fill a variety of tasks, including cutting board or scraping mistakes. A <!--del_lnk--> cutting mat will assist when cutting paper. Process white is a thick opaque white handy for covering mistakes, whilst <!--del_lnk--> adhesives and <!--del_lnk--> tapes are helpful in composition where an image may need to be assembled from different sources.<p><a id="Computer_generated_comics" name="Computer_generated_comics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Computer generated comics</span></h3>
      <p>With the growth of computer processing power and ownership, there are now an increasing number of examples of comic books or strips where the art is made by using computers, either mixing it with hand drawings or replacing hand drawing completely. <!--del_lnk--> Dave McKean is one artist who combines the paper and the digital methods of composition. Still, it is important to separate between traditional drawing done with a <!--del_lnk--> graphics tablet and actual computer graphics (CG). Computers are widely used for both lettering and coloring, with <!--del_lnk--> Blambot <!--del_lnk--> Comicraft two studios which proved digitised <!--del_lnk--> fonts for comics.<p><a id="Comics_awards" name="Comics_awards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Comics awards</span></h2>
