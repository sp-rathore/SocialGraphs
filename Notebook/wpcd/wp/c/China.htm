      <p>China is called <i><b>Zhongguo</b></i> (also Romanized as <i><b>Chung-kuo</b></i> or <i><b>Jhongguo</b></i>) in <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin Chinese. The first character <i>zh&#x14D;ng</i> (&#x4E2D;) means &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;central,&quot; while <i>gu&oacute;</i> (&#x56FD; or &#x570B;) means &quot;country&quot; or &quot;kingdom&quot;.

      <p>China was one of the earliest centres of human <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilisation">civilisation</a>. Chinese civilisation was also one of the few to invent <!--del_lnk--> writing independently, the others being ancient <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (<a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumerians</a>), <!--del_lnk--> Ancient India (<a href="../../wp/i/Indus_Valley_Civilization.htm" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a>), the <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Mayan Civilization</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Chinese script is still used today by the Chinese and Japanese, and to a lesser extent by Koreans and Vietnamese. This script is one of the few <!--del_lnk--> logographic scripts still used in the world, and the only major one.<p><a id="Prehistory" name="Prehistory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Prehistory</span></h3>
      <p>Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest occupants in China date to as long as 2.24 million to 250,000 years ago by an ancient human relative (<!--del_lnk--> hominin) known as <!--del_lnk--> Homo erectus. One particular cave in <!--del_lnk--> Zhoukoudian (near current-day <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>) has fossilized evidence that current dating techniques put at somewhere between 300,000 and 550,000 years old. Evidence of primitive stone tool technology and animal bones associated with H. erectus have been studied since the late 18th to 19th centuries in various areas of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Asia including <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (in particular <!--del_lnk--> Java) and <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. It is thought that these early hominids first evolved in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene epoch. By 2 million years ago, the first migration wave of H. erectus settled throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Old World.<p>Fully modern <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) are believed to originally have evolved between roughly 200,000 and 168,000 years ago in the area of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Southern_Africa.htm" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Homo sapiens idaltu). By 100,000 to 50,000 years ago, modern human beings had settled in all parts of the Old World (25,000 to 11,000 BCE in the <!--del_lnk--> New World). In the last 100,000 years, all proto-human populations disappeared as modern humans took over or drove other human species into extinction.<p>The earliest evidence of fully modern humans in China comes from <!--del_lnk--> Liujiang County, <!--del_lnk--> Guangxi, where a cranium has been found and dated to approximately 67,000 years ago. Although much controversy persists over the dating of the Liujiang remains<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> , there is a partial skeleton from Minatogawa in <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> that has been <!--del_lnk--> radiocarbon dated to 18,250 &plusmn;650 to 16,600 &plusmn;300 years BP, which implies that modern humans must have reached China before that time.<p><a id="Dynastic_rule" name="Dynastic_rule"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Dynastic rule</span></h3>

      <p>The first <!--del_lnk--> dynasty according to Chinese sources was the <!--del_lnk--> Xia Dynasty, but it was believed to be mythical until scientific excavations were made at early <!--del_lnk--> bronze-age sites at <!--del_lnk--> Erlitou in <!--del_lnk--> Henan Province. Since then, archaeologists have uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs that point to the possible existence of the Xia dynasty at the same locations cited in ancient Chinese historical texts.<p>The first reliable historical dynasty is the <!--del_lnk--> Shang (Yin), which settled along the <a href="../../wp/y/Yellow_River.htm" title="Yellow River">Yellow River</a> in eastern China from the 18th to the 12th century BCE. The loosely feudal Shang were invaded from the west by the <!--del_lnk--> Zhou who ruled from the 12th to the 5th century BCE. The centralized authority of the Zhou was slowly eroded by warlords. In the <!--del_lnk--> Spring and Autumn period there were many strong, independent states continually warring with each other, who deferred to the <!--del_lnk--> Zhou state in name only. The first unified Chinese state was established by the <a href="../../wp/q/Qin_Dynasty.htm" title="Qin Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> in 221 BCE, when the office of the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor was set up and the Chinese language was standardized. This state did not last long, as its <!--del_lnk--> legalist approach to control soon led to widespread rebellion.<p>The subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty ruled China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, and created a lasting <!--del_lnk--> Han cultural identity among its populace that would last to the present day. The Han Dynasty expanded China&#39;s territory considerably with military campaigns reaching <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, and also established official contacts with the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road that the dynasty begun in Central Asia. After Han&#39;s collapse, another period of disunion followed, including the highly chivalric period of the <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms. Independent Chinese states of this period also opened diplomatic relations with <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, introducing the Chinese writing system there. In 580 CE, China was reunited under the <!--del_lnk--> Sui. Under the succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Tang and <!--del_lnk--> Song dynasties, China had its golden age. Between the 7th and 14th centuries, China was one of the most advanced <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilizations</a> in the world in technology, literature, and art, although change was gradual. In 1271, <!--del_lnk--> Mongol <!--del_lnk--> leader <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan established the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty, with the last remnant of the Song Dynasty falling to the Yuan in 1279. A peasant named <!--del_lnk--> Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Mongols in 1368 and founded the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>, which lasted until 1644. The Manchu-founded <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>, which lasted until 1912, was the last dynasty in China.<p>Regime change was often violent and the new ruling class usually needed to take special measures to ensure the loyalty of the overthrown dynasty. For example, after the <!--del_lnk--> Manchus conquered China, the Manchu rulers put into effect measures aimed at subduing the <!--del_lnk--> Han Chinese identity, such as the requirement for the Han Chinese to wear the Manchu hairstyle, the <!--del_lnk--> queue.<p>In the 18th century, China achieved a decisive technological advantage over the peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, with which it had been at war for several centuries, while simultaneously falling behind Europe.<p>In the 19th century the Qing Dynasty adopted a defensive posture towards European <!--del_lnk--> imperialism, even though it engaged in <!--del_lnk--> imperialistic expansion into Central Asia itself. At this time China awoke to the significance of the rest of the world, in particular the West. As China opened up to foreign trade and missionary activity, <!--del_lnk--> opium produced by <!--del_lnk--> British India was forced onto Qing China. Two <!--del_lnk--> Opium Wars with Britain weakened the Emperor&#39;s control. One result was the <!--del_lnk--> Taiping Civil War which lasted from 1851 to 1862. It was started by <!--del_lnk--> Hong Xiuquan, who was partly influenced by <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and believed himself the son of <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a> and the younger brother of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Although the Qing forces were eventually victorious, the civil war was one of the bloodiest in human history, costing at least twenty million lives (more than the total number of fatalities in the <!--del_lnk--> First World War), with some estimates of over thirty million. The flow of opium led to more decline, even in the face of noble efforts by missionaries such as <!--del_lnk--> Hudson Taylor and the <!--del_lnk--> China Inland Mission to stem the tide. While China was torn by continuous war, <!--del_lnk--> Meiji Japan succeeded in rapidly modernizing its military with its sights on Korea and Manchuria. Maneuvered by Imperial Japan, the Qing tributary state of <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> declared independence from Qing China in 1894, leading to the <!--del_lnk--> First Sino-Japanese War, which ended in China&#39;s humiliating seccession of both Korea and <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> to Japan. Following these series of defeats, <!--del_lnk--> a reform plan for Qing China to become a modern Meiji-style <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> was drafted by the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Guangxu in 1898, but was opposed and stopped by the Empress Dowager <!--del_lnk--> Cixi, who placed Emperor Guangxu under house arrest in a coup d&#39;&eacute;tat. Further destruction followed the ill-fated 1900 <!--del_lnk--> Boxer Rebellion against westerners in Beijing, to which Cixi had secretly supported. By the early 20th century, mass civil disorder had begun, and calls for reform and revolution were heard across the country. Emperor Guangxu died under house arrest on November 14, 1908, suspiciously just a day before Cixi. With the throne empty, he was succeeded by Cixi&#39;s handpicked heir, his young nephew <!--del_lnk--> Puyi, who became the Xuantong Emperor, the last Chinese emperor. Guangxu&#39;s consort, who became the <!--del_lnk--> Empress Dowager Longyu, signed the abdication decree as regent in 1912, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. She died, childless, in 1913.<p><a id="Republican_China" name="Republican_China"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Republican China</span></h3>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1912, the Republic of China was established, ending the Qing Dynasty. <a href="../../wp/s/Sun_Yat-sen.htm" title="Sun Yat-sen">Sun Yat-sen</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party), was proclaimed provisional president of the republic. However, <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who had defected to the revolutionary cause, soon forced Sun to step aside and took the presidency for himself. Yuan then attempted to have himself proclaimed emperor of a new dynasty; however, he died of natural causes before fully taking power over all of the Chinese empire.<p>After Yuan Shikai&#39;s death, China was politically fragmented, with an internationally-recognized, but virtually powerless, national government seated in Beijing. Warlords in various regions exercised actual control over their respective territories. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-shek, was able to reunify the country under its own control, moving the nation&#39;s capital to Nanjing and implementing &quot;<!--del_lnk--> political tutelage&quot;, an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen&#39;s program for transforming China into a modern, democratic state. Effectively, political tutelage meant one-party rule by the Kuomintang.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945 (part of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>) forced an uneasy alliance between the Nationalists and the Communists. With the surrender of <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in 1945, China emerged victorious but financially drained. The continued distrust between the Nationalists and the Communists led to the resumption of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Civil War. In 1947, constitutional rule was established, but because of the ongoing Civil War many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented on the mainland.<p><a id="The_People.27s_Republic_of_China_and_the_Republic_of_China" name="The_People.27s_Republic_of_China_and_the_Republic_of_China"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> and the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a></span></h3>
      <p>After its victory in the Chinese Civil War, the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China controlled most of Mainland China. On <!--del_lnk--> October 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1949, they established the People&#39;s Republic of China, laying claim as the <!--del_lnk--> successor state of the ROC. The central government of the ROC was forced to retreat to the island of <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. Major armed hostilities ceased in 1950 but both sides are technically still at war.<p>Beginning in the late 1970s, the Republic of China began the implementation of full, multi-party, <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy in the territories still under its control (<!--del_lnk--> Taiwan Province, <a href="../../wp/t/Taipei.htm" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Kaohsiung and some offshore islands of <!--del_lnk--> Fujian province). Today, the ROC has active political participation by all sectors of society. The main cleavage in ROC politics is the issue of eventual unification with China vs. formal independence.<p>Post-1978 reforms on the mainland have led to some relaxation of control over many areas of society. However, the Chinese government still has absolute control over politics, and it continually seeks to eradicate threats to the stability of the country. Examples include the fight against <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, jailing of <!--del_lnk--> political opponents and <!--del_lnk--> journalists, custody <!--del_lnk--> regulation of the press, <!--del_lnk--> regulation of religions, and suppression of independence/secessionist movements.

      <p>Today, the Republic of China continues to exist on Taiwan, while the People&#39;s Republic of China controls the Chinese mainland. The PRC continues to be dominated by the Communist Party, but the ROC has moved towards democracy. Both states are still officially claiming to be the sole legitimate ruler of all of &quot;China&quot;. The ROC had more international support immediately after 1949, but most international diplomatic recognitions have shifted to the PRC. The ROC representative to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> was replaced by the PRC representative in 1971.<p>The ROC has not formally renounced its claim to all of China, or changed its official maps on which its territories include the mainland, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, but it has moved away from this identity and increasingly identifies itself as &quot;Taiwan&quot;. Presently, the ROC does not pursue any of its claims on the territories administered by the PRC, nor the territories of <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. The PRC claims to have succeeded the ROC as the legitimate governing authority of all of China including Taiwan. The PRC has used diplomatic and economic pressure to advance its <!--del_lnk--> One China policy, which attempts to prevent official recognition of the ROC by world organizations such as the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> International Olympic Committee.

      <p>Top-level political divisions of China have altered as administrations changed. Top levels included <!--del_lnk--> circuits and <!--del_lnk--> provinces. Below that, there have been <!--del_lnk--> prefectures, <!--del_lnk--> subprefectures, <!--del_lnk--> departments, <!--del_lnk--> commanderies, <!--del_lnk--> districts, and <!--del_lnk--> counties. Recent divisions also include <!--del_lnk--> prefecture-level cities, <!--del_lnk--> county-level cities, <!--del_lnk--> towns and <!--del_lnk--> townships.<p>Most Chinese dynasties were based in the historical heartlands of China, known as <!--del_lnk--> China proper. Various dynasties also <!--del_lnk--> expanded into peripheral territories like <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia, <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria, <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tibet.htm" title="Tibet">Tibet</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Manchu-established <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> and its successors, the ROC and the PRC, incorporated these territories into China. China proper is generally thought to be bounded by the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Wall_of_China.htm" title="Great Wall">Great Wall</a> and the edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Plateau. <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria and <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia are found to the north of the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Wall_of_China.htm" title="Great Wall of China">Great Wall of China</a>, and the boundary between them can either be taken as the present border between <!--del_lnk--> Inner Mongolia and the <!--del_lnk--> northeast Chinese provinces, or the more historic border of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era <!--del_lnk--> puppet state of <!--del_lnk--> Manchukuo. <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang&#39;s borders correspond to today&#39;s administrative <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang.

On the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, grasslands can be seen. Southern China is dominated by hills and low <!--del_lnk--> mountain ranges. In the central-east are the <!--del_lnk--> deltas of China&#39;s two major rivers, the <!--del_lnk--> Huang He and <a href="../../wp/y/Yangtze_River.htm" title="Yangtze River">Yangtze River</a> (Chang Jiang).

      <p>China&#39;s overall population exceeds 1.3 billion, about one-fifth of the world&#39;s population. While over a hundred <!--del_lnk--> ethnic groups have existed in China, the government of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> officially recognizes a total of <!--del_lnk--> 56. The largest ethnic group in China by far is the <!--del_lnk--> Han. This group is diverse and can be divided into smaller ethnic groups that share some traits.<p>Many ethnic groups have been assimilated into neighboring ethnicities or disappeared without a trace. Several previously distinct ethnic groups have been <!--del_lnk--> Sinicized into the Han, causing its population to increase dramatically. At the same time, many within the Han identity have maintained distinct linguistic and cultural traditions, though still identifying as Han. Many foreign groups have shaped Han language and culture, e.g. the queue was a pig tail hairstyle strictly enforced by the Manchurians on the Han populace. The term <!--del_lnk--> Chinese nation (<i>Zhonghua Minzu</i>) is usually used to describe a notion of a Chinese nationality that transcends ethnic divisions.<p><a id="Languages" name="Languages"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h3>

      <p>Most languages in China belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Tibetan language family, spoken by 29 ethnicities. There are also several major &quot;dialects&quot; within the <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese language</a> itself. The most spoken dialects are <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin (spoken by over 70% of the population), <!--del_lnk--> Wu (Shanghainese), <!--del_lnk--> Yue (Cantonese), <!--del_lnk--> Min, <!--del_lnk--> Xiang, <!--del_lnk--> Gan, and <!--del_lnk--> Hakka.

Standard Mandarin is the medium of instruction in education and is taught in all schools. It is the language used in the media, for formal purposes, and by the government. Non-Sinitic languages are co-official in some autonomic minority regions. Road signs in major Chinese cities are typically bilingual in Chinese and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>.<p>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Vernacular Chinese&quot; or &quot;<i>baihua</i>&quot; is the written standard based on the Mandarin dialect which has been in use since the early 20th century. An older written standard, <!--del_lnk--> Classical Chinese, was used by literati for thousands of years before the 20th century. Classical Chinese is still a part of the high school curriculum and is thus intelligible to some degree to many Chinese. Spoken variants other than Standard Mandarin are usually not written, except for <!--del_lnk--> Standard Cantonese (see <!--del_lnk--> Written Cantonese) which is sometimes used in informal contexts.<p>Chinese banknotes are multilingual and contain written scripts for Standard Mandarin (<!--del_lnk--> Chinese characters and <!--del_lnk--> Hanyu Pinyin), Zhuang (<!--del_lnk--> Roman alphabet), Tibetan (<!--del_lnk--> Tibetan alphabet), Uyghur (<!--del_lnk--> Arabic alphabet) and Mongolian (<!--del_lnk--> traditional Mongolian alphabet).<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>The People&#39;s Republic of China is officially secular and atheist but it does allow personal religion or supervised religious organization. <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (&#x4F5B;&#x6559;) and <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoism</a> (&#x9053;&#x6559;), along with an underlying <!--del_lnk--> Confucian morality, have been the dominant religions of Chinese society for almost two millennia. Personal religion has been more widely tolerated in the PRC today, so there has been a resurrection of interest in Buddhism and Taoism in the past decade. The main tradition of Buddhism practiced by the Chinese is <!--del_lnk--> Mahayana Buddhism (&#x5927;&#x4E58;) and its subsets <!--del_lnk--> Pure Land (&#x6DE8;&#x571F;&#x5B97;) and <!--del_lnk--> Zen (&#x79AA;/&#x7985;&#x5B97;) are the most common.

The <!--del_lnk--> Central Intelligence Agency (<!--del_lnk--> CIA) of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> reports that in addition to unknown numbers of adherents of Taoism and Buddhism,<ul>

      <p>In recent years <!--del_lnk--> Falun Gong, developed in the 1990s, has attracted great controversy after the government labeled it a malicious <!--del_lnk--> cult<!--del_lnk-->  and attempted to eradicate it.

The Falun Gong claims approximately 70-100 million followers, a number which is rejected by foreign independent groups and the Chinese government, though exact numbers are unknown.<p>Religion and ancient Chinese traditions are widely tolerated in the Republic of China, and play a big role in the daily lives of modern Taiwanese people. According to the official figures released by the CIA:<ul>
       <li>93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism.<li>2.5% of Taiwanese are adherents of other religions, such as Islam, <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and others.<li>4.5% of Taiwanese are adherents of Christianity, this group includes a combination of <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, <!--del_lnk--> Catholics, <!--del_lnk--> Mormons, and other non-denominational Christian groups.</ul>

      <p>Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of <!--del_lnk--> Imperial China&#39;s history, and mastery of Confucian texts was the primary criterion for <!--del_lnk--> entry into the imperial bureaucracy. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, e.g. the view that <!--del_lnk--> calligraphy was a higher art form than painting or drama. China&#39;s traditional values were derived from various versions of <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> conservatism. A number of more <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian strains of thought have also been influential, such as <!--del_lnk--> Legalism. There was often conflict between the philosophies, e.g. the <!--del_lnk--> individualistic <!--del_lnk--> Song Dynasty <!--del_lnk--> neo-Confucians believed <!--del_lnk--> Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a <!--del_lnk--> culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of <!--del_lnk--> New Confucians have advocated that democratic ideals and human rights are quite compatible with traditional Confucian &quot;Asian values&quot;.<p>With the rise of Western <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> military power beginning in the mid-19th century, non-Chinese systems of social and political organization gained adherents in China. Some of these would-be reformers totally rejected China&#39;s cultural legacy, while others sought to combine the strengths of Chinese and Western cultures. In essence, the history of 20th century China is one of experimentation with new systems of social, <!--del_lnk--> political, and economic organization that would allow for the reintegration of the nation in the wake of dynastic collapse.<p>The first leaders of the PRC were born in the old society but were influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and Confucian education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and obedience to the state. Many observers believe that the period following 1949 is a continuation of traditional Chinese <!--del_lnk--> dynastic history. Others say that the CPC&#39;s rule and the <!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution have damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, asserting that many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese art, literature, and performing arts like <!--del_lnk--> Beijing opera were altered to conform to government policies and communist propaganda. The institution of the <!--del_lnk--> Simplified Chinese orthography reform is controversial as well.<p>Today, the PRC government has accepted much of traditional <!--del_lnk--> Chinese culture as an integral part of Chinese society, calling it an important achievement of the Chinese civilization and vital to the formation of a <!--del_lnk--> Chinese national identity.<p>Chinese films have enjoyed box office success abroad, introducing both exotic and mundane elements of Chinese culture across the world. In the last two decades, China has become a hotbed of filmmaking with such films as <i><!--del_lnk--> Farewell My Concubine</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> In the Mood for Love</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> 2046</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i> (Taiwan), <i><!--del_lnk--> Yi Yi</i> (Taiwan), <i><!--del_lnk--> Hero</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Infernal Affairs</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Suzhou River</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Road Home</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> House of Flying Daggers</i> being critically acclaimed around the world.<p><a id="Arts.2C_scholarship.2C_and_literature" name="Arts.2C_scholarship.2C_and_literature"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Arts, scholarship, and literature</span></h3>
