The city was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1812 at the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> Scioto and <!--del_lnk--> Olentangy rivers, and assumed the functions of state capital in <!--del_lnk--> 1816.<p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 census, Columbus has a population of 711,470 residents, making it the largest city in Ohio and <!--del_lnk--> the 15th largest in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The population increased to an estimated 730,657 in 2005.

      <p>Evidence of ancient <!--del_lnk--> mound-building societies abounds in the region near the confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> Scioto and <!--del_lnk--> Olentangy rivers. Mound Street, located in downtown Columbus, was so named because of its proximity to a large Native American burial mound. Those ancient civilizations had long since faded into history when European explorers began moving into the region south of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Erie. Rather than an empty <!--del_lnk--> frontier, however, they encountered people of the <!--del_lnk--> Miami, <!--del_lnk--> Delaware, <!--del_lnk--> Wyandot, <!--del_lnk--> Shawnee, and <!--del_lnk--> Mingo nations. These tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, resulting in years of bitter conflict. A decisive battle at <!--del_lnk--> Fallen Timbers resulted in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Greenville, which finally opened the way for new settlements. By <!--del_lnk--> 1797, a young <!--del_lnk--> surveyor from <!--del_lnk--> Virginia named <!--del_lnk--> Lucas Sullivant had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River. An admirer of <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Franklin.htm" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, Sullivant chose to name his new frontier village &quot;Franklinton.&quot;<p><a name="19th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">19th century</span></h3>
      <p>After achieving statehood in <!--del_lnk--> 1803, political infighting among Ohio&#39;s more prominent leaders resulted in the state <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> moving from <!--del_lnk--> Chillicothe to <!--del_lnk--> Zanesville and back again. The state legislature eventually decided that a new capital city, located in the center of the state, was a necessary compromise. Several of Ohio&#39;s small towns and villages petitioned the legislature for the honour of becoming the state capital, but ultimately a coalition of land speculators, with Sullivant&#39;s support, made the most attractive offer to the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio General Assembly. Named in honour of <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, the capital city was founded in February, <!--del_lnk--> 1812, on the &quot;High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto known as Wolf&#39;s Ridge.&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> National Road reached Columbus from <a href="../../wp/b/Baltimore%252C_Maryland.htm" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1831, which complemented the city&#39;s new link to the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio and Erie Canal and facilitated a population boom. A wave of immigrants from Europe resulted in the establishment of two ethnic <!--del_lnk--> enclaves on the outskirts of the city. A significant <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germans</a> took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as <!--del_lnk--> <i>Die Alte Sud Ende</i> (The Old South End). Columbus&#39; German population is responsible for constructing numerous breweries, the Lutheran Theological <!--del_lnk--> Seminary, <!--del_lnk--> Capital University, and for instituting the first <!--del_lnk--> kindergarten in the United States.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1850 the <!--del_lnk--> Columbus and Xenia Railroad became the first railroad to enter the city, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad in <!--del_lnk--> 1851. The two railroads built a joint <!--del_lnk--> Union Station on the east side of High Street just north of Naughten (then called North Public Lane). Rail traffic into Columbus increased--by <!--del_lnk--> 1875 Columbus was served by eight railroads, and a new, more elaborate station was built.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1857, the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Statehouse finally opened to the public after eighteen years of construction. During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, Columbus was the home of <!--del_lnk--> Camp Chase, a major base for the <!--del_lnk--> Union Army that housed 26,000 troops and held up to 9,000 <!--del_lnk--> Confederate <!--del_lnk--> prisoners of war. Over 2,000 Confederate soldiers remain buried at the site, making it one of the largest Confederate cemeteries in the North. By virtue of the <!--del_lnk--> Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1870 on the former estate of William and Hannah Neil.<p>By the end of the 19th century, Columbus saw the rise of several major <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> businesses. The city became known as the &quot;Buggy Capital of the World,&quot; thanks to the presence of some two dozen <!--del_lnk--> buggy factories, notably the Columbus Buggy Company, which was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1875 by C.D. Firestone. The Columbus Consolidated Brewing Company also rose to prominence during this time, and it may have achieved even greater success were it not for the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Saloon League, based in neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Westerville. In the steel industry, a forward-thinking man named <!--del_lnk--> Samuel P. Bush presided over the <!--del_lnk--> Buckeye Steel Castings Company. Columbus was also a popular location for the organization of labor. In <!--del_lnk--> 1886, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Gompers founded the <!--del_lnk--> American Federation of Labor in Druid&#39;s Hall on S. Fourth Street, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1890 the <!--del_lnk--> United Mine Workers of America was founded at old City Hall.<p><a name="20th_century_to_the_present"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">20th century to the present</span></h3>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Columbus earned its nickname &quot;The Arch City&quot; because of the dozens of metal (formerly wooden) arches that spanned High Street at the turn of the twentieth century. The arches illuminated the thoroughfare and eventually became the means by which electric power was provided to the new <!--del_lnk--> streetcars. The arches were torn down and replaced with cluster lights in 1914, but were reconstructed in the <!--del_lnk--> Short North district for their unique historical interest..<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1913, a catastrophic flood devastated the neighbourhood of Franklinton, leaving over ninety people dead and thousands of West Side residents homeless. To prevent future flooding, the <!--del_lnk--> Army Corps of Engineers recommended widening the Scioto River through downtown, constructing new bridges, and building a retaining wall along its banks. With the strength of the post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">WWI</a> economy, a construction boom occurred in the 1920s, resulting in a new Civic Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Theatre, the <!--del_lnk--> American Insurance Union Citadel, and, to the north, a massive new <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Stadium.<p>The effects of the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression were somewhat less severe in Columbus, as the city&#39;s diversified economy helped it fare marginally better than its <!--del_lnk--> Rust Belt neighbors. <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> brought a tremendous number of new jobs to the city, and with it another population surge. This time, the majority of new arrivals were migrants from the &quot;extraordinarily depressed rural areas&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> Appalachia, who would soon account for more than a third of Columbus&#39; rising population. In <!--del_lnk--> 1948, the Town and Country Shopping Centre opened in suburban <!--del_lnk--> Whitehall, and it is now regarded as one of the first modern <!--del_lnk--> shopping centers in the United States. Along with the construction of the <!--del_lnk--> interstate highway, it signaled the arrival of rapid <!--del_lnk--> suburban development in central Ohio. In order to protect the city&#39;s tax base from this <!--del_lnk--> suburbanization, Columbus adopted a policy of linking sewer and water hookups to <!--del_lnk--> annexation to the city. By the early 1990s, Columbus had grown to become Ohio&#39;s largest city in both land area and in population.<p>Efforts to revitalize <!--del_lnk--> downtown Columbus have met with mixed results in recent decades. In the 1970&#39;s old landmarks such as <!--del_lnk--> Union Station and the Neil House Hotel were razed to construct high-rise office and retail spaces such as the <!--del_lnk--> Huntington Centre. Newer suburban developments at <!--del_lnk--> Tuttle Crossing, <!--del_lnk--> Easton, and <!--del_lnk--> Polaris have inhibited much of the anticipated downtown growth. Still, with the addition of the <!--del_lnk--> Arena District as well as hundreds of downtown residential units, significant revitalization efforts are likely to continue in the downtown area.<p>The Columbus metropolitan area has experienced several strong waves of immigration in the 20th century, including groups from <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Somalia.htm" title="Somalia">Somalia</a>, and a slower ongoing immigration from <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and other Hispanic countries. Many other countries of origin are represented as well, with much of this related to the international draw of The Ohio State University.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 550.5 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (212.6 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;). 544.6 km&sup2; (210.3 mi&sup2;) of it is land and 5.9 km&sup2; (2.3 mi&sup2;) of it (1.07%) is water. Unlike many other major US cities in the <!--del_lnk--> Midwest, Columbus continues to expand its reach by way of extensions and <!--del_lnk--> annexations, making it one of the fastest growing large cities in the nation, in terms of both geography and population, and probably the fastest in the <!--del_lnk--> Midwest. Unlike <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Cincinnati, the central cities in Ohio&#39;s two largest metropolitan areas, Columbus is ringed by relatively few suburbs; since the 1950s it has made <!--del_lnk--> annexation a condition for providing water and sewer service, to which it holds regional rights throughout a large portion of Central Ohio. This policy is credited with preserving Columbus&#39; tax base in the face of the U.S.&#39;s suburbanization and has contributed to its continued economic expansion, much like other cities pursuing similar policies such as <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte, <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina, and <!--del_lnk--> San Antonio, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, both of which are similarly lacking in surrounding incorporated suburbs.<p>The confluence of the <!--del_lnk--> Scioto and <!--del_lnk--> Olentangy rivers occurs just west of downtown Columbus. Several smaller tributaries course through the Columbus metro area, including Alum Creek, Big Walnut Creek, and Darby Creek. Columbus is considered to have relatively flat <!--del_lnk--> topography thanks to a large <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glacier</a> that covered most of Ohio during the <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsian Ice Age. However, there are sizeable differences in elevation through the area, with the high point of Franklin County being 1130ft (345m) above <!--del_lnk--> Sea level near New Albany, and the low point being 680ft (207m) where the Scioto River leaves the county near Lockbourne. Numerous ravine areas near the rivers and creeks also help give some variety to the landscape. As far as trees, <!--del_lnk--> deciduous trees are common, including <!--del_lnk--> maple, <!--del_lnk--> oak, <!--del_lnk--> hickory, <!--del_lnk--> walnut, <!--del_lnk--> poplar, <!--del_lnk--> cottonwood, and of course, <!--del_lnk--> buckeye.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>

      <p>The region is dominated by a <!--del_lnk--> humid continental climate, characterized by hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters. The highest temperature ever recorded in Columbus was 106&deg;F (41&deg;C), which occurred twice during the <!--del_lnk--> Dust Bowl <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a> of the 1930&#39;s - once on <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1934, and again two years later, on <!--del_lnk--> July 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1936. The coldest was -22&deg;F (-30&deg;C), occurring <!--del_lnk--> January 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1994.<br />
       <br /> Columbus is subject to <!--del_lnk--> Severe weather typical to the Midwestern United States. Tornadoes are possible from the spring to the fall, the most recent of which occurred on <!--del_lnk--> 11 October <!--del_lnk--> 2006 and caused <!--del_lnk--> F2 damage. <!--del_lnk--> Floods, <!--del_lnk--> Blizzards, and <!--del_lnk--> Severe Thunderstorms can also occur from time to time. <a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>Columbus also has a number of distinctive neighborhoods within the metro area. The <!--del_lnk--> Short North, situated just north of downtown, is rich with <!--del_lnk--> art galleries, dining, pubs, and specialty shops. A number of large, ornate <!--del_lnk--> Victorian homes are located nearby, and together they comprise <!--del_lnk--> Victorian Village. To the south, <!--del_lnk--> German Village is known for its quaint 19th century brick cottages, and it holds the distinction as the largest privately funded historic district on the <!--del_lnk--> National Register of Historic Places. Franklinton, sometimes known as &quot;the Bottoms&quot;, is the neighbourhood immediately west of downtown. It gets its colorful nickname due to the fact that much of the land lies below the level of the Scioto and Olentangy rivers, and a floodwall is required to contain the rivers and protect the area from devastating floods. Just to the west of Franklinton is a group of smaller neighborhoods commonly referred to as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Hilltop.&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> OSU Campus area is populated by a high concentration of students during the school year (approximately 35,000 undergraduate students and 15,000 graduate students for a total of 50,000 students) and features many old homes which have been converted to apartments for student use. The stretch of High Street that runs through the campus area caters to the student body with its abundance of bars, sandwich shops, and music stores and bookstores. Located between OSU and Worthington is <!--del_lnk--> Clintonville, where a mix of middle class <!--del_lnk--> Levittown-type homes can be found alongside beautiful old stone and brick-faced houses nestled among rolling hills. <!--del_lnk--> Clintonville is home to Whetstone Park, and the Park of Roses, a beautiful 13 acre rose garden. Further west of downtown, <!--del_lnk--> San Margherita is a community formed by Italian immigrants who arrived at the turn of the 20th century.<p>Other neighborhoods and crossroads around the area include: <!--del_lnk--> Berwick, <!--del_lnk--> Bexley, <!--del_lnk--> Dublin, <!--del_lnk--> Gahanna, <!--del_lnk--> Hungarian Village, <!--del_lnk--> Merion Village, <!--del_lnk--> Milo Grogan, <!--del_lnk--> Linden, <!--del_lnk--> Flytown, <!--del_lnk--> Italian Village, <!--del_lnk--> Weinland Park, <!--del_lnk--> Driving Park, <!--del_lnk--> New Albany, <!--del_lnk--> Olde Town East, <!--del_lnk--> Grandview<!--del_lnk--> -Marble Cliff, <!--del_lnk--> Seagrave, <!--del_lnk--> University View, <!--del_lnk--> Valleyview, <!--del_lnk--> New Rome, <!--del_lnk--> Urbancrest, <!--del_lnk--> Eastmoor, <!--del_lnk--> Minerva Park, <!--del_lnk--> Mifflinville, <!--del_lnk--> Linworth, <!--del_lnk--> Riverlea, <!--del_lnk--> Northland, <!--del_lnk--> Olentangy, <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln Village, <!--del_lnk--> Upper Arlington, <!--del_lnk--> Westerville and <!--del_lnk--> Worthington.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h3>
      <p>Columbus is bisected by two major <!--del_lnk--> Interstate Highways, <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 70 running east-west, and <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 71 running north to roughly southwest. The two Interstates combine downtown for about 1.5 miles in an area locally known as &quot;The Split&quot;, which is a major traffic congestion point within Columbus, especially during <!--del_lnk--> rush hour. <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway 40, aka <!--del_lnk--> National Road, runs east-west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. It is also widely recognized as the nation&#39;s first highway. <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway 23 runs roughly north-south, while <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway 33 runs northwest-to-southeast. The <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 270 Outerbelt encircles the vast majority of Columbus and its suburbs, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 670 spur on the north side (which continues to the east past Port Columbus International Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), <!--del_lnk--> State Route 315 on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state&#39;s destinations are within a 2-hour drive of Columbus.<p>The city&#39;s street plan originates downtown and in the immediate vicinities, the oldest parts of the city. The plan follows a roughly gridiron model bisected by <!--del_lnk--> High Street (running north-south) and Broad Street (running east-west). The city street numbering plan originates at their intersection in mid-downtown, so house numbers increase with distance from downtown. This street grid is not followed as strictly further out from downtown, particularly in the suburbs (mostly old towns with their own street plans still intact) and the newer subdivisions. Besides High and Broad Streets, major thoroughfares in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road (aka SR-161), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road (aka <!--del_lnk--> SR-3), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, and Livingston Avenue.<p>Columbus maintains a widespread municipal bus service called the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA). Columbus used to have a major train station downtown called <!--del_lnk--> Union Station, however it was razed in the late 1970s. Columbus is now the second largest metropolitan area in the U.S. (after <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix) without passenger rail service. It is served by <!--del_lnk--> Port Columbus International Airport, <!--del_lnk--> Rickenbacker International Airport, <!--del_lnk--> Don Scott Airport (run by OSU), and <!--del_lnk--> Bolton Field Airport.<p>A modern <!--del_lnk--> streetcar system has been proposed for the downtown and surrounding areas. The most favored route would run along High Street, from the <!--del_lnk--> Brewery District to the <!--del_lnk--> Short North. It is not clear where funding for such a system would come from, and no firm construction plans have been promulgated.<p>Columbus was a stop along the <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad that connected <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh to <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

The <!--del_lnk--> population density was 1,306.4/km&sup2; (3,383.6/mi&sup2;). There were 327,175 housing units at an average density of 600.8/km&sup2; (1,556.0/mi&sup2;).

The average household size was 2.30 and the average family size was 3.01.<p>The age distribution is 24.2% under the age of 18, 14.0% from 18 to 24, 35.1% from 25 to 44, 17.9% from 45 to 64, and 8.9% who were 65 years of age or older.

About 10.8% of families and 14.8% of the population were below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line, including 18.7% of those under age 18 and 10.9% of those age 65 or over.<p>Due to its demographics, which include a mix of races and a wide range of incomes, as well as urban, suburban, and nearby rural areas, Columbus has been considered to be a &quot;typical&quot; American city, and has been used as a test market for new products by retail and restaurant chains. However, newer studies suggest that Columbus may no longer accurately mirror the U.S. population as a whole.<p>The demographics of Central Ohio are changing rapidly with the influx of immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and Asia. As is the case in much of America, there is less assimilation going on than compartmentalization, with large monoethnic neighborhoods developing. This influx is putting pressure on all of the social services institutions, notably the public schools and the public health system.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Columbus is home to several world-class buildings, including the Greek-Revival State Capitol and the <!--del_lnk--> Peter Eisenman-designed <!--del_lnk--> Wexner Centre and Columbus Convention Centre. Other buildings of interest include the <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes State Office Tower, <!--del_lnk--> LeVeque Tower, and <!--del_lnk--> One Nationwide Plaza.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Statehouse construction began in 1839 on a 10-acre (40,000-m&sup2;) plot of land donated by four prominent Columbus landowners. This plot formed Capitol Square, which was not part of the original layout of the city. Built of Columbus <!--del_lnk--> limestone from the <!--del_lnk--> Marble Cliff Quarry Co., the Statehouse stands on foundations 18 feet (5 m) deep, laid by <!--del_lnk--> prison labor gangs rumored to have been comprised largely of <!--del_lnk--> masons jailed for minor infractions. The Statehouse features a central recessed <!--del_lnk--> porch with a <!--del_lnk--> colonnade of a forthright and primitive <!--del_lnk--> Greek Doric mode. A broad and low central pediment supports the windowed <!--del_lnk--> astylar drum under an invisibly low <!--del_lnk--> saucer dome that lights the interior <!--del_lnk--> rotunda. Unlike many U.S. state capitol buildings, the Ohio State Capitol owes little to the architecture of the <!--del_lnk--> national Capitol. During the long course of the Statehouse&#39;s 22 years of construction, seven architects were employed. Relations between the legislature and the architects were not always cordial: Nathan B. Kelly, who introduced heating and an ingenious system of natural forced ventilation, was dismissed because the commissioners found his designs too lavish for the original intentions of the committee. The Statehouse was opened to the legislature and the public in 1857 and finally completed in 1861. It is located at the intersection of Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus.<p>Founded in 1975, The Jefferson Center for Learning and the Arts is a campus of nonprofit organizations and a center for research, publications, and seminars on nonprofit leadership and governance.
