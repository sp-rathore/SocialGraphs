      <p>A <b>CF7</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> EMD F-unit <!--del_lnk--> railroad <!--del_lnk--> locomotive that has had its streamlined carbody removed and replaced with a custom-made, &quot;general purpose&quot; body in order to adapt the unit for <!--del_lnk--> road switching duty. All of the conversions were performed by the <!--del_lnk--> Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in their <!--del_lnk--> Cleburne, Texas workshops between October, <!--del_lnk--> 1970 and March, <!--del_lnk--> 1978. The program was initiated in response to a system-wide need for more than 200 additional four-axle diesel <!--del_lnk--> hood units to meet projected motive power demands on <!--del_lnk--> branch lines and secondary <!--del_lnk--> main lines.<p>Santa Fe&#39;s aging fleet of 200-series F-units were in dire need of overhaul, and were not suitable for switching service in their original configurations due to the poor visibility resulting from their the full-width carbody; the <!--del_lnk--> engineer was required to stick his or her head out of the window in order to see the end of the train or locomotive when coupling and uncoupling cars. As new, state-of-the-art locomotives cost upwards of $150,000 each at the time, Santa Fe elected to experiment with modifying its existing F-units to serve their purpose, which they hoped they could accomplish for around $60,000 each.<p>Changes in business philosophy led the company to sell off its entire CF7 inventory by 1987, with most of the units (all but 9) ending up in the hands of regional and <!--del_lnk--> short-line railroads, and a few excursion lines. A number remain in service today.<p>

      <p>The first locomotive to go through the &quot;<b>C</b>onverted <b>F7</b>&quot; Program was Santa Fe <!--del_lnk--> #262C, an F7A <!--del_lnk--> cab unit that entered the Cleburne shops in October, <!--del_lnk--> 1969. The unit was stripped down to bare metal, its sleek carbody removed and scrapped. Unlike hood units, cab units were structurally supported by their carbodies, so a new underframe had to be constructed. Next, a new road switcher carbody complete with walkways was manufactured and installed, along with numerous other upgrades traditionally associated with a comprehensive overhaul, including remanufactured prime movers, trucks, and traction motors (rebuilt at the <!--del_lnk--> San Bernardino, California shops), refurbished electrical systems, and enhanced brakes. #262C was the only CF7 conversion ever equipped with <!--del_lnk--> dynamic brakes, which were parted-out from the long hood of wrecked <!--del_lnk--> GP7B #2788A.<p>In order for the salvaged hood to fit, some 7&quot; had to be removed from the bottom of the hood where the it connected to the main frame and the running board (all other units had long hoods fabricated from scratch by the Cleburne shop forces). A new rounded-roof and low short hood were constructed, and a new control stand installed. To increase versatility, the unit could operate in either switching mode or road service mode. All CF7s were configured with a <!--del_lnk--> B-B wheel arrangement and ran on two <!--del_lnk--> Blomberg B two-axle <!--del_lnk--> trucks, with all axles powered. All but one CF7 utilized the F-units&#39; sixteen-cylinder <!--del_lnk--> EMD 567 series diesel engines as their prime mover, progressing from model 16-567B through 16-567C (#2452 was tested with an <!--del_lnk--> EMD 645 series <!--del_lnk--> turbocharged engine, which produced 2,000 horsepower &mdash; however, the greater availability of parts for the 567 series, coupled with the perception that CF7s would be engaged primarily in switching duties, resulted in the original motors being retained). The engines were removed from their frames, completely dismantled and rebuilt, then reinstalled.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="gallery">

      <p>Assigned <!--del_lnk--> #2649 and painted in Santa Fe&#39;s blue and yellow <i>Billboard</i> scheme, the locomotive was placed into service in February of 1970 and put through its paces during a series of shakedown runs between Cleburne and <a href="../../wp/d/Dallas%252C_Texas.htm" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas</a>. The unit was officially unveiled to the public on <!--del_lnk--> March 13. This initial conversion was considered a success, though several key modifications were incorporated into future units. Based on input from trainmen within the Santa Fe system, the steps on were lowered and enlarged to provide better footing for the <!--del_lnk--> brakeman. Additionally, the grab irons were repositioned to enhance crew safety during switching movements.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During the 8-year program period a total of 233 CF7 conversions were performed (the total number of suitable F-units available in the fleet, as 24 had been involved in wrecks and deemed unusable). <!--del_lnk--> EMD F3, <a href="../../wp/e/EMD_F7.htm" title="EMD F7">F7</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> F9 models were all modified under the program. All but the modifications to #262C required approximately 45 days to complete per unit. The average retrofit cost was $40,000 per unit, well below Santa Fe&#39;s original target estimate. The CF7s went through a limited evolution during this time, most notably:<ul>
       <li>Unit Nos. 2649&ndash;2472 initially received rounded cab roofs (which, by preserving the contour left over from the F-unit roof, were expected to reduce costs &mdash; instead, it was found that the custom-fitted cab doors required by this arrangement were not economical, and many of the units eventually were modified with angled roofs), and Nos. 2471&ndash;2417 featured angled cab roofs from the onset;<li>Unit Nos. 2649&ndash;2614 were outfitted with 2-stack exhaust systems, and Nos. 2613&ndash;2417 were equipped with 4-stack exhausts; and<li>Most units converted beginning in 1973 had <!--del_lnk--> air conditioning systems installed at the Cleburne facility; eventually all CF7s received cab air conditioners.</ul>
      <p>Nos. 2649&ndash;2617 came out of the shops wearing Santa Fe&#39;s <i>Billboard</i> paint scheme, while Nos. 2616&ndash;2417 were decorated in the <i>Yellowbonnet</i> livery. It is not clear why the Santa Fe chose to issue road numbers for its CF7 units in descending order.<p><a id="In_service" name="In_service"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In service</span></h3>

The units distinguished themselves working on <!--del_lnk--> potash trains between <!--del_lnk--> Clovis and <!--del_lnk--> Carlsbad, New Mexico; Nos. 2612&ndash;2625, all equipped with remote control equipment (RCE), were typically &quot;mated&quot; to <!--del_lnk--> road slugs (converted cabless F-units). CF7s also powered <!--del_lnk--> grain trains across the <b>Plains Division</b>.<p>The Santa Fe had planned in the mid-1980s to renumber its CF7 fleet from 2649&ndash;2417 to 1131&ndash;1000 and repaint the units in the new &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kodachrome&quot; paint scheme, all in preparation for the upcoming <!--del_lnk--> Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad (SPSF) merger. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) subsequently denied the merger application, and no CF7s were decorated in the new livery.<p><a id="Afterlife" name="Afterlife"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Afterlife</span></h3>
      <p>Changing philosophies regarding motive power expenditures led the Santa Fe to begin trimming its CF7 roster in <!--del_lnk--> 1984. The majority of the locomotives were sold for as little as $20,000 to short-line and regional railroads such as the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Railway and the <!--del_lnk--> Maryland and Delaware Railroad (6 were involved in wrecks and 3 others sent directly to the scrap yards), though <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> and <!--del_lnk--> GE Transportation Systems were among the major initial purchasers.
