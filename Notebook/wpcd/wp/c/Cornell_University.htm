      <p><b>Cornell University</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> private <!--del_lnk--> research university located in <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, New York. Its two medical campuses are in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> and in <!--del_lnk--> Education City, <a href="../../wp/q/Qatar.htm" title="Qatar">Qatar</a>.<p>The youngest member of the <!--del_lnk--> Ivy League, Cornell was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1865 by <!--del_lnk--> Ezra Cornell and <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Dickson_White.htm" title="Andrew Dickson White">Andrew Dickson White</a> as a <!--del_lnk--> coeducational, non-<!--del_lnk--> sectarian institution where admission was offered irrespective of religion or race. Inaugurated shortly after the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, its founders intended that the new university would teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge &mdash; from the <!--del_lnk--> classics to the <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">sciences</a> and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell&#39;s motto, an 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: &quot;I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.&quot;<p>The university is organized into seven <!--del_lnk--> undergraduate colleges and seven <!--del_lnk--> graduate divisions, each defining its own academic programs in near autonomy. Since the mid-20th century, the university has been expanding both its campus resources and influence worldwide. From a new <!--del_lnk--> residential college housing system to its 2001 founding of a medical college in <a href="../../wp/q/Qatar.htm" title="Qatar">Qatar</a>, Cornell claims &quot;to serve society by educating the leaders of tomorrow and extending the frontiers of knowledge.&quot; Cornell counts more than 240,000 living alumni and 40 <!--del_lnk--> Nobel laureates affiliated with the university as faculty or students. Research is a central element of the university&#39;s mission; Cornell spent <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>561.3 million on research and development in a diverse group of fields during the July 2004 to June 2005 fiscal year.<p>

      <p>Cornell University was created on <!--del_lnk--> April 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1865 by a <!--del_lnk--> New York State Senate bill that named the university as the state&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> land grant institution. Senator Ezra Cornell offered his farm in <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, New York as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial <!--del_lnk--> endowment. Fellow senator and experienced educator <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Dickson_White.htm" title="Andrew Dickson White">Andrew Dickson White</a> agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the initial two buildings and traveled about the country, attracting students and <!--del_lnk--> faculty.<p>The university was inaugurated on <!--del_lnk--> October 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1868, and 412 men were enrolled the next day. Two years later, Cornell admitted its first women students, making it the first <!--del_lnk--> coeducational school among what came to be known as the <!--del_lnk--> Ivy League. Scientists <!--del_lnk--> Louis Agassiz and <!--del_lnk--> James Crafts were among the faculty members.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, more than eighty members of Cornell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Afro-American Society took over the <!--del_lnk--> student union building, <!--del_lnk--> Willard Straight Hall. The takeover was precipitated by increasing racial tension at the university in the 1960s; earlier incidents included a reprimand of three black students for a December 1968 incident and a <!--del_lnk--> cross burning in front of the black women&#39;s cooperative. The crisis ended on <!--del_lnk--> April 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, with Cornell ceding to the society&#39;s demands, including the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> black studies program. The students emerged making a <!--del_lnk--> black power salute with guns in hand. (The guns had been brought into the hall after the initial takeover, following an attempt by members of an all-white fraternity to reclaim the hall.) <!--del_lnk--> James A. Perkins, president of Cornell during the events, would resign soon after.<p>Cornell expanded significantly in the 20th century, with its student population growing to its current count of about 20,000 students. The faculty expanded as well; by the century&#39;s end, the university had more than 3,400 faculty members. Along with its population growth, Cornell increased its breadth of course offerings. Today, the university has wide-ranging programs and offers more than 4,000 courses.<p>In the 2000s, Cornell has been expanding its <a href="#International_programs" title="">international programs</a>. In 2001, the university founded the <!--del_lnk--> Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, the first American <!--del_lnk--> medical school outside of the United States. It continues to forge partnerships with major institutions in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>.

      <p>Cornell is a private institution, receiving most of its funding through <!--del_lnk--> tuition, research <!--del_lnk--> grants, and <!--del_lnk--> alumni contributions. Three of its undergraduate colleges and the graduate-level <!--del_lnk--> College of Veterinary Medicine are called <!--del_lnk--> contract colleges. These divisions receive partial funding from the state of New York to support their research and service mission in niche fields. Residents of New York enrolled in the contract colleges pay reduced tuition. Furthermore, the <!--del_lnk--> governor of the state serves as an ex-officio member of the board of <!--del_lnk--> trustees. Despite some similarities, Cornell&#39;s contract colleges are not <!--del_lnk--> public or state schools &ndash; they are <!--del_lnk--> private institutions that Cornell operates by contract with the <!--del_lnk--> state government.<p>Cornell is <!--del_lnk--> decentralized, with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own <!--del_lnk--> admissions and advising programs, and confers its own <!--del_lnk--> degrees. The only university-wide requirements for a <!--del_lnk--> baccalaureate degree are to pass a <!--del_lnk--> swimming test, take two <!--del_lnk--> physical education courses, and satisfy a writing requirement. Although students are affiliated with their individual college or school, they may take courses in any of the colleges, provided they have fulfilled the course prerequisites. A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.<p>Seven schools provide undergraduate programs and an additional seven provide graduate and professional programs. Students pursuing graduate degrees in departments of these schools are enrolled in the <!--del_lnk--> Graduate School. The School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions offers programs for college and high school students, professionals, and other adults.<table style="border:1px solid #dddddd; background-color:#fefefe; padding:3px; margin:0px">

      <p>Cornell&#39;s main campus is on East Hill in <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, New York, overlooking the town and <!--del_lnk--> Cayuga Lake. When the university was founded in 1865, the campus consisted of 209.5&nbsp;acres (0.85&nbsp;km&sup2;) of Ezra Cornell&#39;s roughly 300-acre (1.2&nbsp;km&sup2;) farm. Since then, it has swelled to about 745&nbsp;acres (3.0&nbsp;km&sup2;), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.<p>Some 260 university buildings are divided primarily between Central and <!--del_lnk--> North Campuses on the <!--del_lnk--> plateau of the Hill, <!--del_lnk--> West Campus on its slope, and Collegetown immediately south of Central Campus. Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the university&#39;s academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. The only residential facility on Central Campus is the <!--del_lnk--> Law School&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> residential college, Hughes Hall. North Campus contains <!--del_lnk--> freshman and <!--del_lnk--> graduate student housing, themed program houses, and 29 <!--del_lnk--> fraternity and sorority houses. West Campus has upperclass residential colleges and an additional 25 fraternity and sorority houses. Collegetown contains the Schwartz <!--del_lnk--> Performing Arts Centre and two upperclass <!--del_lnk--> dormitories, amid a neighbourhood of apartments, restaurants, and businesses.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic <!--del_lnk--> architectural styles, including ornate <!--del_lnk--> Gothic, <!--del_lnk--> Victorian, <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> buildings, and less decorative <!--del_lnk--> international and <!--del_lnk--> modernist structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Because the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, grandiosity was neglected in favour of less expensive and more rapidly constructed styles. While some buildings are neatly arranged into <!--del_lnk--> quadrangles, others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university&#39;s numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of <!--del_lnk--> Central Park, outlined a &quot;grand terrace&quot; overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Cayuga Lake. Because the terrace plan was dropped, McGraw Hall appears to face the wrong direction, facing the Slope rather than the Arts Quad.<p>The Ithaca Campus is among the rolling valleys of the <!--del_lnk--> Finger Lakes region and, atop the Hill, commands a panoramic view of the surrounding area. Two <!--del_lnk--> gorges bound Central Campus, which become popular swimming holes during the warmer months. Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,900-acre (11.7&nbsp;km&sup2;) <!--del_lnk--> Cornell Plantations, a <!--del_lnk--> botanical garden containing flowers, trees, and ponds along manicured trails.<p><a id="New_York_City_campus" name="New_York_City_campus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">New York City campus</span></h3>

      <p>Weill Medical Centre, often called Weill Cornell, is on the <!--del_lnk--> Upper East Side of <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan, <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>. It is home to two Cornell divisions, <!--del_lnk--> Weill Medical College and <!--del_lnk--> Weill Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and has been affiliated with the <!--del_lnk--> New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 1927. Although their faculty and academic divisions are separate, the Medical Centre shares its administrative functions with the <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University Medical Centre. Weill Medical College is also affiliated with the neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre, <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller University, and the <!--del_lnk--> Hospital for Special Surgery.

      <p>In an attempt to create a sense of community and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White&#39;s vision, the university has undertaken the $250 million residential college project on West Campus. The Class Halls will be demolished and rebuilt as five <!--del_lnk--> residential colleges named after notable deceased Cornell professors. The first, <!--del_lnk--> Alice Cook House, was opened to students in 2004, followed by <!--del_lnk--> Carl Becker House in 2005. The next house will be <!--del_lnk--> Hans Bethe House and is expected to open in January 2007. The idea of building a house system can be attributed in part to the success of <!--del_lnk--> Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell. Like Risley, the new houses will have their own dining halls, student governments, in-house lectures, house trips, and <a href="../../wp/h/Heraldry.htm" title="Heraldry">crests</a>. The completion of the five-house residential college campus will occur in August 2009.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Off campus, many homes in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Several high-rise apartment complexes have been constructed in the Collegetown neighbourhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although freshmen are not permitted to live in them. <!--del_lnk--> Housing cooperatives or other independent living units exist, including Watermargin, <!--del_lnk--> Telluride House, the Centre for Jewish Living, and the Wait Cooperative.<p>In its 2006 rankings of college campus food, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Princeton Review</i> ranked Cornell&#39;s dining services fourth overall. The university has 31 on-campus dining locations, and a program called the Cross Country Gourmet Guest Restaurant Series periodically brings chefs, menus, and atmosphere from restaurants to Cornell&#39;s eight all-you-care-to-eat dining halls.<p><a id="Athletics" name="Athletics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Athletics</span></h3>

      <p>Cornell has 36 varsity sports teams that are known as the Big Red. An <!--del_lnk--> NCAA <!--del_lnk--> Division I-AA institution, Cornell is a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Ivy League and <!--del_lnk--> ECAC Hockey League and competes in the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the largest athletic conference in North America. (Note that the ECAC Hockey League is no longer affiliated with the ECAC.) The men&#39;s ice hockey team is the most historically successful of the varsity teams and is the university&#39;s most intently followed sport. Generally, although Cornell&#39;s varsity athletic teams typically earn their &quot;share&quot; of Ivy League titles, they do not perform well in the ECAC conference or the NCAA overall, and fail to compete consistently for national championships in most sports. Because of the Ivy League athletic agreement, the university is not permitted to offer academic scholarships for athletic recruiting.<p>Cornell University&#39;s <a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a> team has won the Ivy League championship three times, last in 1990. The <!--del_lnk--> Sprint Football team won the league championship in 2006. The men&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> team has been NCAA champion twice, ECAC champion 11 times and Ivy League champion 19 times, and recorded the only undefeated season in NCAA Division I Hockey history in 1970. The men&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> lacrosse team has been NCAA champion three times and Ivy League champion 21 times. The women&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> polo team has won the National Women&#39;s Polo Championship 11 times and the women&#39;s hockey team has been Ivy League champion 8 times. In total, Cornell&#39;s varsity athletic teams have been champions of the NCAA, ECAC, or Ivy League 114 times.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Cornell maintains athletic <!--del_lnk--> rivalries with other collegiate institutions. The men&#39;s ice hockey team has a historic rivalry with <!--del_lnk--> Boston University, but since BU left what became the <!--del_lnk--> ECAC Hockey League to join <!--del_lnk--> Hockey East, <!--del_lnk--> rivalry with Harvard University has become predominant. Following tradition, when Harvard plays the men&#39;s ice hockey team at Cornell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lynah Rink, some Big Red fans throw fish on the ice.<p>Cornell and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Pennsylvania are long-time rivals in football. With more than 114 games played since their first meeting in 1893, this is the seventh most-played rivalry in college football. Cornell&#39;s football series against both the University of Pennsylvania and <!--del_lnk--> Dartmouth College are tied for second longest uninterrupted college football match-ups in history, both dating back to 1919. In <!--del_lnk--> polo, the men&#39;s and women&#39;s teams maintain rivalries with the <!--del_lnk--> University of Virginia and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Connecticut.<p>In addition to the school&#39;s varsity athletics, club sports teams have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Dean of Students. Cornell&#39;s intramural program includes 30 sports. Beside such familiar sports such as <!--del_lnk--> flag football, <a href="../../wp/s/Squash_%2528sport%2529.htm" title="Squash (sport)">squash</a>, or <!--del_lnk--> horseshoes, such unusual offerings as &quot;inner tube <!--del_lnk--> water polo&quot; and formerly &quot;broomstick polo&quot; have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition. Cornell students also often participate in the <!--del_lnk--> International Rutabaga Curling Championship, held annually at the Ithaca Farmers&#39; Market.<p><a id="Cornelliana" name="Cornelliana"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cornelliana</span></h3>

      <p>Cornelliana is a term for Cornell&#39;s traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include <!--del_lnk--> Slope Day, a celebration held on the last day of classes, and <!--del_lnk--> Dragon Day, which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school&#39;s oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901. According to legend, if a virgin crosses the <!--del_lnk--> Arts Quad at midnight, the statues of <!--del_lnk--> Ezra Cornell and <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Dickson_White.htm" title="Andrew Dickson White">Andrew Dickson White</a> will walk off their pedestals, meet in the centre of the Quad, and shake hands. The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least three different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower &mdash; once a 60-pound (27&nbsp;kg) pumpkin, once a banner reading &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.<p>The school colors are <!--del_lnk--> carnelian (a shade of red) and white, a play on &quot;Cornellian&quot; and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot &quot;Touchdown&quot; in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games. The university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> alma mater is &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Far Above Cayuga&#39;s Waters&quot; and its <!--del_lnk--> fight song is &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Give My Regards to Davy&quot;. People associated with the university are called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cornellians&quot;. &quot;Cornellian&quot; is also used as an adjective and as the name of the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> yearbook.<p><a id="Research" name="Research"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Research</span></h2>
      <p>For the 2004&ndash;05 fiscal year, the university spent $561.3 million on research. The primary recipients of this funding were the colleges of Medicine ($164.2 million), Agriculture and Life Sciences ($114.5 million), Arts and Sciences ($80.3 million), and Engineering ($64.8 million). The money comes largely from federal sources, with federal investment of $381.0 million. The federal agencies that invest the most money are the <!--del_lnk--> Department of Health and Human Services and the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation that make up, respectively, 51.4% and 30.7% of all federal investment in the university. Cornell was on the top-ten list of U.S. universities receiving the most <!--del_lnk--> patents in 2003, and is one of the nation&#39;s top five institutions in forming <!--del_lnk--> start-up companies. In 2004&ndash;05, Cornell received 200 invention disclosures, filed 203 U.S. patent applications, completed 77 commercial license agreements, and distributed <!--del_lnk--> royalties of more than $4.1 million to Cornell units and inventors.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Since 1962, Cornell has been involved in unmanned missions to <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a>. In the 21st century, Cornell had a hand in the <a href="../../wp/m/Mars_Exploration_Rover.htm" title="Mars Exploration Rover">Mars Exploration Rover Mission</a>. Cornell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Steve Squyres, Principal Investigator for the Athena Science Payload, led the selection of the landing zones and requested data collection features for the <!--del_lnk--> Spirit and <!--del_lnk--> Opportunity rovers. <!--del_lnk--> Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers took those requests and designed the rovers to meet them. The rovers, both of which have operated long past their original life expectancies, are responsible for the discoveries that were awarded 2004 Breakthrough of the Year honours by <i><!--del_lnk--> Science</i>. Control of the Mars rovers has shifted between NASA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jet Propulsion Laboratory at <!--del_lnk--> Caltech and Cornell&#39;s Space Sciences Building.<p>The Automotive Crash Injury Research project was begun in 1952 by John O. Moore at the <!--del_lnk--> Cornell Aeronautical Research Laboratories, which spun off in 1972 as Calspan Corporation. It pioneered the use of <!--del_lnk--> crash testing, originally using corpses rather than <a href="../../wp/c/Crash_test_dummy.htm" title="Crash test dummy">dummies</a>. The project discovered that improved door locks, energy-absorbing steering wheels, padded dashboards, and seat belts could prevent an extraordinary percentage of injuries. The project led <!--del_lnk--> Liberty Mutual to fund the building of a demonstration Cornell Safety Car in 1956, which received national publicity and influenced carmakers. Carmakers soon started their own crash-test laboratories and gradually adopted many of the Cornell innovations. Other ideas, such as rear-facing passenger seats, never found favour with carmakers or the public.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1984, the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation began work on establishing five new <!--del_lnk--> supercomputer centers, including the <a href="../../wp/c/Cornell_University.htm" title="Cornell Theory Center">Cornell Theory Centre</a>, to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the <!--del_lnk--> National Centre for Supercomputing Applications began the development of <!--del_lnk--> NSFNet, a <!--del_lnk--> TCP/IP-based computer network that could connect to the <!--del_lnk--> ARPANET, at the Cornell Theory Centre and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-<!--del_lnk--> kbit/s network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5-<!--del_lnk--> Mbit/s <!--del_lnk--> T1s in 1988 and to 45 Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>.<p>Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as <!--del_lnk--> Hans Bethe, contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project. In the 1930s, Cornell built the second <!--del_lnk--> cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study <!--del_lnk--> synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the <!--del_lnk--> Cornell Electron Storage Ring, located beneath Alumni Field, was the world&#39;s highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.<p>Cornell&#39;s accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved in the design of the proposed <!--del_lnk--> International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the <!--del_lnk--> Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of <!--del_lnk--> dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.<p><a id="Alumni" name="Alumni"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Alumni</span></h2>

      <p>Graduates of Cornell are known as &quot;Cornellians&quot;. As of August 2005, the university counted 244,276 living Cornellians. Many are active through organizations and events including the annual Reunion Weekend and <!--del_lnk--> Homecoming, weekend festivities in Ithaca, and the International Spirit of Zinck&#39;s Night. For the 2004-05 fiscal year, Cornell ranked third for gifts and bequests from alumni, and fourth for total support from all sources (alumni, friends, corporations, and foundations) among U.S. colleges and universities reporting voluntary gift support. In October 2006, Cornell made public a 10 year capital campaign &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Far Above...&quot; to solicit alumni and raise $4 billion to improve the undergraduate experience, attract and retain faculty, and expand the physical plant. .<p>Cornellians are noted for their accomplishments in public, professional, and corporate life.
