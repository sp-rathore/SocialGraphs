      <p><b>Cat Stevens</b> (born <b>Steven Demetre Georgiou</b> on <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1948), now known as <b>Yusuf Islam</b> or simply <b>Yusuf</b>, is a well-known <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> musician, <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriter and a prominent convert to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>.<p>At the outset of his musical career, Georgiou adopted the stage name Cat Stevens; under this moniker, he sold over 60 million albums, mostly in the 1970s. His most notable songs include &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Morning Has Broken&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Peace Train&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Moonshadow&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wild World&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Father and Son&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> If You Want To Sing Out, Sing Out&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Trouble&quot;.<p>Stevens became a <!--del_lnk--> convert to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1977, after a <!--del_lnk--> near-death experience. He adopted the name Yusuf Islam in <!--del_lnk--> 1979, and became a pious advocate for the religion, devoting himself to educational and philanthropic causes in his community. A decade later, controversy arose when he was reported to have made comments that seemed to support a <!--del_lnk--> fatwa calling for the death of author <!--del_lnk--> Salman Rushdie, but he claimed to have been misinterpreted. He publicly and vehemently condemned the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="9/11">September 11</a> attacks, saying they were not consonant with the teachings of the religion of Islam, and mourned the loss of life. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, he returned to the public eye when he was denied entry into the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> after his name appeared on a <!--del_lnk--> no-fly list. He successfully sued British newspapers for libel because of their reports on this incident.<p>Yusuf Islam currently lives with his wife and children in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, where he is an active member of the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim community, and spends part of each year in <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>. He founded, and is chairman of, the <!--del_lnk--> Small Kindness charity, which initially assisted <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a> victims in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and now supports thousands of <!--del_lnk--> orphans and families in the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans, <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Islam also founded the charity <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Aid, in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 he was given the <!--del_lnk--> Man for Peace award for promoting international social justice and peace.<p>Yusuf Islam released a new record album in <!--del_lnk--> November, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> An Other Cup,</i> his first pop album of new songs in 28 years.<p>

      <p>Steven Georgiou was the third child of a <!--del_lnk--> Greek-Cypriot father (Stavros Georgiou) and a <!--del_lnk--> Swedish mother (Ingrid Wickman). The family lived above Moulin Rouge, the restaurant that his parents operated on <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury Avenue, a few steps from <a href="../../wp/p/Piccadilly_Circus.htm" title="Piccadilly Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Soho section of London. All of the family, including Steven, worked in the restaurant.<p>Although his father was <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodox, Georgiou was sent to a <!--del_lnk--> Catholic school, <!--del_lnk--> St. Joseph Roman Catholic Primary School in Macklin Street.<p>When Georgiou was about eight years old, his parents divorced, although they both continued to live above the restaurant. Later, his mother moved back to <!--del_lnk--> G&auml;vle, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and took him with her. It was there that he started developing his drawing skills, influenced by his uncle Hugo, a painter.<p>At age 16, he left <!--del_lnk--> high school and was accepted, then later dismissed from, <!--del_lnk--> Hammersmith Art School. It was during this period he was first influenced by <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a>.<p><a id="Musical_Career_.281966_-_1977.29" name="Musical_Career_.281966_-_1977.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Musical Career (1966 - 1977)</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_musical_career" name="Early_musical_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early musical career</span></h3>
      <p>At age 18 in 1966, eager to establish a music career, Georgiou sought the help of manager/producer <!--del_lnk--> Mike Hurst. Hurst enjoyed Georgiou&#39;s songs and had a friend financially support his first single, &quot;I Love My Dog&quot;. Over the next two years, Georgiou toured with moderate success and placed several single releases in the <!--del_lnk--> British pop music charts under the name &quot;Cat Stevens&quot;. His debut album was <i><!--del_lnk--> Matthew and Son</i> which was released in 1966. At the end of 1967, Stevens released <i><!--del_lnk--> New Masters</i> which failed to chart in the United Kingdom; the album is now most notable for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot; which has become an international hit for <!--del_lnk--> P.P. Arnold, <!--del_lnk--> Rod Stewart and <!--del_lnk--> Sheryl Crow.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, he joined with other recording artists on the airwaves of <!--del_lnk--> Wonderful Radio London bemoaning the loss of the <!--del_lnk--> pirate radio station which had helped create his first hit record.<p>In early 1968, at the age of nineteen, Stevens contracted <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. After several months in the hospital and a year of convalescence, Stevens returned to recording, but his attempts at a comeback single were poorly received.<p><a id="Comeback_after_tuberculosis" name="Comeback_after_tuberculosis"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Comeback after tuberculosis</span></h3>
      <p>In 1970, Stevens signed with <!--del_lnk--> Island Records (then-rival <!--del_lnk--> A&amp;M Records in North America), and released <i><!--del_lnk--> Mona Bone Jakon</i>, an introspective, <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a>-based album that was markedly different from his earlier work. The album featured the songs &quot;Lady D&#39;Arbanville&quot; that was written for Stevens&#39; girlfriend at the time, actress <!--del_lnk--> Patti D&#39;Arbanville; &quot;Pop Star&quot; that commented on his mixed success as a &#39;60s teen hitmaker; and &quot;Katmandu&quot;, featuring <!--del_lnk--> Genesis frontman <!--del_lnk--> Peter Gabriel playing flute.<p>The album presaged the coming <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriter boom and set the stage for Stevens&#39; international breakthrough album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tea for the Tillerman</i>. <i>Tillerman</i> combined a brighter sound and subject matter with Stevens&#39; new folk style, and became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, highlighted by the top-10 single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wild World&quot;.<p>Having established a signature sound, Stevens enjoyed a string of successes over the following years. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Teaser and the Firecat</i> LP album (1971) reached #2 in the US and yielded several hits, including &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Peace Train&quot;, &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; (featuring <!--del_lnk--> Yes&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Rick Wakeman on piano), and &quot;Moonshadow&quot;. Also in 1971, several of his songs were used in the soundtrack to the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Harold and Maude</i>, including at least one that had not been on any album prior to its inclusion on a second &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection many years later.<p>Subsequent releases in the 1970s were consistently successful; the final album under the name Cat Stevens was <i>Back to Earth</i>, released in late 1978. His farewell concert as Cat Stevens took place in <!--del_lnk--> Wembley Stadium, on November 22, 1979.<p><a id="Conversion_to_Islam" name="Conversion_to_Islam"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Conversion to Islam</span></h3>
      <p>When Stevens nearly drowned in an accident in <!--del_lnk--> Malibu in 1975, he reports having pleaded with <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a> to save him. Stevens described the event in a <!--del_lnk--> VH1 interview some years later: &quot;I suddenly held myself and I said, &#39;Oh God! If you save me, I&#39;ll work for you.&#39;&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> near-death experience intensified his long-held quest for spiritual truth; when his brother David gave him a copy of the <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a>, Stevens began to find peace with himself and began his transition to Islam. He formally converted to the Islamic faith in 1977 and he legally changed his name to <b>Yusuf Islam</b><p><a id="Life_as_Yusuf_Islam_.281978_-_present.29" name="Life_as_Yusuf_Islam_.281978_-_present.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Life as Yusuf Islam (1978 - present)</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Muslim_Faith_and_Musical_Career" name="Muslim_Faith_and_Musical_Career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Muslim Faith and Musical Career</span></h3>
      <p>Following his conversion, Yusuf Islam abandoned his career as a <!--del_lnk--> pop star. Song and the use of musical instruments is an area of debate (considered prohibited <i><!--del_lnk--> Haram</i> by some) in <!--del_lnk--> Muslim jurisprudence and is the primary reason he gave for retreating from the pop spotlight. At one point he wrote to the record companies asking that his music no longer be distributed, but his request was denied.<p>In 1981 Islam founded the <!--del_lnk--> Islamia Primary School in Salusbury Road in the <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">north London</a> area of <!--del_lnk--> Kilburn; after that he founded several secondary schools, and devoted his energy to providing an Islamic education to children and to charitable causes.<p>In 1985, Islam decided to return to the public spotlight for the first time since his religious conversion at the historic <!--del_lnk--> Live Aid concert, inspired by the <a href="../../wp/f/Famine.htm" title="Famine">famine</a> threatening <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. Though he had written a song especially for the occasion, his appearance was skipped when <!--del_lnk--> Elton John&#39;s set ran too long. <p><a id="Salman_Rushdie_controversy" name="Salman_Rushdie_controversy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Salman Rushdie controversy</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1989 Yusuf Islam addressed students at <!--del_lnk--> Kingston University in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> about his journey to Islam. He was asked about the controversy in the Muslim world and the <!--del_lnk--> fatwa calling for <!--del_lnk--> Salman Rushdie&#39;s execution. Islam claims to have only stated the legal consequences from the <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a> - that blasphemy is a capital offense - and not actually have made any claims of support for the fatwa. Newspapers quickly denounced Yusuf Islam&#39;s &quot;support&quot; for a possible assassination of Rushdie. The next day he released a statement saying that he was not personally encouraging anybody towards <!--del_lnk--> vigilantism.<p>However, the <!--del_lnk--> New York Times reported on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1989 that Yusuf Islam was to be on a British television courtroom-style program, &quot;A Satanic Scenario,&quot; the following week, and was quoted as saying:<blockquote>
       <p>[that rather than go to a demonstration to burn an effigy of the author Salman Rushdie,] I would have hoped that it&#39;d be the real thing.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>[If Rushdie turned up at my doorstep looking for help,] I might ring somebody who might do more damage to him than he would like. I&#39;d try to phone the <!--del_lnk--> Ayatollah Khomeini and tell him exactly where this man is.</blockquote>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 8 1989, while speaking in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Regents Park Mosque, when asked by a <!--del_lnk--> Christian Science Monitor reporter how he would &quot;<i>cope with the idea of killing a writer for writing a book</i>&quot; he is reported to have replied:<blockquote>
       <p>In Islam there is a line between let&#39;s say freedom and the line which is then transgressed into immorality and irresponsibility and I think as far as this writer is concerned, unfortunately, he has been irresponsible with his freedom of speech. Salman Rushdie or indeed any writer who abuses the prophet, or indeed any prophet, under Islamic law, the sentence for that is actually death. It&#39;s got to be seen as a deterrent, so that other people should not commit the same mistake again.</blockquote>
      <p>He added that if Rushdie should manage to escape the death sentence he would still have to &quot;<i>face God on the day of judgement.</i>&quot;<p>Cat Stevens has never retracted his statements about Rushdie, but, in a 2000 <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, he was asked to explain his position on the fatwa controversy and said:<blockquote>
       <p>I&#39;m very sad that this seems to be the No. 1 question people want to discuss. I had nothing to do with the issue other than what the media created. I was innocently drawn into the whole controversy. So, after many years, I&#39;m glad at least now that I have been given the opportunity to explain to the public and fans my side of the story in my own words. At a lecture, back in 1989, I was asked a question about blasphemy according to Islamic Law, I simply repeated the legal view according to my limited knowledge of the Scriptural texts, based directly on historical commentaries of the Qur&#39;an. The next day the newspaper headlines read, &quot;Cat Says, Kill Rushdie.&quot; I was abhorred, but what could I do? I was a new Muslim. If you ask a Bible student to quote the legal punishment of a person who commits blasphemy in the Bible, he would be dishonest if he didn&#39;t mention Leviticus 24:16.</blockquote>
      <p>The backlash over the Rushdie incident included the band <!--del_lnk--> 10,000 Maniacs, who had covered &quot;Peace Train&quot; on their 1987 <i><!--del_lnk--> In My Tribe</i> album. The band deleted the song from subsequent pressings of their album as a protest against the remarks he made.<p><a id="September_11" name="September_11"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">September 11</span></h3>
      <p>Yusuf Islam immediately and vehemently spoke out against the September 11, 2001 attacks against the United States, saying:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;I wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action: The Qur&#39;an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.&quot;</dl>
      <p>He appeared on videotape on a VH-1 pre-show for the October 2001 <!--del_lnk--> Concert for New York City condemning the attacks and singing an a cappella version of his song <!--del_lnk--> Peace Train for the first time in public in more than twenty years. He also donated half of his box-set royalties to the September 11 Fund for victims&#39; families, and the other half to orphans in underdeveloped countries.<p><a id="Denial_of_entry_into_the_United_States" name="Denial_of_entry_into_the_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Denial of entry into the United States</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 21 September <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Yusuf Islam was traveling on <!--del_lnk--> United Airlines Flight 919 from <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> to <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>, en route to a meeting with singer <!--del_lnk--> Dolly Parton who had recorded a cover of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Peace Train&quot; several years earlier and was planning to include another Cat Stevens song on an upcoming album. While the plane was in flight, the <!--del_lnk--> Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System flagged his name as being on a <!--del_lnk--> no-fly list. Customs agents alerted the <!--del_lnk--> Transportation Security Administration, which then diverted his flight to <!--del_lnk--> Bangor, <!--del_lnk--> Maine, where he was detained by the <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="FBI">FBI</a>.<p>The following day Islam was deported back to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> United States Transportation Security Administration claimed there were &quot;concerns of ties he may have to potential terrorist-related activities.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> United States Department of Homeland Security specifically alleged that Islam had provided funding to the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian Islamic militant group <!--del_lnk--> Hamas, although it did not offer any proof of its allegation, nor has any turned up.<p>Islam&#39;s deportation provoked a small international controversy and led British <!--del_lnk--> Foreign Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Jack Straw to complain personally to <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State <!--del_lnk--> Colin Powell at the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Powell responded by stating that the <!--del_lnk--> watch list was under review, and added, &quot;I think we have that obligation to review these matters to see if we are right.&quot;<p>Yusuf Islam believes his inclusion on the <!--del_lnk--> watch list may have simply been an error, a mistaken identification of him for a man with the same name, different spelling. On <!--del_lnk--> 1 October <!--del_lnk--> 2004 Islam was reported to have requested the removal of his name and stated, &quot;I remain bewildered by the decision of the US authorities to refuse me entry to the United States.&quot; According to a statement by Islam, the man on the list was named &quot;Youssef Islam&quot;, indicating that Yusuf Islam himself was not the suspected terror supporter.<p><a id="Libel_case_victory" name="Libel_case_victory"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Libel case victory</span></h4>
      <p>As a footnote to the actions taken by the U.S. government in deporting Yusuf Islam as a suspected terrorist, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sun</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sunday Times</i> British newspapers had published reports in October 2004 which stated that the U.S. was correct in its action. As a result Yusuf Islam sued for libel, and received a substantial out-of-court, &quot;agreed settlement&quot; and apology from the newspapers. Both newspapers acknowledged that Yusuf Islam has never supported terrorism and that, to the contrary, he had recently been given a <!--del_lnk--> Man for Peace award from the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> Committee. Islam responded that he was:<blockquote>
       <p>...delighted by the settlement [which] helps vindicate my character and good name. ... It seems to be the easiest thing in the world these days to make scurrilous accusations against Muslims, and in my case it directly impacts on my relief work and damages my reputation as an artist. The harm done is often difficult to repair.</blockquote>
      <p>He added that he intended to donate the financial award given to him by the court to help orphans of the recent <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">tsunami</a> in the Indian Ocean. Yusuf Islam wrote about the experience in a newspaper article titled &quot;A Cat in a Wild World&quot;.<p><a id="Return_to_music" name="Return_to_music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Return to music</span></h3>
      <p>For several years during the 1990s, Yusuf Islam made recordings featuring lyrics about Islamic themes accompanied only by basic percussion instruments, which he felt were acceptable to his faith. He also produced an album called <i><!--del_lnk--> A is for Allah</i> as an instruction for children after realizing there were few materials designed to educate children about the Islamic religion. He later established the record label called <!--del_lnk--> Mountain of Light Productions that donates a percentage of its proceeds to Islam&#39;s Small Kindness charity.<p>In 2003, after repeated encouragement from within the Muslim world, Yusuf Islam once again recorded the song &quot;Peace Train&quot; for a compilation CD which also included performances by <!--del_lnk--> David Bowie and <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>.<p>He performed &quot;&quot;Wild World&quot;&quot; in <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> 46664 Concert with his former session player <!--del_lnk--> Peter Gabriel, for which he both performed and recorded in the English language for the first time in twenty-five years. Islam explained that the reason why he had stopped performing in English was due to his own misunderstanding of the Islamic faith:<blockquote>
       <p>This issue of music in Islam is not as cut-and-dried as I was led to believe ... I relied on heresy [sic], that was perhaps my mistake.</blockquote>
      <p>In a separate press release, Islam explains his revived recording career:<blockquote>
       <p>After I embraced Islam many people told me to carry on composing and recording but at the time I was hesitant for fear that it might be for the wrong reasons. I felt unsure what the right course of action was. I guess it is only now after all these years that I&#39;ve come to fully understand and appreciate what everyone has been asking of me. It&#39;s as if I&#39;ve come full circle - however, I have gathered a lot of knowledge on the subject in the meantime.</blockquote>
      <p>In December 2004, he and <!--del_lnk--> Ronan Keating released a new version of &quot;Father and Son&quot;. It debuted at number two, behind <!--del_lnk--> Band Aid 20&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Do They Know It&#39;s Christmas?&quot;. The proceeds of &quot;Father and Son&quot; were donated to the <!--del_lnk--> Band Aid charity. Keating&#39;s former group, <!--del_lnk--> Boyzone, had also had a hit with a cover version of the song a decade earlier.<p>In early 2005, Islam released a new song entitled &quot;Indian Ocean&quot; about the 2004 tsunami disaster. The song featured <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> composer/producer <!--del_lnk--> A. R.
