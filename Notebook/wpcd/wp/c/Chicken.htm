      <p>Male chickens are known as <!--del_lnk--> roosters (in the U.S., Canada and Australia), cocks, or cockerels if they are young. Castrated roosters are called <!--del_lnk--> capons. Female chickens are known as hens, or &#39;chooks&#39; in Australian English. Young females are known as <!--del_lnk--> pullets. Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage, marked by long flowing tails and bright pointed feathers on their necks.<p>However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright, the cock only has slightly pointed neck feathers, and the identification must be made by looking at the comb. Chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, and a fleshy piece of hanging skin under their beak called a wattle. These organs help to cool the bird by redirecting blood flow to the skin. Both the male and female have distinctive wattles and combs. In males, the combs are often more prominent, though this is not the case in all varieties.<p>Domestic chickens are typically fed commercially prepared feed that includes a <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> source as well as <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">grains</a>. Chickens often scratch at the soil to get at adult insects and larvae or seed. Incidents of <!--del_lnk--> cannibalism can occur when a curious bird pecks at a preexisting wound or during fighting (even among female birds). This is exacerbated in close quarters. In commercial egg and meat production this is controlled by trimming the beak (removal of &#x2154; of the top half and occasionally &#x2153; of the lower half of the beak).<p>Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although they are generally capable of flying for short distances such as over fences. Chickens will sometimes fly to explore their surroundings, but usually only to flee perceived danger. Because of flight risk, chickens raised in open-air pens generally have one of their wings clipped by the breeder &mdash; the tips of the longest feathers on one of the wings are cut, resulting in unbalanced flight which the bird cannot sustain for more than a few meters (<!--del_lnk--> more on wing clipping).<p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together as a <!--del_lnk--> flock. They have a communal approach to the <!--del_lnk--> incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> pecking order&quot;, with dominant individuals having priority for access to food and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established.<p>Chickens will try to lay in nests that already contain eggs, and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. Some farmers use fake eggs made from plastic or stone to encourage hens to lay in a particular location. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.<p>Hens can also be extremely stubborn about always laying in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.<p>Contrary to popular belief, roosters do not crow only at dawn, but may crow at any time of the day or night. Their crowing - a loud and sometimes shrill call - is a territorial signal to other roosters. However, crowing may also result from sudden disturbances within their surroundings.<p>Chickens are domesticated descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> Red Junglefowl, which is biologically classified as the same species.<p>Recent studies <!--del_lnk-->  have shown that chickens (and possibly other bird species) still retain the genetic blueprints to produce teeth in the jaws, although these are dormant in living animals. These are a holdover from primitive birds such as <i><a href="../../wp/a/Archaeopteryx.htm" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a></i>, which were descended from <a href="../../wp/t/Theropoda.htm" title="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>.<p><a id="Courting" name="Courting"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Courting</span></h2>
      <p>When a rooster finds food he may call the other chickens to eat it first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour can also be observed in mother hens, calling their chicks. In some cases the rooster will drag the wing opposite the hen on the ground, while circling her. This is part of chicken courting ritual. When a hen is used to coming to his &quot;call&quot; the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the fertilization.<p><a id="Going_broody" name="Going_broody"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Going broody</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Sometimes a hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of eggs, a state that is commonly known as <i>going broody</i>. A broody chicken will sit fast on the nest, and protest or peck in defense if disturbed or removed, and will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust bathe. While broody, the hen keeps the eggs at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly.<p>At the end of the incubation period, which is an average of 21 days, the eggs (if fertilized) will hatch, and the broody hen will take care of her young. Since individual eggs do not all hatch at exactly the same time (the chicken can only lay one egg approximately every 25 hours), the hen will usually stay on the nest for about two days after the first egg hatches. During this time, the newly-hatched chicks live off the egg yolk they absorb just before hatching. The hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to encourage them to break out of their shells. If the eggs are not fertilized and do not hatch, the hen will eventually grow tired of being broody and leave the nest.<p>Modern egg-laying breeds rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation cycle. Some breeds, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Cochin, <!--del_lnk--> Cornish and <!--del_lnk--> Silkie, regularly go broody and make excellent mothers.<p><a id="Artificial_incubation" name="Artificial_incubation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Artificial incubation</span></h2>
      <p>Chicken egg incubation can successfully occur artificially as well. Nearly all chicken eggs will hatch after 21 days of good conditions - 99.5&deg; <!--del_lnk--> fahrenheit (37.5&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) and around 55% <!--del_lnk--> relative humidity (increase to 70% in the last three days of incubation to help soften egg shell). Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process.<p>Home incubators are usually small boxes (<!--del_lnk--> styrofoam incubators are popular) and hold a few to 50 eggs. Eggs must be turned three to five times each day, rotating at least 90 degrees. If eggs aren&#39;t turned, the <!--del_lnk--> embryo inside will stick to the shell and likely will be hatched with physical defects. This process is natural; hens will stand up three to five times a day and shift the eggs around with their <!--del_lnk--> beak.<p><a id="Chickens_as_food" name="Chickens_as_food"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Chickens as food</span></h2>

      <p>Chickens can make loving and gentle companion animals, but can sometimes become aggressive. Some have advised against keeping certain breeds around young children, as the chickens can become territorial and violent. In <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, chickens with striking plumage have long been kept for ornamental purposes, including feather-footed varieties such as the <!--del_lnk--> Cochin and <!--del_lnk--> Silkie from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and the extremely long-tailed <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix from <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. Asian ornamental varieties were imported into the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in the late 1800s. Distinctive American varieties of chickens have been developed from these Asian breeds. Poultry fanciers began keeping these ornamental birds for exhibition, a practice that continues today.<p>While some cities in the United States still allow chickens as pets, the practice is quickly disappearing. Individuals in rural communities commonly keep chickens for both ornamental and practical value. Some communities ban only roosters, allowing the quieter hens. Many zoos use chickens instead of <!--del_lnk--> insecticides to control insect populations.<p>Keeping a few chickens as backyard pets is surprisingly easy to do. The major challenge is protecting the birds from predators such as dogs, raccoons and foxes. The birds will need a secure place to sleep at night. This can be as simple or as elaborate as you like. For a few birds allowed to roam free during the day, a large doghouse-type structure with a locking door will serve just fine. Some kind of bedding such as straw or wood shaving should be provided on the floor. Nest boxes will make egg collection easier. If the birds are left in the structure during the day, a larger, more elaborate structure would be necessary.<p>Chicken naturally return to the same spot to roost every night. On most occasions they will put themselves to bed and your only job would be to make sure the door is shut and locked before nightfall. It is best to count the birds each night as sometimes a bird will not find her way back into the coop. A bird left out at night is likely to be killed by a predator.<p>Most chickens cannot fly well and are easily contained with 3-4&#39; fencing. Birds which are allowed to roam the yard during the day are quite effective at controlling insects of all types. Areas of bare dirt will benefit from the weed control and soil cultivation provided by the birds in their never ending search for food. The birds, however, will pick at plants and grass and may cause some damage to ground-cover with their scratching. Also chickens will eat most any kind of food scraps. It can be quite satisfying to see unusable food items turned into eggs by these able recyclers.<p>The eggs themselves can be quite different from the store purchased variety. Fresh yolks are quite &quot;perky&quot; and stand tall above the white. The yolk color is frequently a deeper colour than the pale yellow of commercially raised eggs and can at time be almost a dark orange.<p>Growing chickens can be tamed by feeding them a special treat (such as <!--del_lnk--> mealworms) by hand, and by being with them for at least ten minutes daily when they are young. Even older birds can be tamed considerably by hand-feeding leftover table scraps. It can be fun to help the birds forage by turning rocks over and watching them grab worms and bugs that typically can be found in these dark, moist areas. The chickens quickly associate you with a source of food and will become your constant companion when you are both in the yard.<p>A former recurring <!--del_lnk--> skit on the weekly comedy show <i><!--del_lnk--> Saturday Night Live</i> featured a chicken <!--del_lnk--> pet store with the Chinese owner (as played by <!--del_lnk--> Dana Carvey) not wishing to sell to customers on the basis that &quot;Chickens make lousy house pets.&quot;<p><a id="Chickens_in_agriculture" name="Chickens_in_agriculture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Chickens in agriculture</span></h2>

      <p>In the United States, chickens were once raised primarily on family farms. Prior to about 1930, chicken was served primarily on special occasions or on Sunday, as the birds were typically more valued for their eggs than meat. Excess roosters or non-productive hens would be culled from the flock first for butchering. As cities developed and markets sprung up across the nation, live chickens from local farms could often be seen for sale in crates outside the market to be butchered and cleaned onsite by the <!--del_lnk--> butcher.<p>With the advent of <!--del_lnk--> vertical integration and selective breeding of efficient meat-type birds, poultry production changed dramatically. Large farms and packing plants emerged that could grow birds by the thousands. Chickens could be sent to slaughterhouses for butchering and processing into pre-packaged commercial products to be frozen or shipped fresh to markets or wholesalers. Meat-type chickens currently grow to market weight in 6-7 weeks whereas only fifty years ago it took three times as long (reference: Havenstein, G.B., P.R. Ferket, and M.A. Qureshi, 2003a. Growth, livability, and feed conversion of 1957 versus 2001 broilers when feed representative 1957 and 2001 broiler diets. Poult. Sci. 82:1500-1508). This is due exclusively to genetic selection and nutritional advances (and not to use of growth hormones, which are illegal for use in poultry in the US and many other countries). Once a meat consumed only occasionally, the common availability and lower cost has made chicken a common and significant meat product within developed nations. Growing concerns over the <!--del_lnk--> cholesterol content of red meat in the 1980s and 1990s further resulted in increased consumption of chicken.<p>Another breed of chicken, the Leghorn, was further developed to be efficient layers of eggs. Egg production and consumption changed with the development of automation and refrigeration. Large farms were devoted solely to egg production and <!--del_lnk--> packaging. Today, eggs are produced on large egg ranches on which environmental parameters are well controlled. Chickens are exposed to artificial light cycles to stimulate egg production year-round. In addition, it is a common practice to induce <!--del_lnk--> molt through careful manipulation of light and the amount of food they receive in order to further increase egg size and production.<p>On average, a chicken lays one egg a day, however this varies from breed to time of year. For example, a <!--del_lnk--> Barred Plymouth Rock may lay one egg a day during the spring, summer and fall. But the same chicken may not lay at all during the winter. However, a chicken bred specifically for egg-laying may occasionally lay two eggs a day, and if housed correctly may lay all through the winter.<p>Often, people in developing countries keep chickens for their eggs and meat.<p><a id="Issues_with_mass_production" name="Issues_with_mass_production"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Issues with mass production</span></h2>

      <p>Many animal welfare advocates object to killing chickens for food or to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> factory farm conditions&quot; under which they are raised. They contend that commercial chicken production usually involves raising the birds in large, crowded <!--del_lnk--> rearing sheds that prevent the chickens from engaging in many of their natural behaviors.<p>Chickens generally live five to ten years depending on the breed <!--del_lnk--> ; chickens raised for meat are slaughtered prior to sexual maturity (six weeks), and thus many of the aggressive behaviors seen in adult chickens (fighting, cannibalism) are seldom seen in meat-type chickens. This may also be due to the fact that both male and female chicks have the <!--del_lnk--> ends of the beaks cut off, as to reduce the injury they would otherwise do to each other in the crowded quarters they are raised in. The trimming of beaks is another controversial issue for individuals concerned with humane treatment of the animals, as it is done without anaesthesia and is a sensitive area. Some contend that the procedure causes lifelong discomfort.<p>Although many would argue that the birds are not intelligent and thus not a high priority for humane treatment on farms, a woman once brought a chicken on <i>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</i> where it played &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; on a toy <a href="../../wp/p/Piano.htm" title="Piano">piano</a> and <!--del_lnk--> bowled 3 strikes. Animal welfare groups such as <!--del_lnk--> PETA see these and other trained chickens as evidence that they are intelligent and sentient and should not be killed or eaten <!--del_lnk--> . Dr. Chris Evans of <!--del_lnk--> Macquarie University is even quoted as saying, &quot;As a trick at conferences, I sometimes list these attributes, without mentioning chickens, and people think I&rsquo;m talking about monkeys.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> <p>Another <!--del_lnk--> animal welfare issue is the use of <!--del_lnk--> selective breeding to create heavy, large-breasted birds, which can lead to crippling leg disorders and heart failure for some of the birds. In addition, many scientists have raised concerns that companies growing one variety of bird for eggs or meat are causing them to become much more susceptible to disease. For this reason, many scientists are promoting the conservation of heritage breeds to retain genetic diversity in the species.<p>In 2004, 8.9 billion chickens were slaughtered in the United States<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Human_Concerns" name="Human_Concerns"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Human Concerns</span></h3>
      <p><b>Antibiotics</b><p>Because raising chickens in close quarters fosters the spread of disease, factory farms use <!--del_lnk--> antibiotics as a matter of course; many contend that this puts humans at risk as bacterial strains develop better and better resistances.<!--del_lnk--> <p>A proposed bill would make the use of antibiotics in animal feed legal only for therapeutic (rather than preventative) use, but it has not been passed yet. <!--del_lnk-->  Though this will certainly solve one problem, it does not address the fact that bacteria continue to develop resistances; hence, there is the risk of slaughtered chickens harboring these bacteria and passing them on to the humans that consume them.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> October 2000, the <!--del_lnk--> FDA discovered that two antibiotics were no longer effective in treating diseases found in factory-farmed chickens; one antibiotic was willingly and swiftly pulled from the market, but the other, <!--del_lnk--> Baytril was not. <!--del_lnk--> Bayer, the company which produced it, contested the claim and as a result, Baytril remained in use until <!--del_lnk--> July of <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<!--del_lnk--> <p><b>Arsenic</b><p>Chickens feed can also include Roxarsone, an <!--del_lnk--> antimicrobial drug that also promotes growth. The drug has generated controversy because it contains the poisonous element <a href="../../wp/a/Arsenic.htm" title="Arsenic">arsenic</a>, which can cause <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> dementia, and <!--del_lnk--> neurological problems in humans. Though the arsenic in Roxarsone is not of the type which can cause cancer, a Consumer Reports study in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 discovered enough arsenic in samples of factory-farmed chicken to &quot;cause neurological problems in a child who ate 2 ounces of cooked liver per week or in an adult who ate 5.5 ounces per week.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> <p><b>Growth Hormones</b><p>The use of <!--del_lnk--> growth hormones in chickens (they now grow to maturity twice as quickly as they would naturally) is also a concern as the people who eat chicken consume the hormones as well. Some believe that the increasingly earlier onset of puberty is the result of the liberal use of such hormones, which are also found in other meats, as well as <!--del_lnk--> dairy.<p><b>E.Coli</b><p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Consumer Reports, &quot;1.1 million or more Americans [are]sickened each year by undercooked, tainted chicken.&quot; A <!--del_lnk--> USDA study discovered <!--del_lnk--> E.Coli in 99% of supermarket chicken, the result of chickens being raised in their own feces. Though E.Coli can usually be killed by proper cooking times, there is still some risk associated with it, and its near-ubiquity in commercially-farmed chicken is troubling to some.<p><b>Avian Flu</b><p>There is also a risk that the crowded conditions in many chicken farms will allow <!--del_lnk--> avian flu to spread quickly. A <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> press release states: &quot;Governments, local authorities and international agencies need to take a greatly increased role in combating the role of factory-farming, commerce in live poultry, and wildlife markets which provide ideal conditions for the virus to spread and mutate into a more dangerous form...&quot;<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Chicken_diseases" name="Chicken_diseases"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Chicken diseases</span></h2>

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> the chicken has great significance during the <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindu</a> <!--del_lnk--> cremation ceremony. A chicken is a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for the duration to ensure that any evil spirits present during the ceremony go into the chicken and not the family members present. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life. It is not treated in any special way or slaughtered after the ceremony.<p>In <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">ancient Greece</a>, the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valour, cocks are found as attributes of <!--del_lnk--> Ares, <a href="../../wp/h/Heracles.htm" title="Heracles">Heracles</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Athena.htm" title="Athena">Athena</a>. The alleged last words of <a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a> as he died from hemlock poisoning, as recounted by <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, were &quot;Crito, I owe a cock to <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius; will you remember to pay the debt?&quot;, signififying that death was a cure for the illness of life.<p>The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of cocks. Several of <!--del_lnk--> Aesop&#39;s Fables reference this belief. In the cult of <!--del_lnk--> Mithras, the cock was a symbol of the divine light and a guardian against evil.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> prophesied the betrayal by <!--del_lnk--> Peter: &quot;And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Luke 22:43) Thus it happened (Luke 22:61), and Peter cried bitterly. This made the cock a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.<p>Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen, when talking about <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>: &quot;How often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Matthew 23:37; also Luke 13:34).<p>In many Central European folk tales, the <!--del_lnk--> devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a cock.<p>In traditional <!--del_lnk--> Jewish practice, a chicken is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before <!--del_lnk--> Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called <!--del_lnk--> kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not actually a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the chicken reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God&#39;s hands.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Talmud speaks of learning &quot;courtesy toward one&#39;s mate&quot; from the rooster. This might refer to the fact that, when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.<p>The chicken is one of the <!--del_lnk--> Zodiac symbols of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese calendar. Also in <!--del_lnk--> Chinese religion, a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a> are not one of the recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with &quot;serious&quot; prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In <!--del_lnk--> Confucian Chinese <!--del_lnk--> Weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken&#39;s head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However this practice is rare today.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The first pictures of chickens in Europe are found on <!--del_lnk--> Corinthian <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> 7th century BC. The poet <!--del_lnk--> Cratinus (mid-<!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC, according to the later Greek author <!--del_lnk--> Athenaeus) calls the chicken &quot;the <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persian</a> alarm&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> Aristophanes&#39;s comedy <i><!--del_lnk--> The Birds</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 414 BC) a chicken is called &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Median bird&quot;, which points to an introduction from the East. Pictures of chickens are found on Greek <!--del_lnk--> red figure and <!--del_lnk--> black-figure pottery.<p>In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for <!--del_lnk--> symposia. <!--del_lnk--> Delos seems to have been a centre of chicken breeding.<p>An early domestication of chickens in <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (<i>*manuk</i>) is part of the reconstructed <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Austronesian language (see <!--del_lnk--> Austronesian languages). Chickens, together with <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dogs</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pigs</a>, were the domestic animals of the <!--del_lnk--> Lapita culture, the first <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic culture of <a href="../../wp/o/Oceania.htm" title="Oceania">Oceania</a>.<p>Chickens were spread by <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian seafarers and reached <a href="../../wp/e/Easter_Island.htm" title="Easter Island">Easter Island</a> in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian Rat (<i>Rattus exulans</i>). They were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone. Traveling as cargo on trading boats, they reached the Asian continent via the islands of Indonesia and from there spread west to Europe and western Asia.<p><a id="Chickens_in_ancient_Rome" name="Chickens_in_ancient_Rome"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Chickens in ancient Rome</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a> used chickens for oracles, both when flying (&quot;ex avibus&quot;) and when feeding (&quot;auspicium ex tripudiis&quot;). The hen (&quot;gallina&quot;) gave a favourable omen (&quot;auspicium ratum&quot;), when appearing from the left (Cic.,de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.<p>For the oracle &quot;ex tripudiis&quot; according to <!--del_lnk--> Cicero (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used, but normally only chickens (&quot;pulli&quot;) were consulted. The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises (&quot;occinerent&quot;), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 249 BC, the Roman general <!--del_lnk--> Publius Claudius Pulcher had his chickens thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Drepana, saying &quot;If they won&#39;t eat, perhaps they will drink.&quot; He promptly lost the battle against the <!--del_lnk--> Carthaginians and 93 Roman ships were sunk. Back in Rome, he was tried for impiety and heavily fined.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 161 BC a law was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet <!--del_lnk--> Apicius offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the <!--del_lnk--> recipes include the <!--del_lnk--> stomach, <!--del_lnk--> liver, <!--del_lnk--> testicles and even the <!--del_lnk--> pygostyle (the fatty &quot;tail&quot; of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).<p>The Roman author <!--del_lnk--> Columella gives advice on chicken breeding in his eighth book of his treatise on <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>. He identifies Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for <!--del_lnk--> cockfighting by the Greeks. For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks. Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.<p>Per Columella, the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings.<p>Per Columella, Chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals. Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.<p>According to Columella, chicken should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (<i>Lollium</i> sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.<p>Columella advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, because they no longer produce sufficient eggs. Capons were produced by burning out their spurs with a hot iron.
