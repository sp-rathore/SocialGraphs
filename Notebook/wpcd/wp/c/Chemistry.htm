Chemistry deals with the composition and statistical properties of such structures, as well as their transformations and interactions to become materials encountered in everyday life. Chemistry also deals with understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms with the purpose of applying that knowledge at the <!--del_lnk--> macroscopic level.

      <p>Chemistry is often called the &quot;central science&quot; because it connects other sciences, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> material science, <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology, <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pharmacy, <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bioinformatics.htm" title="Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>, and <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a>. These connections are formed through various sub-disciplines that utilize concepts from multiple scientific disciplines. For example, <!--del_lnk--> physical chemistry involves applying the principles of <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> to materials at the atomic and molecular level.<p>Chemistry pertains to the interactions of <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a>. These interactions may be between two material substances or between matter and <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a>, especially in conjunction with the <!--del_lnk--> First Law of Thermodynamics. Traditional chemistry involves interactions between <!--del_lnk--> substances in <!--del_lnk--> chemical reactions, where one or more substances become one or more other substances. Sometimes these reactions are driven by energetic (enthalpic) considerations, such as when two highly energetic substances such as elemental hydrogen and oxygen react to form the less energetic substance water. Chemical reactions may be facilitated by a <!--del_lnk--> catalyst, which is generally another chemical substance present within the reaction media but unconsumed (such as sulfuric acid catalyzing the <!--del_lnk--> electrolysis of water) or a non-material phenomenon (such as electromagnetic radiation in photochemical reactions). Traditional chemistry also deals with the analysis of chemicals both in and apart from a reaction, as in <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopy.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>All ordinary matter consists of <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> or the subatomic components that make up atoms; protons, electrons and neutrons. Atoms may be combined to produce more complex forms of matter such as <!--del_lnk--> ions, <!--del_lnk--> molecules or <a href="../../wp/c/Crystal.htm" title="Crystal">crystals</a>. The structure of the world we commonly experience and the properties of the matter we commonly interact with are determined by properties of chemical substances and their interactions. <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">Steel</a> is harder than iron because its atoms are bound together in a more rigid <!--del_lnk--> crystalline lattice. Wood burns or undergoes rapid <!--del_lnk--> oxidation because it can react spontaneously with <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> in a <!--del_lnk--> chemical reaction above a certain <!--del_lnk--> temperature.<p>Substances tend to be classified in terms of their energy or phase as well as their chemical compositions. The three <!--del_lnk--> phases of matter at low energy are <!--del_lnk--> Solid, <!--del_lnk--> Liquid and <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">Gas</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Solids have fixed structures at room temperature which can resist gravity and other weak forces attempting to rearrange them, due to their tight bonds. <!--del_lnk--> Liquids have limited bonds, with no structure and flow with gravity. <!--del_lnk--> Gases have no bonds and act as free particles. Another way to view the three phases is by volume and shape: roughly speaking, solids have fixed volume and shape, liquids have fixed volume but <i>no</i> fixed shape, and gases have neither fixed volume nor fixed shape.<p><a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">Water</a> (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a <!--del_lnk--> liquid at room temperature because its molecules are bound by intermolecular forces called <!--del_lnk--> Hydrogen bonds. <!--del_lnk--> Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) on the other hand is a gas at room temperature and standard pressure, as its molecules are bound by weaker <!--del_lnk--> dipole-dipole interactions. The hydrogen bonds in water have enough energy to keep the water molecules from separating from each other but not from sliding around, making it a liquid at temperatures between 0 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> C and 100 &deg;C at sea level. Lowering the temperature or energy further, allows for a tighter organization to form, creating a solid, and releasing energy. Increasing the energy (see <!--del_lnk--> heat of fusion) will melt the ice although the temperature will not change until all the ice is melted. Increasing the temperature of the water will eventually cause boiling (see <!--del_lnk--> heat of vaporization) when there is enough energy to overcome the polar attractions between individual water molecules (100 &deg;C at 1 atmosphere of <!--del_lnk--> pressure), allowing the H<sub>2</sub>O molecules to disperse enough to be a <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a>. Note that in each case there is energy required to overcome the intermolecular attractions and thus allow the molecules to move away from each other.<p><!--del_lnk--> Scientists who study chemistry are known as <!--del_lnk--> chemists. Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. The chemistry taught at the high school or early college level is often called &quot;general chemistry&quot; and is intended to be an introduction to a wide variety of fundamental concepts and to give the student the tools to continue on to more advanced subjects. Many concepts presented at this level are often incomplete and technically inaccurate, yet they are of extraordinary utility. Chemists regularly use these simple, elegant tools and explanations in their work because they have been proven to accurately model a very wide array of chemical reactivity, are generally sufficient, and more precise solutions may be prohibitively difficult to obtain.<p>The science of chemistry is historically a recent development but has its roots in <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> which has been practiced for <!--del_lnk--> millennia throughout the world. The word chemistry is directly derived from the word alchemy; however, the etymology of alchemy is unclear (see <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>).<p><a id="History_of_chemistry" name="History_of_chemistry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History of chemistry</span></h2>

      <p>The roots of chemistry can be traced to the phenomenon of <!--del_lnk--> burning. <a href="../../wp/f/Fire.htm" title="Fire">Fire</a> was a mystical force that transformed one substance into another and thus was of primary interest to mankind. It was fire that led to the discovery of <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a>. After <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> was discovered and became a precious metal, many people were interested to find a method that could convert other substances into gold. This led to the <!--del_lnk--> protoscience called <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>. Alchemy was practiced by many cultures throughout history and often contained a mixture of philosophy, mysticism, and protoscience (<i>see</i> <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>).<p>Alchemists discovered many chemical <!--del_lnk--> processes that led to the development of modern chemistry. As history progressed the more notable alchemists (esp. <!--del_lnk--> Geber and <!--del_lnk--> Paracelsus) evolved alchemy away from philosophy and mysticism and developed more systematic and scientific approaches. The first alchemist considered to apply the scientific method to alchemy and to distinguish chemistry from alchemy was <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> (1627&ndash;1691); however, chemistry as we know it today was invented by <a href="../../wp/a/Antoine_Lavoisier.htm" title="Antoine Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> with his law of <!--del_lnk--> Conservation of mass in 1783. The <!--del_lnk--> discoveries of the chemical elements has a long history culminating in the creation of the <a href="../../wp/p/Periodic_table.htm" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> of the chemical elements by <!--del_lnk--> Dmitri Mendeleyev.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Chemistry created in 1901 gives an excellent overview of chemical discovery in the past 100 years. In the early part of the 20th century the subatomic nature of atoms were revealed and the science of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> began to explain the physical nature of the chemical bond. By the mid 20th century chemistry had developed to the point of being able to understand and predict aspects of <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> spawning the field of <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> chemical industry represents an important economic activity. The global top 50 chemical producers in 2004 had sales of 587 billion <!--del_lnk--> US dollars with a profit margin of 8.1% and <!--del_lnk--> research and development spending of 2.1% of total chemical sales.<p><a id="Subdisciplines_of_chemistry" name="Subdisciplines_of_chemistry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subdisciplines of chemistry</span></h2>

      <p>Chemistry typically is divided into several major sub-disciplines. There are also several main cross-disciplinary and more specialized fields of chemistry.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their <!--del_lnk--> chemical composition and <!--del_lnk--> structure. Analytical chemistry incorporates standardized experimental methods in chemistry. These methods may be used in all subdisciplines of chemistry, excluding purely theoretical chemistry.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Biochemistry is the study of the <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, <!--del_lnk--> chemical reactions and chemical <!--del_lnk--> interactions that take place in living <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a>. Biochemistry and organic chemistry are closely related, as in <!--del_lnk--> medicinal chemistry or <!--del_lnk--> neurochemistry. Biochemistry is also associated with <!--del_lnk--> molecular biology and <a href="../../wp/g/Genetics.htm" title="Genetics">genetics</a>.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Inorganic chemistry is the study of the properties and reactions of inorganic compounds. The distinction between organic and inorganic disciplines is not absolute and there is much overlap, most importantly in the sub-discipline of <!--del_lnk--> organometallic chemistry.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Organic chemistry is the study of the structure, properties, composition, mechanisms, and <!--del_lnk--> reactions of <!--del_lnk--> organic compounds. An organic compound is defined as any compound based on a carbon skeleton.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Physical chemistry is the study of the physical and fundamental basis of chemical systems and processes. In particular, the energetics and dynamics of such systems and processes are of interest to physical chemists. Important areas of study include <!--del_lnk--> chemical thermodynamics, <!--del_lnk--> chemical kinetics, <!--del_lnk--> electrochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> statistical mechanics, and <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopy. Physical chemistry has large overlap with <!--del_lnk--> molecular physics. Physical chemistry involves the use of <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a> in deriving equations. It is usually associated with <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_chemistry.htm" title="Quantum chemistry">quantum chemistry</a> and theoretical chemistry.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Theoretical chemistry is the study of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> or <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>). In particular the application of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> to chemistry is called <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_chemistry.htm" title="Quantum chemistry">quantum chemistry</a>. Since the end of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of <a href="../../wp/c/Computational_chemistry.htm" title="Computational chemistry">computational chemistry</a>, which is the art of developing and applying <!--del_lnk--> computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) <!--del_lnk--> condensed matter physics and <!--del_lnk--> molecular physics. Essentially from <!--del_lnk--> reductionism theoretical chemistry is just physics, just like fundamental biology is just chemistry and physics.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Nuclear chemistry is the study of how subatomic particles come together and make nuclei. Modern <!--del_lnk--> Transmutation is a large component of nuclear chemistry, and the <!--del_lnk--> table of nuclides is an important result and tool for this field.</ul>
      <p>Other fields include <!--del_lnk--> Astrochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Atmospheric chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Chemical Engineering, <!--del_lnk--> Chemo-informatics, <!--del_lnk--> Electrochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Environmental chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Flow chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Geochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Green chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> History of chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Materials science, <!--del_lnk--> Medicinal chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Molecular Biology, <!--del_lnk--> Molecular genetics, <!--del_lnk--> Nanotechnology, <!--del_lnk--> Organometallic chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Petrochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Pharmacology, <!--del_lnk--> Photochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Phytochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Polymer chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Solid-state chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Sonochemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Supramolecular chemistry, <!--del_lnk--> Surface chemistry, and <!--del_lnk--> Thermochemistry.<p><a id="Fundamental_concepts" name="Fundamental_concepts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fundamental concepts</span></h2>

      <p>A <i>phase</i> is a <a href="../../wp/s/Set.htm" title="Set">set</a> of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties, over a range of conditions, such as <!--del_lnk--> pressure or <!--del_lnk--> temperature. Physical properties, such as <!--del_lnk--> density and <!--del_lnk--> refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase. The phase of matter is defined by the <i><!--del_lnk--> phase transition</i>, which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system, instead of changing the bulk conditions.<p>Sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary, in this case the matter is considered to be in a <!--del_lnk--> supercritical state. When three states meet based on the conditions, it is known as a <!--del_lnk--> triple point and since this is invariant, it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions.<p>The most familiar examples of phases are <!--del_lnk--> solids, <!--del_lnk--> liquids, and <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gases</a>. Less familiar phases include <!--del_lnk--> plasmas, <!--del_lnk--> Bose-Einstein condensates and <!--del_lnk--> fermionic condensates and the <!--del_lnk--> paramagnetic and <!--del_lnk--> ferromagnetic phases of <a href="../../wp/m/Magnet.htm" title="Magnet">magnetic</a> materials. Even the familiar <a href="../../wp/i/Ice.htm" title="Ice">ice</a> has many different phases, depending on the pressure and temperature of the system. While most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems, it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems, which has received attention for its relevance to systems in <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>.<p><a id="Chemical_reactions" name="Chemical_reactions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical reactions</span></h3>

      <p>A <i>Chemical reaction</i> is a process that results in the interconversion of <!--del_lnk--> chemical substances. Such reactions can result in molecules attaching to each other to form larger molecules, molecules breaking apart to form two or more smaller molecules, or rearrangement of <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> within or across molecules. Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of <!--del_lnk--> chemical bonds. For example, substances that react with oxygen to produce other substances are said to undergo <!--del_lnk--> oxidation; similarly a group of substances called <!--del_lnk--> acids or <!--del_lnk--> alkalis can react with one another to neutralize each other&#39;s effect, a phenomenon known as <!--del_lnk--> neutralization. <!--del_lnk--> Substances can also be <!--del_lnk--> dissociated or synthesized from other substances by various different chemical <!--del_lnk--> processes.<p>A stricter definition exists <!--del_lnk-->  that states &quot;a Chemical Reaction is a process that results in the interconversion of chemical species&quot;. Under this definition, a chemical reaction may be an <!--del_lnk--> elementary reaction or a <!--del_lnk--> stepwise reaction. An additional caveat is made, in that this definition includes cases where the <!--del_lnk--> interconversion of conformers is experimentally observable. Such detectable chemical reactions normally involve sets of molecular entities as indicated by this definition, but it is often conceptually convenient to use the term also for changes involving single molecular entities (i.e. &#39;microscopic chemical events&#39;).<p><a id="Quantum_chemistry" name="Quantum_chemistry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Quantum chemistry</span></h3>

      <p><i>Quantum chemistry</i> mathematically describes the fundamental behaviour of <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">matter</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> molecular scale. It is, in principle, possible to describe all chemical systems using this theory. In practice, only the simplest chemical systems may realistically be investigated in purely <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> terms, and approximations must be made for most practical purposes (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Hartree-Fock, <!--del_lnk--> post Hartree-Fock or <!--del_lnk--> Density functional theory, see <a href="../../wp/c/Computational_chemistry.htm" title="Computational chemistry">computational chemistry</a> for more details). Hence a detailed understanding of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> is not necessary for most chemistry, as the important implications of the theory (principally the <!--del_lnk--> orbital approximation) can be understood and applied in simpler terms.<p>In quantum mechanics (several applications in computational chemistry and quantum chemistry), the <!--del_lnk--> Hamiltonian, or the physical state, of a particle can be expressed as the sum of two operators, one corresponding to <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy and the other to <!--del_lnk--> potential energy. The <!--del_lnk--> Hamiltonian in the <!--del_lnk--> Schr&ouml;dinger wave equation used in quantum chemistry does not contain terms for the <!--del_lnk--> spin of the electron.<p>Solutions of the Schr&ouml;dinger equation for the hydrogen atom gives the form of the wave function for <!--del_lnk--> atomic orbitals, and the relative energy of say the 1s,2s,2p and 3s orbitals. The orbital approximation can be used to understand the other atoms e.g. <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithium.htm" title="Lithium">lithium</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon.htm" title="Carbon">carbon</a>.<p><a id="Chemical_Laws" name="Chemical_Laws"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical Laws</span></h3>

      <p>The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the <!--del_lnk--> law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary <!--del_lnk--> chemical reaction. Modern physics shows that it is actually <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> that is conserved, and that energy and mass are <!--del_lnk--> related; a concept which becomes important in <!--del_lnk--> nuclear chemistry. <!--del_lnk--> Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of <!--del_lnk--> equilibrium, <a href="../../wp/t/Thermodynamics.htm" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> kinetics.<p>Further laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass. <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Proust&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.<p><!--del_lnk--> Dalton&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 O:H in water); although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction. Such compounds are known as <!--del_lnk--> non-stoichiometric compounds.<p><a id="Chemistry_societies" name="Chemistry_societies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemistry societies</span></h2>

      <p>The word <i>chemistry</i> comes from the earlier study of alchemy, which is basically the quest to make gold from earthen starting materials. As to the origin of the word &ldquo;alchemy&rdquo; the question is a debatable one; it certainly has Greek origins, and some, following E. Wallis Budge, have also asserted Egyptian origins. Alchemy, generally, derives from the old French <i>alkemie;</i> and the Arabic <i>al-kimia:</i> &quot;the art of transformation.&quot; The Arabs borrowed the word &ldquo;kimia&rdquo; from the Greeks when they conquered <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria in the year 642 AD. A tentative outline is as follows:<ol>
       <li>Egyptian alchemy [5,000 BC &ndash; 400 BC], Alexandria has the world&rsquo;s largest library<li>Greek alchemy [332 BC &ndash; 642 AD], the Greeks take over Alexandria<li>Arabian alchemy [642 AD &ndash; 1200], the Arabs take over Alexandria, e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Jabir is the main chemist.<li>European alchemy [1300 &ndash; Present], <!--del_lnk--> Gerber builds on Arabic chemistry<li>Chemistry [1661], <!--del_lnk--> Boyle writes his classic chemistry text <i>The Sceptical Chymist</i><li>Chemistry [1787], <!--del_lnk--> Lavoisier writes his classic <i>Elements of Chemistry</i><li>Chemistry [1803], <!--del_lnk--> Dalton publishes his <i>Atomic Theory</i></ol>
      <p>Thus, an alchemist was called a &#39;chemist&#39; in popular speech, and later the suffix &quot;-ry&quot; was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as &quot;chemistry&quot;.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reading list for university students</span></h2>
