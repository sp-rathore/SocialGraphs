      <p><b>Coffee</b> is one of the most widely consumed <!--del_lnk--> beverages in the world. It is prepared from the roasted <!--del_lnk--> seeds &ndash; commonly referred to as beans &ndash; of the <!--del_lnk--> coffee plant, and is usually served hot but can also be served cold. A typical 7 fluid ounce (ca. 207&nbsp;mL) cup of coffee contains 80-140 milligrams of <!--del_lnk--> caffeine, depending on the method of preparation. Coffee represents 71% of all the United States caffeine consumption followed by <!--del_lnk--> soft drinks and <a href="../../wp/t/Tea.htm" title="Tea">tea</a>. Coffee, along with tea and <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a>, is one of the most frequently-drunk beverages, its volume amounting to about a third that of tap water. In 2003, coffee was the world&#39;s sixth largest agricultural export in terms of value, behind wheat, maize, soybeans, palm oil and <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar.htm" title="Sugar">sugar</a>.<p><a id="Etymology_and_history" name="Etymology_and_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology and history</span></h2>

      <p>The history of coffee begins in the 9th century. It originated in the <!--del_lnk--> highlands of Ethiopia and spread to the rest of the world via Egypt and Europe. The word <i>coffee</i> is believed to be derived from the word <!--del_lnk--> Kaffa, a region in <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> where coffee originated. Later through its expansion, the name later evolved from <!--del_lnk--> Arabic word &#x642;&#x647;&#x648;&#x629; <i>Qah&#39;wa</i>, over <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Turkish <i>Kahve</i>, which originally meant <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a> or other intoxicating <!--del_lnk--> liquors. In the 15th century, Muslims introduced coffee in <!--del_lnk--> Persia, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, northern Africa and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, where the first coffeehouse, Kiva Han, opened in 1475 in <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople. The stimulant effect of drinking coffee caused it to be forbidden among orthodox and conservative imams in <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> in 1511 and in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> in 1532 by a theological court. In Egypt, coffeehouses and warehouses containing coffee cherries were sacked. But the product&#39;s popularity, particularly among intellectuals, led to the reversal of this decision in 1524 by an order of the <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Turkish <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> <!--del_lnk--> Selim I.<p>From the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim world, coffee spread to Europe, where it became popular in the 17th century. Dutch traders were the first to start the large scale importation of coffee into Europe. In 1538, L&eacute;onard Rauwolf, a German physician, having come back from a ten-year trip in the <!--del_lnk--> Near East, was the first westerner to describe the brew:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>These remarks were noted by merchants, who were sensitive to this kind of information through experience in the commerce of spices. English <!--del_lnk--> coffeehouses were centers of intellectual and commercial activity. <!--del_lnk--> Lloyds of London, the famous <!--del_lnk--> insurance firm, was originally a coffeehouse.<p>In the American colonies, coffee drinking developed slowly. Colonists thought that coffee was a poor substitute for alcohol. High alcohol consumption was normal and even children would drink beer at dinner. However, during the Revolutionary War, there was a large enough demand that dealers hoarded their scarce supplies and raised the prices substantially. Americans&#39; preference for coffee grew during the early 1800&#39;s after the War of 1812, which temporarily cut off access to tea imports. Also, all things French, including coffee drinking, became stylish and the price dropped. Although prices went up during the civil war, many advancements in brewing as well as the substantial amount drank by soldiers helped make coffee an everyday commodity. After the Civil War, prices remained high, but it is estimated that Americans consumed 6 times that of most Europeans.<p><a id="Coffee_seed_types" name="Coffee_seed_types"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Coffee seed types</span></h2>

      <p>There are two main species of the <strong class="selflink">coffee plant</strong>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Coffea arabica</i> being the older one. Coffee is thought to be indigenous to south-western <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, specifically from <!--del_lnk--> Kaffa, from which it may have acquired its name. While more susceptible to disease, it is considered by most to taste better than the second species, <i><!--del_lnk--> Coffea canephora (robusta)</i>. <i>Robusta</i>, which contains about 40-50% more caffeine, can be cultivated in environments where <i>arabica</i> will not thrive and probably originated in <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>. This has led to its use as an inexpensive substitute for <i>arabica</i> in many commercial coffee blends. Compared to <i>arabica</i>, <i>robusta</i> tends to be bitter and has little flavor, with a telltale &quot;burnt rubber&quot; or &quot;wet cardboard&quot; aroma and flavor. Good quality <i>robustas</i> are used in some <!--del_lnk--> espresso blends to provide a better &quot;crema&quot; (foamy head), and to lower the ingredient cost. In <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, many espresso blends are based on dark-roasted <i>robusta</i>. The large industrial roasters use a steam treatment process to remove undesirable flavours from <i>robusta</i> beans for use in mass-marketed coffee blends. Other species include <i>Coffea liberica</i> and <i>Coffea esliaca</i>, believed to be indigenous to <a href="../../wp/l/Liberia.htm" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> and southern <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> respectively.<p><i>Arabica</i> coffees were traditionally named by the port they were exported from, the two oldest being <!--del_lnk--> Mocha, from <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Java, from <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. The modern coffee trade is much more specific about origin, labeling coffees by country, region, and sometimes even the producing estate. Varietal is a botanical term denoting a taxonomic category ranking below species, a designation more specific than arabica or robusta and unrelated to the coffee&#39;s place of origin. Coffees consisting entirely of beans from a single varietal, <i>bourbon</i>, for example, are generally referred to as such, along with a reference to their place of origin (as in: Rwanda Blue Bourbon). Coffee aficionados may even distinguish auctioned coffees by lot number.<p>Most arabica coffee beans originate from one of three growing regions; Latin America, East Africa/Arabia and Asia/Pacific. Beans from different countries or regions usually have distinctive characteristics such as flavor (flavor criteria include terms such as &quot;<a href="../../wp/c/Citrus.htm" title="Citrus">citrus</a>-like&quot; or &quot;earthy&quot;), aroma (sometimes &quot;berry-like&quot; or &quot;flowery&quot;), body or <!--del_lnk--> mouthfeel, and acidity. Acidity refers to a tangy or clean-tasting quality, typically present in washed or wet processed coffees. It does not refer to a coffee&#39;s pH level. (Black coffee has a <!--del_lnk--> pH of around 5). These distinguishing taste characteristics are dependent not only on the coffee&#39;s growing region, but also on its method of process and genetic subspecies or <!--del_lnk--> varietal.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> peaberry, (also sometimes called a &quot;Caracoli&quot; bean) is a coffee bean that that develops singly inside the coffee cherry instead of the usual pair of beans. This situation occurs 5-10% of the time. Since flavour is concentrated when only a single bean is grown inside the cherry, these beans (especially Arabica) are highly prized.<p><a id="Processing_and_roasting" name="Processing_and_roasting"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Processing and roasting</span></h2>

      <p>Much processing and human labour is required before coffee berries and its seed can be processed into the roasted coffee with which most Western consumers are familiar. Coffee berries must be picked, defruited, dried, sorted, and&mdash;in some processes&mdash;also aged.<p>Coffee is usually sold roasted, and the roasting process has a great degree of influence on the taste of the final product. All coffee is roasted before being consumed. Coffee can be sold <!--del_lnk--> roasted by the supplier; alternatively it can be <!--del_lnk--> home roasted.<p>Everyday alchemy, coffee roasting coaxes golden flavor from a bland bean. Unroasted beans boast all of coffee&rsquo;s acids, protein, and caffeine&mdash;but none of its taste. It takes heat to spark the chemical reactions that turn carbohydrates and fats into <!--del_lnk--> aromatic oils, burn off moisture and carbon dioxide, and alternately break down and build up acids, unlocking the characteristic coffee flavor.<p>

      <p>The processing of coffee typically refers to the agricultural and industrial processes needed to deliver whole roasted coffee beans to the consumer. Grinding the roasted coffee beans is done at a roastery, in a grocery store, or at home. It is most commonly ground at the roastery and sold to the consumer ground and packaged, though &quot;whole-bean&quot; coffee that is ground at home is becoming more popular despite the extra effort required. A grind is referred to by its brewing method. &quot;Turkish&quot; grind, the finest, is meant for mixing straight with water, while the coarsest grinds, such as <!--del_lnk--> coffee percolator or <!--del_lnk--> French press, are at the other extreme. Midway between the extremes are the most common: &quot;drip&quot; and &quot;paper filter&quot; grinds, which are used in the most common home coffee brewing machines. The &quot;drip&quot; machines operate with near-boiling water passed in a slow stream through the ground coffee in a paper filter. The <!--del_lnk--> espresso method uses more advanced technology to force very hot (not boiling) water, through the ground coffee, resulting in a stronger flavor and chemical changes with more coffee bean matter in the drink. Once brewed, it may be presented in a variety of ways: on its own, with sugar, with milk or cream, hot or cold, and so on. Roasted arabica beans are also eaten plain and covered with chocolate. See the article on <!--del_lnk--> coffee preparation for a comprehensive list.<p>A number of products are sold for the convenience of consumers who don&#39;t want to prepare their own coffee. <!--del_lnk--> Instant coffee has been dried into soluble powder or freeze dried into granules, which can be quickly dissolved in hot water for consumption. Canned coffee is a beverage that has been popular in Asian countries for many years, particularly in Japan and South Korea. <!--del_lnk--> Vending machines typically sell a number of varieties of canned coffee, available both hot and cold. To match the often busy life of Korean city dwellers, companies mostly have canned coffee with a wide variety of tastes. Japanese convenience stores and groceries also have a wide availability of plastic-bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk. Lastly, liquid coffee concentrate is sometimes used in large institutional situations where coffee needs to be produced for thousands of people at the same time. It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade <i>robusta</i> coffee, and costs about 10 cents a cup to produce. The machines used to process it can handle up to 500 cups an hour, or 1,000 if the water is preheated.<p><a id="Economics_of_coffee" name="Economics_of_coffee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economics of coffee</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> remains the largest coffee exporting nation, but in recent years the green coffee market has been flooded by large quantities of <i>robusta</i> beans from <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Many experts believe the giant influx of cheap green coffee after the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement of 1975-1989 with Cold War pressures led to the prolonged pricing crisis from 2001 to 2004. In 1997 the &quot;c&quot; price of coffee in New York broke <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>3.00/<!--del_lnk--> lb, but by late 2001 it had fallen to US$0.43/lb. Robusta coffees (traded in London at much lower prices than New York&#39;s Arabica) are preferred by large industrial clients (multinational roasters, instant coffee producers, etc.) because of their lower cost.<p>The preference of the &quot;Big Four&quot; coffee companies for cheap <i>robusta</i> is believed by many to have been a major contributing factor to the crash in coffee prices, and the demand for high-quality <i>arabica</i> beans is only slowly recovering. After the crash, many coffee farmers in Africa, Indonesia and South and Central America lost their livelihoods, or turned to illicit crops such as <!--del_lnk--> coca to earn a living. The <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> brand &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Max Havelaar&#39; started the concept of <!--del_lnk--> fair trade Labelling, which attempted to remedy the situation by guaranteeing coffee growers a negotiated pre-harvest price; many smaller roasters and recently Procter &amp; Gamble and Starbucks have joined Fair Trade. Another issue with coffee is ecological: the <!--del_lnk--> American Birding Association has led a campaign for sustainably harvested, shade-grown and organic coffees vs. the newer mono-cropped full-sun varieties, which lead to deforestation and loss of bird habitat.<p>Coffee ingestion on average is about a third that of tap water in most of North America and Europe. In 2002 in the US, coffee consumption was 22.1 gallons per person.<p><a id="Health_and_pharmacology_of_coffee" name="Health_and_pharmacology_of_coffee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Health and pharmacology of coffee</span></h2>

Studies are contradictory as to whether coffee has any specific health benefits, and results are similarly conflicting with respect to negative effects of coffee consumption. In addition, it is often unclear whether these risks or benefits are linked to caffeine or whether they are to be attributed to other chemical substances found in coffee (and whether decaffeinated coffee carries the same benefits or risks).<p>One fairly consistent finding has been the reduction of <!--del_lnk--> diabetes mellitus type 2 in coffee consumers, an association that cannot be explained by the caffeine content alone and indeed may be stronger in decaffeinated coffee.<p>Recently, coffee was found to reduce the chances of developing <!--del_lnk--> cirrhosis of the liver: the consumption of 1 cup a day was found to reduce the chances by 20%, and 4 cups a day reduced the chances by 80%.<p><a id="Social_aspects_of_coffee" name="Social_aspects_of_coffee"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Social aspects of coffee</span></h2>

      <p>Coffee plays an important role in many societies throughout the world today. From the coffeehouses of the 16th century, to the modern day caf&eacute;s, coffee has had a profound impact on the lifestyles of people from all walks of life. When it first appeared in Africa and Yemen, it was commonly used as a type of religious intoxicant. This usage in religious rites among the Sufi branch of Islam led to it being put on trial in Mecca for being a &quot;heretic&quot; substance much as wine was. It was briefly repressed at this point, and was later part of a larger ban in Ottoman Turkey under an edict that led to the death of thousands of people. Its early association in Europe with rebellious political activities led to its banning in England, among other places.<p>In <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Coffee Houses became an icon of the worker&#39;s struggle. This restaurant chain is now owned by the workers of ICHs, as a result of the struggle performed by the thrown-out workers from the Coffee Houses of <!--del_lnk--> Coffee Board. This struggle was led by famed Communist leader of India <!--del_lnk--> A. K. Gopalan. Thus the ICHs became the meeting places of the progressive-minded in India later.<p><a id="Other_uses" name="Other_uses"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other uses</span></h2>

While they tend to be only slightly acidic, they also tend to improve the acidity of garden soil through the same chemical processes that make <!--del_lnk--> sawdust a good fertilizer. Coffee grounds raise soil acidity sooner if they are added fresh, instead of after brewing. Likewise, coffee diluted with four times its volume of water can be used to amend soil acidity, especially useful for <!--del_lnk--> tomatoes, <!--del_lnk--> chili peppers, <!--del_lnk--> blueberries, and other plants that like high soil acidity.<p>The grounds are also used as bait in &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Vegas roach traps&quot;.<p>Some use coffee to create art. <!--del_lnk--> Latte art involves designs in the foam of espresso-based drinks. <!--del_lnk--> Arf&eacute; is the use of coffee as a coloring for painting or other visual effects.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee&quot;</div>
