      <p>Settlements have existed around the area since before the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. The earliest clear evidence of occupation, a collection of hunting weapons, is from the Late Bronze Age, starting around 1000 BC. There is further archaeological evidence through the Iron Age, a <!--del_lnk--> Belgic tribe having settled on Castle Hill in the <a href="../../wp/1/1st_century_BC.htm" title="1st century BC">1st century BC</a>.<p>The first major development of the area began with the <!--del_lnk--> Roman invasion of Britain in about <!--del_lnk--> AD 40. Castle Hill made Cambridge a useful place for a military outpost from which to defend the <!--del_lnk--> River Cam. It was also the crossing point for the Via Devana which linked <!--del_lnk--> Colchester in <!--del_lnk--> Essex with the garrisons at <!--del_lnk--> Lincoln and the north. This Roman settlement may have been called <i>Durolipons</i>.<p>The settlement remained a regional centre during the 350 years after the Roman occupation, until about AD <!--del_lnk--> 400. Roman roads and walled enclosures can still be seen in the area.<p>After the Romans had left, <!--del_lnk--> Saxons took over the land on and around Castle Hill. Their grave goods have been found in the area. During Anglo-Saxon times Cambridge benefited from good trade links across the otherwise hard-to-travel fenlands. By the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a>, however, visitors from nearby Ely reported that Cambridge had declined severely. Cambridge is mentioned in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as Grantebrycge. This is the earliest known reference to a bridge at Cambridge.<p>The arrival of the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> in Cambridge was recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in <!--del_lnk--> 875. Viking rule, the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw, had been imposed by <!--del_lnk--> 878. The Vikings&#39; vigorous trading habits caused Cambridge to grow rapidly. During this period the centre of the town shifted from Castle Hill on the <!--del_lnk--> left bank of the river to the area now known as the Quayside on the <!--del_lnk--> right bank. After the end of the Viking period the Saxons enjoyed a brief return to power, building St Benet&#39;s church in <!--del_lnk--> 1025. It still stands in Bene&#39;t Street.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1068, two years after his conquest of England, <!--del_lnk--> William of Normandy built a castle on Castle Hill. Like the rest of the new kingdom, Cambridge fell under the control of the King and his deputies. The distinctive Round Church dates from this period. By Norman times the name of the town had mutated to Grentabrige or Cantebrigge (Grantbridge), while the river that flowed through it was called the Granta.<p>Over time the name of the town changed to Cambridge, while the river Cam was still known as the Granta - indeed the river is still often known as the Granta to this day. The <!--del_lnk--> Welsh language name of the town remains <i>Caergrawnt</i> (roughly analogous to <!--del_lnk--> Grantchester, which is also the name of a village near Cambridge). It was only later that the river became known as the Cam, by analogy with the name Cambridge. The University, formed 1209, uses a <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> adjective <i>cantabrigiensis</i> (often contracted to &quot;Cantab&quot;) to mean &quot;of Cambridge&quot;, but this is obviously a <!--del_lnk--> back-formation from the English name.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1209, students escaping from hostile townspeople in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> fled to Cambridge and formed a University there. The oldest <!--del_lnk--> college that still exists, <!--del_lnk--> Peterhouse, was founded in 1284. One of the most impressive buildings in Cambridge, <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s College Chapel, was begun in <!--del_lnk--> 1446 by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VI_of_England.htm" title="Henry VI of England">King Henry VI</a>. The project was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1515 during the reign of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry VIII</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Cambridge University Press originated with a printing licence issued in <!--del_lnk--> 1534. <!--del_lnk--> Hobson&#39;s Conduit, the first project to bring clean drinking water to the town centre, was built in <!--del_lnk--> 1610 (by the Hobson of <!--del_lnk--> Hobson&#39;s choice). Parts of it survive today. <!--del_lnk--> Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1766. The railway and station were built in <!--del_lnk--> 1845. According to legend, the University dictated their location: well away from the centre of town, so that the possibility of quick access to London would not distract students from their work. However, there is no basis for this in fact.<p><a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge University</a> played a unique role in the invention of modern <a href="../../wp/f/Football.htm" title="Football">football</a> as the game&#39;s first set of rules were drawn up by members of the university in <!--del_lnk--> 1848. The <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Rules were first played in <!--del_lnk--> Parker&#39;s Piece and had a &quot;defining influence on the 1863 <!--del_lnk--> Football Association rules.&quot;<p>Despite having a University, Cambridge was not granted its <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> charter until <!--del_lnk--> 1951. Cambridge does not have a <!--del_lnk--> cathedral, which was traditionally a pre-requisite for city status.<p><a id="Cambridge_today" name="Cambridge_today"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cambridge today</span></h3>
      <p>Drawing on its links with the University, the Cambridge area today is sometimes referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Fen, due to the growth of high tech businesses and <!--del_lnk--> technology incubators that have sprung up in the series of <!--del_lnk--> science parks and other developments in and around the city. Such companies include <a href="../../wp/a/Acorn_Computers.htm" title="Acorn Computers">Acorn Computers</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Sinclair_Research_Ltd.htm" title="Sinclair Research Ltd">Sinclair</a>. The University was joined by the larger part of <!--del_lnk--> Anglia Ruskin University, and the educational reputation has led to other bodies (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Open University in East Anglia) basing themselves in the city.<p>The University has a large number of museums that are open to the public.<p><a id="Housing_estates" name="Housing_estates"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Housing estates</span></h3>
      <p>Throughout the 1960s and 70s the size of the city was greatly increased by several large <!--del_lnk--> council estates planned to hold London&#39;s overspill. The biggest impact has been on the area north of the river, which is now home to the estates of <!--del_lnk--> Arbury, <!--del_lnk--> East Chesterton and <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Hedges, whilst there are many smaller estates to the south of the city.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      <p>Because of its rapid growth since the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, Cambridge has a congested road network. Several major roads intersect at Cambridge. The <!--del_lnk--> M11 motorway from east <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> terminates here. The <!--del_lnk--> A14 (formerly A604 and A45) east-west trunk route skirts the northern edge of the city. This is a major freight route connecting the port of <!--del_lnk--> Felixstowe on the east coast with the <!--del_lnk--> Midlands, North <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, the west coast and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. The A14 is considered by many local people to be dangerous, and unnecessarily congested. This is particularly true of the section between <!--del_lnk--> Huntingdon and Cambridge where the east-west traffic is merged with the <!--del_lnk--> A1 to <!--del_lnk--> M11 north-south traffic on just a 2-lane dual carriageway. The <!--del_lnk--> A10, a former <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_road.htm" title="Roman road">Roman road</a> from north <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, passes round the city on its way to <!--del_lnk--> Ely and <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Lynn. Other roads connect the city with <!--del_lnk--> Bedford, <!--del_lnk--> St Neots, Newmarket and <!--del_lnk--> Colchester.<p>The city has a ring road about 2 km in diameter, inside which there are traffic restrictions intended to improve conditions for pedestrians, cyclists and bus users and to reduce congestion. It has a well developed <!--del_lnk--> park and ride bus service encouraging motorists to park near the city&#39;s edge.<p><a id="Rail" name="Rail"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rail</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Cambridge railway station was built in <!--del_lnk--> 1845 with a platform designed to take two full-length trains. Cambridge has direct rail links to <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Cross (via <!--del_lnk--> Hitchin and the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast Main Line) and <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Street (via the <!--del_lnk--> West Anglia Main Line) stations in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. It is also linked to <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Lynn and <!--del_lnk--> Ely (via the <!--del_lnk--> Fen Line), <!--del_lnk--> Norwich (via the <!--del_lnk--> Breckland Line), <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ipswich.htm" title="Ipswich">Ipswich</a> and as well as <!--del_lnk--> London Stansted Airport. The important UK rail hub of <!--del_lnk--> Peterborough is also within reach of Cambridge. The railway service connecting Cambridge and Oxford, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Varsity Line, was discontinued in <!--del_lnk--> 1968.<p><a id="Air" name="Air"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Air</span></h3>
      <p><b><!--del_lnk--> Cambridge City Airport</b> is owned by <!--del_lnk--> Marshall Aerospace, who are capable of adapting and fitting out military transports, airliners and corporate jets, and most notably has been involved in fitting out the world&#39;s largest airliner, the <a href="../../wp/a/Airbus_A380.htm" title="Airbus A380">Airbus A380</a>. The runway can accommodate an unladen <a href="../../wp/b/Boeing_747.htm" title="Boeing 747">Boeing 747</a> or <!--del_lnk--> MD-11, but there is no regular scheduled service and it is mostly used by business and leisure flights. In Summer 2004 a <!--del_lnk--> charter service to <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Jersey">Jersey</a> was operated by <!--del_lnk--> Aurigny Air Services using <!--del_lnk--> Saab 340 <!--del_lnk--> turboprop aircraft. A dealer in <!--del_lnk--> fibreglass-moulded light monoplanes is also based here. Removal of Marshalls to a site away from the city, with development of the airport site for housing, is a possibility over the next 5-10 years.<p><a id="Cycling" name="Cycling"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cycling</span></h3>
      <p>As a university town lying on fairly flat ground and with traffic congestion, Cambridge has a large number of cyclists. Many residents also prefer cycling to driving in the narrow, busy streets, giving the city the highest level of cycle use in the UK. According to the 2001 census, 25% of residents travelled to work by cycle. A few roads within the city are adapted for cycling, including separate traffic lights for cycle lanes and cycle contraflows on streets which are otherwise one-way; the city also benefits from parks which have shared use paths. There are, however, no separate cycle paths within the city centre. Despite the high levels of cycling, expenditure on cycling infrastructure is around the national average of 0.3% of the transport budget. There are a few cycle routes in the surrounding countryside and the city is now linked to the <!--del_lnk--> National Cycle Network. The main organisation campaigning to improve conditions for cyclists in Cambridge is <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge Cycling Campaign.<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h2>
      <p>Cambridge&#39;s most successful sports team over recent years is its <!--del_lnk--> rugby union <!--del_lnk--> club. After three successive promotions they are playing in <!--del_lnk--> National Division Two for the 2006/07 season. The club&#39;s home ground is at West Renault Park on Granchester Road in the south west corner of the city.<p>The city is home to <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge United F.C., who played in the <!--del_lnk--> Football League at the <!--del_lnk--> Abbey Stadium from 1970 to 2005, when they were relegated to <!--del_lnk--> Conference National. When relegation became inevitable the club was placed in <!--del_lnk--> administration with substantial debts, but it emerged from administration in time for the 2005-2006 season. Non-league <!--del_lnk--> Cambridge City F.C. play at Milton Road in <!--del_lnk--> Chesterton.<p>Cambridge is also known for its <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">university</a> sporting events against <!--del_lnk--> Oxford, especially the rugby union <!--del_lnk--> Varsity Match and the <!--del_lnk--> Boat Race. These are followed by people across the globe, many of whom have no connection to the institutions themselves.<p>The City Council hosts details of Local Sports Clubs. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Cambridge has a <!--del_lnk--> King George&#39;s Field, named as a memorial to <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a>.<p><a id="Health" name="Health"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Health</span></h2>

      <p>Cambridge is well served by medical care, with several smaller medical centres dotted around the city, along with <!--del_lnk--> Addenbrooke&#39;s Hospital a learning and teaching hospital and one of the largest in the United Kingdom, also functioning as a centre for <!--del_lnk--> medical research.<p><a id="Multicultural_Cambridge" name="Multicultural_Cambridge"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Multicultural Cambridge</span></h2>
      <p>For its size, Cambridge has a relatively diverse ethnic population. This is mainly due to people from other countries coming to study at the University. The area around Mill Road has a large Turkish population, and is home to many Asian food stores and the <!--del_lnk--> Abu Bakr Mosque.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>Cambridge has an active Christian population which makes use of the many churches that dominate the town&#39;s landscape. <!--del_lnk--> Great St Mary&#39;s church has the status of being the &quot;University Church&quot;, and official university sermons take the part of services there. Many of the University colleges contain chapels that hold services according to the rites and ceremonies of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>, while at least one is <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic. There is also a mosque used by Muslim residents and students, and a synagogue belonging to the university Jewish Society.<p>The town also has a number of <!--del_lnk--> ecclesiastical colleges for training clergy for <!--del_lnk--> ordination into a number of denominations, with affiliations to both the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin Universiy.<p><a id="Fiction" name="Fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fiction</span></h2>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, the English children&#39;s writer <!--del_lnk--> Philippa Pearce created a fictionalised version of Cambridge known as &quot;Castleford&quot; (not connected to the <!--del_lnk--> real town of the same name in West Yorkshire). It appears in several of her books, most notably <i><!--del_lnk--> Tom&#39;s Midnight Garden</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Minnow on the Say</i>. The main distinguishing point between &quot;Castleford&quot; and the real Cambridge is that this &quot;Castleford&quot; does not have a university, apparently because the author wanted the readers to think of the town in itself, and she felt that Cambridge was too closely associated with its university in the public imagination for this to be possible.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tom Sharpe is also a Cambridge-based author who has written fictional accounts of teaching at Cambridge Technical College (now <!--del_lnk--> Anglia Ruskin University) and of Cambridge college life.<p><!--del_lnk--> Susanna Gregory wrote a series of novels set in 14th-century Cambridge and featuring a teacher of medicine and sleuth named Matthew Bartholomew.<p><a href="../../wp/d/Douglas_Adams.htm" title="Douglas Adams">Douglas Adams</a> was at one time a resident of Cambridge, and parts of his novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Dirk Gently&#39;s Holistic Detective Agency</i> are set in the city.
