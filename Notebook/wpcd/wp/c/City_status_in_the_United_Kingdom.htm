      <p><b>City status in the United Kingdom</b> is granted by the <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">British monarch</a> to a select group of communities. The status does not apply automatically on the basis of any particular criteria, although it was traditionally given to towns with <!--del_lnk--> diocesan cathedrals. This association between having a cathedral and being called a city was established in the early 1540s when Henry VIII founded dioceses (and therefore cathedrals) in six English towns and also granted them all city status by issuing Letters Patent.<p>

      <p>Until the sixteenth century, a town was recognised as a city by the Crown if it had a <!--del_lnk--> diocesan cathedral within its limits. This means some cities today are very small, because they were unaffected by population growth during the <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution &mdash; notably <!--del_lnk--> Wells, which has a population of about 10,000 (see <!--del_lnk--> Smallest cities in the United Kingdom). After the sixteenth century, no new dioceses (and no new cities) were created until the nineteenth century, but the practice was revived with the creation of the diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Ripon in 1836. A string of new dioceses and cities followed. This process was changed in 1888 to allow <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and other large settlements that did not have cathedrals to become cities (Birmingham&#39;s parish church later became a cathedral).<p><a id="City_status_conferrment" name="City_status_conferrment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City status conferrment</span></h2>
      <p><a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">City</a> status is conferred by <!--del_lnk--> letters patent and not by a royal charter but there are some British cities that predate the historical monarchy, and have been regarded as cities since &quot;<!--del_lnk--> time immemorial&quot;.<p>City status brings no benefits other than the right to be called a city. It should be noted that all cities have to be re-issued with letters patent reconfirming city status following local government re-organisation where the original city has been abolished. This process was followed by a number of cities since <!--del_lnk--> 1974, and <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Hereford&#39;s status was confirmed in both <!--del_lnk--> 1974 and again in the 1990s. Failure to do so leads to the loss of city status as happened at Rochester in <!--del_lnk--> 1998 (see below).<p>Charters originated as <!--del_lnk--> charters of incorporation, allowing a town to become an incorporated <!--del_lnk--> borough, or to hold <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">markets</a>. Some of these charters recognised officially that the town involved was a city. Apart from that recognition, it became accepted that such a charter could make a town into a city. The earliest examples of these are <!--del_lnk--> Hereford and <!--del_lnk--> Worcester, both of which date their city status to 1189.<p>Some people have disputed the official definition, especially inhabitants of places that have been considered cities in the past but are not generally considered cities today. Additionally, although the Crown clearly has the right to bestow &#39;official&#39; city status, some have doubted the right of the Crown to define the word &quot;city&quot; in the United Kingdom. In informal usage, &quot;city&quot; can be used for large towns or conurbations that are not formally cities. The best-known example of this is <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, which contains two cities (the <b><!--del_lnk--> City of London</b>, and the <b><!--del_lnk--> City of Westminster</b>) but is not itself a city.<p><a id="Officially-designated_cities" name="Officially-designated_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Officially-designated cities</span></h2>
      <p>There are currently 66 officially-designated cities in the UK, of which eight have been created since 2000 in competitions to celebrate the new <!--del_lnk--> millennium and Queen <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Golden Jubilee. The designation is highly sought after, with over 40 communities submitting bids at recent competitions.<p><a id="Modern_practice_of_granting_city_status" name="Modern_practice_of_granting_city_status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern practice of granting city status</span></h2>
      <p>Towns that became seats of bishoprics in the twentieth century, such as <!--del_lnk--> Chelmsford, <!--del_lnk--> Guildford, and <!--del_lnk--> Blackburn, were not automatically granted city status. However, well into the twentieth century it was often assumed that the presence of a cathedral was sufficient to elevate a town to city status, and that for cathedral cities the city charters were recognising its city status rather than granting it. On this basis, the <!--del_lnk--> 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica said that <!--del_lnk--> Southwell (diocese established 1884) and <!--del_lnk--> St Asaph (an historic diocese) are cities. These towns were never granted letters patent recognising this by the Crown, and so when the letters patent became the important criterion they were no longer generally considered cities.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1911 an application for city status by <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> was refused. Explaining the <!--del_lnk--> Home Secretary&#39;s reason for not recommending the King to approve the petition, the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Advocate stated: <i>&quot;..during the reign of his late Majesty it was found necessary, in order to maintain the value of the distinction, to lay down a rule as to the minimum population which should ordinarily, in connexion with other considerations, be regarded as qualifying a borough for that higher status.&quot;</i><p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1927 a <!--del_lnk--> Royal Commission on Local Government was examining local authority areas and functions in England and Wales. The question arose as to which towns were entitled to be called cities, and the chairman, the <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Onslow, wrote to the <!--del_lnk--> Home Office to seek clarification. The Home Office replied with a memorandum which read:<p><i>&quot;The title of a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no connexion with the status of the borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the title of a city and the seat of a bishopric, and the creation of a new see neither constitutes the town concerned a city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.</i><p><i>If a town wishes to obtain the title of a city the proper method of procedure is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. It is the duty of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.&quot;</i><p>A town can now apply for city status by submitting an application to the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chancellor, who makes recommendations to the sovereign. Such competitions are usually held to mark special events, such as <!--del_lnk--> coronations, royal <!--del_lnk--> jubilees or the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium.<p><a id="Lord_Mayors" name="Lord_Mayors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lord Mayors</span></h3>

      <p>Some cities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have the further distinction of having a <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor rather than a simple <!--del_lnk--> Mayor - in Scotland, the equivalent is the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Provost. Lord Mayors have the right to be <!--del_lnk--> styled &quot;The Right Worshipful The Lord Mayor&quot;.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rochester was recognised as a city from 1211 to 1998. On <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1974 the city was abolished, becoming part of the <!--del_lnk--> Borough of Medway, a <!--del_lnk--> local government district in the county of <!--del_lnk--> Kent. However, under <!--del_lnk--> letters patent the area of the former city was to continue to be styled the &quot;City of Rochester&quot; to &quot;perpetuate the ancient name&quot; and to recall &quot;the long history and proud heritage of the said city&quot;. The city was unique, as it had no council or charter trustees and no mayor or civic head. In <!--del_lnk--> 1979 the Borough of Medway was renamed as <!--del_lnk--> Rochester-upon-Medway, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1982 further letters patent transferred the city status to the entire borough. On <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1998, the existing local government districts of Rochester-upon-Medway and <!--del_lnk--> Gillingham were abolished and became the new <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority of <!--del_lnk--> Medway. Since it was the local government district that officially held city status under the <!--del_lnk--> 1982 letters patent, when it was abolished, it also ceased to be a city. The other local government districts with city status that were abolished around this time (<!--del_lnk--> Bath and <!--del_lnk--> Hereford) had decided to appoint <!--del_lnk--> Charter Trustees to maintain the existence of the city and the mayoralty. However, Rochester upon Medway City Council had decided not to. Medway Council apparently only became aware of this when, in 2002, they discovered that Rochester was not on the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chancellor&#39;s Office&#39;s list of cities. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Pretenders" name="Pretenders"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pretenders</span></h3>
      <p>After its unsuccessful attempt to gain city status, the <!--del_lnk--> town of <!--del_lnk--> Reading, Berkshire started using the phrase &quot;City Centre&quot; on its buses and car park signs. In its planning, the government of the day intended <a href="../../wp/m/Milton_Keynes.htm" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> to be a &quot;new city&quot; in scale, it was referred to as such in contemporary supporting papers, but was <!--del_lnk--> gazetted in 1967 as a <!--del_lnk--> New Town. It has used the term &quot;City Centre&quot; on its buses and road signs for many years. Although it has been <!--del_lnk--> county town of <!--del_lnk--> Essex since the 13th century and has a cathedral, <!--del_lnk--> Chelmsford does not have city status: nevertheless it&#39;s local football team calls itself <!--del_lnk--> Chelmsford City F.C..<p><a id="List_of_cities" name="List_of_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">List of cities</span></h2>

      <p>Being a city gives a settlement no special rights other than that of calling itself a city. Nonetheless, this is considered very prestigious and competitions for the status are hard fought.<p>Most cities have &quot;city councils&quot;, which have varying powers depending upon the type of settlement. There are <!--del_lnk--> unitary authorities (including <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan and <!--del_lnk--> London boroughs) that are responsible for all local government services within their area. (The only <!--del_lnk--> London borough having city status is the <!--del_lnk--> City of Westminster). Many cities have ordinary <!--del_lnk--> district councils, which share power with <!--del_lnk--> county councils. At the bottom end of the scale, some cities have <!--del_lnk--> civil parish councils, with no more power than a <!--del_lnk--> village.<p>Some cities have no council at all. Where they used to have a city council but it has been abolished they may have <!--del_lnk--> Charter Trustees, drawn from the local district council, who appoint the mayor and look after the city&#39;s traditions.<p>Most &quot;cities&quot; are not <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">cities</a> in the traditional sense of the word (that is, a large urban area) but are in fact <!--del_lnk--> local government districts that have city status, and which often include large rural areas. For example the <!--del_lnk--> City of Canterbury and <!--del_lnk--> City of Wakefield cover large rural areas. The largest &quot;city&quot; district in terms of area is the <!--del_lnk--> City of Carlisle, which covers some 400 square miles (1040&nbsp;km&sup2;) of mostly rural landscape in the north of England, and is larger than smaller counties such as <!--del_lnk--> Merseyside or <!--del_lnk--> Rutland. The <!--del_lnk--> City of Sheffield contains part of the <!--del_lnk--> Peak District National Park. This is however merely a curiosity and has had no impact on the general usage of the word &quot;city&quot; in the UK, which has unambiguously retained its urban meaning in <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British English</a>. Residents of the rural parts of the &quot;City of Carlisle&quot; and the like might be aware of the name of their local council, but would not consider themselves to be inhabitants of a city with a small &quot;c&quot;.<p>Equally, there are some cities where the local government district is in fact smaller than the historical or natural boundaries of the city. Four examples of this are <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> (where the traditional area associated includes areas of the neighbouring authorities of Trafford, Tameside and Bury), <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> (where suburban areas of the city are located in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire), <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton (areas of the neighbouring authorities of Walsall, Dudley and South Staffordshire) and most obviously, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> (Greater London outside the City of London).<p>This contrasts with the situation in the United States, where the primary meaning of the word &quot;city&quot; is any area contained within <!--del_lnk--> city limits, completely disregarding whether or not that area is recognisable as a traditional &quot;city&quot;.<p>Due to the widespread interest in information about towns and cities, and for comparisons between urban populations and with those living outside towns, the Government at each census produces a report <!--del_lnk--> Key Statistics for Urban Areas that separates the population of the actual town or city from the population of the area controlled by the council bearing its name.<p><a id="City_applications" name="City_applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">City applications</span></h2>
      <p>City status grants have been used to mark special royal and other occasions. <!--del_lnk--> Swansea was granted city status in 1969 to mark the investiture of <!--del_lnk--> Charles, Duke of Cornwall as <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales. At the <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Silver Jubilee in <!--del_lnk--> 1977, <a href="../../wp/d/Derby.htm" title="Derby">Derby</a> was granted the honour. The use of formal competitions for city status is a recent practice. The first competition was held in 1992, to mark the fortieth anniversary of the Queen&#39;s reign. <!--del_lnk--> Sunderland was the winner. In 1994 two historic seats of Bishoprics &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> St David&#39;s and <!--del_lnk--> Armagh &mdash; were granted city status. They had been considered cities historically, but this status had lapsed. For the city applications in 2000, held to celebrate the <!--del_lnk--> millennium, the following towns and boroughs requested city status:<ul>
       <li><i>England</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Blackburn, <a href="../../wp/b/Blackpool.htm" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bolton, <!--del_lnk--> Brighton &amp; Hove, <!--del_lnk--> Chelmsford, <!--del_lnk--> Colchester, <!--del_lnk--> Croydon, <!--del_lnk--> Doncaster, <a href="../../wp/d/Dover.htm" title="Dover">Dover</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Guildford, <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich, <!--del_lnk--> Luton, <!--del_lnk--> Maidstone, <!--del_lnk--> Medway, <!--del_lnk--> Middlesbrough, <a href="../../wp/m/Milton_Keynes.htm" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Northampton, <!--del_lnk--> Preston, <!--del_lnk--> Reading, <!--del_lnk--> Shrewsbury and Atcham, <!--del_lnk--> Southend-on-Sea, <!--del_lnk--> Southwark, <!--del_lnk--> Stockport, <!--del_lnk--> Swindon, <!--del_lnk--> Telford and Wrekin, <!--del_lnk--> Warrington, <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton.<li><i>Wales</i>: <a href="../../wp/a/Aberystwyth.htm" title="Aberystwyth">Aberystwyth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Machynlleth, <!--del_lnk--> Newport, <!--del_lnk--> Newtown, <!--del_lnk--> St Asaph, <!--del_lnk--> Wrexham.<li><i>Scotland</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Ayr, <!--del_lnk--> Inverness, <!--del_lnk--> Paisley, <!--del_lnk--> Stirling.<li><i>Northern Ireland</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Ballymena, <!--del_lnk--> Lisburn.</ul>
      <p>The three winners were <!--del_lnk--> Brighton &amp; Hove, <!--del_lnk--> Wolverhampton, and <!--del_lnk--> Inverness.<p>For the 2002 applications, held to celebrate the Queen&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Golden Jubilee, the entrants included all of the above towns except <!--del_lnk--> Southwark, together with <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich and <!--del_lnk--> Wirral in England, <!--del_lnk--> Dumfries in Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> Carrickfergus, <!--del_lnk--> Coleraine, <!--del_lnk--> Craigavon and <!--del_lnk--> Newry in Northern Ireland. There was controversy in the rest of the UK &mdash; especially in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> &mdash; over the fact that two of the three winners of the 2000 competition were <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> towns, so 2002 was run as four separate competitions. The winners in Great Britain were <!--del_lnk--> Preston in England, <!--del_lnk--> Newport in Wales, and <!--del_lnk--> Stirling in Scotland. In <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> it was decided to award city status to two entrants: <!--del_lnk--> Lisburn (predominantly unionist) and <!--del_lnk--> Newry (predominantly nationalist) so that offence would not be caused to either community. <!--del_lnk--> Exeter was awarded Lord Mayoralty status in a separate application.<p><a id="Cathedral_towns" name="Cathedral_towns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cathedral towns</span></h2>

      <p>Now that being the seat of a <!--del_lnk--> Church of England diocese is no longer sufficient (or necessary) to become a city, there are a number of cathedral towns.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> national church of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland, is <!--del_lnk--> presbyterian in governance with no <!--del_lnk--> bishops or <!--del_lnk--> dioceses, and thus has <!--del_lnk--> high kirks rather than <!--del_lnk--> cathedrals. However the pre-<!--del_lnk--> Reformation and modern <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic dioceses, and the modern dioceses of the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Episcopal_Church.htm" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>, do have extant cathedrals. There are three towns in Scotland that have Episcopal cathedrals but do not have city status &mdash; Millport, <!--del_lnk--> Oban and <!--del_lnk--> Perth. Perth is often called a city, the <i>fair city of Perth</i>, but Oban is not. Additionally, <!--del_lnk--> Brechin and <!--del_lnk--> Elgin are often referred to as cities, as they had pre-Reformation cathedrals. In the past Elgin, Brechin and Perth were all cities.<p><!--del_lnk--> Stirling, which was awarded city status in 2002, has never had an Episcopal or Catholic cathedral.<p><a id="Large_towns" name="Large_towns"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Large towns</span></h2>
      <p>As noted above, in ordinary discourse, &quot;city&quot; can refer to any large settlement, with no fixed limit.<p>There are certain towns which have large urban areas, which could qualify for city status on the grounds of their population size. Some have applied for city status and had the application turned down. Northampton is one of the most populous urban districts not to be a London Borough, metropolitan borough or city; on this basis the council claims that it is the largest town in England.<p>At every census the government produces the report <!--del_lnk--> Key Statistics for Urban Areas which shows that the following are the largest nine urban sub-areas outside London not a part of a city or having a city as a component:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Reading &mdash; 232,662<li><!--del_lnk--> Dudley &mdash; 194,919<li><!--del_lnk--> Northampton &mdash; 189,474<li><!--del_lnk--> Luton &mdash; 185,543<li><a href="../../wp/m/Milton_Keynes.htm" title="Milton Keynes">Milton Keynes</a> (urban area) &mdash; 184,506<li><!--del_lnk--> Walsall &mdash; 170,994<li><!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth &mdash; 167,527<li><!--del_lnk--> Southend-on-Sea &mdash; 160,257<li><!--del_lnk--> Swindon &mdash; 155,432</ul>
      <p>See <!--del_lnk--> List of English cities by population for further such examples in England.<p>It should be noted that city status is usually not granted to urban areas, but to local government areas such as civil parishes and boroughs, the boundaries, and hence populations, of which are not necessarily the same. The <!--del_lnk--> City of Stirling and the <!--del_lnk--> City of Inverness provide counterexamples here. <!--del_lnk--> Stirling Council&#39;s application for city status was specifically for the urban area of the (now former) <!--del_lnk--> Royal Burgh of Stirling - proposed city boundaries were included, and so not all of the <!--del_lnk--> council area has city status.<p>This leads to the oddity whereby city status can be granted to areas that are not generally regarded as towns.
