      <p>The <b>Chew Valley</b> is an area in North <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, named after the <!--del_lnk--> River Chew, which rises at <!--del_lnk--> Chewton Mendip, and joins the <!--del_lnk--> River Avon at <!--del_lnk--> Keynsham. Technically, the area of the valley is bounded by the <!--del_lnk--> water catchment area of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas, for example, <!--del_lnk--> Blagdon Lake and its environs, which by a stricter definition are part of the <!--del_lnk--> Yeo Valley. The valley is an area of rich <a href="../../wp/a/Arable_land.htm" title="Arable land">arable</a> and <!--del_lnk--> dairy farmland, interspersed with a number of <!--del_lnk--> villages.<p>The landscape consists of the valley of the River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from <!--del_lnk--> Dundry Down to the north, the <!--del_lnk--> Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the <a href="../../wp/m/Mendip_Hills.htm" title="Mendip Hills">Mendip Hills</a> to the south and the <!--del_lnk--> Hinton Blewett, <!--del_lnk--> Marksbury and <!--del_lnk--> Newton Saint Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley&#39;s boundary generally follows the top of <!--del_lnk--> scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create <a href="../../wp/c/Chew_Valley_Lake.htm" title="Chew Valley Lake">Chew Valley Lake</a>, which provides <a href="../../wp/d/Drinking_water.htm" title="Drinking water">drinking water</a> for the nearby city of <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its <!--del_lnk--> nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.<p>The area falls into the domains of several councils including: <!--del_lnk--> Bath and North East Somerset, <!--del_lnk--> North Somerset and <!--del_lnk--> Mendip. Some of the area falls within the <a href="../../wp/m/Mendip_Hills.htm" title="Mendip Hills">Mendip Hills</a> <!--del_lnk--> AONB. Most of the undeveloped area is within the Bristol/<!--del_lnk--> Bath <!--del_lnk--> Green Belt. Many of the villages date back to the time of the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a> and there is evidence of human occupation since the <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a>. There are hundreds of <!--del_lnk--> listed buildings with many of the churches being Grade I listed.<p>

      <p>There is no clear origin for the name &quot;Chew&quot;, found scarcely anywhere else; however, there have been several explanations of the <!--del_lnk--> etymology, including &quot;winding water&quot;, the &#39;ew&#39; being a variant of the French <i>eau</i>, meaning water. The word <i>chewer</i> is a western dialect for a narrow passage, and <i>chare</i> is Old English for turning. Many believe that the name Chew began in Normandy as <i>Cheux</i>, and came to England with the Norman Conquest during the eleventh century. However, some people agree with Ekwall&#39;s interpretation that it is derived from the Welsh <i>cyw</i> meaning &quot;the young of an animal, or chicken&quot;, so that <i>afon Cyw</i> would have been &quot;the river of the chickens&quot;. Other possible explanations suggest it comes from the Old English word <i>ceo</i>, `fish gill&#39;, used in the transferred sense of a ravine, in a similar way to Old Norse <i>gil</i>, or possibly a derogatory nickname from Middle English <i>chowe</i> `chough&#39;, Old English <i>ceo</i>, a bird closely related to the crow and the jackdaw, notorious for its chattering and thieving.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Many of the villages in the valley have their own <!--del_lnk--> parish councils which have some responsibility for local issues. They also elect councillors to district councils e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Mendip and <!--del_lnk--> Somerset County Council or unitary authorities e.g. Bath and North East Somerset or <!--del_lnk--> North Somerset, which have wider responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism etc.<p>Each of the villages is also part of a constituency, either <!--del_lnk--> Wansdyke (which will become <!--del_lnk--> North East Somerset) or <!--del_lnk--> Woodspring (which is to become <!--del_lnk--> North Somerset), each of which elects one <!--del_lnk--> MP to the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">Westminster Parliament</a>. The area is also part of the <!--del_lnk--> South West England (European Parliament constituency) which elects seven members to the European Parliament. <!--del_lnk--> Avon and Somerset Constabulary provides police services to the area.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The western end of the area of the area (around <!--del_lnk--> Nempnett Thrubwell) consists of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a>, <!--del_lnk--> shale and <!--del_lnk--> Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic Mudstones of the <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous period</a>, is found in the adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic period</a>. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods.  The main geological outcrops around the lake are <!--del_lnk--> Mudstone, largely consisting of red <!--del_lnk--> Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. There are also bands of <!--del_lnk--> Sandstone of the <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> period, that contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent <!--del_lnk--> alluvial deposits beside the course of the <!--del_lnk--> River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250&ndash;770&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to sometimes give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the <!--del_lnk--> Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the <!--del_lnk--> Jurassic period found on the higher ground around <!--del_lnk--> Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with many of the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised with several sites including; <!--del_lnk--> Barns Batch Spinney, <!--del_lnk--> Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and <!--del_lnk--> Dundry Main Road South Quarry being recognised as <!--del_lnk--> Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest.<p>The oldest geological formation in the valley is the Supra- Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and is represented by the <!--del_lnk--> Pensford Syncline <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> basin. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around <!--del_lnk--> Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to the eastern part of the area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around <!--del_lnk--> Clutton and <!--del_lnk--> High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the <!--del_lnk--> River Chew flows through <!--del_lnk--> Publow, <!--del_lnk--> Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the <!--del_lnk--> River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.<p><a id="Natural_history" name="Natural_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Natural history</span></h3>

      <p>The valley has several areas designated as <!--del_lnk--> Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for biological interest including; <!--del_lnk--> Blagdon Lake, <!--del_lnk--> Burledge Hill, Chew Valley Lake, <!--del_lnk--> Compton Martin Ochre Mine, <!--del_lnk--> Harptree Combe and two sites at <!--del_lnk--> Folly Farm.<p><a id="Flora" name="Flora"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Flora</span></h4>
      <p>The small and medium-sized fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of <!--del_lnk--> enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Hedgerows support the nationally rare <!--del_lnk--> bithynian vetch (<i>Vicia bithynica</i>). Mature <!--del_lnk--> oak (<i>Quercus</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> ash (<i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of <!--del_lnk--> scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) and <a href="../../wp/c/Chestnut.htm" title="Chestnut">Chestnuts</a> (<i>Castanea sativa</i>). Many <!--del_lnk--> elm (<i>Ulmus</i>) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.<p><a id="Fauna" name="Fauna"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Fauna</span></h4>
      <p>Wildlife abounds in the valley, particularly the water birds around the rivers and lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including <!--del_lnk--> ducks, <!--del_lnk--> shoveler (<i>Anas clypeata</i>), <!--del_lnk--> gadwall (<i>Anas strepera</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> great crested grebes (<i>Podiceps cristatus</i>)  a wide variety of other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as <!--del_lnk--> tits (<i>Paridae</i>) and <a href="../../wp/w/Wren.htm" title="Wren">wrens</a> (<i>Troglodytidae</i>) to <a href="../../wp/m/Mistle_Thrush.htm" title="Mistle Thrush">Mistle Thrush</a> (<i>Turdidae</i>). Larger birds include <a href="../../wp/w/Woodpecker.htm" title="Woodpecker">Woodpeckers</a> (<i>Picidae</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Common Buzzard (<i>Buteo buteo</i>).<p>The valley also has a wide variety of small mammals with larger species including; <!--del_lnk--> Eurasian Badger (<i>Meles meles</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Deer (<i>Cervidae</i>). The valley is also home to fifteen of the sixteen <!--del_lnk--> bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for <!--del_lnk--> Greater Horseshoe Bats (<i>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</i>). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the <!--del_lnk--> Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 <!--del_lnk--> European Community Habitats Directive.<p><a id="Human_habitation" name="Human_habitation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Human habitation</span></h3>

Almost all of the villages have churches dating back to the fifteenth or sixteenth Century.<p>The area around <!--del_lnk--> Pensford was an important <!--del_lnk--> coal mining area during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with much of the coal being carried on the <!--del_lnk--> Somerset Coal Canal, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the <!--del_lnk--> River Chew on the surviving distinctive <!--del_lnk--> viaduct at <!--del_lnk--> Pensford and on to <!--del_lnk--> Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">flooding</a> during the storm of <!--del_lnk--> 10 July <!--del_lnk--> 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around <!--del_lnk--> Pensford and Keynsham.<p><a id="Field_patterns" name="Field_patterns"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Field patterns</span></h4>
      <p>The small fields in the western part of the area are particularly characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late <!--del_lnk--> medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around <!--del_lnk--> Nempnett Thrubwell, south of <!--del_lnk--> Bishop Sutton and west and south of <!--del_lnk--> Chelwood.<div class="center">

      <p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>Along with the rest of <!--del_lnk--> South West England, the Chew Valley has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is approximately 10&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (50&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F)and shows a seasonal and a <!--del_lnk--> diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 and 2&nbsp;&deg;C (34&ndash;36&nbsp;&deg;F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 &deg;C (70&nbsp;&deg;F). In general December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England has a favoured location with respect to the <!--del_lnk--> Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. <!--del_lnk--> Convective cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and acts to reduce sunshine amounts. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. <!--del_lnk--> Rainfall tends to be associated with <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic <!--del_lnk--> depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower <a href="../../wp/c/Cloud.htm" title="Cloud">clouds</a> and a large proportion of rainfall falls from showers and <!--del_lnk--> thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800-900 millimetres (31&ndash;35&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in). About 8-15 days of <!--del_lnk--> snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">wind</a> speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.<p><a id="Population_and_demographics" name="Population_and_demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Population and demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Many of the large houses in the valley have been built or bought by wealthy merchants from Bristol and Bath with many of the local people working for their households. <!--del_lnk--> Bess of Hardwick (1527&ndash;1606) is known to have lived in <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Court, <!--del_lnk--> Stowey for a few years in the sixteenth century, after the death of her first husband Sir <!--del_lnk--> William Cavendish, when she married Sir <!--del_lnk--> William St. Loe (or Sentloe or St. Lowe), captain of the guard to <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, Chief Butler of England, and owner of several manors within the valley and surrounding areas. Around this period a close neighbour was <!--del_lnk--> Sir John Popham (1533&ndash;1607) who was judge and the <a href="../../wp/s/Speaker_of_the_British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="Speaker of the British House of Commons">Speaker of Parliament</a>. In the seventeenth century <a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> (1632&ndash;1704) an eminent <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> lived in <!--del_lnk--> Belluton and his house is still known as John Locke&#39;s cottage. In the eighteenth century the <!--del_lnk--> poet <!--del_lnk--> John Langhorne (1735&ndash;1779) became the <!--del_lnk--> curate at <!--del_lnk--> Blagdon around the time that <!--del_lnk--> Augustus Montague Toplady (1740&ndash;1778) was the priest, and <!--del_lnk--> William Smith moved to the valley to make a valuation survey of an estate. He stayed there for the next eight years, working first for Webb and later for the <!--del_lnk--> Somersetshire Coal Canal Company.<p>During the nineteenth century <!--del_lnk--> aristocrat <!--del_lnk--> George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton (1817&ndash;1876) was a resident. His seat was at <a href="../../wp/c/Chew_Magna.htm" title="Chew Magna">Chew Magna</a>, where <!--del_lnk--> John Sanger, the circus proprietor, was born in 1816. <!--del_lnk--> William Rees-Mogg, former editor of <!--del_lnk--> The Times, took the title Baron Rees-Mogg, of <!--del_lnk--> Hinton Blewitt, but no longer lives in the village. <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> <!--del_lnk--> clarinetist <!--del_lnk--> Acker Bilk lives in <!--del_lnk--> Pensford. <!--del_lnk--> Richard Brock the <!--del_lnk--> natural history film producer, <!--del_lnk--> Liam Fox a <!--del_lnk--> conservative <!--del_lnk--> politician and <!--del_lnk--> Dr Phil Hammond a <!--del_lnk--> GP and <!--del_lnk--> comedian also live in the valley. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Hunter of the <!--del_lnk--> Grateful Dead lived in <!--del_lnk--> Pensford from 1979-1981.<p>In the past many of the population worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and some in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2001 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in some isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1-4% of all economically active people aged 16-74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.<p><a id="Buildings_and_settlements" name="Buildings_and_settlements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Buildings and settlements</span></h2>

      <p>Many of the villages are at the points where it was possible to cross the <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> and <!--del_lnk--> streams. Chew Magna is the business centre with a range of shops, <!--del_lnk--> banks etc. Many other villages have local shops, often combined with <!--del_lnk--> post offices. Most villages have <!--del_lnk--> pubs and <!--del_lnk--> village halls which provide the majority of the social activity.<p>The traditional building material is white Lias <!--del_lnk--> Limestone; sometimes incorporating red <!--del_lnk--> sandstone or conglomerate, with red clay tiled roofs. Buildings, particularly the churches, date back many hundreds of years, for example those at <!--del_lnk--> Marksbury and <!--del_lnk--> Compton Martin; the latter incorporating a <!--del_lnk--> columbarium.<p><a id="Listed_buildings" name="Listed_buildings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Listed buildings</span></h3>

The authority for listing is granted by the <!--del_lnk--> Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and is presently administered by <!--del_lnk--> English Heritage, an agency of the <!--del_lnk--> Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport. Grade I covers buildings of exceptional interest, Grade II* particularly important buildings of special interest and Grade II buildings of special interest. Listed buildings in the valley number five churches dating back to the fourteenth century or even earlier, with grade I status; Church of St Andrew at Chew Magna, Church of St. Bartholomew at <!--del_lnk--> Ubley, Church of St James at <!--del_lnk--> Cameley, Church of St. Margaret at Hinton Blewitt and Church of St Michael the Archangel at Compton Martin.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>At the western end of the valley is the <!--del_lnk--> A38 and <!--del_lnk--> Bristol International Airport, which means parts of the valley are on the flight path. The valley is also crossed by the <!--del_lnk--> A37 and they are joined by the <!--del_lnk--> A368. Most of the roads in the valley are small single track lanes with little traffic although a bottleneck often occurs within Chew Magna. The &quot;Chew Valley Explorer&quot; bus route 672/674 provides access to many of the villages in the valley. Cyclists can gain access via part of the <!--del_lnk--> Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, <!--del_lnk--> National Cycle Network Route 3.<p><a id="Schools" name="Schools"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Schools</span></h2>
      <p>Chew Valley School  is the main <!--del_lnk--> secondary school (11-18 years) for the valley.
