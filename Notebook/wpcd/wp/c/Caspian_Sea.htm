      <p>The <b>Caspian Sea</b> is the largest <!--del_lnk--> lake on Earth by both <!--del_lnk--> area and <!--del_lnk--> volume, with a surface area of 371,000 <!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (143,244&nbsp;mi&sup2;) and a volume of 78,200 <!--del_lnk--> cubic kilometres (18,761&nbsp;mi&sup3;). It is a <!--del_lnk--> landlocked <!--del_lnk--> endorheic body of water and lies between <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It has a maximum depth of about 1025 meters (3,363 ft). It is called a sea because when the Romans arrived for their first time, they tasted the water and found it to be salty. It has a <!--del_lnk--> salinity of approximately 1.2%, about a third the <!--del_lnk--> salinity of <!--del_lnk--> sea water.<p>

      <p>The sea is estimated to be about 30 million years old. It became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago. Discoveries in the Huto cave near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Behshahr, <!--del_lnk--> Mazandaran, (Southern land of Caspian Sea) suggest human habitation of the area as early as 75,000 years ago.<sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup><p>In <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity it was called the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hyrcanian Ocean</i>. It has also been known as the <i><a href="../../wp/k/Khazars.htm" title="Khazar">Khazar</a> Sea</i>. In Persian antiquity, as well as in modern <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, it is known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mazandaran Sea</i>. Old Russian sources call it the <i>Khvalyn (Khvalynian) Sea</i> after the Khvalis, inhabitants of <!--del_lnk--> Khwarezmia. Ancient Arabic sources refer to <i>Bahr-e-Qazvin</i> &ndash; the <i><!--del_lnk--> Qazvin Sea</i>. The word Caspian is derived from the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Caspi, an ancient people that lived to the west of the sea in <!--del_lnk--> Transcaucasia.<p>Historical cities by the sea include<ul>

      <p>The Caspian Sea holds great numbers of <!--del_lnk--> sturgeon, which yield eggs that are processed into <!--del_lnk--> caviar. In recent years overfishing has threatened the sturgeon population to the point that <!--del_lnk--> environmentalists advocate banning sturgeon fishing completely until the population recovers. However, prices for sturgeon caviar are so high that fisherman can afford to pay similarly high bribes to authorities to look the other way, making regulations in many locations ineffective.<sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup> Caviar harvesting further endangers the fish stocks, since it targets reproductive females.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Caspian Seal (<i>Phoca caspica</i>, <i>Pusa caspica</i> in some sources) is <!--del_lnk--> endemic to the Caspian Sea, one of very few <!--del_lnk--> seal species living in inland waters (see also <!--del_lnk--> Baikal Seal).<p>The area has given its name to several species of birds, including the <!--del_lnk--> Caspian Gull and the <!--del_lnk--> Caspian Tern.<p>There are several species of fish endemic to the Caspian sea, including <!--del_lnk--> Kutum (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Caspian White Fish), Caspian <!--del_lnk--> Roach, <!--del_lnk--> Bream, and a species of <!--del_lnk--> salmon. Caspian <!--del_lnk--> Salmon is critically endangered.<p><a id="Oil" name="Oil"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Oil</span></h2>
      <p>The area is rich in energy wealth. As well as recently discovered <!--del_lnk--> oil fields, large natural gas supplies are also in evidence, though further exploration is needed to define their full potential. Geopolitical jockeying is taking place amongst Caspian-bordering countries, especially in the light of Middle East instability and the subsequent recasting of many Western countries&#39; energy policies. Another factor influencing this is the new US military deployment to the Central Asian region.<p>A key problem is the status of the Caspian Sea and the establishment of the water boundaries among the five littoral countries. Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan signed an agreement in 2003 to divide the northern 64% of the sea among themselves, although the other two bordering countries, Iran and Turkmenistan, did not agree to this. This is likely to result in the three agreeing nations proceeding with oil development regardless; Iranian and Turkmen development is likely to stall.<p>At present, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have seen the biggest increase in oil production, an increase of 70% since 1992. Despite this, the region is still achieving less than potential output, with total regional production 1.6 million barrels (250,000 m&sup3;) per day, roughly equal to Brazil&#39;s production. This is expected to triple by 2010.<p>The oil in the Caspian basin is estimated to worth in the region of $12 thousand billion dollars.<p><a id="International_disputes" name="International_disputes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">International disputes</span></h2>

      <p>There are three major issues regulated by the Caspian Sea status: access to mineral resources (<a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>), access for <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and access to <!--del_lnk--> international waters (through <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Volga river and the canals connecting it to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>). Access to the Volga-river is particularly important for the <!--del_lnk--> landlocked states of <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>. This issue is of course sensitive to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, because this potential traffic will move through its territory (albeit onto the inland <!--del_lnk--> waterways). If a body of water is labeled as <a href="../../wp/s/Sea.htm" title="Sea">Sea</a> then there would be some precedents and international treaties obliging the granting of access permits to foreign vessels. If a body of water is labeled merely as <!--del_lnk--> lake then there are no such obligations. <!--del_lnk--> Environmental issues are also somewhat connected to the status and <!--del_lnk--> borders issue. It should be mentioned that <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> got the bulk of the former Soviet Caspian military fleet (and also currently has the most powerful military presence in the Caspian Sea). Some assets were assigned to <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and especially <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> got a very small share (because they lack major port cities).<ul>
       <li>According to a <!--del_lnk--> treaty signed between the <!--del_lnk--> Persians (predecessor of today&#39;s Iran) and the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire the Caspian Sea is technically a lake and it is to be divided into two sectors (Persian and Russian), but the resources (then mainly <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>) would be commonly shared. The line between the two sectors was to be seen as an international border in a common <!--del_lnk--> lake (like <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Albert.htm" title="Lake Albert">Lake Albert</a>). Also the Russian sector was sub-divided into administrative sectors of the four <!--del_lnk--> littoral republics.<li>After the dissolution of the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Union not all of the <!--del_lnk--> newly independent states assumed continuation of the old treaty. At first <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> announced that they would continue to adhere to the old treaty (but they don&#39;t have a common border any more, so this is practically impossible). <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> announced that they do not consider themselves parties to this treaty.<li>Later followed some proposals for common agreement between all littoral states about the status of the sea. <ul>
         <li><a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> insisted that the sectors should be based on the <!--del_lnk--> median line, thus giving each state a share proportional to its Caspian <!--del_lnk--> coastline length. Also the sectors would form part of the sovereign territory of the particular state (thus making them international borders and also allowing each state to deal with all resources within its sector as it wishes unilaterally).<li><a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> insisted that the sectors should be such that each state gets a 1/5th share of the whole Caspian Sea. This was advantageous to Iran, because it has a proportionally smaller coastline.<li><a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> proposed a somewhat compromising solution: the seabed (and thus mineral resources) to be divided along sectoral lines (along the two above-described variants), the surface (and thus fishing rights) to be shared between all states (with the following variations: the whole surface to be commonly shared; each state to receive an exclusive zone and one single common zone in the centre to be shared. The second variant is deemed not practical, because of the small size of the whole sea).</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Current situation</ul>
      <p><a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> have agreed to a solution about their sectors. There are no problems between <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, but the latter is not actively participating, so there is no agreement either. <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> is at odds with <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> over some <!--del_lnk--> oil fields that the both states claim. There have been occasions where Iranian patrol boats have opened fire at vessels sent by Azerbaijan for exploration into the disputed region. There are similar tensions between <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> (the latter claims that the former has pumped more oil than agreed from a field, recognized by both parties as shared). Less acute are the issues between <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Regardless, the southern part of the sea remains disputed.<ul>
       <li>
        <ul>
         <li><a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> signed a treaty, according to which, they divide the northern part of the Caspian Sea between them into two sectors along the median line. Each sector is an exclusive zone of its state. Thus all resources, seabed and surface are exclusive to the particular state.<li><a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> signed a similar treaty about their common border.<li><a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> signed a similar treaty about their common border.<li><a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> doesn&#39;t recognize the bilateral agreements between the other littoral states, but this has limited practical implications, because it doesn&#39;t have common borders with <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. Also <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> continues to insist on a single multilateral agreement between all five littoral states (as the only way to achieve 1/5-th share).<li>The position of <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> is unclear.</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>After <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> adopted the <!--del_lnk--> median line sectoral division and the three treaties already signed between some littoral states this is looking like the realistic method for regulating the Caspian borders. The Russian sector is fully defined. The Kazakhstan sector is not fully defined, but is not disputed either. Azerbaijan&#39;s, Turkmenistan&#39;s and Iran&#39;s sectors are not fully defined.

It is often listed as the world&#39;s largest lake, though it is not a <!--del_lnk--> freshwater lake.<p>The <a href="../../wp/v/Volga_River.htm" title="Volga River">Volga River</a> (about 80% of the inflow) and the <!--del_lnk--> Ural River discharge into the Caspian Sea, but it is <!--del_lnk--> endorheic, i.e. there is no natural outflow (other than by <!--del_lnk--> evaporation) except the <!--del_lnk--> Manych Canal. Thus the Caspian <!--del_lnk--> ecosystem is a <!--del_lnk--> closed basin, with its own sea level history that is independent of the <!--del_lnk--> eustatic level of the world&#39;s oceans. The Caspian became landlocked about 5.5 million years ago. The level of the Caspian has fallen and risen, often rapidly, many times over the centuries. Some Russian historians claim that a <!--del_lnk--> medieval rising of the Caspian caused the coastal towns of <a href="../../wp/k/Khazars.htm" title="Khazaria">Khazaria</a>, such as <!--del_lnk--> Atil, to flood. In 2004, the water level is -28 metres, or 28 metres (92 feet) below <!--del_lnk--> sea level.<p>Over the centuries, Caspian Sea levels have changed in synchronicity with the estimated discharge of the Volga, which in turn depends on rainfall levels in its vast catchment basin. Precipitation is related to variations in the amount of North Atlantic depressions that reach the interior, and they in turn are affected by cycles of the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Oscillation. Thus levels in the Caspian sea relate to atmospheric conditions in the North Atlantic thousands of miles to the north and west. These factors make the Caspian Sea a valuable place to study the causes and effects of global climate change.<p>The last short-term sea-level cycle started with a sea-level fall of 3 m from 1929 to 1977, followed by a rise of 3 m from 1977 until 1995. Since then smaller oscillations have taken place<!--del_lnk--> . These changes have caused major environmental problems<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p>Several scheduled <!--del_lnk--> ferry services operate on the Caspian Sea, including:<ul>
       <li>line between <!--del_lnk--> Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan (formerly Krasnovodsk) and <!--del_lnk--> Baku<li>line between Baku and <!--del_lnk--> Aktau</ul>

      <p>The northern part of the Caspian Sea freezes during winter. In the coldest winters ice can also be found at south. When weather is not as harsh icebanks can form in the shallow waters neighbouring the coast.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea&quot;</div>
