      <p><b>Cleveland</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> county seat of <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> state of <!--del_lnk--> Ohio. The municipality is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of <!--del_lnk--> Lake Erie, approximately 60&nbsp;miles (100&nbsp;km) west of the <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga River, and became a <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> centre owing to its location at the head of numerous <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canals</a> and <!--del_lnk--> railroad lines. With the decline of heavy manufacturing, Cleveland&#39;s businesses have diversified into the <!--del_lnk--> service economy, including the financial services, insurance, and healthcare sectors.<p>As of the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 Census, the city proper had a total population of 478,403, making it the 33rd largest city in the nation and the second largest city in Ohio. Recent estimates from the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau show it to currently be the 36th largest in the nation. It is the centre of <!--del_lnk--> Greater Cleveland, the largest <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area in Ohio, which spans several counties and is defined in several different ways by the Census Bureau. The Cleveland-<!--del_lnk--> Elyria-<!--del_lnk--> Mentor <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Statistical Area has 2,250,871 people and is the 23rd largest in the country. Cleveland is also part of the larger Cleveland-<!--del_lnk--> Akron-Elyria <!--del_lnk--> Combined Statistical Area, which is the 14th largest in the country with a population of 2,945,831 according to the 2000 Census.<p>City residents and tourists benefit from investments made by wealthy residents in the city&#39;s heyday, in arts and cultural institutions, and philanthropy also helped to establish a robust <!--del_lnk--> public library system in the city. More recent investments have provided the city with tourist attractions in the downtown area, such as <!--del_lnk--> Jacobs Field, the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and <!--del_lnk--> Playhouse Square Centre. In studies conducted by <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i> in 2005, Cleveland and <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh were ranked as the most <!--del_lnk--> livable cities in the United States, and the city was ranked as the best city for business meetings in the continental U.S. Nevertheless, the city faces continuing challenges, in particular from concentrated poverty in some neighborhoods and difficulties in the funding and delivering of high-quality <!--del_lnk--> public education.<p>Residents of Cleveland are usually referred to as <i><!--del_lnk--> Clevelanders</i>. Nicknames used for the city include <i><!--del_lnk--> The Forest City</i>, <i>Metropolis of the Western Reserve</i>, <i>The New American City</i>, <i>America&#39;s North Coast</i>, <i>Sixth City,</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> C-Town</i>. Its <!--del_lnk--> 20 sister cities include <!--del_lnk--> Volgograd, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>; <a href="../../wp/b/Bratislava.htm" title="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Slovakia.htm" title="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Ljubljana, <a href="../../wp/s/Slovenia.htm" title="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Miskolc, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>; <a href="../../wp/b/Bangalore.htm" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>; <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>; and most recently <!--del_lnk--> Fier, <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>.<p>

      <p>Cleveland obtained its name on <!--del_lnk--> July 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1796 when surveyors of the <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut Land Company laid out <!--del_lnk--> Connecticut&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Western Reserve into townships and a capital city they named &quot;Cleaveland&quot; after their leader, General <!--del_lnk--> Moses Cleaveland. Cleaveland oversaw the plan for the modern downtown area, centering on the <!--del_lnk--> Public Square, before returning home, never again to visit Ohio. The first settler in Cleveland was Lorenzo Carter, who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on <!--del_lnk--> December 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1814. The spelling of the city&#39;s name was later changed to &quot;Cleveland&quot; when, in 1831, an &quot;a&quot; was dropped so the name could fit a newspaper&#39;s masthead.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Though not initially apparent the location proved providential, despite being adjacent to swampy lowlands and experiencing harsh winters. The city began to grow rapidly after the completion of the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio and Erie Canal in 1832, turning the city into a key link between the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio River and the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, connecting by water the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> St. Lawrence Seaway to the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> via the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>. Cleveland&#39;s growth continued even more once <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railroad</a> links were later added. The rapid growth resulted in Cleveland&#39;s incorporation as a city in 1836.<p>In 1837 the city, then located only on the eastern banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga River, nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring <!--del_lnk--> Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two. Ohio City remained an independent municipality until it was <!--del_lnk--> annexed by Cleveland in 1854. As a halfway point for <!--del_lnk--> iron ore coming from <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> across the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and for <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and other raw materials coming by rail from the south, the site flourished. Cleveland became one of the major <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and population centers of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, and was home to numerous major <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> firms. <!--del_lnk--> Standard Oil founder <!--del_lnk--> John D. Rockefeller made his fortune there, and by 1920, it was the fifth largest city in the country. The city was also one of the centers of the national <!--del_lnk--> progressive movement, headed locally by Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Tom L. Johnson. Many Clevelanders of this era are buried in the historic <!--del_lnk--> Lake View Cemetery, along with <!--del_lnk--> James A. Garfield, the 20th <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a>.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In commemoration of the <!--del_lnk--> centennial of Cleveland&#39;s incorporation as a city, the <!--del_lnk--> Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the <!--del_lnk--> Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city hit hard by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, it drew 4 million visitors in its first season, and 7 million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Lakes Science Centre, the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and <!--del_lnk--> Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.<p>Immediately after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the city experienced a brief boom. In sports, the Indians won the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 World Series and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s. Businesses proclaimed that Cleveland was the &quot;best location in the nation&quot;. The city&#39;s population reached its peak of 914,808, and in 1949 Cleveland was named an <!--del_lnk--> All-America City for the first time. By the 1960s, however, heavy industries began to slump and residents sought new housing in the suburbs, reflecting the national trends of <!--del_lnk--> white flight and <!--del_lnk--> urban sprawl. Like other major U.S. cities, Cleveland also began witnessing racial unrest, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Hough Riots on <!--del_lnk--> July 18&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> July 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1966 and the <!--del_lnk--> Glenville Shootout on <!--del_lnk--> July 23&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> July 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1968. The city&#39;s nadir is often considered to be its <!--del_lnk--> default on its loans on <!--del_lnk--> December 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1978, when under Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Kucinich it became the first major American city to enter default since the Great Depression. National media began referring to Cleveland as &quot;the mistake by the lake&quot; around this time in reference to the city&#39;s financial difficulties, a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River (where industrial waste on the river&#39;s surface caught on fire) and its struggling professional sports teams. The city has worked to shed this nickname ever since, though in recent times the national media have been much kinder to the city, using it as an exemplar for <!--del_lnk--> public-private partnerships, downtown revitalization and urban renaissance.<p>The metropolitan area began a recovery thereafter under Mayors <!--del_lnk--> George Voinovich and <!--del_lnk--> Michael R. White. Redevelopment within the city limits has been strongest in the downtown area near the <!--del_lnk--> Gateway complex&mdash;consisting of <!--del_lnk--> Jacobs Field and <!--del_lnk--> Quicken Loans Arena, and near <!--del_lnk--> North Coast Harbour&mdash;including the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Browns Stadium, and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Lakes Science Centre. Although Cleveland was hailed by the media as the &quot;Comeback City,&quot; many of the inner-city residential neighborhoods remain troubled, and the public school system continues to experience serious problems. <!--del_lnk--> Economic development, <!--del_lnk--> retention of young professionals, and capitalizing upon its waterfront are current municipal priorities.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

Public Square, less than a <!--del_lnk--> mile (2 <!--del_lnk--> km) inland, sits at an elevation of 650&nbsp;feet (198&nbsp;m), and Hopkins Airport, only five miles (8 km) inland from the lake, is at an elevation of 770&nbsp;feet (235&nbsp;m).<p>Cleveland shares borders with the following suburbs: <!--del_lnk--> Bratenahl, <!--del_lnk--> Brook Park, <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn, <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga Heights, <!--del_lnk--> East Cleveland, <!--del_lnk--> Euclid, <!--del_lnk--> Fairview Park, <!--del_lnk--> Garfield Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Lakewood, <!--del_lnk--> Linndale, <!--del_lnk--> Maple Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Newburgh Heights, <!--del_lnk--> Parma, <!--del_lnk--> Shaker Heights, <!--del_lnk--> South Euclid, and <!--del_lnk--> Warrensville Heights.<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>
      <p>Cleveland&#39;s downtown architecture is varied. Many of the city&#39;s government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the Cuyahoga County Courthouse, the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Public Library, and <!--del_lnk--> Public Auditorium are clustered around an open <!--del_lnk--> mall and share a common <!--del_lnk--> neoclassical architecture. Built in the early 20th century, they are the result of the <!--del_lnk--> 1903 <!--del_lnk--> Group Plan, and constitute one of the most complete examples of <!--del_lnk--> City Beautiful design in the United States. The <!--del_lnk--> Terminal Tower, dedicated in <!--del_lnk--> 1930, was the tallest building in the United States outside <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> until <!--del_lnk--> 1967 and the tallest in the city until <!--del_lnk--> 1991. It is a prototypical <!--del_lnk--> Beaux-Arts <!--del_lnk--> skyscraper. The two newer skyscrapers on <!--del_lnk--> Public Square, <!--del_lnk--> Key Tower (currently the tallest building in Ohio) and the <!--del_lnk--> BP Building, combine elements of <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco architecture with <!--del_lnk--> postmodern designs. Another of Cleveland&#39;s architectural treasures is <!--del_lnk--> The Arcade (sometimes called the Old Arcade), a five-story <!--del_lnk--> arcade built in <!--del_lnk--> 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a <!--del_lnk--> Hyatt Regency Hotel.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Running east from Public Square through University Circle is <!--del_lnk--> Euclid Avenue, which at one time rivaled New York&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Avenue for prestige and elegance. Known as &quot;Millionaire&#39;s Row&quot;, Euclid Avenue was world-renowned as the home of such internationally-known names as <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller, <!--del_lnk--> Hanna, and <!--del_lnk--> Hay.<p>The countywide <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Metroparks system, often referred to as the &quot;Emerald Necklace&quot;, includes four parks in Cleveland. In the Big Creek valley sits the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Metroparks Zoo, which contains the largest collection of primates of any zoo in the United States. The other three parks are Brookside Park and parts of the Rocky River and Washington Reservations. Apart from the Metroparks is Cleveland Lakefront State Park, which provides public access to Lake Erie. Among its six parks are Edgewater Park, located between the <!--del_lnk--> Shoreway and Lake Erie just west of downtown, and <!--del_lnk--> Euclid Beach Park and Gordon Park on the east side. The City of Cleveland&#39;s Rockefeller Park, with its many Cultural Gardens honoring the city&#39;s ethnic groups, follows Doan Brook across the city&#39;s east side.<p><a id="Neighborhoods" name="Neighborhoods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neighborhoods</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Downtown Cleveland includes mixed-use neighborhoods such as <!--del_lnk--> the Flats and <!--del_lnk--> the Warehouse District, which are occupied by industrial and office buildings, and also by restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of <!--del_lnk--> condominiums, <!--del_lnk--> lofts, and <!--del_lnk--> apartments has increased over the past ten years.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Cleveland residents often define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east side or the west side of the <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga River. The east side comprises the following neighborhoods: Buckeye-<!--del_lnk--> Shaker Square, Central, <!--del_lnk--> Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid-Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Payne/Goodrich-Kirtland Park, Hough, Kinsman, Lee Harvard/Seville-Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union-Miles Park, <!--del_lnk--> University Circle, <!--del_lnk--> Little Italy, and Woodland Hills. The west side of the city includes the following neighborhoods: Brooklyn Centre, Clark-Fulton, Detroit-Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, <!--del_lnk--> Ohio City, <!--del_lnk--> Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as <!--del_lnk--> West Park: Kamm&#39;s Corners, Jefferson, Puritas-Longmead, and Riverside. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley/Duck Island, <!--del_lnk--> Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont.<p>Several inner-city neighborhoods have begun to <!--del_lnk--> gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been successful in attracting increasing numbers of <!--del_lnk--> creative class members, which in turn is spurring new residential development. Furthermore, a live-work <!--del_lnk--> zoning overlay for the city&#39;s near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east-west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to <!--del_lnk--> Sandusky, but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast. This feature is the principal contributor to the <!--del_lnk--> lake effect snow that is a mainstay of Cleveland (especially east side) weather from mid-November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes, usually in late January or early February. The lake effect causes snowfall totals to range greatly across the city; while Hopkins Airport has only reached 100&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;cm) of snowfall in a given season three times since 1968, seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100&nbsp;inches are not uncommon in an area known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Snow Belt&quot;, extending from the east side of Cleveland proper through the eastern suburbs and up the Lake Erie shore as far as <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo.<p>The all-time record high in Cleveland of 104 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> F (40 &deg;<!--del_lnk--> C) was established on <!--del_lnk--> June 25, <!--del_lnk--> 1988, and the all-time record low of &minus;20 &deg;F (&minus;29 &deg;C) was set on <!--del_lnk--> January 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1994. On average, July is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 71.9 &deg;F (22.2 &deg;C), and January, with a mean temperature of 25.7 &deg;F (&minus;3.5 &deg;C), is the coldest. Normal yearly <!--del_lnk--> precipitation based on the 30-year average from 1971 to 2000 is 38.7&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches (930&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm).<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Cleveland&#39;s location on the <!--del_lnk--> Cuyahoga River and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Erie proved providential in the growth of the city and its industry. Cleveland experienced explosive growth after the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio and Erie Canal, establishing the city as one of the manufacturing centers of America. <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">Steel</a> and many other manufactured goods were major industries.<p>The city was hit hard by the fall of manufacturing, but the city has diversified its economy to include service-based industries. Cleveland is the corporate <!--del_lnk--> headquarters of many large companies such as <!--del_lnk--> National City Corporation, <!--del_lnk--> Eaton Corporation, <!--del_lnk--> Forest City Enterprises, <!--del_lnk--> Sherwin-Williams Company, and <!--del_lnk--> KeyCorp. <!--del_lnk--> NASA maintains a facility in Cleveland, the <!--del_lnk--> Glenn Research Centre. <!--del_lnk--> Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the world, traces its origins to Cleveland, and its Cleveland office remains the firm&#39;s largest.<p>Cleveland has also become a world leader in <!--del_lnk--> health care and <!--del_lnk--> health sciences. The world-famous <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Clinic, the area&#39;s largest employer, is one of the highest-ranked hospitals in the United States as tabulated by <i><!--del_lnk--> U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>. Cleveland&#39;s healthcare industry also includes <!--del_lnk--> University Hospitals of Cleveland, a noted competitor of the Clinic&#39;s which is ranked #25 in cancer care, and <!--del_lnk--> MetroHealth medical centre.<p>Cleveland is emerging as a leader in <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> fuel cell research, led by <!--del_lnk--> Case Western Reserve University, the Cleveland Clinic, and University Hospitals of Cleveland. Cleveland is now one of the top areas in receiving seed money for biotech start-ups and research. Case Western Reserve, the Clinic, and University Hospitals have recently announced plans to build a large biotechnology research centre and <!--del_lnk--> incubator on the site of the former Mt. Sinai Medical Centre, creating a research campus to stimulate biotech <!--del_lnk--> startup companies that can be spun off from research conducted in the city.<p>Additionally, city leaders stepped up efforts to cultivate a technology sector in its economy in the early 2000s. Former Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Jane L. Campbell appointed a &quot;tech czar&quot;, whose job is to actively recruit tech companies to the downtown office market, offering connections to the high-speed fibre networks that run underneath downtown streets in several &quot;high-tech offices&quot; focused on the <!--del_lnk--> Euclid Avenue area. <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland State University hired a Technology Transfer Officer to work full time on cultivating technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area, and recently announced the appointment of a Vice President for Economic Development that will be working to leverage the university&#39;s assets in expanding the city&#39;s economy. Case Western Reserve University is also involved in technology initiatives such as the <!--del_lnk--> OneCommunity project, a high-speed fibre optic network connecting all nonprofits in the area at high speeds, intended to breed collaboration among the area&#39;s major research centers and produce jobs for the city and region. OneCommunity&#39;s work attracted the attention of <!--del_lnk--> Intel and in mid-2005, Cleveland was named an Intel &quot;Worldwide Digital Community&quot; with <!--del_lnk--> Corpus Christi, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and <a href="../../wp/t/Taipei.htm" title="Taipei">Taipei, Taiwan</a>. This distinction will eventually bring to the region around <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>12 million for use in marketing and expanding regional technology partnerships, creating a city-wide <!--del_lnk--> WiFi network, and developing a tech economy. In addition to this Intel initiative, in January 2006 a New York-based think tank, the Intelligent Community Forum, selected Cleveland as one of its seven finalists for the &quot;Intelligent Community of the Year&quot; award, the only city in the United States that was chosen. The group announced that the city was nominated due to the OneCleveland network and its potential broadband applications. OneCommunity is working with <!--del_lnk--> Cisco Systems to deploy a cutting edge wireless network that could eventually blanket the entire city with wireless access to the OneCommunity Network. Cisco is using the network to test various new technologies in wireless &quot;mesh&quot; networking. OneCommunity and Cisco officially launched the first phase of this network in September 2006, blanketing several square miles of University Circle with wireless connectivity.

      <p>Cleveland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> professional sports teams include the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Indians (<!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball), <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Browns (<!--del_lnk--> National Football League), and <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Cavaliers (<!--del_lnk--> National Basketball Association). Annual sporting events held in Cleveland include the <!--del_lnk--> Champ Car <!--del_lnk--> Grand Prix of Cleveland, the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Marathon, the <!--del_lnk--> Mid-American Conference <!--del_lnk--> college basketball tournament and the <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Classic <!--del_lnk--> college football game. The city hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Gravity Games, an <!--del_lnk--> extreme sports series, from 2002 to 2004. Local sporting facilities include <!--del_lnk--> Jacobs Field, <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Browns Stadium, <!--del_lnk--> Quicken Loans Arena, and the CSU <!--del_lnk--> Wolstein Centre. Cleveland will also host both the semifinals and finals of the <!--del_lnk--> 2007 NCAA Women&#39;s Division I Basketball Tournament.<p>Cleveland has long been known as a &quot;<a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a> town&quot;, and the Browns dominated the NFL from <!--del_lnk--> 1950 to <!--del_lnk--> 1955. The city&#39;s franchise is one of the most storied in football, though it last won an <!--del_lnk--> NFL championship in <!--del_lnk--> 1964 and has never appeared in the <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl. The Cleveland Indians last reached the <!--del_lnk--> World Series in <!--del_lnk--> 1995 and <!--del_lnk--> 1997, though they lost to the <!--del_lnk--> Atlanta Braves and <!--del_lnk--> Florida Marlins, respectively, and have not won the series since <!--del_lnk--> 1948. Between 1995 and 2001, Jacobs Field sold out for 455 consecutive games, a Major League Baseball record. The Cleveland Cavaliers are experiencing a renaissance with Cleveland fans due to <!--del_lnk--> LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron and the number one overall <!--del_lnk--> draft pick of 2003. The city&#39;s recent lack of success in sports have earned it a reputation of being a cursed sports city, which <!--del_lnk--> ESPN validated by proclaiming Cleveland as its &quot;most tortured sports city&quot; in 2004.<p>At the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Major League Soccer <!--del_lnk--> All-Star Game in <a href="../../wp/c/Columbus%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus</a>, MLS commissioner <!--del_lnk--> Don Garber announced that Cleveland was one of several top areas in contention for an <!--del_lnk--> expansion team in 2007. Cleveland fielded an <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">NHL</a> team, the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Barons, from <!--del_lnk--> 1976 to <!--del_lnk--> 1978, which was later merged into the <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota North Stars. The city remains without major-league hockey to the present, and the most recent incarnation of the <!--del_lnk--> Barons, the <!--del_lnk--> AHL affiliate of the <!--del_lnk--> San Jose Sharks, moved to <!--del_lnk--> Worcester, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts in 2006. The tradition of professional hockey in Cleveland <!--del_lnk--> stretching back to 1937 is slated to resume in 2007 when an AHL team purchased by Cavaliers owner <!--del_lnk--> Dan Gilbert begins play. Cleveland was also home to the <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Rockers, one of the original eight teams in the <!--del_lnk--> WNBA in 1997. However, in 2003, the team folded after owner <!--del_lnk--> Gordon Gund dropped the team from operation.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>

      <p>The city is home to two <!--del_lnk--> airports. Cleveland <!--del_lnk--> Hopkins International Airport is the city&#39;s major facility and a large <!--del_lnk--> international airport that serves as one of three main <!--del_lnk--> hubs for <!--del_lnk--> Continental Airlines. It holds the distinction of having the first airport-to-downtown rapid transit connection, established in 1968. In 1930, the airport was the site of the first airfield lighting system and the first air traffic <!--del_lnk--> control tower. In addition to Hopkins, Cleveland is served by <!--del_lnk--> Burke Lakefront Airport, on the north shore of downtown between Lake Erie and the <!--del_lnk--> Shoreway. Burke is primarily a commuter and business airport, though a Cleveland-based charter company, <!--del_lnk--> Destination One, returned limited commercial air service to Burke in 2006.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Cleveland, via the <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Limited and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Shore Limited routes, which stop at <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Lakefront Station. Cleveland has also been identified as a hub for the proposed <!--del_lnk--> Ohio Hub project, which would bring <!--del_lnk--> high-speed rail to Northeast Ohio.<p>Cleveland currently has a <!--del_lnk--> bus and <!--del_lnk--> rail <!--del_lnk--> mass transit system operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, also known as &quot;RTA&quot;. The rail portion is officially called the <!--del_lnk--> RTA Rapid Transit, but is better known as <i>The Rapid</i>. It consists of two <!--del_lnk--> light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines, and a <!--del_lnk--> heavy rail line, the Red Line. RTA is currently installing a <!--del_lnk--> bus rapid transit line, coined the &quot;Silver Line&quot;, which will run along <!--del_lnk--> Euclid Avenue from downtown to University Circle.<p>Three two-digit <!--del_lnk--> Interstate highways serve Cleveland directly. <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 71 begins just southwest of downtown and is the major route from downtown Cleveland to the airport. I-71 runs through the southwestern <!--del_lnk--> suburbs and eventually connects Cleveland with <a href="../../wp/c/Columbus%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 77 begins in downtown Cleveland and runs almost due south through the southern suburbs. I-77 sees the least traffic of the three interstates, although it does connect Cleveland to <!--del_lnk--> Akron. <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 90 connects the two sides of Cleveland, and is the northern terminus for both I-71 and I-77. Running due east/west through the west side suburbs, I-90 turns northeast at the junction with I-71 and I-490, and is known as the Innerbelt through downtown. At the junction with the Shoreway, I-90 makes a 90-degree turn known in the area as <!--del_lnk--> Dead Man&#39;s Curve, then continues northeast, entering <!--del_lnk--> Lake County near the eastern split with Ohio 2. Cleveland is also served by two three-digit interstates, <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 480, which enters Cleveland briefly at a few points and <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 490, which connects I-77 with the junction of I-90 and I-71 just south of downtown.<p>Two other limited-access highways serve Cleveland. The <!--del_lnk--> Cleveland Memorial Shoreway carries <!--del_lnk--> Ohio 2 along its length, and at varying points also carries <!--del_lnk--> US 6, <!--del_lnk--> US 20 and I-90. The Jennings Freeway (<!--del_lnk--> Ohio 176) connects I-71 just south of I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Parma and <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn Heights. A third highway, the Berea Freeway (<!--del_lnk--> Ohio 237 in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and <!--del_lnk--> Brook Park.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland%2C_Ohio&quot;</div>
