      <p>Charlie Chaplin was born on the 16th April 1889 in <!--del_lnk--> East Street, <!--del_lnk--> Walworth, London. His parents, both entertainers in the Music Hall tradition, separated before he was three. As a child he lived with his mother, Hannah, of <!--del_lnk--> Roma ancestry in various addresses in and around <!--del_lnk--> Kennington Road. His father, an alcoholic, who had little contact with his family, died when Charlie was twelve, leaving him and his older half-brother, <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Chaplin, in the sole care of his mother. Hannah Chaplin suffered from <a href="../../wp/s/Schizophrenia.htm" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, and was eventually admitted to the <!--del_lnk--> Cane Hill Asylum at <!--del_lnk--> Coulsdon. Chaplin had to be left in the workhouse at <!--del_lnk--> Lambeth, London, moving after several weeks to the Central London District School for paupers in <!--del_lnk--> Hanwell. The young Chaplin brothers forged a close relationship to survive. They gravitated to the Music Hall while still very young, and both proved to have considerable natural stage talent.<p>Unknown to Charlie and Sydney until years later, they had a half-brother through their mother, Wheeler Dryden, who was raised abroad by his father. He was later reconciled with the family, and worked for Chaplin at his Hollywood studio.<p>Chaplin&#39;s mother died in 1928 in Hollywood, seven years after being brought to the U.S. by her sons.<p><a id="Stage" name="Stage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Stage</span></h2>
      <p>Charlie first took to the stage in 1894, when, at the age of five, he gave an impromptu performance at a theatre in <!--del_lnk--> Aldershot, standing in for his mother. As a child, he was confined to a bed for weeks due to a serious illness, and, at night, his mother would sit at the window and act out what was going on outside. His first professional work came when he joined <!--del_lnk--> The Eight Lancashire Lads, a troupe of dancers who played the music halls of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. In 1900, at the age of 11, his half-brother Sydney helped get him the role of a comic cat in the <!--del_lnk--> pantomime <i><!--del_lnk--> Cinderella</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> London Hippodrome. In 1903 he appeared in <i>Jim: A Romance of Cockayne</i>, followed by his first regular job, as the newspaper boy Billy in <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, a part he played into 1906. This was followed by Casey&#39;s &#39;Court Circus&#39; <!--del_lnk--> variety show, and, the following year, he became a clown in <!--del_lnk--> Fred Karno&#39;s &#39;Fun Factory&#39; slapstick comedy company, where Chaplin became the star of the troupe.<p><a id="America" name="America"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">America</span></h2>
      <p>Chaplin first toured America with the Karno troupe from 1910 to 1912. Then, after five months back in England, he returned for a second tour and arrived in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> with the Karno Troupe on <!--del_lnk--> October 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1912. In the Karno Company was Arthur Stanley Jefferson, who would later become known as <!--del_lnk--> Stan Laurel. Chaplin and Laurel wound up sharing a room in a boarding house. Stan Laurel returned to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> but Chaplin remained in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. In late <!--del_lnk--> 1913, Chaplin&#39;s act with the Karno Troupe was seen by film producer <!--del_lnk--> Mack Sennett, who hired him for his studio, the <!--del_lnk--> Keystone Film Company. Chaplin&#39;s first film appearance was in <i><!--del_lnk--> Making a Living</i> a one-reel comedy released on <!--del_lnk--> February 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1914.<p><a id="Pioneering_film_auteur" name="Pioneering_film_auteur"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pioneering film auteur</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Chaplin&#39;s earliest films (1914) were made for <!--del_lnk--> Keystone Studios, where he developed his Tramp character and very quickly learned the art and craft of filmmaking. The Tramp was first presented to the public in Chaplin&#39;s second film <i><!--del_lnk--> Kid Auto Races at Venice</i> (released Feb 7th 1914) though <i><!--del_lnk--> Mabel&#39;s Strange Predicament</i>, his third film, (released Feb 9th 1914) was produced a few days before. It was for this film that Chaplin first conceived of and played the Tramp. As Chaplin recalled in his autobiography:<dl>
       <dd>I had no idea what makeup to put on. I did not like my get-up as the press reporter [in <i>Making a Living</i>]. However on the way to the wardrobe I though I would dress in baggy pants, big shoes, a cane and a derby hat. I wanted everything to be a contradiction: the pants baggy, the coat tight, the hat small and the shoes large. I was undecided whether to look old or young, but remembering Sennet had expected me to be a much older man, I added a small moustache, which I reasoned, would add age without hiding my expresion.<dd>I had no idea of the character. But the moment I was dressed, the clothes and the makeup made me feel the person he was. I began to know him, and by the time I walked on stage he was fully born (Chaplin, <i>My Autobiography</i>: 154).</dl>
      <p>By the end of his year at Keystone, he was directing and editing his own short films. These were an immediate, runaway success with the public, and even today Chaplin&#39;s standout screen presence in these films is apparent. In 1915 he began a year&#39;s contract with <!--del_lnk--> Essanay film studios, and further developed his film skills, adding new levels of depth and pathos to the Keystone-style slapstick. In 1916, he signed a lucrative deal with the <!--del_lnk--> Mutual Film Corporation to produce a dozen two-reel comedies. He was given near complete artistic control, and produced twelve films over an eighteen month period that rank among the most influential comedy films in cinema. Chaplin later said the Mutual period was the happiest of his career.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>At the conclusion of the Mutual contract in 1917, Chaplin signed a contract with <!--del_lnk--> First National to produce eight two-reel films. First National financed and distributed these pictures (1918-23) but otherwise gave him complete creative control over production. Chaplin built his own Hollywood studio and using his independence, created a remarkable, timeless body of work that remains entertaining and influential. The First National films include the comedy shorts: <i><!--del_lnk--> A Dog&#39;s Life</i> (1918), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Pay Day</i> (1922); longer films, such as: <i><!--del_lnk--> Shoulder Arms</i> (1918) and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Pilgrim</i> (1923); and the feature-length classic <i><!--del_lnk--> The Kid</i> (1921).<p>In 1919 Chaplin co-founded the <!--del_lnk--> United Artists film distribution company with <!--del_lnk--> Mary Pickford, <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Fairbanks and <!--del_lnk--> D. W. Griffith, all of whom were seeking to escape the growing power consolidation of film distributors and financiers in the developing Hollywood studio system. This move, along with complete control of his film production through his studio, assured Chaplin&#39;s independence as a filmaker. He served on the board of UA until the early 1950s.<p>All Chaplin&#39;s United Artists pictures were of feature length, beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> A Woman of Paris</i> (1923). This was followed by the classic <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gold Rush</i> (1925), and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Circus</i> (1928).<p>After the arrival of sound films, he made what is considered to be his greatest film, <i><!--del_lnk--> City Lights</i> (1931), as well as <i><!--del_lnk--> Modern Times</i> (1936) before he committed to sound. These were essentially silent films scored with his own music and sound effects. <i>City Lights</i> contained arguably his most perfect balance of comedy and sentimentality. Of the final scene, critic <!--del_lnk--> James Agee wrote in <i>Life</i> magazine in 1949 that it was the &quot;greatest single piece of acting ever committed to celluloid&quot;.<p>His dialogue films made in Hollywood were <i><!--del_lnk--> The Great Dictator</i> (1940), <i><!--del_lnk--> Monsieur Verdoux</i> (1947), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Limelight</i> (1952).<p>While <i>Modern Times</i> (1936) is a non-talkie, it does contain talk&mdash;usually coming from inanimate objects such as a radio or a TV monitor. This was done to help 1930s audiences, who were out of the habit of watching silent films, adjust to not hearing dialogue. <i>Modern Times</i> was the first film where Chaplin&#39;s voice is heard (in the nonsense song at the end). However, for most viewers it is still considered a silent film -- and the end of an era.<p>Although &quot;<!--del_lnk--> talkies&quot; became the dominant mode of moviemaking soon after they were introduced in 1927, Chaplin resisted making such a film all through the 1930s. It is a tribute to Chaplin&#39;s versatility that he also has one film credit for choreography for the 1952 film <i>Limelight</i>, and another as a singer for the title music of the 1928&#39;s <i>The Circus</i>. The best-known of several songs he composed are &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Smile&quot;, composed for the film &quot;Modern Times&quot; and given lyrics to help promote a 1950s revival of the film, famously covered by <!--del_lnk--> Nat King Cole. &quot;This Is My Song&quot; from Chaplin&#39;s last film, &quot;A Countess From Hong Kong,&quot; was a number one hit in several different languages in the 1960s (most notably the version by <!--del_lnk--> Petula Clark), and Chaplin&#39;s theme from <i>Limelight</i> was a hit in the 50s under the title &quot;Eternally.&quot; Chaplin&#39;s score to <i>Limelight</i> was nominated for an <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award in 1972 due to a decades-long delay in the film premiering in Los Angeles making it eligible.<p>

      <p><a id="The_Great_Dictator" name="The_Great_Dictator"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Great Dictator</i></span></h2>
      <p>His first dialogue picture, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Great Dictator</i> (1940) was an act of defiance against <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, filmed and released in the United States one year before it abandoned its policy of <!--del_lnk--> isolationism to enter <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The film was seen as an act of courage in the political environment of the time, both for its ridicule of Nazism and for the portrayal of overt Jewish characters and the depiction of their persecution. Chaplin played both the role of a Nazi <!--del_lnk--> dictator clearly modeled on Hitler (with a certain physical likeness), and also that of a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> barber cruelly persecuted by the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a>. <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>, who was a great fan of movies, is known to have seen the film twice (records were kept of movies ordered for his personal theatre).<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>Chaplin&#39;s political sympathies always lay with the <!--del_lnk--> left. His politics seem tame by modern standards, but in the 1940s his views (in conjunction with his influence, fame, and status in the United States as a resident foreigner) were seen by many as dangerously communistic. His silent films made prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression typically did not contain overt political themes or messages, apart from the Tramp&#39;s plight in poverty and his run-ins with the law. But his films made in the 1930s were more openly political. <i>Modern Times</i> depicts workers and poor people in dismal conditions. The final dramatic speech in <i>The Great Dictator</i>, which was critical of blindly following patriotic nationalism without question, and his vocal public support for the opening of a second European front in 1942 to assist the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> were controversial. In at least one of those speeches, according to a contemporary account in the <i>Daily Worker</i>, he intimated that Communism might sweep the world after the war and equated it with &quot;human progress&quot;.<p>Apart from the controversial 1942 speeches, Chaplin declined to patriotically support the war effort as he had done for the First World War (although his two sons saw service in the Army in Europe), which led to public anger. For most of the war he was fighting serious criminal and civil charges related to his involvement with actress Joan Berry (see below). After the war, the critical view towards what he regarded as <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> in his 1947 black comedy, <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i> led to increased hostility, with the film being the subject of protests in many US cities. As a result, Chaplin&#39;s final American film, <i>Limelight</i>, was less political and more autobiographical in nature. His following European-made film, <i><!--del_lnk--> A King in New York</i> (1957), satirised the political persecution and paranoia that had forced him to leave the US five years earlier (one of the few films of the 1950s to do so). After this film, Chaplin lost interest in making overt political statements, later saying that comedians and clowns should be &quot;above politics&quot;.<p><a id="McCarthyism" name="McCarthyism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">McCarthyism</span></h2>
      <p>Although Chaplin had his major successes in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and was a resident from 1914 to 1952, he always retained his <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> nationality. During the era of <!--del_lnk--> McCarthyism, Chaplin was accused of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> un-American activities&quot; as a suspected <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communist</a> sympathiser and <!--del_lnk--> J. Edgar Hoover, who had instructed the <a href="../../wp/f/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation.htm" title="FBI">FBI</a> to keep extensive secret files on him, tried to end his United States residency. FBI pressure on Chaplin grew after his 1942 campaign for a second European front in the war, and reached a critical level in the late 1940s, when Congressional figures threatened to call him as a witness in hearings. This was never done, probably from the fear of Chaplin&#39;s ability to lampoon the investigators.<p>In 1952, Chaplin left the US for what was intended as a brief trip home to England; Hoover learned of it and negotiated with the <!--del_lnk--> INS to revoke his re-entry permit. Chaplin then decided to stay in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, and made his home in <!--del_lnk--> Vevey, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. He briefly returned to the United States in April 1972, with his wife, to receive an <!--del_lnk--> Honorary Oscar. Even though he was invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Awards), he was only issued a one-time entry visa valid for a period of two months. However, by this time the animosities towards the now elderly and apolitical Chaplin had faded, and his visit was a triumphant success.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Chaplin won two honorary <!--del_lnk--> Oscars. When the first Oscars were awarded on <!--del_lnk--> May 16, 1929, the voting audit procedures that now exist had not yet been put into place, and the categories were still very fluid. Chaplin had originally been nominated for both Best Actor and Best Comedy Directing for his movie <i>The Circus</i>, but his name was withdrawn and the Academy decided to give him a special award &quot;for versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing <i>The Circus</i>&quot; instead. The other film to receive a special award that year was <i><!--del_lnk--> The Jazz Singer</i>.<p>Chaplin&#39;s second honorary award came 44 years later in 1972, and was for &quot;the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century&quot;. He came out of his exile to accept his award. Upon receiving the award, Chaplin received the longest <!--del_lnk--> standing ovation in Academy Award history, lasting a full five minutes from the studio audience.<p>Chaplin was also nominated without success for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay for <i>The Great Dictator</i>, and again for Best Original Screenplay for <i>Monsieur Verdoux</i> (1947). During his active years as a filmmaker, Chaplin expressed disdain for the Academy Awards; his son Charles Jr. wrote that Chaplin invoked the ire of the Academy in the 1930s by jokingly using his 1929 Oscar as a doorstop. This might help explain why <i><!--del_lnk--> City Lights,</i> considered by several polls to be one of the greatest of all motion pictures, was not nominated for a single Academy Award.<p>It is sometimes overlooked that Chaplin also won a competitive Academy Award. In 1973, he received an Oscar for the <!--del_lnk--> Best Music in an Original Dramatic Score for the 1952 film <i>Limelight</i>, which co-starred <!--del_lnk--> Claire Bloom. The film also features a cameo with <!--del_lnk--> Buster Keaton, which was the only time the two great comedians ever appeared together. Because of Chaplin&#39;s political difficulties, the film did not play a one-week theatrical engagement in Los Angeles when it was first produced. This criterion for nomination was not fulfilled until 1972.<p><a id="Final_works" name="Final_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Final works</span></h2>
      <p>Chaplin&#39;s two final films were made in London: <i><!--del_lnk--> A King in New York</i> (1957) in which he starred, and (as writer and director) <i><!--del_lnk--> A Countess from Hong Kong</i> (1967), starring <!--del_lnk--> Sophia Loren and <!--del_lnk--> Marlon Brando, in which Chaplin made his final on-screen appearance in a brief cameo role as a seasick steward.<p>In his autobiographical book <i>My Life in Pictures</i>, published in 1974, Chaplin indicated that he had written a screenplay for his youngest daughter, Victoria. Entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> The Freak</i>, the film would have cast Victoria as an angel. According to Chaplin, a script was completed and pre-production rehearsals had already begun on the film (the book includes a photograph of Victoria in costume) but were halted when Victoria got married. &quot;I mean to make it some day,&quot; Chaplin wrote; he died before this could happen.<p>One of the last known works Chaplin completed was in 1976 when he composed a new score for his unsuccessful 1923 film <i><!--del_lnk--> A Woman of Paris</i>.<p><a id="Notable_relationships" name="Notable_relationships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notable relationships</span></h2>
      <p>Chaplin&#39;s relationships with various women were an important part of his life and career, in both positive and negative ways.<p><a id="Hetty_Kelly" name="Hetty_Kelly"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hetty Kelly</span></h3>
      <p>Hetty Kelly was Chaplin&#39;s &#39;true&#39; first love, a dancer, whom he met in London when she was 15 (he was 19). Chaplin fell madly in love with her and asked her to marry him. When she refused, Chaplin suggested it would be best if they did not see each other again. He was crushed when she agreed. Years later, her memory would remain a &#39;fetish&#39; with Chaplin. He was devastated in 1921 when he found out that she had died of influenza in the great epidemic of 1918. Speculators would later agree that it was his original infatuation with Hetty that fueled his later relationships with young girls.<p><a id="Edna_Purviance" name="Edna_Purviance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Edna Purviance</span></h3>
      <p>Chaplin and his first major leading lady, <!--del_lnk--> Edna Purviance, were involved in a close romantic relationship during the production of his Essanay and Mutual films in 1916&ndash;1917. The romance seems to have ended by 1918, and Chaplin&#39;s marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Mildred Harris in late 1918 ended any possibility of reconciliation. Purviance would continue as leading lady in Chaplin&#39;s films until 1923, and would remain on Chaplin&#39;s payroll until her death in 1958. She and Chaplin spoke warmly of one another for the rest of their lives.<p><a id="Mildred_Harris" name="Mildred_Harris"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mildred Harris</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1918, the 29-year-old Chaplin married the 16-year-old <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> actress <!--del_lnk--> Mildred Harris. The marriage resulted from a false-alarm pregnancy claim from the underage Harris. They had one child, Norman Spencer Chaplin (also known as &quot;The Little Mouse&quot;), who died in infancy; they divorced in 1920. During the divorce, Chaplin claimed Harris had had a <!--del_lnk--> lesbian affair with noted actress of the time <!--del_lnk--> Alla Nazimova, well known for seducing young actresses. Harris in turn claimed Chaplin was a sexual addict. Both claims have merit.<p><a id="Pola_Negri" name="Pola_Negri"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pola Negri</span></h3>
      <p>Chaplin was involved in a very public relationship and engagement to the actress <!--del_lnk--> Pola Negri in 1922&ndash;23. Negri was a Polish actress who had recently arrived in Hollywood to star in films. The stormy on-off engagement was halted after about nine months, but in many ways it foreshadowed the modern stereotypes of Hollywood star relationships. Chaplin&#39;s public involvement with Negri was unique in his public life. By comparison he strove to keep his other romances and relationships very discreet and private (usually without success). Many biographers have concluded the affair with Negri was largely for publicity purposes.<p><a id="Lita_Grey" name="Lita_Grey"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lita Grey</span></h3>
      <p>At 35, he became involved with 16-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Lita Grey during preparations for <i>The Gold Rush</i>. They married on <!--del_lnk--> November 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1924 after she became pregnant. They had two sons, the actors <!--del_lnk--> Charles Chaplin Jr. (1925&ndash;1968) and <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Earle Chaplin (1926&ndash;). The marriage was a disaster, with the couple hopelessly mismatched. Their extraordinarily bitter divorce in 1928 had Chaplin paying Grey a then-record-breaking $825,000 settlement, on top of almost a million dollars in legal costs. The stress of the sensational divorce, compounded by a federal tax dispute, allegedly turned his hair white. The publication of court records, which included many intimate details, led to a short-lived campaign against him. The Chaplin biographer Joyce Milton asserted in <i>Tramp: The Life of Charlie Chaplin</i> that the Grey-Chaplin marriage was the inspiration for Vladimir Nabokov&#39;s 1950&#39;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Lolita</i>.<p><a id="May_Reeves" name="May_Reeves"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">May Reeves</span></h3>
      <p>May Reeves was originally hired to be Chaplin&#39; secretary on his 1931-1932 extended trip to Europe, dealing mostly with reading his personal correspondence. She worked only one morning, and then was introduced to Chaplin, who was instantly infatuated by her. May became his constant companion and lover on the trip, much to the disgust of Chaplin&#39;s brother Syd. After Reeves also became involved with Syd, Chaplin ended the relationship and she left his entourage. Reeves chronicled her short time with Chaplin in her book, &quot;The Intimate Charlie Chaplin&quot;.<p><a id="Paulette_Goddard" name="Paulette_Goddard"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Paulette Goddard</span></h3>
      <p>Chaplin and actress <!--del_lnk--> Paulette Goddard were involved in a romantic and professional relationship between 1932 and 1940, with Goddard living with Chaplin in his Beverly Hills home for most of this time. Chaplin &quot;discovered&quot; Goddard and gave her starring roles in <i>Modern Times</i> and <i>The Great Dictator</i>. Refusal to clarify their marital status is often claimed to have eliminated Goddard from final consideration for the role of Scarlett O&#39;Hara in <i><a href="../../wp/g/Gone_with_the_Wind_%2528film%2529.htm" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>. After the relationship ended in 1940, Chaplin and Goddard made public statements that they had been secretly married in 1936. But these claims were likely a mutual effort to prevent any lasting damage to Goddard&#39;s career, because Chaplin privately confirmed they were never officially married. In any case, their <!--del_lnk--> common-law marriage ended amicably in 1942, with Goddard being granted a settlement. Goddard went on to a major career in films at Paramount in the 1940s, working several times with <!--del_lnk--> Cecil B. DeMille, whose politics could not have been further from those of Goddard&#39;s former spousal equivalent. She also lived her later life in Switzerland, like Chaplin.<p><a id="Joan_Berry" name="Joan_Berry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Joan Berry</span></h3>
      <p>Chaplin had a brief affair with <!--del_lnk--> Joan Berry in 1942, whom he was considering for a starring role in a proposed film, but the relationship ended when she began harassing him and displaying signs of severe mental illness (similar to those of his mother). Chaplin&#39;s brief involvement with Berry proved to be a nightmare for him. After having a child, she filed a paternity suit against him in 1943. Although blood tests proved Chaplin was not the father of Berry&#39;s child, the tests were then inadmissible as evidence in court, and he was ordered to support the child. The injustice of the ruling later led to a change in California law to allow blood tests as evidence. Federal prosecutors also brought <!--del_lnk--> Mann Act charges against Chaplin related to Berry in 1944, of which he was acquitted. Chaplin&#39;s public image in America was permanently damaged by these sensational trials.<p><a id="Oona_O.27Neill" name="Oona_O.27Neill"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Oona O&#39;Neill</span></h3>
      <p>During Chaplin&#39;s legal trouble over the Berry affair, he met <!--del_lnk--> Oona O&#39;Neill, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Eugene O&#39;Neill, and married her on <!--del_lnk--> June 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1943. He was 54; she was 17. The elder O&#39;Neill refused all contact with Oona after the marriage, up until his death. O&#39;Neill and Chaplin each seemed to provide elements missing in the others&#39; lives: she longed for the love of a father figure, and Chaplin craved her loyalty and support as his public popularity declined. The marriage was a long and happy one, with eight children. They had three sons: <!--del_lnk--> Christopher, <!--del_lnk--> Eugene and <!--del_lnk--> Michael Chaplin and five daughters: <!--del_lnk--> Geraldine, <!--del_lnk--> Josephine, <!--del_lnk--> Jane, <!--del_lnk--> Victoria and <!--del_lnk--> Annette-Emilie Chaplin. Oona survived Chaplin by fourteen years, but her final years were unhappy, with grief over Chaplin&#39;s death eventually leading to alcoholism. She died from <!--del_lnk--> pancreatic cancer in 1991.<p><a id="Knighthood" name="Knighthood"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Knighthood</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1975, he was <!--del_lnk--> knighted as a <!--del_lnk--> Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) by <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. The honour was first proposed in 1931, and again in 1956, when it was vetoed by the then Conservative government for fears of damage to relations with the United States at the height of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> and planned <!--del_lnk--> invasion of Suez of that year.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Chaplin died on <!--del_lnk--> Christmas Day, 1977, in <!--del_lnk--> Vevey, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, in his sleep, aged 88, and was <!--del_lnk--> interred in <!--del_lnk--> Corsier-Sur-Vevey Cemetery in <!--del_lnk--> Corsier-Sur-Vevey, <!--del_lnk--> Vaud. On <!--del_lnk--> March 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1978, his body was stolen by a small group of Polish and Bulgarian mechanics in an attempt to extort money from his family. The plot failed, the robbers were captured, and the body was recovered 11 weeks later near <!--del_lnk--> Lake Geneva (and reburied under six feet of concrete to prevent another attempt).<p><a id="Other_controversies" name="Other_controversies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other controversies</span></h2>
      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, from March 1916, Chaplin was criticized in the British press for not joining the Army. He had in fact presented himself for service, but was denied for being too small and underweight. However, Chaplin also raised substantial funds for the war effort during <!--del_lnk--> War bond drives, and by making, at his own expense, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Bond</i>, a comedic <!--del_lnk--> propaganda film used in 1918. This lingering controversy reportedly prevented Chaplin&#39;s knighthood in the early 1930s.<p>For Chaplin&#39;s entire career, some level of controversy existed over claims of Jewish ancestry. Nazi propaganda in the 1930s prominently portrayed Chaplin as Jewish (named Karl Tonstein) relying on articles published in the US press before, and FBI investigations of Chaplin in the late 1940s also focused on Chaplin&#39;s racial origins. Paranoia about alleged Jewish domination of the movie industry was probably the root cause underlying this controversy. There is no evidence of Jewish ancestry for Chaplin himself. Chaplin&#39;s half-brother, Sydney, was three-fourths-Jewish <!--del_lnk--> , but he was never a practising Jew. For his entire public life, Chaplin fiercely refused to challenge or refute such claims, saying that to do so would always &quot;play directly into the hands of <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semites&quot;. His fearless portrayal of Jewish persecution in <i>The Great Dictator</i> bears this conviction out. In the biographical film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Chaplin</i>, there is a fictional confrontation with a Nazi in which Chaplin responded to his query if he was a Jew with, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have that honour.&quot;<p>Chaplin has also figured in the mysterious events surrounding the death of producer <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Ince aboard the yacht of <!--del_lnk--> William Randolph Hearst in 1924, one of Hollywood&#39;s greatest mysteries. A fictionalised version of these events are depicted in the 2001 film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cat&#39;s Meow</i>. The precise circumstances of Ince&#39;s death will likely never be known.<p>Chaplin&#39;s lifelong attraction to younger women remains another enduring source of controversy. His biographers have attributed this to a teenage infatuation with <!--del_lnk--> Hetty Kelly, whom he met in Britain while performing in the music hall, and which defined his feminine ideal. Chaplin clearly relished the role of discovering and closely guiding young female stars; with the exception of Mildred Harris, all of his marriages and most of his major relationships began in this manner.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

In 1985 he was honoured with his image on a <!--del_lnk--> postage stamp of the United Kingdom, and in 1994 he appeared on a <!--del_lnk--> United States postage stamp designed by caricaturist <!--del_lnk--> Al Hirschfeld.

      <p>Since the 1960s, Chaplin&#39;s films have been unendingly compared to those of <!--del_lnk--> Buster Keaton and <!--del_lnk--> Harold Lloyd (the other two great silent film comedians alongside Charlie Chaplin), especially among the loyal fans of each comic.<p>The three had very different styles: Chaplin had a strong affinity for sentimentality and pathos (which was popular in the 1920s), Lloyd was renowned for his everyman persona and classic 1920s optimism, and Keaton adhered to onscreen stoicism with a cynical tone more suited to modern audiences. On a historical level, Chaplin was behind the pioneering generation of film comedians, and both the younger Keaton and Harold Lloyd built upon his groundwork (in fact, Lloyd&#39;s early characters &quot;Willie Work&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Luke&quot; were obvious Chaplin ripoffs, something that Lloyd acknowledged and tried hard to move away from - eventually succeeding). Chaplin&#39;s period of film experimentation ended after the Mutual period (1916-1917), just before Keaton entered films.<p>Commercially, Charlie Chaplin made some of the <!--del_lnk--> highest-grossing films in the silent era; <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gold Rush</i> is the fifth with $4.25 million and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Circus</i> is the seventh with $3.8 million. However, Chaplin&#39;s films combined made about $10.5 million while Harold Lloyd&#39;s grossed $15.7 million (Lloyd was far more prolific, releasing twelve feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just three). Buster Keaton&#39;s films were not nearly as commercially successful as Chaplin&#39;s or Lloyd&#39;s even at the height of his popularity, and only received belated critical acclaim in the late 1950s and 1960s.<p>Beyond a healthy professional rivalry, the two former vaudevillians and Harold Lloyd (who was a dramatic actor by training) thought highly of each other. Keaton stated that Chaplin was the greatest comedian that ever lived, and the greatest comedy director. Chaplin also greatly admired Keaton: he welcomed him to <!--del_lnk--> United Artists in 1925, advised him against his disastrous move to MGM in 1928, and for his last American film, <i>Limelight</i>, wrote a part specifically for Keaton as his first on-screen comedy partner since 1915.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>

It is said that Chaplin once entered in such a contest and came in third. Other stories claim he came in second. The real story is actually worse: he did take part in such a contest at a San Francisco theatre and did in fact lose. But his final standing was not recorded because he did not even make the finals.<!--del_lnk-->  In another such contest, a rising young actor named <!--del_lnk--> Milton Berle took first prize.<!--del_lnk--> <li>Chaplin befriended <!--del_lnk--> Luis Bu&ntilde;uel in the early 30s.
