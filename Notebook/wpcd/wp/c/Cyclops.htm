      <p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a> a <b>Cyclops</b>, or <b>Kyklops</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek <i><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Kappa;&#x3CD;&kappa;&lambda;&omega;&psi;</span></i>), is a member of a primordial race of <!--del_lnk--> giants, each with a single round eye in the middle of its forehead. The plural is <b>Cyclopes</b> or <b>Kyklopes</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek <i><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Kappa;&#x3CD;&kappa;&lambda;&omega;&pi;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span></i>). The name means &quot;round-&quot; or &quot;wheel-eyed&quot;.<p>Hesiod describes one group of cyclopes and Homer describes another. In <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i>, Zeus releases the Cyclopes, the sons of the sky (<!--del_lnk--> Uranus) and the earth (<!--del_lnk--> Gaia), from the dark pit of <!--del_lnk--> Tartarus. They provide Zeus&#39;s thunderbolt, Hades&#39; helmet of invisibility, and Poseidon&#39;s trident, and the gods use these weapons to defeat the titans. In a famous passages of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer&#39;s</a> <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, the hero <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> encounters the Cyclops <!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon and a <!--del_lnk--> nereid (<!--del_lnk--> Thoosa), who lives with his fellow Cyclopes in a distant country. The connection between the two groups has been debated in antiquity and by modern scholars.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Theogony</i>, the Cyclopes&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Brontes (<i>thunderer</i>), <!--del_lnk--> Steropes () and <!--del_lnk--> Arges (<i>brightener</i>)&mdash;were the sons of <!--del_lnk--> Uranus (&quot;Sky&quot;) and <!--del_lnk--> Gaia (&quot;Earth&quot;). Like their brothers, the <!--del_lnk--> Hecatonchires (&quot;hundred-handed ones&quot;), they were primordial sons of Sky and Earth. They were <!--del_lnk--> giants with a single eye in the middle of their forehead and a foul disposition. According to <!--del_lnk--> Hesiod, they were strong, stubborn, and &quot;abrupt of emotion&quot;. Collectively they eventually became synonyms for brute strength and power, and their name was invoked in connection with massive masonry and especially well-crafted weapons.<p>Uranus, fearing their strength, locked them in <!--del_lnk--> Tartarus. <!--del_lnk--> Cronus, another son of Uranus and Gaia, later freed the Cyclopes, along with the Hecatonchires, after he had castrated and overthrown Uranus. But Cronus then placed them back in Tartarus, where they remained, guarded by the she-dragon <!--del_lnk--> Campe, until freed by Zeus. They fashioned thunderbolts for Zeus to use as weapons, and helped him <!--del_lnk--> overthrow Cronus and the other <!--del_lnk--> Titans. The thunderbolts, which became Zeus&#39; signature weapons, were forged by all three Cyclopes: Arges added brightness, Brontes added thunder, and Steropes added lightning.<p>These Cyclopes also created <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> trident, <!--del_lnk--> Artemis&#39; bow and arrow, and the helmet that <!--del_lnk--> Hades gave to <!--del_lnk--> Perseus on his quest to kill <!--del_lnk--> Medusa. According to a hymn of <!--del_lnk--> Callimachus, they were <!--del_lnk--> Hephaestus&#39; helpers at the forge. The Cyclopes were said to have built the &quot;cyclopean&quot; fortifications at <!--del_lnk--> Tiryns and <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae in the <!--del_lnk--> Peloponnese. The noises proceeding from the heart of <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">volcanoes</a> were attributed to their operations.<p>It is said that these Cyclopes were later killed by <a href="../../wp/a/Apollo.htm" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> after Zeus killed his son, <!--del_lnk--> Asclepius, with a Cyclopes-forged thunderbolt.<p><a id="Homer.27s_Cyclopes" name="Homer.27s_Cyclopes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Homer&#39;s Cyclopes</span></h2>
      <p>The Cyclopes were huge one-eyed monsters that resided on an island with the same name. Commonly, the term &quot;Cyclops&quot; refers to a particular son of <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon and <!--del_lnk--> Thoosa named <!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus who was a Cyclops. Another member of this group of Cyclopes was <!--del_lnk--> Telemus, a seer.<p><a id="Polyphemus" name="Polyphemus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Polyphemus</span></h3>
      <p>In Book 9 of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>, a scouting party led by <a href="../../wp/o/Odysseus.htm" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> lands on the Island of the Cyclopes and discovers a large cave. They enter into the cave and feast on food they find there. This cave is the home of <!--del_lnk--> Polyphemus, who soon returns and traps the trespassers in the cave. He proceeds to eat several crew members, but Odysseus devises a cunning plan for escape.<p>To make Polyphemus unwary, Odysseus gives him a skin of very strong, unwatered <a href="../../wp/w/Wine.htm" title="Wine">wine</a>. When Polyphemus asks for Odysseus&#39; name, he tells him that it is &#39;Outis&#39;, Greek for &#39;no man&#39; or &#39;nobody&#39;. Once the giant falls asleep drunk, Odysseus and his men take the spit from the fire and drive it through Polyphemus&#39; only eye. Polyphemus&#39; cries of help are answered by the others of his race; however, they turn away from aiding him when they hear that &quot;Nobody&quot; is the cause of his woes.<p>In the morning, Odysseus ties his men and himself to the undersides of Polyphemus&#39; sheep. When the Cyclops lets the sheep out to graze, the men are carried out. Since Polyphemus has been blinded, he doesn&#39;t see the men, but feels the tops of his sheep to make sure the men aren&#39;t riding them. As he sailed away, Odysseus shouts &quot;Cyclops, when your father asks who took your eye, tell him that it was Odysseus, Sacker of Cities, Destroyer of Troy, son of Laertes, and King of Ithaca,&quot; which proves to be a catastrophic example of <!--del_lnk--> hubris. Now knowing his attacker&#39;s name, Polyphemus asks his father <!--del_lnk--> Poseidon to prevent Odysseus from returning home to <!--del_lnk--> Ithaca, or to at least deprive him of his ship and crew.<p>This tale from the <i>Odyssey</i> is more humorously told in the only surviving <!--del_lnk--> satyr play, entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Cyclops</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Euripides.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian Greek poet <!--del_lnk--> Theocritus wrote two poems circa <!--del_lnk--> 275 BC concerning Polyphemus&#39; desire for <!--del_lnk--> Galatea, a sea <!--del_lnk--> nymph. When Galatea instead was with <!--del_lnk--> Acis, a Sicilian mortal, a jealous Polyphemus killed him with a boulder. Galatea turned Acis&#39; blood into a river of the same name in Sicily.<p>

      <p><a id="Origins" name="Origins"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Walter Burkert among others suggeststhat the archaic groups or societies of lesser gods mirror real cult associations: &quot;it may be surmised that smith guilds lie behind <!--del_lnk--> Cabeiri, <!--del_lnk--> Idaian Dactyloi, <!--del_lnk--> Telchines, and Cyclopes.&quot; Given their penchant for blacksmithing, many scholars believe the legend of the Cyclopes&#39; single eye arose from an actual practice of blacksmiths wearing an eyepatch over one eye to prevent flying sparks from blinding them in both eyes. The Cyclopes seen in Homer&#39;s <i>Odyssey</i> are of a different type from those in the <i>Theogony</i>; they were most likely much later additions to the pantheon and have no connection to blacksmithing. It is possible that legends associated with Polyphemus did not make him a Cyclops before <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/o/Odyssey.htm" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a></i>; Polyphemus may have been some sort of local <!--del_lnk--> daemon or monster originally. The <!--del_lnk--> Triamantes in Cretan legend have been suggested - they were a rural race of man-eating <!--del_lnk--> ogres who had a third eye on the back of their head. Other than the detail of the eyes, they sound very similar to the Cyclopes of Homer.<p>Another possible origin for the Cyclops legend is that prehistoric <!--del_lnk--> dwarf elephant skulls - about twice the size of a human skull were found by the Greeks on <!--del_lnk--> Crete and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily. Due to the large central nasal cavity (for the trunk) in the skull, it might have been believed that this was a large, single, eye-socket. The smaller, actual, eye-sockets are on the sides and, being very shallow, hardly noticeable as such. Given the paucity of experience that the locals likely had with living <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephants</a>, they were unlikely to recognize the skull for what it actually was. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a name=".22Cyclopean.22_walls"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Cyclopean&quot; walls</span></h2>
      <p>After the &quot;Dark Age&quot;, when Hellenes looked with awe at the vast dressed blocks, known as <!--del_lnk--> Cyclopean structures that had been used in <!--del_lnk--> Mycenaean masonry, at sites like <!--del_lnk--> Mycenae and <!--del_lnk--> Tiryns or on <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, they concluded that only the Cyclopes had the combination of skill and strength to build in such a monumental manner.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclops&quot;</div>
