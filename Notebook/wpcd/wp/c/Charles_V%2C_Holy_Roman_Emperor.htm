In <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, though he is often referred to as <i>Carlos V</i>, he ruled officially as <i>Carlos I</i>, hence <b>Charles I of Spain</b>.

      <p>Combining in himself the heritage of the German <!--del_lnk--> Habsburgs, the <!--del_lnk--> House of Burgundy, and the Spanish heritage of his mother, Charles transcended ethnic and national boundaries.<p>Charles was born in the Flemish city of <!--del_lnk--> Ghent and brought up in <!--del_lnk--> Mechelen by his aunt Margaret until <!--del_lnk--> 1517. The culture and courtly life of the Burgundian <!--del_lnk--> Low Countries was the prime influence in his early life. He was brought up to speak French and <!--del_lnk--> Flemish, but also added Spanish and some German . Indeed, he was said to speak &quot;Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to his horse&quot;. He could not speak Spanish very well, as it was not his primary language.<p>From his Burgundian ancestors, he inherited an ambiguous relationship with the <a href="../../wp/l/List_of_French_monarchs.htm" title="List of French monarchs">Kings of France</a>. Charles shared with France his <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">mother tongue</a> and many cultural forms. In his youth, he made frequent visits to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, then the largest city of <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe, which he thoroughly enjoyed. In his words: &quot;Paris is not a city, but a <a href="../../wp/u/Universe.htm" title="Universe">universe</a>&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> Lutetia non urbs, sed orbis</i>). But Charles was also born into the tradition of political and dynastical enmity between the Royal and the Burgundian lines of the <!--del_lnk--> Valois Dynasty.<p>This conflict was amplified by his accession to both the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and the kingdom of Spain. Though Spain was the core of his kingdom, he was never totally assimilated and especially in his earlier years felt and was viewed as a foreign prince. Nonetheless, he spent most of his life in Spain, including his final years in a Spanish monastery.<p>In his youth, Charles was tutored by <!--del_lnk--> Adrian of Utrecht, later <!--del_lnk--> Pope Adrian VI. His three most prominent subsequent advisors were <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chi&egrave;vres, <!--del_lnk--> Jean Sauvage and <!--del_lnk--> Mercurino Gattinara.<p><a id="Marriage_and_children" name="Marriage_and_children"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage and children</span></h2>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 10, <!--del_lnk--> 1526, Charles married his first cousin <!--del_lnk--> Isabella of Portugal, sister of <!--del_lnk--> John III of Portugal.<p>Their children included:<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1527 - <!--del_lnk--> 1598), the only son to reach adulthood.<li><!--del_lnk--> Maria of Spain (<!--del_lnk--> 1528 - <!--del_lnk--> 1603), who married her cousin <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor.<li><!--del_lnk--> Joan of Habsburg (<!--del_lnk--> 1537 - <!--del_lnk--> 1573)</ul>
      <p>Charles is also infamous for his many mistresses. Two of them gave birth to two future <!--del_lnk--> Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands:<ul>
       <li>Johanna Maria van der Gheynst bore <!--del_lnk--> Margaret of Parma and<li><!--del_lnk--> Barbara Blomberg bore <!--del_lnk--> John of Austria.</ul>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1506, Charles inherited his father&#39;s Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and <!--del_lnk--> Franche-Comt&eacute;, although, as he was a minor, his aunt <!--del_lnk--> Margaret acted as regent until <!--del_lnk--> 1515.<p>Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of <!--del_lnk--> Tournai, <!--del_lnk--> Artois, <!--del_lnk--> Utrecht, <!--del_lnk--> Groningen and <!--del_lnk--> Guelders. The <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen Provinces had been unified by Charles&#39; Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were <!--del_lnk--> fiefs of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In <!--del_lnk--> 1549, Charles issued a <!--del_lnk--> Pragmatic Sanction, declaring the Low Countries as a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs..<p>The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles personally, they were the region where he spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the rich cities, they were also important for the treasury.<p><a id="Spain" name="Spain"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spain</span></h3>
      <p>With the death of his grand-father Ferdinand II, on <!--del_lnk--> May 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1516 Charles became the first king of a united Spain. Charles inherited his grandfather&#39;s realm, which included <!--del_lnk--> Aragon, <!--del_lnk--> Navarre, <!--del_lnk--> Naples, <!--del_lnk--> Sicily and <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia, and also became joint-king of <!--del_lnk--> Castile and guardian of his insane mother <!--del_lnk--> Joanna. With the Castilian crown he also gained <!--del_lnk--> Granada and the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish possessions in the New World.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>For the first time the crowns of Castile and Aragon were united in one person. Ferdinand and Isabella had each been sovereign in one kingdom, but only consort in the other.<p>Charles arrived in his new kingdoms in autumn of 1517. His <!--del_lnk--> regent <!--del_lnk--> Jim&eacute;nez de Cisneros came to meet him, but fell ill along the way, not without a suspicion of poison. Charles sent him a letter to thank him for his services, but Cisneros died before meeting the King.<p>Negotiations with the Castilian Cortes proved difficult, and in the end Charles was accepted under the following conditions: he would learn to speak <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Castilian</a>; he would not appoint foreigners; he was prohibited from taking precious metals from Castile; and he would respect the rights of his mother, Queen <!--del_lnk--> Joanna. The Cortes paid homage to him in Valladolid in 1518. In 1519 he was crowned before the Cortes of Aragon in <!--del_lnk--> Zaragoza, and the Cortes of Catalonia followed.<p>Charles was accepted as sovereign, even though the Spanish felt uneasy with the Imperial style; Spanish monarchs until then had been bound by the laws, the monarchy was a contract with the people. With Charles it would become more absolute, even though until his mother&#39;s death in <!--del_lnk--> 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.<p>Soon resistance against the Emperor rose, because of the heavy taxation &ndash; funds that were used to fight wars abroad, wars most Castilians had no interest in &ndash; and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Spain and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Castilian War of the Communities, which was suppressed by Charles. After this, Castile became integrated into the Habsburgs&#39; empire, and would provide the bulk of the Habsburg&#39;s military and financial resources.<p><a id="America" name="America"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">America</span></h3>
      <p>During Charles&#39; reign, the territories in <!--del_lnk--> New Spain were considerably extended by <!--del_lnk--> conquistadores like <a href="../../wp/h/Hern%25C3%25A1n_Cort%25C3%25A9s.htm" title="Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro, who brought the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> empires to fall in little more than a decade. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe in <!--del_lnk--> 1522, this gave to Charles a strong impression of his divine mission to become the leader of a <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">christian</a> world. The conquests also provided the state treasury with enormous amounts of <!--del_lnk--> bullion. The conquistador <!--del_lnk--> Bernal Diaz had already observed: <i>&quot;We came to serve God and our Majesty, ... and also to get rich.&quot;</i>  In <!--del_lnk--> 1550, Charles convened a conference at <!--del_lnk--> Valladolid in order to consider the morality of the force used against the indigenous populations of Spanish America.<p><a id="Holy_Roman_Empire" name="Holy_Roman_Empire"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Holy Roman Empire</span></h3>
      <p>After the death of his other grandfather, <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian, in 1519, he inherited <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg lands in <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a>. Naturally, he also was the candidate for succeeding Maximilian as Emperor, but he had to face the competition of the French King <!--del_lnk--> Francis I, who also had the support of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Leo X. Francis used promises and bribes to win the favour of the <!--del_lnk--> electors, but with the help of the wealthy <!--del_lnk--> Fugger family Charles could oust Francis and was elected on <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1519. In <!--del_lnk--> 1530 he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Clement VII in <a href="../../wp/b/Bologna.htm" title="Bologna">Bologna</a>, the last Emperor to receive a papal coronation.<p>Charles was Holy Roman Emperor over the German states, but his real power was limited by the princes. Protestantism gained a lot of support in Germany, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An <!--del_lnk--> inquisition was established as early as <!--del_lnk--> 1522. In <!--del_lnk--> 1550 the death penalty was introduced for all <!--del_lnk--> heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth: the <!--del_lnk--> Revolt of Ghent in <!--del_lnk--> 1539, which Charles personally suppressed.<p><a id="Wars_against_France" name="Wars_against_France"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wars against France</span></h2>
      <p>Much of Charles&#39;s reign was taken up with wars with France, which found itself encircled by Charles&#39;s empire and still maintained ambitions in Italy. The <a href="../../wp/i/Italian_War_of_1521.htm" title="Italian War of 1521">first war</a> with Charles&#39;s great nemesis <!--del_lnk--> Francis I of France began in <!--del_lnk--> 1521. Charles allied with England and <!--del_lnk--> Pope Leo X against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> and defeating and capturing Francis at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Pavia in <!--del_lnk--> 1525, and forcing him to sign the humiliating <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Madrid the next year, in which the French king was forced to cede <!--del_lnk--> Burgundy to Charles.<p>When he was released, however, Francis had the parlement de Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under <!--del_lnk--> duress. Already the <!--del_lnk--> Pope had formed the <!--del_lnk--> League of Cognac with <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a>, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy, and Francis soon joined. This war was notable for the <!--del_lnk--> sack of Rome by Charles&#39;s forces in <!--del_lnk--> 1527, which took the Pope out of the war. Charles&#39;s occupation of Rome and virtual imprisonment of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Clement VII allowed him to keep the Pope from annulling the marriage of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and Charles&#39;s aunt <!--del_lnk--> Catherine of Aragon, with important consequences. Besides the sack, the war itself was inconclusive, and came to an end with the compromise <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Cambrai in <!--del_lnk--> 1529, called the &quot;Ladies&#39; Peace&quot; because it was negotiated between Charles&#39;s aunt and Francis&#39;s mother, in which Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> third war erupted in <!--del_lnk--> 1535, when, following the death of the last Sforza <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Milan, Charles installed his own son, <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip</a> in the duchy, despite Francis&#39;s claims on it. The war was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but was successful in conquering most of the lands of Charles&#39;s ally the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Savoy, including his capital, <a href="../../wp/t/Turin.htm" title="Turin">Turin</a>. A truce at <!--del_lnk--> Nice in <!--del_lnk--> 1538 on the basis of <i><!--del_lnk--> uti possidetis</i> ended the war, but only for a short time. The <!--del_lnk--> Italian war of 1542 resumed in <!--del_lnk--> 1542, with Francis now actively allied with Ottoman Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Suleiman I, and Charles once again allied with <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>. Despite the conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Nice by a Franco-Ottoman fleet, the French remained unable to advance into Milan, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the <i>status quo ante</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1544.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> final war erupted with Francis&#39;s son and successor, <!--del_lnk--> Henry II, in <!--del_lnk--> 1551. This war saw early successes by Henry in <!--del_lnk--> Lorraine, where he captured <!--del_lnk--> Metz, but continued failure of French offensives in Italy. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, <a href="../../wp/p/Philip_II_of_Spain.htm" title="Philip II of Spain">Philip II</a> and his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor.<p><a id="Wars_against_the_Ottoman_Empire" name="Wars_against_the_Ottoman_Empire"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wars against the Ottoman Empire</span></h2>
      <p>Charles had been fighting with the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and its sultan, <a href="../../wp/s/Suleiman_the_Magnificent.htm" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a>, for a number of years. The expeditions of the Ottoman force along the Mediterranean coast posed a threat to Habsburg lands and the peace of Western Europe. In <!--del_lnk--> Central Europe, the Turkish advance was halted at <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1529, which they <!--del_lnk--> besieged unsuccessfully. In <!--del_lnk--> 1535 Charles won an important victory at <a href="../../wp/t/Tunis.htm" title="Tunis">Tunis</a>, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1536 Francis I of France allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in <!--del_lnk--> 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in <!--del_lnk--> 1542. In <!--del_lnk--> 1543 Charles allied himself with <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> and forced Francis to sign the <!--del_lnk--> Truce of Crepy-en-Laonnois. Charles later signed a humiliating treaty with the Ottomans, to gain him some respite from the huge expenses of their war, although it wasn&#39;t over. However, the Protestant powers in the Holy Roman Empire <!--del_lnk--> Diet often voted against money for his Turkish wars, as many Protestants saw the Muslim advance as a counterweight to the Catholic powers. The great Hungarian defeat at the 1526 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Mohacs was in some ways a moral defeat for the West as a whole.<p><a id="Humanism_and_Reformation" name="Humanism_and_Reformation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Humanism and Reformation</span></h2>
