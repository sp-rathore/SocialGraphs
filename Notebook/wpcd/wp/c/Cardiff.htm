      <p>Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district known as the <!--del_lnk--> Vale of Glamorgan, to the east by the city of <!--del_lnk--> Newport, to the north by the <!--del_lnk--> South Wales Valleys and to the south by the <!--del_lnk--> Bristol Channel. The <!--del_lnk--> River Taff (Afon Taf in Welsh) winds through the centre of the city and together with the <!--del_lnk--> River Ely (Afon Elai in Welsh) flows into the freshwater lake of <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Bay. A third river, the <!--del_lnk--> Rhymney (Afon Rhymni in Welsh) flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Bristol Channel. A fourth river, the <!--del_lnk--> Lleucu, (Afon Lleucu in Welsh) has been culverted.<p>Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from <!--del_lnk--> Chepstow to the Ely estuary, which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. Triassic landscapes are usually shallow and low-lying which accounts and explains Cardiff&#39;s flatness. The classic Triassic <!--del_lnk--> marl, <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a> and <!--del_lnk--> conglomorate rocks are used predominantly throughout Cardiff as building materials. Many of these Triassic rocks have a purple complexion, especially the coastal <!--del_lnk--> marl found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is &quot;Radyr Stone&quot;, a <!--del_lnk--> free-stone which as it name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district. Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> sandstones (the <!--del_lnk--> Old Red Sandstone) from the <!--del_lnk--> Brecon Beacons has been used. Most famously, the superbly elegant buildings of <!--del_lnk--> Cathays Park, arguably Britain&#39;s finest civic centre buildings are built of <!--del_lnk--> Portland stone which was imported from Dorset. A widely used building stone in Cardiff are the surreal yellow-grey <!--del_lnk--> Lias <!--del_lnk--> limestone rocks of the <!--del_lnk--> Vale of Glamorgan, including the very rare &quot;Sutton Stone&quot;, a conglomerate of lias limestone and <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">carboniferous</a> limestone that is, apart from Radyr Stone, the only free-stone in South-East Wales (freestones can be cut to a perfectly smooth surface). The yellow-ish complexion of the lias limestone used mainly in the city centre give Cardiff an unusually sunny, light and breezy complexion for a city in the <!--del_lnk--> U.K..<p>Cardiff is situated near to the <!--del_lnk--> Glamorgan <!--del_lnk--> Heritage Coast, stretching westward from Penarth and Barry (which are commuter towns of Cardiff), with its striped yellow-blue Jurassic &quot;lias&quot; limestone/carboniferous limestone cliffs that thrust outwards towards the Bristol Channel. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Sea that has exposed <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> (<!--del_lnk--> blue lias) geology. This west facing stretch of coast, which takes the brunt of brutal Atlantic westerlies and has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs aplenty (like <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall) was a ship graveyard during the age of sail; ships sailing upto Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as most were wrecked around this hostile coastline during brutal west/south-westerly gales. Consequently, just like its Celtic cousin in Cornwall, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships became a way of life for many people living in the small coastal villages of the Vale.<p>Cardiff is linked to the West <!--del_lnk--> Somerset/North <!--del_lnk--> Devon seaside resorts (such as <!--del_lnk--> Minehead, <!--del_lnk--> Ilfracombe and <!--del_lnk--> Lundy Island) via the paddle steamers Waverley and Balmoral which sail from Penarth pier, as they have done for over 150 years. Sailing across the Bristol Channel to North Devon is a much a part of Cardiffian life as a pint of Brains and watching rugby. In fact, Devon&#39;s tourist trade began in the 19th century when the paddle steamers spent weekends crusing the Bristol Channel taking the expanding population of Cardiff to places such as Lynmouth, Ilfracombe, Bideford and Clovelly.<p>Cardiff is a relatively flat city and its geographic features were influential in its development as one of the world&#39;s largest coal ports. Most notably this included its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys. Cardiff has a relatively dry climate compared to most of Wales , with an average rainfall of 1,065&nbsp;mm. It is also a relatively mild city, with an average January temperature of 4.5 &deg;C and an average July temperature of 16 &deg;C<p>Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral &#39;village&#39; of Llandaff, whose bishop is currently Archbishop of Wales. Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a Catholic archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated Catholic and Jewish population of the city. There are a significant number of Nonconformist chapels.<p><a id="Districts" name="Districts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Districts</span></h3>
      <p>There have been seven major expansions to Cardiff&#39;s boundaries between the years 1875-1996. Before 1875 Cardiff was comprised of the two parishes of St John and St Mary and totalled an area of 7.86 km&sup2;, however this had increased to 139.53 km&sup2; by 1996. The first expansion, of 1875 included the areas of and around Canton and Roath. The expansion of 1922 took in the areas between <!--del_lnk--> Ely and <!--del_lnk--> Llanishen. The next expansion in 1938 incorporated <!--del_lnk--> Rumney in <!--del_lnk--> Monmouthshire into the city. Further expansion in 1974 included an arc from <!--del_lnk--> St Fagans in the west, through Lisvane in the north and <!--del_lnk--> St Mellons in the east. The most recent expansion of 1996 has brought the areas of and around <!--del_lnk--> Creigiau and <!--del_lnk--> Pentyrch into the city&#39;s boundaries.<p>Roughly speaking, &quot;Inner Cardiff&quot; can be considered to consist of the following wards: <!--del_lnk--> Penylan, <!--del_lnk--> Plasnewydd, <!--del_lnk--> Gabalfa, <!--del_lnk--> Roath, <!--del_lnk--> Cathays, <!--del_lnk--> Adamsdown and <!--del_lnk--> Splott ward on the north and east of the city centre, and <!--del_lnk--> Butetown, <!--del_lnk--> Grangetown, <!--del_lnk--> Riverside and <!--del_lnk--> Canton to the south and west. The inner-city areas to the south of the A4161 road known as the &quot;Southern Arc&quot; are, with the exception of affluent and trendy Cardiff Bay, some of the poorest districts of Wales with low levels of economic activity and high ethnic minority populations. The proximity of these areas to <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Bay have led some critics of the project to argue that the regeneration scheme has failed as it has done little to improve the economic prospects of local people, and may have worsened problems of exclusion and alienation. On the other hand Gabalfa, Plasnewydd and Cathays have very large student populations, and Pontcanna in Riverside is a favourite for young professionals. <!--del_lnk--> Penylan which lies to the north east side of Roath Park is an affluent area popular with those with older children and the retired.<p>&quot;Suburban Cardiff&quot; can be broken down into three distinct areas. To the west lie Ely, Caerau and Fairwater which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom. With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at Michaelston Super Ely and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of workless households. <!--del_lnk--> Radyr, <!--del_lnk--> Llandaff, <!--del_lnk--> Llandaff North, <!--del_lnk--> Whitchurch &amp;<!--del_lnk--> Tongwynlais, <!--del_lnk--> Rhiwbina, <!--del_lnk--> Heath, <!--del_lnk--> Llanishen, <!--del_lnk--> Lisvane, and <!--del_lnk--> Cyncoed which lie in an arc from thenorth west to the north east of the centre can be considered the main middle class suburbs of the city. In particular, Cyncoed, Radyr and Lisvane contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales, and the last of these is likely to see considerable expansion in coming years with the council planning 4000 houses in the area. Further to the east lie the wards of Pontprennau &amp; Old St Mellons, Rumney, <!--del_lnk--> Pentwyn, <!--del_lnk--> Llanrumney and <!--del_lnk--> Trowbridge. The latter 3 are again largely of public housing stock, although new private housing is being built in Trowbridge in considerable number. <!--del_lnk--> Pontprennau is the newest &#39;suburb&#39; of Cardiff, whilst Old <!--del_lnk--> St Mellons has a history going back to the Norman Conquest.<p>To the North West of the city lies a region that may be called &quot;Rural Cardiff&quot; containing the villages of St Fagans, Creigiau and Pentyrch. The latter two are primarily &quot;planned&quot; communities developed from the mid 20th century and are popular with families looking for green space close to the city. St Fagans, home to the Museum of Welsh Life, is protected from further development.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The name Cardiff is an Anglicisation of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh name &quot;Caerdydd&quot;. There is uncertainty concerning the origin of &quot;Caerdydd&quot;&mdash;&quot;Caer&quot; means &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;castle,&quot; but although &quot;Dydd&quot; means &quot;Day&quot; in modern Welsh, it is unclear what was meant in this context. Some believe that &quot;Dydd&quot; or &quot;Diff&quot; was a corruption of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Taff&quot;, the river on which <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff castle stands, in which case &quot;Cardiff&quot; would mean &quot;the fort on the river Taff&quot; (in <!--del_lnk--> Welsh the <i>T</i> mutates to <i>D</i>).<p>Others favour a link with <!--del_lnk--> Aulus Didius Gallus, as it is known that the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Romans</a> established a fort in Cardiff when he was governor of the nearby province, in which case Cardiff might mean &quot;the Fort of Didius&quot;. A Norman <!--del_lnk--> castle still exists, within the site of the earlier <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Roman</a> fort, but was substantially altered and extended during the Victorian period by <!--del_lnk--> John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, and the <!--del_lnk--> architect <!--del_lnk--> William Burges. Original Roman work can, however, still be distinguished in the wall facings.<p>There is a second castle north of the city, called <b><!--del_lnk--> Castell Coch</b> (Welsh: &quot;the Red Castle&quot;). The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian folly designed by Burges for the Marquess and built in the 1870s. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by <!--del_lnk--> Ivor Bach, a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions.<p>Situated on the narrowest part of the south Wales coastal plain, Cardiff had a crucial strategic importance in the wars between the Normans (who had occupied lowland Wales) and the Welsh who maintained their hold on the Uplands. As a result Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of Castles of any city in Europe. As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch the remains of Castell Morgraig, Bishop&#39;s Castle, Y Twmpath, Ruperra Castle and Saint Fagans Castle are still in existence while Whitchurch Castle and King&#39;s Castle have disappeared under later developments.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>
      <p>Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with Latin, English, Welsh, and Norse dominating at different times. Although it was the Romans who established the &quot;castle on the Taff&quot; it was the Vikings who first began developing the maritime trade from which the town (later to become a city) was to derive its prosperity. The Vikings - who controlled the Bristol Channel - used Cardiff as a raiding base, a port and a trading post. Many street-names in Cardiff are of Viking origin including Dumballs Road and the oldest street in the city, Womanby Street. Womanby Street is a corruption of the original Norse name Humandaby Street. Some believe that Welsh was the majority language from the thirteenth century until the city&#39;s explosive growth in Victorian times. As late as 1850 five of the twelve Anglican churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in Welsh, while only two worshipped exclusively in English.<p>A substantial Irish population settled in Cardiff during the 19th century. They were drawn to Cardiff by the work available on major building and engineering projects in the docks and the city itself. The Irish are credited with having introduced the distinctive flat-vowelled &quot;Cardiff accent&quot;. By 1891 the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only Lisvane, Llanedyrn and Creigiau remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities. The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of Chapels and Churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemerate the new millennium. Following the establishment of the city&#39;s first Welsh School Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf in the 1950s Welsh has slowly regained some ground.<p>Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from rural Wales the number of Welsh speakers in Cardiff rose by 14,451 between 1991 and 2001 and is now spoken by 11% of Cardiffians. The highest percentage of Welsh speakers is in Creigiau where over twenty per cent of the population are able to speak the language.<p><a id="Capital_City_Status" name="Capital_City_Status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capital City Status</span></h3>
      <p><a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VII of the United Kingdom">King Edward VII</a> granted Cardiff <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1905. It was then proclaimed capital city of Wales on <!--del_lnk--> December 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1955, by a <!--del_lnk--> Written Reply by the Home Secretary. <!--del_lnk--> Caernarfon had also vied for this title.  Cardiff therefore celebrated two important <!--del_lnk--> anniversaries in 2005.<p>The city is <!--del_lnk--> county town of <!--del_lnk--> Glamorgan, although this role has diminished since council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the <!--del_lnk--> Vale of Glamorgan together as the new county of <!--del_lnk--> South Glamorgan. Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff City&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> district council becoming a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Cardiff was granted <!--del_lnk--> Fairtrade City status.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>Cardiff&#39;s population is a growing one, with a likely population figure exceeding 321,000 in 2006 representing an increase of over 10,000 since the 2001 final revised <!--del_lnk--> Census estimates of 310,400. The Council has also predicted growth of 16,000 in the decade following 2011, which, extrapolating current growth rates until that date would give a population of the county borough of 333,000 in 2011 and 349,000 in 2021. The population of the urban area (which officially includes <!--del_lnk--> Dinas Powys &amp; <!--del_lnk--> Penarth) will thus pass 380,000 within the next 15 years. If one also includes the towns of <!--del_lnk--> Caerphilly, <!--del_lnk--> Barry, <!--del_lnk--> Llantrisant and some other neighbouring towns in an unofficial larger metropolitan area, the population would approach 500,000 by the same date. The ethnic make-up of Cardiff&#39;s population ,at the time of the 2001 census was: 91.6% white, 2% mixed race, 4% Asian, 1.3% Black, 1.2% Chinese or other ethnic origin. 66.9% described themselves as Christian, below the Welsh and UK average, while 3.7% described themselves as Muslim, significantly above the Welsh average but in line with the UK average. The proportion of people declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures. 18.8% stated they had no religion, while 8.6% did not state a religion.<p>Official estimates derived from the census are controversial. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.

      <p>Cardiff was originally a small town - much smaller than Swansea and Merthyr Tydfil. What changed it was the demand for iron, brought to the sea by packhorse from Merthyr. The Ironmasters, the proprietors of the smelters in Dowlais and Merthyr, wanted to reduce the cost of carrying iron by road to ships berthed in the estuary of the River Taff at Cardiff. They sought permission of Parliament to build a 25-mile long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.<p>Work on building the <!--del_lnk--> Glamorganshire Canal began in 1790, took eight years and involved installing 50 locks. The Cardiff Sea Lock, which enabled barges to unload iron into sea-going ships, was built at Harrowby St (Harrowby - a Viking place-name - had been the original Norse trading post in Cardiff). Eventually the <!--del_lnk--> Taff Vale Railway replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff - all prompted by the soaring world-wide demand for South Wales coal.<p>Cardiff&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> port, known as <!--del_lnk--> Tiger Bay, became one of the busiest ports in the world and - for some time - the world&#39;s most important <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> port. Indeed, Cardiff&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Coal Exchange was reputedly the first host to a business deal for a million <!--del_lnk--> pounds Sterling.<p>The Tiger Bay area also housed one of the UK&#39;s earliest <!--del_lnk--> immigrant communities. After a long period of neglect as <i><!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Bay</i>, it is now being <!--del_lnk--> regenerated as a popular area for arts, entertainment and night-life. Much of the growth has been thanks to the building of the <!--del_lnk--> Cardiff Barrage.<p><a id="Present_day" name="Present_day"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Present day</span></h3>
      <p>Today, Cardiff is the principal <a href="../../wp/f/Finance.htm" title="Finance">finance</a> and business <!--del_lnk--> services centre in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and as such there is a strong representation of finance and business services in the local economy. In December 2003, 19 % of the city&#39;s workforce (33,850 individuals) were employed in the sector - higher than the proportion across both Wales (9.6%) and Great Britain (15.4%). However many analysts claim that Cardiff suffers from the failure to attract high value added jobs in this sector when similar cities such as <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Leeds.htm" title="Leeds">Leeds</a> are more successful.<p>Companies such as <!--del_lnk--> Legal &amp; General, <!--del_lnk--> Barclays, <!--del_lnk--> Admiral Insurance, <!--del_lnk--> HBOS, <a href="../../wp/z/Z%25C3%25BCrich.htm" title="Z&uuml;rich">Z&uuml;rich</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ING Direct, <!--del_lnk--> The AA, <!--del_lnk--> Principality Building Society, <!--del_lnk--> 118118, <!--del_lnk--> British Gas, SWALEC Energy and <!--del_lnk--> BT all operate contact centres in the city. Other major employers include <!--del_lnk--> NHS Wales and the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly for Wales.<p>Cardiff is home to <!--del_lnk--> BBC Wales, <!--del_lnk--> S4C and <!--del_lnk--> ITV Wales and is the UK&#39;s largest Film, TV &amp; Multimedia sector outside London. Employment in the sector has grown significantly in recent years, and currently provides employment for 2.1% of the City&#39;s workforce - higher than the level across Wales (1.1%) and marginally lower than that across Great Britain as a whole (2.2%).<p><!--del_lnk--> Retail also plays a strong role in the city&#39;s employment, with it being crowned the 8th best place to shop in UK according to recent surveys, and this ranking is likely to rise into the top 5 once the St David&#39;s 2 shopping development is completed. The majority of Cardiff&#39;s shopping portfolio is in the city centre around Queen St and St Mary&#39;s St, and there are numerous out of town retail parks.<p>The city is also host to <!--del_lnk--> S A Brain, a <!--del_lnk--> brewery with premises in Cardiff since 1882.<p>In 2003 Cardiff combined with the Vale of Glamorgan had a <!--del_lnk--> GDP of &pound;8.335 billion <!--del_lnk--> GBP.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> M4 motorway is the principal motorway in the region that connects Cardiff with towns in <!--del_lnk--> West Wales such as Llanelli, Swansea and Camarthen, and also <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, principally, <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> A48(M) motorway is another motorway within the city, acting as a short spur off the M4 to the city centre.
