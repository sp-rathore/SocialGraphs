      <!-- start content -->
      <p>In <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a>, a <b>capital</b> (also called <b>capital city</b> or <b>political capital</b> &mdash; although the latter phrase has <!--del_lnk--> a second meaning based on an alternative sense of &quot;capital&quot;) is the principal <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> or <!--del_lnk--> town associated with a country&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>. It is almost always the city which physically encompasses the offices and meeting places of the <!--del_lnk--> seat of government and fixed by <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>.<p>The word <i>capital</i> is derived from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>caput</i> meaning &quot;head,&quot; and the related term <i><!--del_lnk--> capitol</i> refers to the building where government business is chiefly conducted.<p>Seats of government in major substate jurisdictions are often called &quot;capitals&quot;, but this is typically the case only in countries with some degree of <!--del_lnk--> federalism, where major substate jurisdictions have an element of <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty. In <!--del_lnk--> unitary states, &quot;administrative centre&quot; or other similar terms are typically used. For example, the seat of government in a state of the United States of America is usually called its &quot;capital&quot;, but the main city in a region of England is usually not. At lower administrative subdivisions, terms such as <!--del_lnk--> county town, <!--del_lnk--> county seat, or <!--del_lnk--> borough seat are usually used.<p>Historically, the major economic centre of a state or region often becomes the focal point of political power, and becomes a capital through conquest or amalgamation. This was the case for <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. The capital naturally attracts the politically motivated and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of government such as <!--del_lnk--> lawyers, <!--del_lnk--> journalists, and <!--del_lnk--> public policy researchers. A capital that is the prime economic, cultural, or intellectual centre is sometimes referred to as a <!--del_lnk--> primate city. Such is certainly the case with <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a> among national capitals, and <!--del_lnk--> Irkutsk or <a href="../../wp/s/Salt_Lake_City%252C_Utah.htm" title="Salt Lake City, Utah">Salt Lake City</a> in their respective state or province.<p>Capitals are sometimes sited to discourage further growth in an existing major city. <a href="../../wp/b/Bras%25C3%25ADlia.htm" title="Bras&iacute;lia">Bras&iacute;lia</a> was planted in <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>&#39;s interior because the old capital, <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, along with all of Southeastern Brazil, was considered already crowded. The government of <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> announced in 2004 it would move its capital from <a href="../../wp/s/Seoul.htm" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Yeongi-Gongju &mdash; even though the word <i>Seoul</i> itself means &quot;capital&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Korean language.<p>The convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals, as occurred with <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing by <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. The decline of a dynasty or culture could mean the extinction of its capital city as well, as occurred with <!--del_lnk--> Babylon and <!--del_lnk--> Cahokia. And many modern capital cities, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Abuja.htm" title="Abuja">Abuja</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="../../wp/o/Ottawa.htm" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, were deliberately fixed outside existing economic areas, and may not have established themselves as new commercial or industrial hubs since.<p>

      <p>A number of cases exist where states or other entities have multiple capitals, and there are also several states that have no capital. In others, the &quot;effective&quot; and &quot;official&quot; capital may differ for pragmatic reasons, resulting in a situation where a city known as &quot;the capital&quot; is not, in fact, host to the seat of government. Likewise, occasionally the official &quot;capital&quot; as called is may be host to he seat of government, but is not always the geographic origin of political decision-making.<ul>

      <p><a id="Capital_as_symbol" name="Capital_as_symbol"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Capital as symbol</span></h2>
      <p>With the rise of modern <!--del_lnk--> empires and the <!--del_lnk--> nation-state, the capital city has become a <!--del_lnk--> symbol for the state and its government, and imbued with political meaning. Unlike medieval capitals, which were declared wherever a <!--del_lnk--> monarch held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding or capture of a modern capital city is an emotional affair. For example:<ul>
       <li>Ruined and almost uninhabited <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a> was made capital of newly independent <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a> with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of the ancients. Similarly, following the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/German_reunification.htm" title="German reunification">German reunification</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Berlin is now once again the capital of the country. Other restored capital cities include <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> October Revolution.<li>A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either <!--del_lnk--> economic or <!--del_lnk--> strategic reasons (sometimes known as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> forward capital&quot; or <!--del_lnk--> spearhead capital). <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter I of Russia</a> moved his government from <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> to <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> to give the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire a <!--del_lnk--> western orientation, while <!--del_lnk--> Kemal Atat&uuml;rk did the same by actually moving east, to <!--del_lnk--> Ankara, away from more <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Ming Emperors moved their capital to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> from more central <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing as to better supervise the border. with the Mongols and Manchus. Other examples include <a href="../../wp/a/Abuja.htm" title="Abuja">Abuja</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Astan&aacute;, <a href="../../wp/b/Bras%25C3%25ADlia.htm" title="Bras&iacute;lia">Bras&iacute;lia</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Helsinki.htm" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Islamabad, <!--del_lnk--> Naypyidaw and <a href="../../wp/y/Yamoussoukro.htm" title="Yamoussoukro">Yamoussoukro</a>.<li>The selection or founding of a &quot;neutral&quot; capital city &mdash; i.e. one unencumbered by regional or political identity &mdash; was meant to represent the unity of a new state when <!--del_lnk--> Bern, <a href="../../wp/c/Canberra.htm" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Ottawa.htm" title="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> became capitals.<li>During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, tremendous resources were expended to defend <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, which bordered the <!--del_lnk--> Confederate States of America, from Confederate attack, even though the small <!--del_lnk--> federal government could have been moved relatively easily in the era of <!--del_lnk--> railroads and <!--del_lnk--> telegraph.</ul>
      <p><a id="Strategic_importance_of_capitals" name="Strategic_importance_of_capitals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Strategic importance of capitals</span></h2>
      <p>The capital city is almost always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.<p>In old <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a <!--del_lnk--> Dynasty could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms period, both <!--del_lnk--> Shu and <!--del_lnk--> Wu fell when their respective capitals of <!--del_lnk--> Cheng Du and Jian Ye fell. The <!--del_lnk--> Ming dynasty relocated its capital from <!--del_lnk--> Nanjing to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from <!--del_lnk--> Mongols and <!--del_lnk--> Manchus. The Ming was destroyed when the <!--del_lnk--> Manchus took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Confucian monarchy in the 20th century. After the <a href="../../wp/q/Qing_Dynasty.htm" title="Qing Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a>&#39;s collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation technologies allowed both the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Nationalists and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Communists to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of <!--del_lnk--> Japanese invasion.<p>National capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, due to socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1205, after the Latin <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders captured the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> capital, Constantinople, Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British</a> forces sacked various <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> capitals repeatedly during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a> and <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812, but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent frontiersmen-civilians. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital is taken; in their military strategies, traditional enemies of France such as <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> focused on the capture of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>.<p><a id="Largest_national_capital_cities" name="Largest_national_capital_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Largest national capital cities</span></h2>
