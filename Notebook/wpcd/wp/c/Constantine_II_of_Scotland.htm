</script><a id="Early_Period:_the_Viking_threat" name="Early_Period:_the_Viking_threat"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early Period: the Viking threat</span></h2>
      <p>Prior to his reign, Scotland had been dominated by, and perhaps tributary to, the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> kings of the Irish Sea province in the later 9th century. During his reign, Causant&iacute;n faced <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> raids from the north and west, and expanding <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon kings of <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>, while establishing the kingdom of Alba in its definitive <!--del_lnk--> Gaelicised form.<p>The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records an attack by the Vikings, and the plundering of Dunkeld, in the third year of Causant&iacute;n&#39;s reign. The following year, the invaders were defeated in Strathearn.<p>The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba records that Causant&iacute;n and bishop <!--del_lnk--> Cellach<blockquote>
       <p>met at <i>the Hill of Belief</i> near the royal city of <!--del_lnk--> Scone [and] pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept in conformity with the Scotti.</blockquote>
      <p>It is supposed that if any single event may be taken to mark the birth of the <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Alba, then it should be this.<p>In 914, the <!--del_lnk--> Annals of Ulster report the defeat of Barid son of Oitir by Ragnall grandson of Ivar in the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>. It in is the period of dominance of northern Britain by Ragnall and his cousin Sihtric that Causant&iacute;n is found as an ally of <!--del_lnk--> Ealdred of <!--del_lnk--> Bernicia and, perhaps, of &quot;Queen&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Ethelfleda of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a>. Armies led by Ragnall and his brother Sihtric raided throughout northern Britain and Ireland. They attacked <!--del_lnk--> Chester, <!--del_lnk--> Dumbarton and <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria. The <!--del_lnk--> U&iacute; &Iacute;mair - the grandsons of Ivar - were the greatest threat to Alba, hence the alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons of Bernicia and Mercia.<p>While two <!--del_lnk--> battles of Corbridge are claimed, in 915 and 918, only the second is mentioned by the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and, at some length, by the Annals of Ulster and the <!--del_lnk--> Fragmentary Annals of Ireland. The first battle rests on <!--del_lnk--> Symeon of Durham&#39;s <i>Historia de Sancto Cuthberto</i>.  The location in Gaelic sources is vague, <!--del_lnk--> Corbridge again coming from Symeon.<p><a id="Later_period:_the_English_threat" name="Later_period:_the_English_threat"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later period: the English threat</span></h2>
      <p>After Carham, Ragnall seized control of <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>. However, in 920, after taking direct control of Mercia soon after Ethelfleda&#39;s death, <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Elder forced Ragnall to acknowledge his rule. While neither of the kings may have been happy with the compromise of 920, neither did they live long enough to break the treaty. Ragnall died in 921, succeeded by his cousin Sihtric. Edward died in 924, followed by <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;lfweard, who reigned for a very short time, succeeded by his half-brother <!--del_lnk--> Athelstan. Sihtric may have rebelled in 924, but by 926 he had evidently acknowledged Athelstan as over-king, adopting <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and marrying a sister of Athelstan at <!--del_lnk--> Tamworth. Within the year Sihtric abandoned his new faith and repudiated his unwanted wife. Before Athelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927.<p>Athelstan moved quickly, seizing much of <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria, and securing the submission of Sihtric&#39;s brother Gofraid (or Guthfrith), of Ealdred of Bernicia, of Causant&iacute;n, and of <!--del_lnk--> Owain of Strathclyde. Sihtric&#39;s young son <!--del_lnk--> Amla&iacute;b Cuaran (Olaf Sihtricsson) fled to Ireland. In less than a decade, the kingdom of <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, and whatever threat the Vikings, or the early <!--del_lnk--> U&iacute; &Iacute;mair, had posed, clearly the main threat to Alba was now to the south. As if to prove the point, Athelstan imposed his authority on the kings of <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Hywel Dda and <!--del_lnk--> Idwal Foel among them.<p><a id="Brunanburh_and_after" name="Brunanburh_and_after"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Brunanburh and after</span></h2>
      <p>By the 930s, Causant&iacute;n, his son-in-law <!--del_lnk--> Amla&iacute;b mac Gofraidh (Olaf Guthfrithsson), the U&iacute; &Iacute;mair king of <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>, perhaps together with Owain of Strathclyde, are found in alliance,certainly directed against Athelstan. In 933 or 934, Athelstan led &quot;a great army and fleet&quot; into Scotland and laid waste to the country. If this was intended to bring about Causant&iacute;n&#39;s submission, it appears to have failed.<p>In 937, the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Brunanburh was a notable victory for Athelstan and his brother <!--del_lnk--> Edmund over Causant&iacute;n, Amla&iacute;b and Owain. It is commemorated in an <!--del_lnk--> Old English poem. Owain of Strathclyde is supposed to have died in the battle, as did a son of Causant&iacute;n. The report of the deaths of Dubucan son of Indrechtaig, <!--del_lnk--> Mormaer of Angus, Eochaid son of Alp&iacute;n and of Athelstan follow that for Brunanburh, and may be related to the period 937&ndash;939.<p>For all that Brunanburh was a great victory, it does not appear to have been sufficient to make rule by the West Saxon kings popular in the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw and <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria. On 27 October, 939, at <!--del_lnk--> Malmesbury, as the Annals of Ulster report: &quot;Athelstan, king of the Saxons, pillar of the dignity of the western world, died an untroubled death.&quot; Before the end of 939, Amla&iacute;b mac Gofraid had seized York without resistance. In 940, he gained control of the Danelaw with little fighting, a treaty being signed with the new West Saxon king, Athelstan&#39;s brother Edmund, at the prompting of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, near <a href="../../wp/l/Leicester.htm" title="Leicester">Leicester</a>. The following year, Amla&iacute;b turned north, on Bernicia, campaigning as far as <!--del_lnk--> Tyninghame in East Lothian, but he died that year, being succeeded by his cousin Amla&iacute;b Cuaran.<p><a id="Abdication_and_posterity" name="Abdication_and_posterity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Abdication and posterity</span></h2>
      <p>The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba states:<blockquote>
       <p>And in his old age, being decrepit, [Causant&iacute;n] took the staff [i.e. entered a monastery], and served the Lord; and he gave up the kingdom to <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el [Coluim] son of Domnall.</blockquote>
      <p>The monastery is assumed to have been that of the <!--del_lnk--> Cel&iacute; D&eacute; at <!--del_lnk--> St Andrews, probably founded in its C&eacute;li D&eacute; form during the reign of Causant&iacute;n. The Chronicle is not done with Causant&iacute;n however. It states that in the seventh year of <!--del_lnk--> Ma&eacute;l Coluim&#39;s reign:<blockquote>
       <p>[H]e plundered the English as far as the river Tees, and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Causant&iacute;n made this raid, asking of the king, M&aacute;el Coluim, that the kingship should be given to him for a week&#39;s time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was M&aacute;el Coluim who made the raid, but Causant&iacute;n incited him, as I have said.</blockquote>
      <p>Causant&iacute;n&#39;s death is recorded by the Chronicle in 952:<blockquote>
       <p>And Causant&iacute;n died in [Ma&eacute;l Coluim&#39;s] 10th year [952], under the crown of penitence in good old age.</blockquote>
      <p>As has been said, one of Causant&iacute;n&#39;s sons died at Brunanburh and a daughter married Amla&iacute;b mac Gofraidh. Causant&iacute;n himself may have had a Norse or <!--del_lnk--> Hiberno-Norse wife as his son <!--del_lnk--> Ildulb had a gaelicised Norse name. The line of kings descended from Causant&iacute;n appears to have ended with the deaths of his great-grandson <!--del_lnk--> Causant&iacute;n mac Cul&eacute;in in 997. None the less, the kingdom which he had created existed in much the same form until the <!--del_lnk--> Scotto-Norman reforming kings <!--del_lnk--> David I, and his grandsons <!--del_lnk--> M&aacute;el Coluim IV and <!--del_lnk--> William the Lion, brought about a new form of Scottish kingship in the 12th century.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_II_of_Scotland&quot;</div>
