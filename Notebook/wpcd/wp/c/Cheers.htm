      <p><i><b>Cheers</b></i> was an <!--del_lnk--> American <!--del_lnk--> situation comedy produced by <!--del_lnk--> Charles-Burrows-Charles Productions in association with <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Television for <!--del_lnk--> NBC. <i>Cheers</i> was created by the team of <!--del_lnk--> James Burrows, <!--del_lnk--> Glen Charles, and <!--del_lnk--> Les Charles. The show was set in the <!--del_lnk--> eponymous Cheers <!--del_lnk--> bar (itself named for the <!--del_lnk--> toast &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cheers&quot;) in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts, where a group of locals met to drink and generally have fun. The show&#39;s theme song was written and performed by <!--del_lnk--> Gary Portnoy with its famous refrain, &quot;where everybody knows your name&quot;, that also became the show&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> tagline.<p>After premiering on <!--del_lnk--> September 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1982, it was nearly cancelled during its first season when it ranked dead last in ratings. However, <i>Cheers</i> eventually became a <!--del_lnk--> highly rated <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> show in the United States, earning a top-ten rating during eight of its eleven seasons, including one season at #1, and spending the bulk of its run on NBC&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Must See Thursday&quot; lineup. Its <!--del_lnk--> widely watched <!--del_lnk--> series finale was broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> May 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1993, and the show&#39;s 273 <!--del_lnk--> episodes have now entered into a long and successful <!--del_lnk--> syndication run. The show earned 26 <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Awards, out of a total of 117 nominations. The character <!--del_lnk--> Frasier Crane (<!--del_lnk--> Kelsey Grammer) was featured in his own successful <!--del_lnk--> spin-off, <i><!--del_lnk--> Frasier</i>, after <i>Cheers</i> ended.<p>

      <p>The character of <!--del_lnk--> Sam Malone was originally intended to be a retired <a href="../../wp/a/American_football.htm" title="American football">football</a> player, but after casting <!--del_lnk--> Ted Danson it was decided that a former <!--del_lnk--> relief pitcher for the <!--del_lnk--> Boston Red Sox would be more believable. The character of <!--del_lnk--> Cliff Clavin was created for <!--del_lnk--> John Ratzenberger after he auditioned for <i>Cheers</i>. While chatting with producers afterwards, he asked if they were going to include a &quot;bar <!--del_lnk--> know-it-all&quot;, the part which he eventually played. <!--del_lnk--> Kirstie Alley joined the cast when <!--del_lnk--> Shelley Long left, and <!--del_lnk--> Woody Harrelson joined when <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Colasanto died. Danson, <!--del_lnk--> George Wendt, and <!--del_lnk--> Rhea Perlman were the only actors to appear in every episode of the series. <!--del_lnk--> Paul Willson, who played the recurring <!--del_lnk--> barfly character of &quot;Paul&quot;, made early appearances in the first season as &quot;Glen&quot;, was credited as &quot;Gregg&quot;, and also appeared in the show as a character named &quot;Tom&quot;.<p><a id="Guest_stars" name="Guest_stars"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Guest stars</span></h3>
      <p>Although <i>Cheers</i> operated largely around that main ensemble cast, <!--del_lnk--> guest stars did occasionally supplement them. Notable repeat guests included <!--del_lnk--> Jay Thomas as <!--del_lnk--> Eddie LeBec, <!--del_lnk--> Dan Hedaya as <!--del_lnk--> Nick Tortelli, <!--del_lnk--> Jean Kasem as <!--del_lnk--> Loretta Tortelli, <!--del_lnk--> Roger Rees as <!--del_lnk--> Robin Colcord, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Skerritt as <!--del_lnk--> Evan Drake, and <!--del_lnk--> Harry Anderson as <!--del_lnk--> Harry the Hat. Other celebrities guest starred in single episodes as themselves throughout the series. Some sports figures appeared on the show as former teammates of Sam&#39;s from the Red Sox such as <!--del_lnk--> Luis Tiant and <!--del_lnk--> Wade Boggs, while others appeared with no connection to <i>Cheers</i> such as <!--del_lnk--> Kevin McHale or <!--del_lnk--> Mike Ditka. Some television stars also made guest appearances such as <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Gilbert, <!--del_lnk--> Alex Trebek, <!--del_lnk--> Arsenio Hall, and <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Carson. Some political figures even made appearances on <i>Cheers</i> such as then-<!--del_lnk--> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <!--del_lnk--> Admiral <!--del_lnk--> William J. Crowe, former <!--del_lnk--> Colorado <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Senate.htm" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> <!--del_lnk--> Gary Hart, then-<a href="../../wp/s/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <!--del_lnk--> Tip O&#39;Neill, Senator <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry, then-<!--del_lnk--> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Michael Dukakis, and then-<!--del_lnk--> Mayor of Boston <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Flynn (the last four of which all represented Cheers&#39; home state and city). Musician <!--del_lnk--> Harry Connick, Jr. appeared in an episode as Woody&#39;s cousin and plays a song from his Grammy winning album <i><!--del_lnk--> We Are in Love</i> (c. 1991). <!--del_lnk--> John Cleese won an Emmy for his guest appearance as &quot;Dr. Simon Finch-Royce&quot; in a fifth season episode &quot;Simon Says&quot;.<p><a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h2>
      <p>The concept for <i>Cheers</i> was the end result of a long consideration process. The original idea was a group of workers who interacted like a family, hoping to be similar to <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>. They considered making an American version of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Fawlty Towers</i> centered around a hotel or an inn. When the creators settled on a bar as their setting the show began to resemble the <!--del_lnk--> radio show <i><!--del_lnk--> Duffy&#39;s Tavern</i>. They liked the idea of a tavern as it provided a continuous stream of new people arriving, giving them a constant supply of characters.<p>After choosing a plot, the three had to choose a location. Early discussions centered around <!--del_lnk--> Barstow, California, then <a href="../../wp/k/Kansas_City%252C_Missouri.htm" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. They eventually turned to the <!--del_lnk--> East Coast and Boston. The <!--del_lnk--> Bull &amp; Finch Pub in Boston that Cheers was styled after was originally chosen from a <!--del_lnk--> phone book. When Glen Charles asked the owner to shoot initial <!--del_lnk--> exterior and interior shots the owner agreed, charging <!--del_lnk--> $1. He has since gone on to make millions, licensing the pub&#39;s image and selling a variety of <i>Cheers</i> memorabilia, making the Bull &amp; Finch the 42nd busiest outlet in the American food and beverage industry in 1997. Coincidentally during Shelley Long&#39;s casting (who was in Boston at the time filming <i><!--del_lnk--> A Small Circle of Friends</i>) she remarked that the bar in the script resembled a bar she had come upon in Boston, which turned out to be the Bull &amp; Finch.<p>Most <i>Cheers</i> episodes were shot before a live studio audience on Paramount Stage 25, generally on Tuesday nights. Scripts for a new episode were issued the Wednesday before for a <!--del_lnk--> read-through, Friday was <!--del_lnk--> rehearsal day, and final scripts were issued on Monday. Nearly 100 crewmembers were involved in the shooting of a single episode. Burrows, who directed most episodes, insisted on shooting on <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> rather than <!--del_lnk--> videotape. He was also noted for using motion in his directorial style, trying to always keep characters moving rather than standing still.<p><a id="Crew" name="Crew"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Crew</span></h3>
      <p>The crew of <i>Cheers</i> numbered in the hundreds; as such, this section can only provide a brief summary of the many crewmembers for the show. The three creators &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> James Burrows, <!--del_lnk--> Glen Charles, and <!--del_lnk--> Les Charles &mdash; stayed on throughout the series as executive producers along with <!--del_lnk--> Tom Palmer. In fact, the two Charles brothers kept offices on Paramount&#39;s lot for the duration of <i>Cheers</i> run. In the final seasons, however, they handed over much of the show to Burrows. Burrows is regarded as being a factor in the show&#39;s longevity, directing 243 of the episodes and supervising the show&#39;s production. <!--del_lnk--> David Angell was also a part of the crew from the start, writing many <i>Cheers</i> episodes. The show was often noted for its writing which most credit along with other production factors and the ensemble cast for the show&#39;s success.<p><a id="Awards" name="Awards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Awards</span></h2>
      <p>Over its eleven-season run, <i>Cheers</i> and its cast and crew earned many awards. <i>Cheers</i> earned 117 <!--del_lnk--> Emmy nominations, tying the series with <!--del_lnk--> <i>ER</i> (<!--del_lnk--> as of 2006) for the most Emmy nominations for a single series. These nominations resulted in a total of 26 Emmy wins. In addition, <i>Cheers</i> has earned 31 <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe nominations with a total of 6 wins. All ten of the actors who were regulars on the series received Emmy nominations for their roles. <i>Cheers</i> won the Golden Globe for &quot;Best TV-Series - Comedy/Musical&quot; in 1991 and the Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot; in 1983, 1984, 1989 and 1991. <i>Cheers</i> was presented with the &quot;Legend Award&quot; at the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> TV Land Awards, with many surviving cast members attending the event.<p>The following table summarizes awards won by the <i>Cheers</i> cast and crew.<table class="wikitable">

      <p>Nearly all of <i>Cheers</i> took place in the front room of the bar, only occasionally stepping into the rear pool room or the bar&#39;s office. In fact, <i>Cheers</i> didn&#39;t show any action <!--del_lnk--> outside the bar until later into the series. <i>Cheers</i> had some <!--del_lnk--> running gags, such as Norm arriving in the bar greeted by a loud &quot;Norm!&quot; Early episodes generally followed Sam&#39;s antics with his various women, following a variety of <!--del_lnk--> romantic comedy <!--del_lnk--> clich&eacute;s to get out of whatever relationship troubles he was in that particular episode. As the show progressed and Sam got into more serious relationships the general tone switched to comedy on Sam settling down into a more <!--del_lnk--> monogamous lifestyle. Throughout the series, larger <!--del_lnk--> story arcs began to develop that spanned multiple episodes or seasons interspersed with smaller themes and one-off episodes.<p><a id="Romance" name="Romance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Romance</span></h3>
      <p>The show&#39;s main theme in its early seasons was the romance between the intellectual waitress Diane Chambers and the ex-<!--del_lnk--> baseball pitcher, recovering alcoholic, bar owner Sam Malone. In later episodes the focus shifted to Sam&#39;s new relationship with neurotic corporate climber Rebecca. Both romances became important continuing story lines, with relationship growth and change. The story arc began with mutual detestation but sexual attraction to dating and love, and back to detestation. Both relationships featured multi-episode &quot;will they or won&#39;t they&quot; <!--del_lnk--> sexual tension that drew viewers in. While a common theme in old romantic comedies, such continuing romantic story lines were largely absent from television until <i>Cheers</i>. After Sam and Diane&#39;s courtship was consummated, the show&#39;s popularity grew greatly and subsequent TV shows now very commonly have such &quot;will they or won&#39;t they&quot; tensions between opposites.<p><a id="Social_issues" name="Social_issues"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social issues</span></h3>
      <p>Many <i>Cheers</i> scripts centered around or were improved with a variety of social issues. As <i>Toasting Cheers</i> puts it:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

The &quot;upper class&quot; - represented by characters like Diane Chambers, Frasier Crane, Lilith Sternin and (initially) Rebecca Howe &mdash; rubbed shoulders with middle and working class characters &mdash; Sam Malone, Carla Tortelli, Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. An extreme example of this was the relationship between Woody Boyd and <!--del_lnk--> millionaire&#39;s daughter Kelly Gaines. Many viewers enjoyed <i>Cheers</i> in part because of this focus on character development in addition to plot development.<p><!--del_lnk--> Feminism and the role of women were also recurring themes throughout the show, with some seeing each of the major female characters as a flawed feminist in her own way. Diane was a very vocal feminist, but Sam was the epitome of everything she hated: a <!--del_lnk--> womanizer and a <!--del_lnk--> male chauvinist. Their relationship led Diane to several diatribes on Sam&#39;s promiscuity, while Carla merely insulted people. Carla was respected because of her power, while Diane was ignored as she commanded little respect. Finally, Rebecca was a stereotypical ambitious and <!--del_lnk--> golddigging woman, seeking relationships with her superiors at the Lillian Corporation, most notably, <!--del_lnk--> Robin Colcord, to gain promotions or raises. However, she encountered a <!--del_lnk--> glass ceiling and ended the show by marrying a plumber rather than one of the rich businessmen she originally flirted with.<p><!--del_lnk--> Homosexuality was dealt with from the very first season, a rare move for American network television in the early 1980s. In the first season episode &quot;The Boys In The Bar&quot; (after the 1970s film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Boys in the Band</i>) a college friend and teammate of Sam&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> comes out in his <!--del_lnk--> autobiography. Some of the male regulars pressure Sam to take action to ensure that Cheers does not became a <!--del_lnk--> gay bar. The episode won a <!--del_lnk--> GLAAD <!--del_lnk--> Media Award, and the script&#39;s writers, Ken Levine &amp; David Isaacs, were nominated for an Emmy Award for their writing. <!--del_lnk--> Harvey Fierstein would later appear in the 1990s as &quot;Mark Newberger&quot;, Rebecca&#39;s old high school sweetheart who is gay. Finally, the finale episode included a gay man who gets into trouble with his boyfriend (played by <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Heald) after agreeing to pose as Diane&#39;s husband.<p><!--del_lnk--> Addiction also plays a role in <i>Cheers</i>, almost exclusively through Sam, although some critics believed the issue was never really developed. Sam was a recovering <!--del_lnk--> alcoholic who ended up buying a bar after his baseball career was ruined by his drinking. Frasier also has a notable bout of drinking in the fourth season episode &quot;The Triangle&quot;, although Sam is the primary alcoholic figure on the show. Some critics believe Sam was a generally <!--del_lnk--> addictive personality who had largely conquered his alcoholism but was still a <!--del_lnk--> sexual addict, shown through his womanizing.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p><a id="Cheers_owners" name="Cheers_owners"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Cheers</i> owners</span></h3>
      <p>Cheers obviously had several owners before Sam, as the bar was opened in 1889 (The &quot;Est. 1895&quot; on the bar&#39;s sign is a made-up date chosen by Carla for <!--del_lnk--> numerological purposes as revealed in the 8th season episode &quot;The Stork Brings a Crane&quot;). In the second episode, &quot;Sam&#39;s Women&quot;, Norm tells a customer looking for the owner of Cheers that the man he thought was the owner has been replaced, and his replacement replaced by Sam.<p>The biggest storyline surrounding the ownership of Cheers begins in the fifth season finale, &quot;I Do, Adieu&quot;, when Sam and Diane part ways, Shelley Long leaves the regular cast, and Sam leaves to attempt <!--del_lnk--> circumnavigating the Earth. Before he leaves, Sam sells Cheers to the fictional Lillian Corporation. Sam returns in the sixth season premiere, &quot;Home is the Sailor&quot;, having sunk his boat, to find the bar under the new management of Rebecca Howe. He begs for his job back and is hired by Rebecca as a bartender. Throughout the sixth season, Sam tries a variety of schemes to buy back Cheers. This plot largely comes to an end in the seventh season premiere, &quot;How to Recede in Business&quot;, when Rebecca is fired and Sam is promoted to manager. Rebecca is allowed to keep a job at Lillian vaguely similar to what she had before, but only after Sam had Rebecca &quot;agree&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> in absentia) to a long list of demands that the corporation had for her (e.g. returning to graduate school and taking on the task of waitress if the bar became too busy).<p>From there Sam would occasionally attempt to buy the bar back with schemes that usually involved wealthy executive <!--del_lnk--> Robin Colcord. Cheers did eventually end up back in Sam&#39;s hands in the eighth season finale, when it was sold back to him for eighty-seven <!--del_lnk--> cents by the Lillian Corporation after he alerted the company of Colcord&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> embezzlement. Rebecca earns back a waitress/hostess job from Sam.<p><a id="Other_recurring_themes" name="Other_recurring_themes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other recurring themes</span></h3>
      <p>Aside from the storylines that spanned across the series, <i>Cheers</i> had several themes that followed no storylines but that recurred throughout the series. There was a heated rivalry between Cheers and the rival bar, Gary&#39;s Olde Towne Tavern, owned, as the name suggests, by a man named Gary. One episode of every season depicted some wager between Sam and Gary, which resulted in either a sports competition or a battle of wits that devolved into complex practical jokes. Aside from the very first and very last <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Bar Wars&quot; episodes, the Cheers gang always lost to Gary&#39;s superior ingenuity. Sam also had a long-running feud with the management of the upscale restaurant situated directly above the bar, Melville&#39;s. The restaurant&#39;s management found the bar&#39;s clientele decidedly uncouth, while Sam regarded the restaurant as snobbish. This conflict escalated in later seasons, when Melville&#39;s came under the ownership of John Allen Hill (<!--del_lnk--> Keene Curtis), and it emerged that Sam did not technically own the bar&#39;s poolroom and <!--del_lnk--> bathrooms. Sam subsequently was forced to pay rent for them and often found himself at the mercy of Hill&#39;s tyranny.<p>Norm Peterson continually searched for gainful employment as an accountant but spent most of the series unemployed, thereby explaining his constant presence in Cheers at the same stool. The face of his wife, Vera, was <!--del_lnk--> never fully seen onscreen, despite a few fleeting appearances and a couple of vocal cameos. Cliff Clavin seemed unable to shake the constant presence of his mother, Esther Clavin (<!--del_lnk--> Frances Sternhagen). Though she did not appear in every episode, he would refer to her quite often, mostly as both an emotional burden and a smothering parent.<p>Carla Tortelli carried a reputation of being both extremely fertile and matrimonially inept. The last husband she had on the show, <!--del_lnk--> Eddie LeBec, was a washed-up <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> <!--del_lnk--> goaltender who ended up dying in an ice show accident. Carla later discovered that Eddie had cheated on her, marrying another woman after impregnating her. Carla&#39;s sleazy first husband, <!--del_lnk--> Nick Tortelli, also made frequent appearances, mostly to torment Carla with a new custody battle or legal scam that grew out of their divorce. Carla&#39;s eight kids were also notoriously ill-behaved.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>

      <p><i>Cheers</i> was critically acclaimed even in its first season, though it landed a disappointing 74th in the ratings that year. This critical support, coupled with early success at the Emmys and the support of the president of NBC&#39;s entertainment division <!--del_lnk--> Brandon Tartikoff, is thought to be the main reason for the show&#39;s survival and eventual success. The cast themselves went across the country on various <!--del_lnk--> talk shows to try and further promote the series after its first season. When NBC discovered <i><!--del_lnk--> Family Ties</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Cosby Show</i> and placed them both on Thursday night with <i>Cheers&#39;</i> second season, the show&#39;s audience expanded (starting what NBC would go on to call &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Must See Thursday&quot;). By its final season <i>Cheers</i> had a run of eight consecutive seasons in the Top Ten of the <!--del_lnk--> Nielsen ratings. Critics have a variety of opinions on addiction in <i>Cheers</i> (<i><!--del_lnk--> see above</i>). Some critics now use <i><!--del_lnk--> Frasier</i> and <i>Cheers</i> as a model of a successful spin-off for a character from an already successful series to compare to modern spin-offs, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Joey</i> from <i><!--del_lnk--> Friends</i>.<p>NBC dedicated a whole night to the final episode of <i>Cheers</i>. The show began with a &quot;pregame&quot; show hosted by <!--del_lnk--> Bob Costas, followed by the final 98-minute episode itself. Local news then aired tributes to <i>Cheers</i>, and the night concluded with a special <i><!--del_lnk--> Tonight Show</i> broadcast live from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. Some critics disliked the finale for the sudden reentry of Shelley Long which they felt was flawed, the odd length of the episode, <!--del_lnk--> Leno&#39;s monologue, and a seemingly uninterested (and, as they would later sheepishly admit, drunk) <i>Cheers</i> cast that resorted to spitball fights much to Leno&#39;s dismay. Although the episode fell short of its hyped ratings predictions to become the <!--del_lnk--> most-watched television episode, it was the most watched show that year and ranked 11th all time in entertainment programming. The episode originally aired in the usual <i>Cheers</i> spot of Thursday night and was then rebroadcast on Sunday. Some estimate that while the original broadcast did not outperform the <!--del_lnk--> <i>M*A*S*H</i> finale, the combined non-repeating audiences for the Thursday and Sunday showings did. <i>Toasting Cheers</i> also notes that television had greatly changed between the <i><a href="../../wp/m/M%252AA%252AS%252AH_%2528TV_series%2529.htm" title="M*A*S*H (TV series)">M*A*S*H</a></i> and <i>Cheers</i> finales, leaving <i>Cheers</i> with a broader array of competition for ratings.<p><a id="Spin-offs_and_crossovers" name="Spin-offs_and_crossovers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Spin-offs and crossovers</span></h2>
      <p>Some of the actors and actresses from <i>Cheers</i> brought their characters into other television shows, either in a guest appearance or in a new spin-off. The most successful <i>Cheers</i> spin-off was the show <i><!--del_lnk--> Frasier</i> which directly followed Frasier Crane after moving back to <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, where he lived with his family and hosted a call-in radio show. Ironically, Frasier was originally supposed to be a small disliked character who only existed to further Diane and Sam&#39;s relationship, but Grammer&#39;s acting turned what were supposed to be unfunny lines into comedy the audience enjoyed. Sam, Diane, and Woody all had individual crossover appearances on <i>Frasier</i> where they came to visit Frasier, and his ex-wife <!--del_lnk--> Lilith remained a constant supporting character throughout <i>Frasier</i>. Cliff, Norm, Carla, and two of Cheers&#39; regular background barflies Paul and Phil had a crossover together in the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Frasier</i> episode &quot;Cheerful Goodbyes&quot;. In the episode Frasier, on a trip to Boston, meets the Cheers gang and Cliff thinks Frasier has flown out for his (Cliff&#39;s) retirement party, which Frasier ends up attending. <i>Frasier</i> was on the air as long as <i>Cheers</i>, going off the air in 2004 after an eleven-season run. Although <i>Frasier</i> was the most successful spin-off, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tortellis</i> was the first series to spin-off from <i>Cheers</i>, premiering in 1987. The show featured Carla&#39;s husband <!--del_lnk--> Nick Tortelli and his wife <!--del_lnk--> Loretta, but was cancelled after 13 episodes and drew protests for its stereotypical depictions of Italian Americans.<p>In addition to direct spin-offs, several <i>Cheers</i> characters had guest appearance crossovers with other shows. In <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Fear of Flying&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> Homer stumbles into a Cheers-like bar after being kicked out of <!--del_lnk--> Moe&#39;s. Most of the central cast appears in the episode, including Frasier. Ironically Frasier does not speak (so Grammer is not in the episode) even though Grammer was the only actor from <i>Cheers</i> with an already recurring role on <i>The Simpsons</i> (he voiced the recurring character <!--del_lnk--> Sideshow Bob). The tagline for Moe&#39;s Tavern &quot;Where nobody knows your name&quot; is also a reference to <i>Cheers</i>. Characters also had crossovers with <i><!--del_lnk--> Wings</i>&mdash;which was created by <i>Cheers</i> producers/writers&mdash;and <i><!--del_lnk--> St. Elsewhere</i> in a somewhat rare comedy-drama crossover. The <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek__Deep_Space_Nine.htm" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></i> character <!--del_lnk--> Morn, who remained mostly at <!--del_lnk--> Quark&#39;s Bar, is named (as an <!--del_lnk--> anagram) for Norm Peterson.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Scrubs</i> <!--del_lnk--> episode <!--del_lnk--> &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; makes numerous jokes about <i>Cheers</i> and <!--del_lnk--> multicamera setup <!--del_lnk--> laugh track sitcoms. <i>Scrubs</i> is notable for using a <!--del_lnk--> single camera setup, no laugh track, and not being filmed before a live audience. <i>Cheers</i> had all three and a dream sequence in &quot;My Life in Four Cameras&quot; was shot with all three also. In addition, the main patient treated was fictional <i>Cheers</i> writer &quot;Charles James&quot;, a mixture of <i>Cheers</i> three creators James Burrows, Glen Charles, and Les Charles. The episode makes repeated comments about these &quot;traditional&quot; sitcoms and ends with the opening bars of <i>Cheers</i> theme playing with the quote &quot;Unfortunately, around here things don&#39;t always end as neat and tidy as they do in sitcoms.&quot;<p>The bar from <i>Cheers</i> and its patrons were also featured in a scene in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Wonderful World of Disney</i> TV special <i><!--del_lnk--> Mickey&#39;s 60th Birthday</i>.<p><a id="Syndication_and_home_video" name="Syndication_and_home_video"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Syndication and home video</span></h2>
      <p><i>Cheers</i> grew in popularity as it aired on American television and entered into syndication. When the show went off the air in 1993, <i>Cheers</i> was syndicated in 38 countries with 179 American television markets and 83 million viewers. Then, after going off the air, <i>Cheers</i> entered a long, successful, and continuing syndication run on <i><!--del_lnk--> Nick at Nite</i>. While the quality of some earlier footage of <i>Cheers</i> had begun to degrade, it underwent a careful restoration in 2001 due to its continued success. Notably, a <i>Cheers</i> rerun replaced <i><!--del_lnk--> Australia&#39;s Naughtiest Home Videos</i> on Australia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Nine Network. The latter was cancelled mid-episode on its only broadcast by <!--del_lnk--> Kerry Packer, who pulled the plug after a phone call. <i>Cheers</i> was aired by <!--del_lnk--> NCRV in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. After the last episode, NCRV simply began re-airing the series, and then again, thus airing the show three times in a row, showing an episode nightly.<p><a id="DVD_releases" name="DVD_releases"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">DVD releases</span></h3>

      <p><i>Cheers</i> was a successful enough show to launch the careers of several young actors. Grammer was arguably the most successful with his spin-off <i><!--del_lnk--> Frasier</i>, which lasted for the same eleven-season run <i>Cheers</i> had. By the final season of <i>Frasier</i>, Grammer had become the highest paid actor on television, earning about <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>1.6 million an episode. Harrelson has also had a successful career following <i>Cheers</i>, including appearances in a number of notable films that have established him as a box-office draw. He also earned an <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award nomination in 1997 for <i><!--del_lnk--> The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>. Danson, who had been the highest paid <i>Cheers</i> cast member earning $450,000 an episode in the final season, has starred in the successful sitcom <i><!--del_lnk--> Becker</i> as well as the unsuccessful sitcom &quot;Ink,&quot; but has had few starring film roles, including a cameo in the 1998 Steven Spielberg film <!--del_lnk--> Saving Private Ryan. Ratzenberger has voice acted in all of <!--del_lnk--> Pixar&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> computer-animated feature films and currently hosts the <!--del_lnk--> Travel Channel show <i><!--del_lnk--> Made in America</i>. On <i>Made in America</i> he travels around the U.S. showing the stories of small towns and the goods they produce. Coincidentally, Ted Danson starred in a film also called <i><!--del_lnk--> Made in America</i>. Bebe Neuwirth has gone on to star in numerous <!--del_lnk--> Broadway musicals, earning two <!--del_lnk--> Tony Awards for her work. She also did voice work for <i>All Dogs Go To Heaven 2</i> and <i>All Dogs Go To Heaven the TV series</i>. Kirstie Alley starred in the TV series <i><!--del_lnk--> Veronica&#39;s Closet</i> as well as numerous <!--del_lnk--> miniseries and film roles. Although some believe Shelley Long leaving the show was a bad career move, she has gone on to star in several television and film roles, notably <i><!--del_lnk--> The Brady Bunch Movie</i> and its sequel.<p>In addition to continuing careers after <i>Cheers</i>, some of the cast members have had personal problems. In 2004 Shelley Long grew <!--del_lnk--> depressed after divorcing her husband of 23 years and appears to have attempted suicide by overdosing on drugs. Kirstie Alley gained a significant amount of weight after <i>Cheers</i>, which somewhat affected her career. She went on to write and star in a sitcom partly based on her life and weight gain, <i><!--del_lnk--> Fat Actress</i>. She has recently become a spokeswoman for Jenny Craig.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Host Marriott Corporation installed 46 bars modeled after <i>Cheers</i> in their hotel and airport lounges. <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures licensed the characters and details of the show, allowing the bars to have fake memorabilia such as Sam Malone&#39;s supposed jersey while playing for the Red Sox. Among the details Marriott included were two robots, &quot;Bob&quot; and &quot;Hank&quot;, one of which was heavy (resembling <!--del_lnk--> Norm Peterson), with the other wearing a postal uniform (<!--del_lnk--> Cliff Clavin).<p>Ratzenberger and Wendt filed a groundbreaking <!--del_lnk--> lawsuit against Paramount in 1993 (around the time that <!--del_lnk--> Viacom purchased Paramount), claiming that the company was illegally licensing and earning off their images without their permission. Ratzenberger and Wendt claimed that Paramount could not earn off of their images simply because the robots are dressed like the characters Paramount still holds rights over. The case was dismissed by a <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Superior Court judge in 1996, though a <!--del_lnk--> federal judge reinstated the case in the Los Angeles court. Paramount tried to bring the case before the <a href="../../wp/s/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>, but the court refused to hear the case, instead merely reaffirming the ruling to reinstate the case in the Superior Court. Some believe the case could have had significant implications in <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood, as its outcome would have determined whether rights over a character imply rights to reproduce the actor&#39;s image with or without his or her permission, so long as the image is of the actor as the character. However, Paramount settled with the two before the suit was ruled on.<p>In addition to the characters, the <i>Cheers</i> <!--del_lnk--> opening sequence and theme song has become iconic. Because of this, the sequence is a common target for <!--del_lnk--> parody, such as on <i>The Simpsons&#39;</i> episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Flaming Moe&#39;s&quot;.<p><a id="Outside_the_bar" name="Outside_the_bar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Outside the bar</span></h3>
      <p>The first year of the show took place entirely within the confines of the bar - the first location outside the bar ever seen was Diane&#39;s apartment. When the series became a hit, the characters started venturing further afield, first to other sets and eventually to an occasional exterior location. The exterior location shots of the bar were actually of the Bull &amp; Finch Pub, north of <!--del_lnk--> Boston Common, which has become a <!--del_lnk--> tourist attraction because of its association with the series and draws in nearly a million visitors annually. It has since been renamed Cheers Beacon Hill, though its interior is different from the TV bar. To further capitalize on the show&#39;s popularity, another bar, Cheers Faneuil Hall, was built to be a replica of the show&#39;s set to provide tourists with a bar whose interior was closer to the one they saw on TV. It is near <!--del_lnk--> Faneuil Hall, about a mile from the Bull &amp; Finch Pub. In 1997 Europe&#39;s first officially licensed Cheers bar opened in London&#39;s Regent&#39;s Street W1. Like Cheers Faneuil Hall, Cheers London is an exact replica of the set. The gala opening was attended by James Burrows and cast members <!--del_lnk--> George Wendt and <!--del_lnk--> John Ratzenberger. The actual bar set is now on permanent display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum.<br clear="all" />
