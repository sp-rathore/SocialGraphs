      <p>The <b>Crusades</b> were a series of military campaigns conducted in the name of <!--del_lnk--> Christendom and usually sanctioned by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a>. They were military campaigns of a <!--del_lnk--> religious character typically characterized as being waged against <!--del_lnk--> pagans, <!--del_lnk--> heretics, <!--del_lnk--> Muslims or those under the ban of <!--del_lnk--> excommunication. When originally conceived, the aim was to recapture <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Land from the <!--del_lnk--> Muslims while supporting the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> against the &quot;<i><!--del_lnk--> ghazwat</i>&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuq  expansion into <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia. The <!--del_lnk--> fourth crusade however was diverted and resulted in the conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople. Later crusades were launched against various targets outside of the Levant for a mixture of religious, economic, and political reasons, such as the <a href="../../wp/a/Albigensian_Crusade.htm" title="Albigensian Crusade">Albigensian Crusade</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Aragonese Crusade, and the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Crusades.<p>Beyond the medieval military events, the word &quot;crusade&quot; has evolved to have multiple meanings and connotations. For additional meanings, see <!--del_lnk--> usage of the term &quot;crusade&quot; below and/or the <!--del_lnk--> dictionary definition.<p>

       <dd><i>It is necessary to look for the origin of a crusading ideal in the struggle between Christians and Muslims in Spain and consider how the idea of a holy war emerged from this background.</i> &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Norman F. Cantor</dl>
      <p><a id="Western_European_origins" name="Western_European_origins"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Western European origins</span></h3>
      <p>The origins of the crusades lie in developments in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe earlier in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, as well as the deteriorating situation of the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in the east, due to a new wave of Turkish Muslim attacks. The breakdown of the <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian Empire in the later 9th century, combined with the relative stabilisation of local European borders after the Christianisation of the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Slavs, and <!--del_lnk--> Magyars, had as one side-effect produced a large class of armed warriors whose energies were misplaced fighting one another and terrorizing the local populace. The Church tried to stem this violence with the <!--del_lnk--> Peace and Truce of God movements, which was somewhat successful, but trained warriors always sought an outlet for their violence and opportunities for territorial expansion were becoming less attractive for large segments of the nobility. One exception was the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reconquista</i> in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, which at times occupied Iberian <!--del_lnk--> knights and some <!--del_lnk--> mercenaries from elsewhere in Europe in the fight against the Islamic <!--del_lnk--> Moors, who had attacked and successfully overrun most of the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula over the preceding two centuries.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1009, the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimid <!--del_lnk--> caliph <!--del_lnk--> al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah sacked the pilgrimage hospice in Jerusalem and destroyed the <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Holy Sepulchre. al-Hakim&#39;s successors allowed it to be rebuilt later by the Byzantine emperor, but this event was remembered in Europe and may have helped spark the crusades. In 1063, <!--del_lnk--> Pope Alexander II had given papal blessing to Iberian <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> in their wars against the Muslims, granting both a papal standard (the <i>vexillum sancti Petri</i>) and an <!--del_lnk--> indulgence to those who were killed in battle. Pleas from the Byzantine Emperors, now threatened under by the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuks, thus fell on ready ears. These occurred in 1074, from Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Michael VII to <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory VII and in 1095, from Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Alexius I Comnenus to <!--del_lnk--> Pope Urban II.<p>The Crusades were, in part, an outlet for an intense religious piety which rose up in the late 11th century among the lay public. A crusader would, after pronouncing a solemn vow, receive a cross from the hands of the pope or his <!--del_lnk--> legates, and was thenceforth considered a &quot;soldier of the Church&quot;. This was due in part to the <!--del_lnk--> Investiture Controversy, which had started around 1075 and was still on-going during the First Crusade. <!--del_lnk--> Christendom had emerged as a political conception that supposed the union of all peoples and sovereigns under the direction of the pope and had been greatly affected by the Investiture Controversy; as both sides tried to marshal public opinion in their favour, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. The result was an awakening of intense Christian piety and public interest in religious affairs. This was further strengthened by religious propaganda, advocating <!--del_lnk--> Just War in order to retake the Holy Land, which included <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> (where the death, resurrection and ascension into heaven of Jesus took place according to Christian theology) and <!--del_lnk--> Antioch (the first Christian city), from the Muslims. All of this eventually manifested in the overwhelming popular support for the First Crusade, and the religious vitality of the 12th century.<p><a id="Middle_Eastern_situation" name="Middle_Eastern_situation"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Middle Eastern situation</span></h3>
      <p>This background in the Christian West must be contrasted with that in the Muslim East. Muslim presence in the Holy Land goes back to the initial <!--del_lnk--> Arab conquest of <!--del_lnk--> Palestine in the 7th century. This did not interfere much with <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage to Christian holy sites or the security of monasteries and Christian communities in the Holy Land of Christendom, and western Europeans were not much concerned with the loss of far-away <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> when, in the ensuing decades and centuries, they were themselves faced with invasions by Muslims and other hostile non-Christians, such as the Vikings and Magyars. However, the Muslim armies&#39; successes were putting strong pressure on the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire.<p>The turning point in western attitudes towards the east came in the year 1009, when the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimid caliph of <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, had the <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Holy Sepulchre in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> destroyed. His successor permitted the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> to rebuild it under stringent circumstances, and pilgrimage was again permitted, but many reports began to circulate in the <!--del_lnk--> West about the cruelty of Muslims toward Christian pilgrims; these accounts from returning pilgrims then played an important role in the development of the crusades later in the century.<h3><span class="mw-headline">After the First Crusade</span></h3>
      <p>On a popular level, the first crusades unleashed a wave of impassioned, personally felt pious Christian fury that was expressed in the massacres of Jews that accompanied the movement of the Crusader mobs through Europe, as well as the violent treatment of &quot;schismatic&quot; Orthodox Christians of the east. The violence against the Orthodox Christians culminated in the sack of Constantinople in 1204, in which most of the Crusading armies took part. It should be noted, however that during many of the attacks on Jews, local Bishops and Christians made attempts to protect Jews from the mobs that were passing through. Jews were often offered sanctuary in churches and other Christian buildings, but the mobs broke in and killed them anyway.<p>The 13th century crusades never expressed such a popular fever, and after Acre fell for the last time in 1291, and after the extermination of the Occitan <!--del_lnk--> Cathars in the <a href="../../wp/a/Albigensian_Crusade.htm" title="Albigensian Crusade">Albigensian Crusade</a>, the crusading ideal became devalued by Papal justifications of political and territorial aggressions within Catholic Europe.<p>The last crusading order of knights to hold territory were the <!--del_lnk--> Knights Hospitaller. After the final fall of Acre, they took control of the island of <!--del_lnk--> Rhodes, and in the sixteenth century, were driven to <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a>. These last crusaders were finally unseated by <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in 1798.<p><a id="A_list_of_the_crusades" name="A_list_of_the_crusades"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">A list of the crusades</span></h2>
      <p>A traditional numbering scheme for the crusades gives us nine during the 11th to 13th centuries, as well as other smaller crusades that are mostly contemporaneous and unnumbered. There were frequent &quot;minor&quot; crusades throughout this period, not only in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine, but also in the Iberian Peninsula and central Europe, against not only Muslims, but also Christian heretics and personal enemies of the Papacy or other powerful monarchs. Such &quot;crusades&quot; continued into the 16th century, until the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Reformation when the political and religious climate of Europe was significantly different to that of the Middle Ages. The following is a list of crusades.<p><a id="First_Crusade_1095.E2.80.931099" name="First_Crusade_1095.E2.80.931099"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">First Crusade 1095&ndash;1099</span></h3>

Crusader armies managed to defeat two substantial Turkish forces at <!--del_lnk--> Dorylaeum and at <a href="../../wp/s/Siege_of_Antioch.htm" title="Siege of Antioch">Antioch</a>, finally marching to Jerusalem with only a fraction of their original forces. In 1099, they <!--del_lnk--> took Jerusalem by assault and massacred the population. As a result of the First Crusade, several small <!--del_lnk--> Crusader states were created, notably the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Jerusalem.<p><a id="Crusade_of_1101" name="Crusade_of_1101"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Crusade of 1101</span></h4>
      <p><i>Full article: <!--del_lnk--> Crusade of 1101</i><p>Following this crusade there was a second, less successful wave of crusaders.

A new crusade was called for by various preachers, most notably by <!--del_lnk--> Bernard of Clairvaux. French and German armies, under the Kings <!--del_lnk--> Louis VII and <!--del_lnk--> Conrad III respectively, marched to Jerusalem in 1147, but failed to accomplish any major successes, and indeed endangered the survival of the Crusader states with a strategically foolish attack on <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. By 1150, both leaders had returned to their countries without any result.<p><a id="Third_Crusade_1189.E2.80.931192" name="Third_Crusade_1189.E2.80.931192"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Third Crusade 1189&ndash;1192</span></h3>
      <p><i>Full article: <!--del_lnk--> Third Crusade</i><p>Also known as the Kings&#39; Crusade. In 1187, <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, Sultan of Egypt, recaptured <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory VIII called for a crusade, which was led by several of Europe&#39;s most important leaders: <!--del_lnk--> Philip II of France, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard I of England</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Frederick drowned in <!--del_lnk--> Cilicia in 1190, leaving an unstable alliance between the English and the French. Philip left, in 1191, after the Crusaders had recaptured Acre from the Muslims. The Crusader army headed down the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. They defeated the Muslims near Arsuf and were in sight of Jerusalem. However, the inability of the Crusaders to thrive in the locale due to inadequate food and water resulted in an empty victory. Richard left the following year after establishing a truce with Saladin. On Richard&#39;s way home, his ship was wrecked and he ended up in Austria, where his enemy, Duke Leopold, captured him. The Duke delivered Richard to Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Henry VI, who held the King for ransom. By 1197, Henry felt himself ready for a Crusade, but he died in the same year of malaria. Richard I died during fighting in Europe and never returned to the Holy Land.<p><a id="Fourth_Crusade_1201.E2.80.931204" name="Fourth_Crusade_1201.E2.80.931204"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Fourth Crusade 1201&ndash;1204</span></h3>
      <p><i>Full article: <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Crusade</i><p>The Fourth Crusade was initiated in 1202 by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Innocent III, with the intention of invading the Holy Land through Egypt. The <!--del_lnk--> Venetians, under <!--del_lnk--> Doge <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Dandolo, gained control of this crusade and diverted it first to the Christian city of Zara (<!--del_lnk--> Zadar), then to <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople, where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne.

The story is that an outburst of the old popular enthusiasm led a gathering of children in France and Germany, which <!--del_lnk--> Pope Innocent III interpreted as a reproof from heaven to their unworthy elders. The leader of the French army, Stephen, led 30,000 children. The leader of the German army, Nicholas, led 7,000 children. None of the children actually reached the Holy Land; they were either sold as slaves, settled along the route to <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, or died of hunger during the journey.<p><a id="Fifth_Crusade_1217.E2.80.931221" name="Fifth_Crusade_1217.E2.80.931221"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Fifth Crusade 1217&ndash;1221</span></h3>
      <p><i>Full article: <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Crusade</i><p>By processions, prayers, and preaching, the Church attempted to set another crusade on foot, and the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) formulated a plan for the recovery of the Holy Land.

This battle is considered by many historians to have been the death knell to the Kingdom of Outremer.

These Crusades ranged from the 12th century, contemporaneous with the Second Crusade, to the 16th century.<p>Between 1232 and 1234, there was a crusade against the <!--del_lnk--> Stedingers. This crusade was special, because the Stedingers were not heathens or heretics, but fellow Roman Catholics. They were free <!--del_lnk--> Frisian farmers who resented attempts of the count of <!--del_lnk--> Oldenburg and the archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Bremen-Hamburg to make an end to their freedoms. The archbishop excommunicated them and the pope declared a crusade in 1232. The Stedingers were defeated in 1234.<p><a id="Other_crusades" name="Other_crusades"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Other crusades</span></h3>

      <p>In the 14th century, Khan <!--del_lnk--> Tokhtamysh combined the Blue and White Hordes forming the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horde. It seemed that the power of the Golden Horde had begun to rise, but in 1389, Tokhtamysh made the disastrous decision of waging war on his former master, the great <!--del_lnk--> Tamerlane. Tamerlane&#39;s hordes rampaged through southern Russia, crippling the Golden Horde&#39;s economy and practically wiping out its defenses in those lands.<p>After losing the war, Tokhtamysh was then dethroned by the party of Khan Temur Kutlugh and Emir Edigu, supported by <!--del_lnk--> Tamerlane. When Tokhtamysh asked <!--del_lnk--> Vytautas the Great for assistance in retaking the Horde, the latter readily gathered a huge army which included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, Russians, Mongols, Moldavians, Poles, Romanians and <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic knights.<p>In 1398, the huge army moved from Moldavia and conquered the southern steppe all the way to the <!--del_lnk--> Dnieper River and northern <!--del_lnk--> Crimea. Inspired by their great successes, Vytautas declared a &#39;Crusade against the Tatars&#39; with Papal backing. Thus, in 1399, the army of Vytautas once again moved on the Horde. His army met the Horde&#39;s at the <!--del_lnk--> Vorskla River, slightly inside Lithuanian territory.<p>Although the Lithuanian army was well equipped with <!--del_lnk--> cannons, it could not resist a rear attack from Edigu&#39;s reserve units. Vytautas hardly escaped alive. Many princes of his kin&mdash;possibly as many as 20&mdash;were killed (as for example, <!--del_lnk--> Stefan Musat, Prince of <!--del_lnk--> Moldavia and two of his brothers, while a fourth was badly injured ), and the victorious Tatars besieged <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>. &quot;And the Christian blood flowed like water, up to the Kievan walls,&quot; as one chronicler put it. Meanwhile, Temur Kutlugh died from the wounds received in the battle, and Tokhtamysh was killed by one of his own men.<p><a id="Crusades_in_the_Balkans" name="Crusades_in_the_Balkans"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Crusades in the Balkans</span></h4>
      <p>To counter the expanding <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, several crusades were launched in the XV. century. The most notable are:<ul>
       <li>the <b>Crusade of Nicopolis</b> (1396) organized by <!--del_lnk--> Sigismund of Luxemburg king of Hungary culminated in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Nicopolis. It is often called the last of the crusades.<li>the <b>Crusade of Varna</b> (1444) led by the Polish-Hungarian king <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Warne&#x144;czyk ended in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Varna<li>and the <b>Crusade of 1456</b> organized to lift the <!--del_lnk--> Siege of Belgrade led by <!--del_lnk--> John Hunyadi and <!--del_lnk--> Giovanni da Capistrano</ul>

      <p>The Hussite Crusade(s), also known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hussite Wars,&quot; or the &quot;Bohemian Wars,&quot; involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia in the period 1420 to circa 1434. The Hussite Wars were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as muskets made a decisive contribution. The Hussite warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armoured knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In the end, it was an inconclusive war.<p><a id="The_Swedish_Crusades" name="The_Swedish_Crusades"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">The Swedish Crusades</span></h4>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> conquest of <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> has traditionally been divided into three &quot;crusades&quot;: the <!--del_lnk--> First Swedish Crusade around 1155 CE, the <!--del_lnk--> Second Swedish Crusade about 1249 CE and the <!--del_lnk--> Third Swedish Crusade in 1293 CE.<p>The first crusade is purely legendary, and according to most historians today, never took place as described in the legend and did not result in any ties between Finland and Sweden. For the most part, it was made up in the late 13th century to date the Swedish rule in Finland further back in time. No historical record has also survived describing the second one, but it probably was done and ended up in the concrete conquest of southwestern Finland. The third one was against <!--del_lnk--> Novgorod, and is properly documented by both parties of the conflict.<p>According to archaeological finds, Finland was largely <!--del_lnk--> Christian already before the said crusades. Thus the &quot;crusades&quot; can rather be seen as ordinary expeditions of conquest whose main target was territorial gain. The expeditions were dubbed as actual crusades only in the 19th century by the national-romanticist Swedish and Finnish historians.<p><a id="Historical_perspectives_on_the_Crusades" name="Historical_perspectives_on_the_Crusades"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Historical perspectives on the Crusades</span></h2>

      <p>Western and Eastern <!--del_lnk--> historiography present variously different views on the Crusades, in large part because &quot;crusade&quot; invokes dramatically opposed sets of associations - &quot;crusade&quot; as a valiant struggle for a supreme cause, and &quot;crusade&quot; as a byword for barbarism and aggression. This contrasting view is not recent, as Christians have in the past struggled with the tension of military activity and teachings of Christ to &quot;love ones enemies&quot; and to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;. For these reasons, the crusades have been controversial even among contemporaries.<p>Western sources speak of both heroism, faith and honour (emphasized in <!--del_lnk--> chivalric romance), but also of acts of brutality. <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Christian chroniclers tell stories of barbarian savagery and brutality.<p>Likewise, some modern historians in the west express moral outrage - for example <!--del_lnk--> Steven Runciman, the leading western historian of the Crusades for much of the 20th century, ended his history with a resounding condemnation:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed.. the Holy War was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God&quot;.</dl>

      <p>One traditional Catholic perspective is presented in the 1908 version of the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Encyclopedia.

      <p>Like Muslims, <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox Christians also see the Crusades as attacks by &quot;the barbarian West&quot;, but centered on the sack of <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople in 1204. Many relics and artifacts taken from Constantinople are still in the West, in the <a href="../../wp/v/Vatican_City.htm" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> and elsewhere. Disagreement currently exists between modern Turks and Greeks over the claimant rights to the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Horses on the facade of <!--del_lnk--> St. Mark&#39;s in <!--del_lnk--> Venice. The Greeks argue that the frieze is inherently part of Greek culture and identity, similar to the &quot;Elgin&quot; Marbles and the Turks counter that the freize originated from what is now modern-day <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. A picture of Turkish popular history of the Crusades can be assembled by compiling text of official Turkish brochures on Crusader fortifications in the Aegean coast and coastal islands.<p>Countries of Central Europe, despite the fact that they also belonged to <!--del_lnk--> Western Christianity, were the most skeptical about the idea of Crusades. Many cities in <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> were sacked by passing bands of Crusaders; <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Polish</a> Prince <!--del_lnk--> Leszek I the White refused to join a Crusade, allegedly because of the lack of <!--del_lnk--> mead in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine. Later on, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poles</a> were themselves subject to conquest from the Crusaders (see <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Order), and therefore championed the notion that <!--del_lnk--> pagans have the right to live in peace and have property rights to their lands (see <!--del_lnk--> Pawel Wlodkowic).<p><a id="Popular_reputation_in_Western_Europe" name="Popular_reputation_in_Western_Europe"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Popular reputation in Western Europe</span></h3>
      <p>In Western Europe, the Crusades have traditionally been regarded by laypeople as heroic adventures, though the mass enthusiasm of common people was largely expended in the First Crusade, from which so few of their class returned. Today, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Saracen&quot; adversary is crystallized in the lone figure of <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>; his adversary <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_I_of_England.htm" title="Richard I of England">Richard the Lionheart</a> is, in the English-speaking world, the archetypical crusader king, while <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Barbarossa (<i>illustration, below left</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> Louis IX fill the same symbolic niche in German and French culture. Even in contemporary areas, the crusades and their leaders were romanticized in popular literature; the <i><!--del_lnk--> Chanson d&#39;Antioche</i> was a <!--del_lnk--> chanson de geste dealing with the First Crusade, and the <!--del_lnk--> Song of Roland, dealing with the era of the similarly romanticized <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, was directly influenced by the experience of the crusades, going so far as to replace Charlemagne&#39;s historic <!--del_lnk--> Basque opponents with Muslims.

      <p>The Crusades have been remembered relatively favourably in western Europe (countries which were, at the time of the Crusades, Roman Catholic countries).

      <p>The Crusades had an enormous influence on the European <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>. At times, much of the continent was united under a powerful <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">Papacy</a>, but by the 14th century, the development of centralized bureaucracies (the foundation of the modern <!--del_lnk--> nation-state) was well on its way in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Burgundy, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Castile, and <!--del_lnk--> Aragon partly because of the dominance of the church at the beginning of the crusading era.<p>Although <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> had been exposed to <!--del_lnk--> Islamic culture for centuries through contacts in <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, much knowledge in areas such as science, medicine, and architecture, was transferred from the <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> to the western world during the crusade era.<p>The military experiences of the crusades also had their effects in Europe; for example, European <!--del_lnk--> castles became massive stone structures, as they were in the east, rather than smaller wooden buildings as they had typically been in the past.<p>In addition, the Crusades are seen as having opened up European culture to the world, especially Asia:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Along with trade, new scientific discoveries and inventions made their way east or west.

This also aided in the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> in Italy, as various Italian <!--del_lnk--> city-states from the very beginning had important and profitable trading colonies in the crusader states, both in the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Land and later in captured <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> territory.<p>Increased trade brought many things to Europeans that were once unknown or extremely rare and costly.

      <p>Despite the ultimate defeat in the Middle East, the Crusaders were successful in regaining the Iberian Peninsula permanently and slowed down the military expansion of Islam.<p>The successful international coordination of Crusading forces from different countries, and the reduction (not cessation) in fighting between Christian monarchs that the crusading ideal encouraged, allowed Christian Europe to remain strong in the face of Muslim military expansionism. It is therefore likely that a considerable part of modern Christian Europe (particularly Spain, Portugal, and the Balkans) would be Muslim today had the Crusades not occurred, and it is furthermore possible that Christianity might have been largely replaced by Islam throughout Europe. (This is one traditional Roman Catholic perspective: See below.)<p>The achievement of preserving Christian Europe must not, however, ignore the eventual fall of the Christian <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, which was in large part due to the <!--del_lnk--> Fourth Crusade&#39;s extreme aggression against <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox Christianity, largely at the instigation of the infamous <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Dandolo, the <!--del_lnk--> Doge of Venice and financial backer of the Fourth Crusade. The Byzantine lands had been a stable Christian state since the fourth century. After the Crusaders took Constantinople in 1204, the Byzantines never again had as large or strong a state and finally fell in 1453.<p>Taking into account the fall of the Byzantines, the Crusades could be portrayed as the defence of <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism against the violent expansion of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, rather than the defence of <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> as a whole against Islamic expansion. On the other hand, the Fourth Crusade could be presented as an anomaly. It is also possible to find a compromise between these two points of view, specifically that the Crusades were Roman Catholic campaigns which primarily sought to fight Islam to preserve Catholicism, and secondarily sought to thereby protect the rest of Christianity; in this context, the Fourth Crusade&#39;s crusaders could have felt compelled to abandon the secondary aim in order to retain <!--del_lnk--> Dandolo&#39;s absolutely essential logistical support in achieving the primary aim. Even so, the Fourth Crusade was condemned by the Pope of the time, and is now generally remembered throughout Europe as a disgraceful failure.<p><a id="Islamic_world" name="Islamic_world"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Islamic world</span></h3>
      <p>The crusades had profound but localized effects upon the Islamic world, where the equivalents of &quot;Franks&quot; and &quot;Crusaders&quot; remained expressions of disdain.

In the 21st century, some in the Arab world, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Arab independence movement and <!--del_lnk--> Pan-Islamism movement, continue to call Western involvement in the Middle East a &quot;crusade&quot;.

They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Innocent III and formed the turning-point in medieval <!--del_lnk--> anti-Semitism.<p>The Crusading period brought with it many narratives from Jewish sources. Among the better-known Jewish narratives are the chronicles of Solomon Bar Simson and Rabbi Eliezer bar Nathan, The Narrative of the Old Persecutions by Mainz Anonymous, and Sefer Zekhirah, and The Book of Remembrance, by Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn.<p><a id="The_Caucasus" name="The_Caucasus"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The Caucasus</span></h3>

Russian serviceman and ethnographer <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Zisserman who spent 25 years (1842&ndash;67) in the Caucasus, believed the exotic group of Georgian highlanders were descendants of the last Crusaders based on their customs, language, art and other evidence. American traveler <!--del_lnk--> Richard Halliburton (1900&ndash;1939) saw and recorded the customs of the tribe in 1935.<p><a id="Etymology_and_use_of_the_term_.22crusade.22" name="Etymology_and_use_of_the_term_.22crusade.22"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Etymology and use of the term &quot;crusade&quot;</span></h2>
      <p>The crusades were never referred to as such by their participants. The original crusaders were known by various terms, including <i>fideles Sancti Petri</i> (the faithful of St. Peter) or <i>milites Christi</i> (knights of Christ). They saw themselves as undertaking an <i>iter</i>, a journey, or a <i>peregrinatio</i>, a pilgrimage, though pilgrims were usually forbidden from carrying arms. Like pilgrims, each crusader swore a vow (a <i>votus</i>), to be fulfilled on successfully reaching Jerusalem, and they were granted a cloth cross (<i>crux</i>) to be sewn into their clothes. This &quot;taking of the cross&quot;, the <i>crux</i>, eventually became associated with the entire journey; the word &quot;crusade&quot; (coming into English from the French <i>croisade</i>, the Italian <i>crociata</i>, or the Portuguese <i>cruzada</i>) developed from this.<p>Since the 17th century, the term &quot;crusade&quot; has carried a connotation in the <!--del_lnk--> West of being a righteous campaign, usually to &quot;root out <!--del_lnk--> evil&quot;, or to fight for a just cause. In a non-historical common or theological use, &quot;crusade&quot; has come to have a much broader emphatic or religious meaning &mdash;substantially removed from &quot;armed struggle.&quot;<p>In a broader sense, &quot;crusade&quot; can be used, always in a <!--del_lnk--> rhetorical and <!--del_lnk--> metaphorical sense, to identify as righteous any <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a> that is given a <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religious</a> justification.<p>Ardent activists may also refer to their causes as &quot;crusades,&quot; as in the &quot;Crusade against Adult Illiteracy,&quot; or a &quot;Crusade against Littering.&quot; In recent years, however, the use of &quot;crusade&quot; as a positive term has become less frequent in order to avoid giving offense to Muslims or others offended by the term. The term may also sarcastically or pejoratively characterize the <!--del_lnk--> zealotry of agenda promoters, for example with the monicker &quot;Public Crusader&quot; or the campaigns &quot;Crusade against abortion,&quot; and the &quot;Crusade for prayer in public schools.&quot;<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades&quot;</div>
