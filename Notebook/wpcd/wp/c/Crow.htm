      <p>There is no good systematic approach to the genus at present. Generally, it is assumed that the species from a geographical area are more closely related to each other than to other lineages, but this is not necessarily correct. For example, while the Carrion/Collared/House Crow complex is certainly closely related to each other, the situation is not at all clear regarding the Australian/Melanesian species.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Neogene fossil record of crows is rather dense in Europe, but the relationships among most prehistoric species is not clear. Jackdaw-, crow- and raven-sized forms seem to have existed since long ago and crows were regularly hunted by humans up to the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, documenting the evolution of the modern taxa. American crows are not as well-documented.<p>A surprisingly high number of species have become <!--del_lnk--> extinct after human colonization; the loss of one prehistoric Caribbean crow could also have been related to the <!--del_lnk--> last ice age&#39;s climate changes.<p><a id="Species" name="Species"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Species</span></h3>

      <p><a id="Calls" name="Calls"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Calls</span></h3>
      <p>Crows make a wide variety of calls or vocalizations. Whether the crows&#39; system of communication constitutes a <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> is a topic of debate and study. Crows have also been observed to respond to calls of other species; this behaviour is presumably learned because it varies regionally. Crows&#39; vocalizations are complex and poorly understood. Some of the many vocalizations that crows make are a &quot;caw&quot;, usually echoed back and forth between birds, a series of &quot;caws&quot; in discrete units, counting out numbers, a long caw followed by a series of short caws (usually made when a bird takes off from a perch), an echo-like &quot;eh-aw&quot; sound, and more. These vocalizations vary by species, and within each species vary regionally. In many species, the pattern and number of the numerical vocalizations have been observed to change in response to events in the surroundings (i.e. arrival or departure of crows). Crows can hear sound frequencies lower than those that humans can hear, which complicates the study of their vocalizations.<p><a id="Intelligence" name="Intelligence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Intelligence</span></h3>

      <p>As a group, the crows show remarkable examples of intelligence. They top the <!--del_lnk--> avian IQ scale<!--del_lnk--> . Crows and ravens often score very highly on intelligence tests. Crows in the northwestern U.S. (a blend of <i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i> and <i>Corvus caurinus</i>) show modest linguistic capabilities and the ability to relay information over great distances, live in complex, hierarchic societies involving hundreds of individuals with various &quot;occupations&quot;, and have an intense rivalry with the area&#39;s less socially advanced ravens. One species, the <!--del_lnk--> New Caledonian Crow, has recently been intensively studied because of its ability to manufacture and use its own <!--del_lnk--> tools in the day-to-day search for food. Wild <!--del_lnk--> hooded crows in Israel have learned to use bread crumbs for bait-fishing. Crows will engage in a kind of midair <!--del_lnk--> jousting, or air-&quot;<!--del_lnk--> chicken&quot; to establish pecking order.<p><a id="Color_and_society" name="Color_and_society"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colour and society</span></h3>
      <p><b>Extra-specific uses of colour in crow societies<br /></b> Many crow species are all black. Most of their natural enemies, the <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">raptors</a> or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> falconiformes&quot;, soar high above the trees, and hunt primarily on bright, sunny days when contrast between light and shadow is greatest. Crows take advantage of this by maneuvering themselves through the dappled shades of the trees, where their black colour renders them effectively invisible to their enemies above, in order to set up complex ambush attacks. Thus, their black coloring is of great strategic importance to their societies. It is perhaps here where we find the greatest difference between ravens and crows; <a href="../../wp/r/Raven.htm" title="Raven">ravens</a> tend to soar high in the air as raptors do, and like raptors, are usually the target of ambushes by crows. Crows do not appear to perceive ravens as their own kind, but instead treat them as raptors. <p>While hawks tend to be the primary daytime predators of crows, their most deadly predators, in many areas, are the owls that hunt by night, preying upon crows sleeping helplessly in their roosts. Presumably their dark colour is particularly helpful in blending into nighttime shadows. Crows also will often mob owls much more fiercely when they find them in daylight than they do hawks and other raptors. Frequently crows appear to &quot;play&quot; with hawks, taking turns &quot;<!--del_lnk--> counting coup&quot; while escorting the raptor out of their territory. Their attacks on owls, on the other hand, possess a definite serious quality.<p><b>Intra-specific uses of colour in crow societies</b><br /> Even in species characterized by being all black, one will still occasionally find variations, most of which appear to result from varying degrees of <a href="../../wp/a/Albinism.htm" title="Albinism">albinism</a>, such as:<ul>
       <li>an otherwise all-black crow stunningly contrasted by a full set of brilliant, pure-white primary feathers.<li>complete covering in varying shades of grey (generally tending toward the darker side)<li>blue or red, rather than swarthy eyes (blue being more common than red).<li>Some combination of the above</ul>
      <p>The treatment of these rare individuals may vary from group to group, even within the same species. For example, one such individual may receive special treatment, attention, or care from the others in its group, while another group of the same species might exile such individuals, forcing them to fend for themselves. The reason for such behaviors, and why these behaviors vary as they do, has yet to be studied.<p><a id="Mythology_and_folklore" name="Mythology_and_folklore"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mythology and folklore</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Crows, and especially <a href="../../wp/r/Raven.htm" title="Raven">ravens</a>, often feature in <!--del_lnk--> legends or <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">mythology</a> as <!--del_lnk--> portents or harbingers of doom or <!--del_lnk--> death, because of their dark plumage, unnerving calls, and tendency to eat <!--del_lnk--> carrion. They are commonly thought to circle above scenes of death such as <!--del_lnk--> battles. The <!--del_lnk--> Child ballad <i><!--del_lnk--> The Three Ravens</i> depicts three ravens discussing whether they can eat a dead knight, but finds that his hawk, his hound, and his true love prevent them; in the parody version <i>The Twa Corbies</i>, these guards have already forgotten the dead man, and the ravens can eat their fill. Their depiction of evil has also led to some exaggeration of their appetite. In <!--del_lnk--> Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#39;s Chest, <!--del_lnk--> The Omen II and <!--del_lnk--> Exorcist: The Beginning, crows are shown tearing out people&#39;s eyes while they are still alive. This, of course, does not happen as crows can distinguish between <!--del_lnk--> carrion and living people.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Native American folklore, Crow is often seen as a similar trickster to <!--del_lnk--> Coyote. However, Crow&#39;s tricks tend to be more out of malice and they rarely (if ever) are portrayed as a hero. One possible explanation for this is that crows are often considered a <!--del_lnk--> pest to <!--del_lnk--> crops, which the tribes who came up with the stories featuring Crow needed to survive.<p>In the <i><a href="../../wp/e/Epic_of_Gilgamesh.htm" title="Epic of Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a></i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Chaldean myth, the character <!--del_lnk--> Utnapishtim releases a <a href="../../wp/d/Dove.htm" title="Dove">dove</a> and a raven to find land, similar to what <!--del_lnk--> Noah does in the book of <!--del_lnk--> Genesis. However, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the dove merely circles and returns. Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the raven, who does not return. Utnapishtim extrapolates from this that the raven has found land, which is why it hasn&#39;t returned. This would seem to indicate some acknowledgement of crow intelligence, which may have been apparent even in ancient times, and to some might imply that the higher intelligence of crows, when compared to other birds, is striking enough that it was known even then.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> occult circles, distinctions are sometimes made between crows and ravens. In mythology and folklore as a whole, crows tend to be <!--del_lnk--> symbolic more of the spiritual aspect of death, or the transition of the spirit into the <!--del_lnk--> afterlife, whereas ravens tend more often to be associated with the negative (physical) aspect of death. However, few if any individual mythologies or folklores make such a distinction, and there are ample exceptions. Another reason for this distinction is that while crows are typically highly social animals, ravens don&#39;t seem to congregate in large numbers anywhere but a) near carrion where they meet seemingly by chance, or b) at <!--del_lnk--> cemeteries, where large numbers sometimes live together, even though carrion there is no more available (and probably less attainable) than any road or field. <p>Amongst <!--del_lnk--> Neopagans, crows are often thought to be highly <!--del_lnk--> psychic and are associated with the element of <i><!--del_lnk--> ether</i> or <i>spirit</i>, rather than the element of <i>air</i> as with most other birds. This may in part be due to the long-standing occult tradition of associating the colour black with &quot;the abyss&quot; of infinite knowledge (see <!--del_lnk--> akasha), or perhaps also to the more modern occult belief that wearing the &quot;colour&quot; black aids in <!--del_lnk--> psychic ability, as it absorbs more <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic energy, since surfaces appear black by absorbing all frequencies in the <!--del_lnk--> visible spectrum, reflecting no colour.<p><a id="Gods_and_goddesses_associated_with_crows_and_ravens" name="Gods_and_goddesses_associated_with_crows_and_ravens"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gods and goddesses associated with crows and ravens</span></h3>

In Greek mythology, it was believed that when the crows gave bad news to the goddess Athena, she flew into a rage, and cursed their feathers to be black. Myths in India -Hindu it is believed that people who died will take food and offerings through a variety of crows called &quot;Bali kkakka&quot;. Every year people whose parents or relatives died will offer food to crows as well as cows on the Shradha day.<p><a id="Virus" name="Virus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Virus</span></h2>
      <p>The American crow is very susceptible to the <!--del_lnk--> West Nile virus, a disease just recently introduced in North America. American crows usually die within one week of acquiring the disease with only very few surviving exposure. Crows are so affected by the disease that their deaths are now serving as an indicator of the West Nile Virus&rsquo;activity in an area.<br />
