      <p><b>Coventry</b> is a <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city</a> and <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan borough, in the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands region of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <!--del_lnk--> UK. With a population of 305,000 (2006 estimate) Coventry is the eighth largest city in England and the eleventh largest in the <!--del_lnk--> UK. It is also the second largest city in the English Midlands by population, with residents and those born in the city styling themselves &quot;Coventrians&quot; or in the vernacular &quot;Cov Kids&quot;. It is situated 95 miles (153 km) northwest of London and 19 miles (30 km) east of Birmingham and is notable for being further from the coast than any other British city.<p>Coventry is famous for its involvement in the <!--del_lnk--> British motor industry (see <!--del_lnk--> Coventry motor companies), its <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral and the legendary exploits of <!--del_lnk--> Lady Godiva. Over the years Coventry has developed an international reputation as Europe&#39;s major city of peace and reconciliation and holds an annual Peace Month. <!--del_lnk-->  Coventry has two universities: <!--del_lnk--> Coventry University and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Warwick.<p>

      <p>Coventry is traditionally believed to have been established in the year <!--del_lnk--> 1043 with the founding of a <!--del_lnk--> Benedictine Abbey by <!--del_lnk--> Leofric, Earl of Mercia and his wife <!--del_lnk--> Lady Godiva. Current evidence suggests that this abbey was probably in existence by <!--del_lnk--> 1022, therefore Leofric and Godiva most likely <i>endowed</i> it around 1043. In time, a <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a> was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded.<p>By the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a> Coventry had become an important centre of the <!--del_lnk--> cloth trade, and throughout the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> was one of the largest and most important cities in England. Coventry was granted <a href="../../wp/c/City_status_in_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="City status in the United Kingdom">city status</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1345, and later became a <!--del_lnk--> county in its own right.<p>Hostile attitudes of the cityfolk towards <!--del_lnk--> Royalist prisoners held in Coventry during the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War are believed to have originated the phrase &quot;sent to Coventry&quot;, which in Britain means &quot;to be ostracised&quot;.<p>In the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> Coventry became a major centre of <a href="../../wp/b/Bicycle.htm" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a> manufacture, with the industry being pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Rover. By the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> bicycle manufacture had evolved into <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">motor</a> manufacture, and Coventry became a major centre of the <!--del_lnk--> British motor industry.<p>Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, most notoriously from a massive <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> air raid (the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Coventry Blitz&quot;) on <!--del_lnk--> 14 November <!--del_lnk--> 1940. This destroyed most of the historic city centre and Coventry&#39;s historic <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral. Aside from London and Plymouth, Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was targeted due to its high concentration of armaments, munitions and engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort. Following the raids, the majority of Coventry&#39;s historic buildings could not be saved as they were in ruinous states or were deemed unsafe for any future use.<p>In the postwar years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the <!--del_lnk--> Gibson Plan, gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe) and the much-celebrated new <!--del_lnk--> St Michael&#39;s Cathedral in 1962 (incorporating the world&#39;s largest tapestry).<p>Coventry&#39;s motor industry boomed in during the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s and <!--del_lnk--> 1960s. But during the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s the British motor industry underwent decline and Coventry suffered badly as a result. By the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s Coventry had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. In recent years the city has recovered with newer industries locating there. Although the motor industry continues to decline.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> St. Michael&#39;s Cathedral is Coventry&#39;s best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The original <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a> cathedral was largely destroyed by German bombing during World War Two, leaving only the outer walls and spire. The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in <!--del_lnk--> 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Basil Spence and contains the tapestry <i>Christ in Glory</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Graham Sutherland and the bronze statue <i>St. Michael&#39;s Victory over the Devil</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Epstein. <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Britten.htm" title="Benjamin Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> War Requiem</i>, regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new Cathedral.<p>The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the Three Spires which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th century, the others being those of Christ Church (of which only the spire survives) and Holy Trinity Church (which is still in use).<p>Another major visitor attraction in Coventry city centre is the free-to-enter <!--del_lnk--> Coventry Transport Museum, which has the largest collection of British-made road vehicles in the world. The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, <!--del_lnk--> Thrust2 and <!--del_lnk--> ThrustSSC. The museum received a major refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a striking new entrance as part of the city&#39;s Phoenix Initiative project. The revamp saw the museum exceed its projected five-year visitor numbers within the first year alone, and it was a finalist for the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Gulbenkian Prize.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Art Gallery and Museum is a major art gallery in the city centre. About 4 miles from the city centre and just outside Coventry in <!--del_lnk--> Baginton is the <!--del_lnk--> Lunt Fort, a reconstructed <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> fort. The <!--del_lnk--> Midland Air Museum is situated just outside Baginton in <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire on land adjacent to <!--del_lnk--> Coventry Airport.<p>The city&#39;s main Police Station in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry&#39;s Police Force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections - one representing the history of the city&#39;s Police Force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force&#39;s history. The museum is funded from charity donations - viewings can be made by appointment.<p>Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative reached the final shortlist for the 2004 <!--del_lnk--> RIBA Stirling Prize and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to <!--del_lnk--> Coventry Canal Basin, coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board.<p>Coventry City Football Club have also recently started playing at their new home, The <!--del_lnk--> Ricoh Arena, a 32,000 capacity stadium in the Foleshill area of the city. The old stadium has now been demolished to make way for new housing.<div class="thumb tright">

The University of Warwick is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research.<p>Many of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as <!--del_lnk--> Finham Park School, which is a Mathematics and IT college and now a teacher training school and <!--del_lnk--> The Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School which has recently become a specialist college of Music, one of only a few in the country. <!--del_lnk--> Bishop Ullathorne RC School became a specialist college in Humanities in 2006. <!--del_lnk--> Woodlands School in Coventry is now also a sports college, which has a newly built sport centre. On the North of the City you can find Exhall Grange School and Science College. <!--del_lnk--> Ernesford Grange School, in the South East, is a specialist science college. <!--del_lnk--> Pattison College, a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts.<p>The Coventry School Foundation is comprised of independent schools <!--del_lnk--> King Henry VIII and <!--del_lnk--> Bablake together with <!--del_lnk--> Coventry Preparatory School.<p>The Woodlands School, which is an all boys&#39; school, and <!--del_lnk--> Tile Hill Wood Girls School are the only single-sex schools left in Coventry.

       <li>During the early 19th century Coventry was well known to the famous author <a href="../../wp/g/George_Eliot.htm" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a> who was born near <!--del_lnk--> Nuneaton. The city was the model for her famous novel <!--del_lnk--> Middlemarch (1871).</ul>

       <li>The Coventry Carol is named after the city of Coventry. It was a carol performed in the play <i>The Pageant of The Shearman and Tailors</i>, written in the 15th century as one of the Coventry Cycle Mystery Plays. These plays depicted the nativity story, the lyrics of the Coventry Carol referring to the Annuciation to the Massacre of the Innocents, which was the basis of the Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors. These plays were traditionally performed on the steps of the (old) Cathedral, and the plays are believed to have been performed for both Richard III in 1484 and Henry VII in 1584.</ul>

       <li>During the late-<!--del_lnk--> 1970s and early-<!--del_lnk--> 1980s, Coventry was the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Two Tone musical phenomenon, with bands such as <!--del_lnk--> The Specials and <!--del_lnk--> The Selecter coming from the city, spawning several major hit singles and albums. The Specials achieved three UK #1 hit singles between 1979 - 1981, namely &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot;, &quot;Rat Race&quot; and &quot;Ghost Town&quot;. Notable Selecter singles included &quot;On My Radio&quot; and &quot;Three Minute Hero&quot;.<li>Today Coventry is recognised for its range of music events including one of the UK&#39;s foremost international jazz programmes, The Coventry Jazz Festival, and the award-winning <!--del_lnk--> Godiva Festival. On the Saturday of the Godiva Festival, a carnival parade also starts in the city centre and makes its way to the <!--del_lnk--> War Memorial Park where the festival is held.<li>In the film <!--del_lnk--> The Italian Job, the famous scene of <!--del_lnk--> Mini Coopers being driven at speed through <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>&#39;s catacombs was actually filmed in Coventry, using what were then the country&#39;s biggest sewer pipes. More recently various locations in Coventry have been used in the <!--del_lnk--> BAFTA nominated film &quot;Bouncer&quot; starring <!--del_lnk--> Ray Winstone, <!--del_lnk--> All In The Game, also starring Ray Winstone (Ricoh Arena), the medical TV series <!--del_lnk--> Angels (Walsgrave Hospital), the BBC <!--del_lnk--> sitcom <!--del_lnk--> Keeping Up Appearances (Stoke Aldermoor and Binley Woods districts) and in August 2006 scenes from the forthcoming series of <i><a href="../../wp/d/Doctor_Who.htm" title="Doctor Who">Doctor Who</a></i> were filmed in the grounds of Bonds Hospital.</ul>

      <p>Arguably Coventry&#39;s most famous resident was <!--del_lnk--> Lady Godiva, who according to legend, rode through the city naked on horseback, in protest at high taxes being waged on the cityfolk by her husband <!--del_lnk--> Leofric, Earl of Mercia. According to the legend, the residents of the city were asked to look away as she rode, but one man didn&#39;t and was allegedly struck blind, he became known as <!--del_lnk--> Peeping Tom thus originating the term. There is a statue of her in the city centre, which used to stand out in the open but is now somewhat unthoughtfully situated under the much-maligned Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy (see right).

      <p>Coventry has long been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing, dating back from 1896, the car and cycle industry has been a strong centre point for this town. Starting out with some less familiar names such as Coventry Motette, Great Horseless Carriage Co, Swift and more familiar names like <!--del_lnk--> Humber, <!--del_lnk--> Riley and <!--del_lnk--> Daimler and the <!--del_lnk--> Triumph motorcycle having its origins in <!--del_lnk--> 1902 in a Coventry factory. Although the motor industry has declined, the <!--del_lnk--> Jaguar company has its headquarters in the city, and a large <!--del_lnk--> Peugeot car factory is located in <!--del_lnk--> Ryton just outside the city, although this is set to close in 2007. The famous London <!--del_lnk--> black cab taxis are also produced in Coventry by <!--del_lnk--> LTI.<p>Coventry&#39;s main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development, creative industries as well as logistics and leisure.<p>

      <p>Traditionally a part of <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire (although it was <!--del_lnk--> a county in its own right for 400 years), Coventry became an independent <!--del_lnk--> county borough in <!--del_lnk--> 1889. It later became a <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan district of the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands county under the Local Government Act (1974), even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally &quot;jut out&quot; into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In <!--del_lnk--> 1986 the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands County Council was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority in its own right.<p>Coventry is still strongly associated with its traditional county, Warwickshire. This may be because of its geographical location, forming a large protrusion into the county.<p>Coventry is administered by <b>Coventry City Council</b>. The city is divided up into 18 <!--del_lnk--> Wards each with three <!--del_lnk--> councillors. Coventry has long been considered a stronghold or source of <!--del_lnk--> safe seats for the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party. The city council was for years described as a &quot;one party state&quot;, but is currently <!--del_lnk--> Conservative-controlled since the local elections on <!--del_lnk--> 4 May <!--del_lnk--> 2006, although the Conservative group held the administration on the casting vote of the Lord Mayor since June 2004. A notable politician serving with Coventry City Council is former Militant Labour MP <!--del_lnk--> Dave Nellist who now represents the <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Party (England and Wales).<p>The leader of the controlling Conservative group is Ken Taylor who holds the post of Leader of the Council.<p>The leader of the opposition Labour group is <!--del_lnk--> John Mutton.<p>Certain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Police, the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Fire Service and the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (Centro) which is responsible for <!--del_lnk--> public transport.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the <!--del_lnk--> West Midlands Ambulance Service. The <!--del_lnk--> Warwickshire and Northamptonshire Air Ambulance service is based in Coventry, at Baginton Airport.<p>Coventry is represented in <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> by three <!--del_lnk--> MPs all of whom are Labour.
