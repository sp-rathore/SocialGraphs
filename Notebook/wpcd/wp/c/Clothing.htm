      <p><b>Clothing</b> is defined, in its broadest sense, as coverings for the torso and limbs as well as coverings for the hands (<!--del_lnk--> gloves), feet (<!--del_lnk--> socks, <!--del_lnk--> shoes, <!--del_lnk--> sandals, <!--del_lnk--> boots) and head (<!--del_lnk--> hats, <!--del_lnk--> caps). Humans nearly universally wear clothing, which is also known as <b>dress</b>, <b>garments</b>, <b>attire</b>, or <b>apparel</b>. People wear clothing for functional as well as for social reasons. Clothing protects the vulnerable <!--del_lnk--> nude <!--del_lnk--> human body from the extremes of <a href="../../wp/w/Weather.htm" title="Weather">weather</a>, other features of our environment, and for safety reasons. But every article of clothing also carries a <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultural</a> and social meaning.<p>People also decorate their bodies with <!--del_lnk--> makeup or <!--del_lnk--> cosmetics, <!--del_lnk--> perfume, and other <!--del_lnk--> ornamentation; they also cut, dye, and arrange the hair of their heads, <!--del_lnk--> faces, and bodies (see <!--del_lnk--> hairstyle), and sometimes also mark their skin (by <!--del_lnk--> tattoos, <!--del_lnk--> scarifications, and <!--del_lnk--> piercings). All these decorations contribute to the overall effect and message of clothing, but do not constitute clothing per se.<p>Articles carried rather than worn (such as <!--del_lnk--> purses, <!--del_lnk--> canes, and <!--del_lnk--> umbrellas) are normally counted as <!--del_lnk--> fashion accessories rather than as clothing. <!--del_lnk--> Jewelry and <!--del_lnk--> eyeglasses are usually counted as accessories as well, even though in common speech these items are described as being worn rather than carried.<p>

</script><a id="Clothing_as_functional_technology" name="Clothing_as_functional_technology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Clothing as functional technology</span></h2>
      <p>The practical function of clothing is to protect the human body from dangers in the environment: weather (strong sunlight, extreme heat or cold, and precipitation, for example), <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>, noxious chemicals, <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapons</a>, and contact with abrasive substances, and other hazards. Clothing can protect against many things that might injure the naked human body. In some cases clothing protects the environment from the clothing wearer as well (example: <!--del_lnk--> medical scrubs).<p>Humans have shown extreme inventiveness in devising clothing solutions to practical problems and the distinction between clothing and other protective equipment is not always clear-cut. See, among others: <!--del_lnk--> air conditioned clothing, <!--del_lnk--> armor, <!--del_lnk--> diving suit, <!--del_lnk--> swimsuit, <!--del_lnk--> bee-keeper&#39;s costume, <!--del_lnk--> motorcycle leathers, <!--del_lnk--> high-visibility clothing, and <!--del_lnk--> protective clothing.<p><a id="Clothing_as_social_message" name="Clothing_as_social_message"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Clothing as social message</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Social messages sent by clothing, accessories, and decorations can involve social status, occupation, ethnic and religious affiliation, marital status and sexual availability, etc. Humans must know the code in order to recognise the message transmitted. If different groups read the same item of clothing or decoration with different meanings, the wearer may provoke unanticipated responses.<p><a id="Social_status" name="Social_status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social status</span></h3>
      <p>In many societies, people of high rank reserve special items of clothing or decoration for themselves as symbols of their <!--del_lnk--> social status. In ancient times, only <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> senators could wear garments dyed with <!--del_lnk--> Tyrian purple; only high-ranking Hawaiian chiefs could wear <!--del_lnk--> feather cloaks and <!--del_lnk--> palaoa or carved whale teeth. In <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> before the establishment of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">republic</a>, only the emperor could wear yellow. In many cases throughout history, there have been elaborate systems of <!--del_lnk--> sumptuary laws regulating who could wear what. In other societies (including most modern societies), no laws prohibit lower-status people wearing high status garments, but the high cost of status garments effectively limits purchase and display. In current Western society, only the rich can afford <!--del_lnk--> haute couture. The threat of social ostracism may also limit garment choice.<p><a id="Occupation" name="Occupation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Occupation</span></h3>
      <p>Military, police, and firefighters usually wear <!--del_lnk--> uniforms, as do workers in many industries. School-children often wear <!--del_lnk--> school uniforms, while college and university students sometimes wear academic dress. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as <b><!--del_lnk--> habits</b>. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one&#39;s occupation or rank within a profession &mdash; for example, the high <!--del_lnk--> toque or <!--del_lnk--> chef&#39;s hat worn by a chief cook.<p><a id="Ethnic.2C_political.2C_and_religious_affiliation" name="Ethnic.2C_political.2C_and_religious_affiliation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ethnic, political, and religious affiliation</span></h3>
      <p>In many regions of the world, <!--del_lnk--> national costumes and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his <!--del_lnk--> tartan. A <!--del_lnk--> Sikh may display his religious affiliation by wearing a <!--del_lnk--> turban and other traditional clothing. A French peasant woman may identify her village with her cap or <!--del_lnk--> coif.<p>Clothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th-century</a> Europe, artists and writers lived <i><!--del_lnk--> la vie de Boh&egrave;me</i> and dressed to shock: <!--del_lnk--> George Sand in men&#39;s clothing, female emancipationists in <!--del_lnk--> bloomers, male artists in velvet waistcoats and gaudy neckcloths. <!--del_lnk--> Bohemians, <!--del_lnk--> beatniks, <!--del_lnk--> hippies, <!--del_lnk--> Goths, <!--del_lnk--> punks and <!--del_lnk--> Skinheads have continued the (<!--del_lnk--> counter-cultural) tradition in the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th-century</a> <!--del_lnk--> West. Now that <!--del_lnk--> haute couture plagiarises <!--del_lnk--> street fashion within a year or so, street fashion may have lost some of its power to shock, but it still motivates millions trying to look <!--del_lnk--> hip and <!--del_lnk--> cool.<p><a id="Marital_status" name="Marital_status"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marital status</span></h3>
      <p>Hindu women, once <!--del_lnk--> married, wear <i><!--del_lnk--> sindoor</i>, a red powder, in the parting of their hair; if widowed, they abandon <i>sindoor</i> and jewelry and wear simple white clothing. Men and women of the Western world may wear <!--del_lnk--> wedding rings to indicate their marital status. See also <!--del_lnk--> Visual markers of marital status.<p><a id="Sexual_availability" name="Sexual_availability"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sexual availability</span></h3>
      <p>Some clothing indicates the modesty of the wearer. For example, many Muslim women wear a head or body covering (see <!--del_lnk--> hijab, <!--del_lnk--> burqa or bourqa, <!--del_lnk--> chador and <!--del_lnk--> abaya) that proclaims their status as respectable women. Other clothing may indicate flirtatious intent. For example, a Western woman might wear extreme <!--del_lnk--> stiletto heels, close-fitting and body-revealing black or red clothing, exaggerated make-up, flashy jewelry and perfume to show sexual availability. What constitutes modesty and allurement varies radically from culture to culture, within different contexts in the same culture, and over time as different <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashions</a> rise and fall. Moreover, a person may choose to display a mixed message. For example, a Saudi Arabian woman may wear an <!--del_lnk--> abaya to proclaim her respectability, but choose an abaya of luxurious material cut close to the body and then accessorize with <!--del_lnk--> high heels and a fashionable purse. All the details proclaim sexual desirability, despite the ostensible message of respectability.<p><a id="Clothing_fetishes" name="Clothing_fetishes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Clothing fetishes</span></h3>
      <p>Because clothing and adornment have such frequent links with sexual display, humans may develop clothing <!--del_lnk--> fetishes. They may strongly prefer to have sexual relations with other humans wearing clothing and accessories they consider arousing or sexy. In Western culture, such fetishes may include extremely high heels, lace, leather, or military clothing. Other cultures have different fetishes. The men of <!--del_lnk--> Heian <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> lusted after women with floor-sweeping hair and layers of silk robes. Fetishes vary as much as <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a>. Sometimes the clothing itself becomes the object of fetish, such as in case with <!--del_lnk--> used girl panties in Japan.<p><a id="Religious_habits_and_special_religious_clothing" name="Religious_habits_and_special_religious_clothing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religious habits and special religious clothing</span></h2>
      <p>Religious clothing might be considered a special case of occupational clothing. Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn everyday as a marker for special religious status.<p>For example, <!--del_lnk--> Jains wear unstitched cloth pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.<p>The cleanliness of religious dresses in Eastern Religions like <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Jainism is of paramount importance, which indicates purity.<p><a id="Sport_and_activity" name="Sport_and_activity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport and activity</span></h2>
      <p>Most sports and physical activities are practised wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common <!--del_lnk--> sportswear garments include <!--del_lnk--> shorts, <!--del_lnk--> T-shirts, <!--del_lnk--> polo shirts, <!--del_lnk--> tracksuits, and <!--del_lnk--> trainers. Specialised garments include <!--del_lnk--> wet suits (for <!--del_lnk--> swimming, <!--del_lnk--> diving or <!--del_lnk--> surfing) and <!--del_lnk--> salopettes (for <a href="../../wp/s/Skiing.htm" title="Skiing">skiing</a>).<p><a id="Clothing_materials" name="Clothing_materials"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Clothing materials</span></h2>
      <p>Common clothing materials include:<ul>

      <p>Clothing, once manufactured, suffers assault both from within and from without. The human body inside sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, damp, abrasion, dirt, and other indignities afflict the garment. Fleas and lice take up residence in clothing seams. Well-worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, will smell, itch, look scruffy, and lose functionality (as when <a href="../../wp/b/Button.htm" title="Button">buttons</a> fall off and <!--del_lnk--> zippers fail).<p>In some cases, people simply wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Cleaning leather presents difficulties; one cannot wash bark cloth (tapa) without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but old leather and bark clothing will always look <i>old</i>.<p>But most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be <!--del_lnk--> laundered and mended (<!--del_lnk--> patching, <!--del_lnk--> darning, but compare <!--del_lnk--> felt).<p><a id="Laundry.2C_ironing.2C_storage" name="Laundry.2C_ironing.2C_storage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Laundry, ironing, storage</span></h3>
      <p>Humans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from the earliest &quot;pound clothes against rocks in running stream&quot; to the latest in electronic <!--del_lnk--> washing machines and <!--del_lnk--> dry cleaning (dissolving dirt in <!--del_lnk--> solvents other than water).<p>Many kinds of clothing are designed to be <!--del_lnk--> ironed before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, <!--del_lnk--> dress shirts and <!--del_lnk--> suits). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. However, much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle and so do not have to be ironed. Some clothing is <!--del_lnk--> permanent press, meaning that it has been treated with a synthetic coating (such as <!--del_lnk--> polytetrafluoroethylene) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.<p>Once clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung up on <!--del_lnk--> clothes hangers or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are <!--del_lnk--> folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent <!--del_lnk--> creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.<p>Many kinds of clothes are folded before they are put in a <!--del_lnk--> suitcases as preparation for travel. Other clothes, such as <!--del_lnk--> suits, may be hung up in special garment bags, or rolled rather than folded. Many people use their clothing as packing material around fragile items that might otherwise break in transit.<p><a id="Mending" name="Mending"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mending</span></h3>
      <p>In past times, <!--del_lnk--> mending was an art. A meticulous <!--del_lnk--> tailor or <!--del_lnk--> seamstress could mend rips with thread raveled from <!--del_lnk--> hems and seam edges so skillfully that the darn was practically invisible. When the raw material &mdash; cloth &mdash; was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the time it would take to repair it. Many people prefer to buy a new piece of clothing rather than to spend their time mending old clothes. But the thrifty still replace <!--del_lnk--> zippers and <a href="../../wp/b/Button.htm" title="Button">buttons</a> and sew up ripped <!--del_lnk--> hems.<p><a id="The_life_cycle_of_clothing" name="The_life_cycle_of_clothing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The life cycle of clothing</span></h2>
      <p>Used, no-longer-wearable clothing was once desirable raw material for <!--del_lnk--> quilts, <!--del_lnk--> rag rugs, <!--del_lnk--> bandages, and many other household uses. It could also be recycled into <!--del_lnk--> paper. Now it is usually thrown away. Used but still wearable clothing can be sold at <!--del_lnk--> consignment shops, <!--del_lnk--> flea markets, <!--del_lnk--> online auction, or just donated to charity. Charities usually skim the best of the clothing to sell in their own <!--del_lnk--> thrift stores and sell the rest to merchants, who bale it up and ship it to poor <!--del_lnk--> Third World countries, where vendors bid for the bales and then make what profit they can selling used clothing.<p><a id="Early_21st-century_clothing_styles" name="Early_21st-century_clothing_styles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early 21st-century clothing styles</span></h2>
      <p>Western fashion has to a certain extent become international fashion, as Western media and styles penetrate all parts of the world. Very few parts of the world remain where people do not wear items of cheap, mass-produced Western clothing. Even people in poor countries can afford <!--del_lnk--> used clothing from richer Western countries.<p>However, people may wear ethnic or <!--del_lnk--> national dress on special occasions or if carrying out certain roles or occupations. For example, most Japanese women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but will still wear silk <!--del_lnk--> kimonos on special occasions. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used <!--del_lnk--> T-shirt with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or <!--del_lnk--> tupenu.<p>Western fashion, too, does not function monolithically. It comes in many varieties, from expensive <!--del_lnk--> haute couture to <!--del_lnk--> thrift store <!--del_lnk--> grunge.<p><a id="Mainstream_Western_or_international_styles" name="Mainstream_Western_or_international_styles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mainstream Western or international styles</span></h3>

      <p>According to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing probably consisted of <!--del_lnk--> fur, <!--del_lnk--> leather, leaves or grass, draped, wrapped or tied about the body for protection from the elements. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early <!--del_lnk--> sewing needles of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near Kostenki, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, in 1988.<p>Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropologists</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, have conducted a genetic analysis of human <!--del_lnk--> body lice that indicates that they originated about 107,000 years ago. Since most humans have very sparse body hair, body lice require clothing to survive, so this suggests a surprisingly recent date for the invention of clothing. Its invention may have coincided with the spread of modern <i><a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Homo sapiens">Homo sapiens</a></i> from the warm <a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">climate</a> of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers used similar genetic methods to estimate that body lice originated about 540,000 years ago (Reed et al. 2004. PLoS Biology 2(11): e340). For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.<p>Some human cultures, such as the various peoples of the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic_Circle.htm" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, until recently made their clothing entirely of furs and skins, cutting clothing to fit and decorating lavishly.<p>Other cultures have supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibres. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> weaving, <!--del_lnk--> knitting, and <!--del_lnk--> twining.</i><p>Although modern consumers take clothing for granted, making the fabrics that go into clothing is not easy. One sign of this is that the <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile</a> industry was the first to be mechanized during the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>; before the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> powered loom, textile production was a tedious and labor-intensive process. Therefore, methods were developed for making most efficient use of textiles.<p>One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many peoples wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit &mdash; for example, the <!--del_lnk--> dhoti for men and the <!--del_lnk--> saree for women in the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian Sub-continent</a>, the Scottish <!--del_lnk--> kilt or the <!--del_lnk--> Javanese <!--del_lnk--> sarong. The clothes may simply be tied up, as is the case of the first two garments; or pins or belts hold the garments in place, as in the case of the latter two. The precious cloth remains uncut, and people of various sizes or the same person at different sizes can wear the garment.<p>Another approach involves cutting and sewing the cloth, but using every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing. The tailor may cut triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and then add them elsewhere as <!--del_lnk--> gussets. Traditional European patterns for men&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> shirts and women&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> chemises take this approach.<p>Modern European <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a> treats cloth much more prodigally, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into <!--del_lnk--> quilts.<p>In the thousands of years that humans have spent constructing clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which we can reconstruct from surviving garments, <!--del_lnk--> photos, <a href="../../wp/p/Painting.htm" title="Painting">paintings</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mosaic.htm" title="Mosaic">mosaics</a>, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history serves as a source of inspiration to current <!--del_lnk--> fashion designers, as well as a topic of <!--del_lnk--> professional interest to costumers constructing for <!--del_lnk--> plays, <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> historical reenactment.<p><a id="Future_trends" name="Future_trends"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Future trends</span></h2>
      <p>As technologies change, so will clothing. Many people, including <!--del_lnk--> futurologists have extrapolated current trends and made the following predictions:<ul>
       <li>Man-made fibers such as <!--del_lnk--> nylon, <!--del_lnk--> polyester, <!--del_lnk--> terylene, <!--del_lnk--> terycot, <!--del_lnk--> lycra, and <!--del_lnk--> Gore-Tex already account for much of the clothing market. Many more types of fibers will certainly be developed, possibly using <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology. For example, military uniforms may stiffen when hit by bullets, filter out poisonous chemicals, and treat wounds.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>&quot;Smart&quot; clothing will incorporate electronics. Clothing may incorporate wearable computers, flexible wearable displays (possibly leading to fully animated clothing and some forms of <!--del_lnk--> invisibility cloaks), medical sensors, etc.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Present-day ready-to-wear technologies will presumably give way to computer-aided custom manufacturing. Low power laser beams will measure the customer; computers will draw up a custom pattern and execute it in the customer&#39;s choice of cloth as well as choice of desirable fit.</ul>

      <p>The clothing industry is concentrated outside of western Europe and America, and garment workers often have to labor under poor conditions. Coalitions of <!--del_lnk--> NGO&#39;s, designers (Katharine Hamnett, <!--del_lnk--> American Apparel, <!--del_lnk--> Veja, Edun,...) and trade unions like the <!--del_lnk--> Clean clothes campaign (CCC) seek to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers&#39; conditions.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing&quot;</div>
