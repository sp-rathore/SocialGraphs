      <p>The <b>cat</b> (or <b>domestic cat</b>, <b>house cat</b>) is a small <!--del_lnk--> domesticated <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammal</a>. It is valued by humans for its ability to destroy vermin. A skilled <!--del_lnk--> predator, the cat is known to hunt over 1,000 species for food. Intelligent, the cat can can be trained to obey simple commands, and has been known to teach itself to manipulate simple mechanisms (see <!--del_lnk--> cat intelligence).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> trinomial name of the domestic cat is <i><b>Felis silvestris catus</b></i>. Its closest pre-domesticated ancestor is believed to be the <!--del_lnk--> African wild cat, <i>Felis silvestris lybica</i>. Humans have developed <!--del_lnk--> several dozen breeds of cat, in a variety of colours.<p>Cats have lived in close association with humans for at least 9,500 years,. Legends and myths about the cat exist in many cultures, from the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Egyptians and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese to the <a href="../../wp/n/Norse_mythology.htm" title="Norse mythology">Vikings</a>. They have been both revered and vilified by different cultures.<p>Cats use more than one hundred vocalizations and types of body language for communication, including mewing (&quot;meow&quot; or &quot;miaou&quot;), <!--del_lnk--> purring, <!--del_lnk--> hissing, <!--del_lnk--> growling, <!--del_lnk--> chirping, <!--del_lnk--> clicking, and grunting. Cats have even been observed mimicking the calls of birds.<p>Like horses and other domesticated animals, cats can sometimes become <!--del_lnk--> feral, living effectively in the wild. <!--del_lnk--> Feral cats will often form small <!--del_lnk--> feral cat colonies. Animal welfare organizations note that few abandoned cats are able to survive long enough to become feral, most being killed by vehicles, or succumbing to starvation, predators, exposure, or disease.<p>

      <p>A group of cats is referred to as a <b>clowder</b>, a male cat is called a <b>tom</b>, and a female is called a <b>queen</b>. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its <b>sire</b>, and its female progenitor is its <b>dam</b>. An immature cat is called a <b><!--del_lnk--> kitten</b> (which is also an alternative name for young <!--del_lnk--> rats, <a href="../../wp/r/Rabbit.htm" title="Rabbit">rabbits</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hedgehogs, <a href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver">beavers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> squirrels and <!--del_lnk--> skunks). In <!--del_lnk--> medieval Britain, the word <i>kitten</i> was interchangeable with the word <i>catling</i>. A cat whose <a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">ancestry</a> is formally registered is called a <!--del_lnk--> pedigreed cat, <!--del_lnk--> purebred cat, or a <!--del_lnk--> show cat (although not all show cats are pedigreed or purebred). In strict terms, a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded, but may have ancestors of different breeds (almost exclusively new breeds; cat registries are very strict about which breeds can be mated together). Cats of mixed ancestry are referred to as <!--del_lnk--> domestic longhairs and <!--del_lnk--> domestic shorthairs or commonly as random-bred, moggies, mongrels, mutt-cats or alley cats. The ratio of pedigree/purebred cats to random-bred cats varies from country to country. However, generally speaking, purebreds are less than ten percent of the total feline population.<p>The word <i>cat</i> derives from Old English <i>catt</i>, which belongs to a group of related words in European languages, including Latin <i>cattus</i>, Byzantine Greek &kappa;&#x3AC;&tau;&tau;&alpha;, Old Irish <i>cat</i>, and Old Church Slavonic <i>kotka</i>. The ultimate source of all these terms, however, is unknown.<p>The term <i>puss</i> (as in <!--del_lnk--> pussycat or <!--del_lnk--> Puss in boots) may come from <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> (from <i>&quot;poes&quot;</i>, a female cat, or the diminutive <i>&quot;poesje&quot;</i>, an endearing term for any cat) or from other Germanic languages.<p><a id="Scientific_classification" name="Scientific_classification"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientific classification</span></h2>
      <p>The domestic cat was named <i>Felis catus</i> by <a href="../../wp/c/Carolus_Linnaeus.htm" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Carolus Linnaeus</a> in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Systema Naturae</i> of 1758. <!--del_lnk--> Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named the <a href="../../wp/w/Wild_cat.htm" title="Wild cat">wild cat</a> <i>Felis silvestris</i> in 1775. The domestic cat is now considered a subspecies of the wild cat: by the strict rule of priority of the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Zoological Nomenclature the name for the species thus ought to be <i>F. catus</i> since Linnaeus published first. However, in practice almost all biologists use <i>F. silvestris</i> for the wild species, using <i>F. catus</i> only for the domesticated form.<p>In opinion 2027 (published in Volume 60, Part 1 of the <i>Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature</i>, March 31 2003) the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are predated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;, thus confirming <i>F. silvestris</i> for the wild cat and <i>F. silvestris catus</i> for its domesticated subspecies. (<i>F. catus</i> is still valid if the domestic form is considered a separate species.)<p><!--del_lnk--> Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben named the domestic cat <i>Felis domesticus</i> in his <i>Anfangsgr&uuml;nde der Naturlehre and Systema regni animalis</i> of 1777. This name, and its variants <i>Felis catus domesticus</i> and <i>Felis silvestris domesticus</i>, are often seen, but they are not valid scientific names under the rules of the <!--del_lnk--> International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.<p><a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Characteristics</span></h2>

      <p>Cats typically weigh between 2.5 and 7&nbsp;kg (5.5&ndash;16&nbsp;pounds); however, some breeds, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Maine Coon can exceed 11.3&nbsp;kg (25&nbsp;pounds). Some have been known to reach up to 23&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;pounds) due to overfeeding. Conversely, very small cats (less than 1.8 kg / 4.0 lbs)  have been reported.<p>In captivity, indoor cats typically live 14 to 20 years, though the oldest-known cat lived to age 36. Domestic cats tend to live longer if they are not permitted to go outdoors (reducing the risk of injury from fights or accidents and exposure to diseases) and if they are <!--del_lnk--> spayed or neutered. Some such benefits are: neutered male cats cannot develop <!--del_lnk--> testicular cancer, spayed female cats cannot develop <!--del_lnk--> ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of <!--del_lnk--> mammary cancer. <p>Cats also possess rather loose skin; this enables them to turn and confront a predator or another cat in a fight, even when it has a grip on them. This is also an advantage for veterinary purposes, as it simplifies injections . In fact, the life of cats with <!--del_lnk--> kidney failure can sometimes be extended for years by the regular injection of large volumes of fluid subcutaneously, which serves as an alternative to <!--del_lnk--> dialysis ,  The particular loose skin at the back of the neck is known as the <i>scruff</i>, and is the area by which a mother cat grips her kittens to carry them. As a result, cats have a tendency to relax and become quiet and passive when gripped there which often extends into adulthood, and can be useful when attempting to treat or move an uncooperative cat. However, since the adult cat is quite a bit heavier than a kitten, she should not be carried with her weight entirely hanging from the scruff, but should also have her weight supported at the abdomen and hind legs , . Some advise against &quot;scruffing&quot; an adult cat at all ,,.<p><a id="Ears" name="Ears"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Ears</span></h3>
      <p>Sixty-two individual muscles in the ear allow for a manner of directional hearing: the cat can move each ear independently of the other. Because of this mobility, a cat can move its body in one direction and point its ears in another direction. Most cats have straight ears pointing upward. Unlike <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dogs</a>, flap-eared breeds are extremely rare. (<!--del_lnk--> Scottish Folds are one such exceptional <!--del_lnk--> genetic mutation.) When angry or frightened, a cat will lay its ears back, to accompany the growling or <!--del_lnk--> hissing sounds it makes. Cats will also turn their ears back when they are playing, or occasionally to show interest in a sound coming from behind them.<p><a id="Metabolism" name="Metabolism"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Metabolism</span></h3>

      <p>Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. Daily durations of sleep vary, usually 12&ndash;16 hours, with 13&ndash;14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours in a 24-hour period. The term <i>cat nap</i> refers to the cat&#39;s ability to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period and has entered the English lexicon &ndash; someone who nods off for a few minutes is said to be &quot;taking a cat nap&quot;.<p>Due to their <!--del_lnk--> crepuscular nature, cats are often known to enter a period of increased hyperactivity and playfulness during the evening and early morning, dubbed the &quot;evening crazies&quot;, &quot;night crazies&quot; or &quot;mad half hour&quot; by some.<p>The temperament of a cat can vary depending on the breed and socialization. Cats with &quot;oriental&quot; body types tend to be thinner and more active, while cats that have a &quot;cobby&quot; body type tend to be heavier and less active.<p>The normal <!--del_lnk--> body temperature of a cat is between 38 and 39&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> C (101 and 102.2&nbsp;&deg;<!--del_lnk--> F). A cat is considered <!--del_lnk--> febrile (<!--del_lnk--> hyperthermic) if it has a temperature of 39.5&nbsp;&deg;C (103&nbsp;&deg;F) or greater, or <!--del_lnk--> hypothermic if less than 37.5&nbsp;&deg;C (100&nbsp;&deg;F). For comparison, humans have a normal temperature of approximately 36.8&nbsp;&deg;C (98.2&nbsp;&deg;F). A domestic cat&#39;s normal heart rate ranges from 140 to 220 beats per minute, and is largely dependent on how excited the cat is. For a cat at rest, the average heart rate should be between 150 and 180 bpm, about twice that of a human.<p><a id="Legs" name="Legs"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Legs</span></h3>

      <p>Cats, like dogs, are <!--del_lnk--> digitigrades: they walk directly on their toes, the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. Cats are capable of walking very precisely, because like all felines they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding forepaw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain.<p>Unlike dogs and most mammals, cats walk by moving both legs on one side and then both legs on the other. Most mammals move legs on alternate sides in sequence. Cats share this unusual gait with camels, giraffes, and a select few other mammals. There is no known connection between these animals which might explain this.<p>Like all members of <!--del_lnk--> family <i><!--del_lnk--> Felidae</i> except the <a href="../../wp/c/Cheetah.htm" title="Cheetah">cheetah</a>, cats have retractable <!--del_lnk--> claws. In their normal, relaxed position the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can extend their claws voluntarily on one or more paws at will. Cats may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> kneading&quot;, or for extra traction on soft surfaces (bedspreads, thick rugs, etc.). The curved claws may become entangled in carpet or thick fabric, which may cause injury if the cat is unable to free itself.<p>Most cats have 5 claws at their front paws, and 4 or 5 at their rear paws. But because of a mutation, cats are prone to <!--del_lnk--> polydactyly, and may have 6 or 7 toes. The 5th front claw, the thumb, is on much higher position than those of the other fingers. Then even higher, there seems to be a 6th finger, but it is not. This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists, is the <!--del_lnk--> carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an anti-skidding device during jumping. If present, the 5th claw at the rear legs, corresponding with the big toe, is called the dew-claw.<p><a id="Perching_and_falling" name="Perching_and_falling"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Perching and falling</span></h3>

      <p>Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places, or perching. Animal behaviorists have posited a number of explanations, the most common being that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its &quot;territory&quot; and become aware of activities of people and other pets in the area. In the wild, a higher place may serve as concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats are known to strike prey by pouncing from such a perch as a tree branch, as does a leopard, or a fence rail. Height, therefore, can also give cats a sense of security and prestige.<p>This fondness for high spaces, however, can dangerously test the popular axiom that a cat &quot;always lands on its feet.&quot; The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals warns owners to safeguard the more dangerous perches in their homes, to avoid &quot;high-rise syndrome,&quot; where an overconfident cat falls from an extreme height.<p>During a fall, a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute <!--del_lnk--> sense of balance and flexibility. This is known as the cat&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> righting reflex.&quot; It always rights itself in the same way, provided it has the time to do so during a fall. Thus, high (multi-story) falls can be less dangerous to them than those of only a few meters. Many cases are known of cats falling from substantial heights (5 to 10 stories) and surviving almost unscathed. Contrary to popular belief, cats without a <!--del_lnk--> tail also have this ability, since a cat mostly moves its hindlegs and relies on conservation of <!--del_lnk--> angular momentum to set up for landing, and the tail is in fact little used for this feat.<p><a id="Senses" name="Senses"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Senses</span></h3>

These along with the cat&#39;s highly advanced hearing, eyesight, taste, and touch receptors make the cat extremely sensitive among mammals.<p><a id="Sight" name="Sight"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Sight</span></h4>

      <p>Testing indicates that a cat&#39;s vision is superior <!--del_lnk--> at night in comparison to humans, and inferior in daylight. Cats, like dogs and many other animals, have a <i><!--del_lnk--> tapetum lucidum</i> that reflects extra light to the retina. While this enhances the ability to see in low light, it appears to reduce net <!--del_lnk--> visual acuity, thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like <!--del_lnk--> iris closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a>, and improving <!--del_lnk--> depth of field. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in colour of cats&#39; eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the interaction of the flash with the <!--del_lnk--> tapetum.<p>Average cats have a visual <!--del_lnk--> field of view estimated at 200&deg;, versus 180&deg; in humans, with a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans. As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording <!--del_lnk--> depth perception at the expense of field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye&#39;s construction. Instead of the <!--del_lnk--> fovea which gives humans sharp central vision, cats have a central band known as the visual streak. Cats can apparently differentiate among <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colors</a>, especially at close range, but without appreciable subtlety.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Cats have a third eyelid, the <!--del_lnk--> nictitating membrane, which is a thin cover that closes from the side and appears when the cat&#39;s eyelid opens. This membrane partially closes if the cat is sick; although in a sleepy, content cat this membrane is often visible. If a cat chronically shows the third eyelid, it should be taken to a <!--del_lnk--> veterinarian for evaluation.<p>Cats have a wide variation in eye colour, the most typical colors being golden, green and orange. Blue eyes are usually associated with the Siamese breed, but they are also found in white cats. If a white cat has two blue eyes, it is oftentimes deaf; however, orange eyes usually indicate the cat is free of hearing problems. White cats having one blue and one other-colored eye are called &quot;odd-eyed&quot; and may be deaf on the same side as the blue eye. This is the result of the yellow iris pigmentation rising to the surface of only one eye, as blue eyes are normal at birth before the adult pigmentation has had a chance to express itself in the eye(s).<p><a id="Hearing" name="Hearing"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Hearing</span></h4>
      <p>Humans and cats have a similar range of hearing on the low end of the scale, but cats can hear much higher-pitched sounds, up to 64 <!--del_lnk--> kHz, which is 1.6 octaves above the range of a human, and even 1 octave above the range of a dog. When listening for something, a cat&#39;s ears will swivel in that direction; a cat&#39;s ear flaps (<!--del_lnk--> pinnae) can independently point backwards as well as forwards and sideways to pinpoint the source of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">sound</a>. Cats can judge within three inches (7.5&nbsp;cm) the location of a sound being made one yard (approximately one meter) away - this can be useful for localizing prey, etc.<p><a id="Smell" name="Smell"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Smell</span></h4>

      <p>A domestic cat&#39;s sense of smell is about fourteen times as strong as a human&#39;s. Cats have twice as many smell-sensitive cells in their noses as people do, which means they can smell things we are not even aware of. Cats also have a scent organ in the roof of their mouths called the <!--del_lnk--> vomeronasal, or Jacobson&#39;s organ. When a cat wrinkles its muzzle, lowers its chin, and lets its tongue hang a bit, it is opening the passage to the vomeronasal. This is called <i>gaping</i>, &quot;sneering&quot;, or &quot;flehming&quot;. Gaping is the equivalent of the <!--del_lnk--> Flehmen response in other animals, such as <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dogs</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Horse.htm" title="Horses">horses</a> and <!--del_lnk--> big cats.<p><a id="Touch" name="Touch"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Touch</span></h4>

      <p>A cat has about twenty-four movable <!--del_lnk--> vibrissae (&quot;whiskers&quot;), in four rows on each upper lip on each side of its nose (some cats may have more), in addition to a few on each cheek, tufts over the eyes, bristles on the chin, the cat&#39;s inner &quot;wrists&quot;, and at the back of the legs.  The <!--del_lnk--> Sphynx (a nearly hairless breed) may have full length, short, or no whiskers at all.<p>Vibrissae aid with navigation and sensation. The upper two rows of whiskers can move independently from the lower two rows for even more precise measuring. Whiskers are more than twice as thick as ordinary hairs, and their roots are set three times deeper than hairs in a cat&#39;s tissue. Richly supplied with nerve endings, whiskers give cats extraordinarily detailed information about air movements, air pressure and anything they touch. Vibrissae possess exquisite sensitivity to vibrations in air currents. As air swirls and eddies around objects, whiskers vibrate too. Whiskers may detect very small shifts in air currents, enabling a cat to know it is near obstructions without actually seeing them. Cats use messages in these vibrations to sense the presence, size, and shape of obstacles without seeing or touching them.<p>Whiskers are also good hunting tools. The structure of the brain region which receives information from the vibrissae is similar to that found in the <!--del_lnk--> visual cortex, suggesting that the nature of the cat&#39;s perception through its whiskers is similar to that via its vision. , ,   Stop motion photography reveals that at the moment a cat&#39;s prey is so close to its mouth to be too near for accurate vision, its whiskers move so as to form a basket shape around its muzzle in order to precisely detect the prey&#39;s location.,  A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the wrong part of a mouse it&#39;s attacking, indicating that signals from these delicate structures provide cats with vital information about the shape and activity of its prey &mdash; interestingly, whiskers also help cats detect scents.<p>It is thought that a cat may choose to rely on the whiskers in dim light where fully dilating the pupils would reduce its ability to focus on close objects. The whiskers also spread out roughly as wide as the cat&#39;s body making it able to judge if it can fit through an opening.<p>Whiskers are also an indication of the cat&#39;s attitude. Whiskers point forward when the cat is inquisitive and friendly, and lie flat on the face when the cat is being defensive or aggressive.<p>Whiskers can also be a bother to a cat, especially when the cat tries to eat food out of a bowl. The end of the whiskers touching the side of the bowl transfer irritating sensations to its brain, making it hard for it to continue eating.<p>When a kitten is cleaned by its mother, she may chew off some or all of the whiskers.<p><a id="Taste" name="Taste"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Taste</span></h4>
      <p>The cat family has been shown in <!--del_lnk--> 2005 to lack the <!--del_lnk--> T1R2 <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a>, one of two required for function of the <!--del_lnk--> sweetness <!--del_lnk--> sensory receptor; a <!--del_lnk--> deletion in the relevant <!--del_lnk--> gene (<i>Tas1r2</i>) causes a shift in the genetic <!--del_lnk--> reading frame, leading to <!--del_lnk--> transcription stopping early and no detectable <!--del_lnk--> mRNA or protein produced.  The other protein, <!--del_lnk--> T1R3 is present and identical to that of other animals, and the relevant <!--del_lnk--> taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a <!--del_lnk--> genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a <!--del_lnk--> mutation in an early ancestor of the entire family; as a <!--del_lnk--> deletion mutation it could not <!--del_lnk--> revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, even as the <!--del_lnk--> evolutionary tree branched out. Most scientists now believe this is the root of the cat family&#39;s extremely specialized <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionary</a> <!--del_lnk--> niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favour of a high <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> carnivorous diet which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.<p><a id="Communication" name="Communication"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Communication</span></h3>

      <p>Cats are <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolutionarily</a> highly specialized for hunting, compared to other mammals such as dogs. This is now thought to be the indirect result of the mutation which caused their ancestor to lose the ability to taste sugars, thereby reducing their intake of plant foods. Since they have a greatly reduced need to digest plants, their digestive tract has evolved to be shorter, too short for effective digestion of plants but less of a weight penalty for the rapid movement required for hunting. Hunting has likewise become central to their behaviour patterns, even to their predeliction for short burst of intense exercise punctuating long periods of rest.<p>Much like the <!--del_lnk--> big cats, domestic cats are very effective predators. They ambush and immobilize vertebrate <!--del_lnk--> prey using tactics similar to those of <!--del_lnk--> leopards and <a href="../../wp/t/Tiger.htm" title="Tiger">tigers</a> by pouncing; then they deliver a lethal neck bite with their long <!--del_lnk--> canine teeth that severs the victim&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> spinal cord, causes fatal bleeding by puncturing the <!--del_lnk--> carotid artery or the <!--del_lnk--> jugular vein, or asphyxiate it by crushing its trachea. The domestic cat can hunt and eat about one thousand <!--del_lnk--> species&mdash;many <!--del_lnk--> big cats will eat fewer than 100. Although, theoretically, big cats can kill most of these species as well, they often do not due to the relatively low nutritional content that smaller animals provide for the effort. An exception is the <!--del_lnk--> leopard, which commonly hunts rabbits and many other smaller animals.<p>Even well-fed domestic cats hunt and kill birds, mice, rats, scorpions, and other small animals in the vicinity. They often present such trophies to their owner. The motivation is not entirely clear, but friendly bonding behaviors are often associated with such an action. It is probable that cats in this situation expect to be praised for their symbolic contribution to the group. Some theories suggest that cats see their owners gone for long times of the day and assume they are out hunting, as they always have plenty of food available. It is thought that a cat presenting its owner with a dead animal thinks it&#39;s &#39;helping out&#39; by bringing home the kill. <!--del_lnk--> Ethologist <!--del_lnk--> Paul Leyhausen, in an extensive study of social and predatory behaviour in domestic cats (documented in his book <i>Cat Behaviour</i>}, proposed a mechanism which explains this presenting behaviour. In simple terms, cats adopt humans into their social group, and share excess kill with others in the group according to the local pecking order, in which humans place at or near the top.<p>Due to their hunting behaviour, in many countries feral cats are considered pests. Domestic cats are occasionally also required to have contained cat runs or to be kept inside entirely, as they can be hazardous to locally endangered bird species. For instance, various municipalities in Australia have enacted such legislation. In some localities, owners fit their cat with a bell in order to warn prey of its approach. Sometimes, the bell has the unwanted effect of &quot;training&quot; the cat to be an even stealthier killer.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Cats have highly specialized teeth and a digestive tract suitable to the digestion of meat. The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth, which efficiently functions to shear meat like a pair of scissors. While this is present in <!--del_lnk--> canines, it is highly developed in felines. The cat&#39;s tongue has sharp spines, or <!--del_lnk--> papillae, useful for retaining and ripping flesh from a carcass. These papillae are small backward-facing hooks that contain <!--del_lnk--> keratin and assist in their grooming. Domesticated cats eat fairly little vegetable matter. It is quite common, however, for cats to occasionally supplement their carnivorous diets with small amounts of grass or other plant matter to help their digestive tract. Whereas <a href="../../wp/b/Bear.htm" title="Bear">bears</a> and dogs commonly supplement their diet of meat with fruits, berries, roots, and honey when they can get them, cats prefer to mostly feed on meat. All felines, including the big cats, have a genetic anomaly that prevents them from tasting sweetness, which, more than likely, is related to their meat-dominated eating habits, and almost certainly related to their aversion to fruits and berries. However, many domesticated cats are known to like vegetables. The majority of brand-name <!--del_lnk--> cat foods are primarily meat based, but often contain large amounts of corn or rice and supplemented with meat byproducts and minerals and vitamins. Cats are also known to munch on grass, leaves, shrubs and houseplants to facilitate regurgitation of whatever may be upsetting their digestion.<p>Cats are obligate <!--del_lnk--> carnivores, and cannot live on an unsupplemented <!--del_lnk--> vegetarian diet because they cannot synthesize several required nutrients which are absent or rare in plant food. This applies mainly to <!--del_lnk--> taurine, <!--del_lnk--> vitamin A (cats cannot convert the pro-vitamin A that is abundant in plants to vitamin A proper) and to certain <!--del_lnk--> fatty acids. The absence of taurine causes the cat&#39;s retina to slowly degenerate, causing eye problems and (eventually) irreversible blindness. This condition is called <!--del_lnk--> central retinal degeneration (CRD). Cow&#39;s milk is a poor source of taurine and adult cats are generally <!--del_lnk--> lactose intolerant. Lactose-free milk is perfectly safe, but still not a substitute for meat.<p>Some vegetarians, however, feed their cats a vegetarian diet, with a supplement containing these specific nutrients and others tailored to meet the needs of cats. Vegan pre-supplemented kibble is also available.<p>Some houseplants are harmful to cats. The leaves of the <!--del_lnk--> Easter Lily can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage to cats. <!--del_lnk--> Philodendron are also poisonous to cats. <i><!--del_lnk--> Cat Fancy</i> has a full list of <!--del_lnk--> plants harmful to cats.<p>Some cats have a fondness for <!--del_lnk--> catnip. While they generally do not consume it, they will often roll in it, paw at it, and occasionally chew on it (as catnip is sensed by the cat&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> vomeronasal organ). The effect is usually relatively short, lasting for only a few minutes. After two hours or less, susceptible cats gain interest again. Several other species of plants cause this effect, to a lesser degree.<p>Cats can be fussy eaters, possibly due to the mutation which caused their ancestor to lose the ability to taste sugars. Unlike most mammals, cats can voluntarily starve themselves indefinitely despite being presented with palatable food, even a food which they had previously readily consumed. This can happen when the <!--del_lnk--> vomeronasal or Jacobson&#39;s organ becomes accustomed to a specific food, or if the cats are spoiled by their owners, in which case the cat will reject any food that does not fit the pattern it is expecting. It is also known for cats to merely become bored with their given food and decide to stop eating until they are tempted into eating again. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called <!--del_lnk--> hepatic lipidosis, a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.<p>Additionally, cats have been known to develop a fondness for &quot;people food&quot; such as chicken, bread, French fries, pizza, ice cream, tomato soup, bacon, carrot juice, olives, mushrooms, and carnitas burritos, as well as such cat diet exotica as corn kernels and diced cantaloupe or cantaloupe skin. A diet consisting of people food or unlimited access to normal cat food often leads to the cat becoming obese. This may lead to several health complications, such as diabetes, especially in neutered males. Such health conditions can be prevented through diet and exercise (playing), especially for cats living exclusively indoors.<p>Cats can also develop <!--del_lnk--> pica. Pica is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this is mostly harmless as they do not digest most of it, but can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Siamese, Burmese, and breeds with these in their ancestry.<p>Domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of string play. Many cats cannot resist a dangling piece of string, or a piece of rope drawn randomly and enticingly across the floor. This well known love of string is often depicted in cartoons and photographs, which show kittens or cats playing with balls of yarn. It is probably related to hunting instincts, including the common practice of kittens practice hunting of their mother&#39;s, and each other&#39;s, tail. If string is ingested, however, it can become caught in the cat&rsquo;s stomach or intestines, causing illness, or in extreme cases, death. Due to possible complications caused by ingesting a string, string play is sometimes replaced with a <!--del_lnk--> laser pointer&#39;s dot, which some cats will chase. Some also discourage the use of laser pointers for pet play, however, because of the potential damage to sensitive eyes and/or the possible loss of satisfaction associated with the successful capture of an actual prey object, play or real. <p>Because of their small size, domestic cats pose almost no danger to humans &mdash; the main hazard is the possibility of infection (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> cat scratch disease, or, rarely, <a href="../../wp/r/Rabies.htm" title="Rabies">rabies</a>) from a cat bite or scratch. Cats can also potentially inflict severe scratches or puncture an eye, though this is quite rare. Dogs have been known to be blinded by cats in fights, in which the cat specifically targeted the eyes of the larger animal with some accuracy.<p>Cats can be destructive to <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems in which they are not native and whose species have not had time to adapt to their <!--del_lnk--> introduction. In some cases, cats have contributed to or caused <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinctions</a> -&mdash; for example, see the case of the <!--del_lnk--> Stephens Island Wren.<p><a id="Poisoning" name="Poisoning"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Poisoning</span></h4>
      <p>The liver of a cat is less effective at detoxification than those of humans or dogs, which limits the use of pesticides and medications where they may be exposed. For instance, the common painkiller, <!--del_lnk--> paracetamol, is extremely toxic to cats. Because they naturally lack enzymes needed to digest it, even minute portions of doses safe for humans can be fatal. Any suspected ingestion warrants immediate veterinary attention. Similarly, <!--del_lnk--> phenol based products often used for cleaning and disinfecting, such as <!--del_lnk--> Pine-Sol, <!--del_lnk--> Lysol, <!--del_lnk--> hexachlorophene, <i>etc.</i>, are more toxic to cats than to humans or dogs , , and exposure has been known to be fatal. <p>Many human foods are toxic to cats; chocolate, for example, can be fatal due to the presence of <!--del_lnk--> theobromine (see <!--del_lnk--> theobromine poisoning), although few cats will eat chocolate.<p><a id="Hygiene" name="Hygiene"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Hygiene</span></h3>

      <p>Cats are known for their fastidious cleanliness. They <!--del_lnk--> groom themselves by licking their <!--del_lnk--> fur, employing their hooked pappilae and saliva. Their <!--del_lnk--> saliva is a powerful cleaning agent, but it can provoke <!--del_lnk--> allergic reactions in humans. Some people who are allergic to cats&mdash;typically manifested by <!--del_lnk--> hay fever, <a href="../../wp/a/Asthma.htm" title="Asthma">asthma</a> or a skin <!--del_lnk--> rash &mdash;quickly acclimate themselves to a particular animal and live comfortably in the same house with it, while retaining an allergy to cats in general. Many cats also enjoy grooming humans or other cats. Some cats occasionally regurgitate <!--del_lnk--> hair balls of fur that have collected in their stomachs as a result of their grooming. Longhair cats are more prone to this than shorthairs. Hairballs can be prevented with certain cat foods and remedies that ease elimination of the hair and regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush. Cats expend nearly as much fluid grooming as they do urinating.<p>Indoor cats are usually provided with a <!--del_lnk--> litter box containing <!--del_lnk--> litter, typically <!--del_lnk--> bentonite, but sometimes other absorbent material such as shredded paper or wood chips, or sometimes <a href="../../wp/s/Sand.htm" title="Sand">sand</a> or similar material. This arrangement serves the same purpose as a toilet for humans. It should be cleaned daily and changed often, depending on the number of cats in a household and the type of litter; if it is not kept clean, a cat may be fastidious enough to find other locations in the house for urination or defecation. This may also happen for other reasons; for instance, if a cat becomes <!--del_lnk--> constipated and defecation is uncomfortable, it may associate the discomfort with the litter box and avoid it in favour of another location. A litterbox is recommended for indoor-outdoor cats as well. Daily attention to the litter box also serves as a monitor of the cat&#39;s health. Numerous variations on litter and litter box design exist, including some which automatically sift the litter after each use. Clumping litter is a variation which absorbs urine into clumps which can be sifted out along with feces, and thus stays cleaner longer with regular sifting, but has sometimes been reported to cause health problems in some cats.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Litterboxes may pose a risk of <!--del_lnk--> toxoplasmosis transmission to susceptible pregnant women and immuno-compromised individuals, although this risk is greatly decreased in indoor-only cats which would not normally be exposed to the disease. Transmission risk may be reduced by daily litterbox cleaning by someone other than the susceptible individual.<p>Some cats can be toilet trained, eliminating the litterbox and its attendant expense and smell. Training involves two or three weeks of incremental moves, such as moving and elevating the litterbox until it is near the toilet. For a short time, an adapter, such as a bowl or small box, may be used to suspend the litter above the toilet bowl; numerous kits and other aids are marketed to help toilet-train cats. When training is complete, the cat uses the toilet by perching over the bowl. Occasional accidental dunkings, which can traumatize the cat to the point of its avoidance of the toilet, urinating and defecating in undesirable locations around the house, can be avoided by use of a simple insert of one or two crossbars or a widely spaced grid to prevent falling in but allow feces to pass; such safety devices have recently become commercially available. Otherwise, if a cat is not trained to use the toilet, it is wise to keep the lid shut to prevent thirsty or curious cats from falling in.<p><a id="Scratching" name="Scratching"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Scratching</span></h4>

      <p>Cats are naturally driven to periodically hook their front claws into suitable surfaces and pull backwards, in order to sharpen the claws and remove the worn outer sheath as well as exercising and stretching their muscles. This scratching behaviour seems enjoyable to the cat, and even <a href="#Declawing" title="">declawed</a> cats will go through elaborate scratching routines with every evidence of great satisfaction, despite the total lack of results. Indoor cats benefit from being provided with a <!--del_lnk--> scratching post so that they are less likely to use carpet or furniture which they can easily ruin. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery, but some authorities advise against this practice, as not making it clear to the cat which surfaces are permissible and which are not; they suggest using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher texture of the carpet backing is a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Some indoor cats, however, especially those that were taken as kittens from feral colonies, may not understand the concept of a scratching post, and as a result will ignore it.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Although scratching can serve cats to keep their claws from growing excessively long, their nails can be trimmed if necessary, with a small nail trimmer designed for humans, a small pair of electrical <!--del_lnk--> diagonal cutting pliers, or a guillotine type cutter specifically designed for animal nail trimming. Care must always be taken to avoid cutting the <!--del_lnk--> quick of the claw, analogous to cutting into the tip of a finger and equally painful and bloody. The position of the quick can be easily seen through the translucent nail of a cat with light colored claws but not in cats with dark colored nails, who therefore require carefully trimming of only small amounts from the nails.<p><a id="Declawing" name="Declawing"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Declawing</span></h5>

      <p>Declawing is a major surgery known as <i>onychectomy</i>, performed under <!--del_lnk--> anesthesia, which removes the tip of each digit (from the first knuckle out) of the cat&#39;s forepaws (and rarely the hind paws). The primary reason for declawing cats is to prevent them from damaging furniture; in the United States, some <!--del_lnk--> landlords may require that tenants&#39; cats be declawed. Rarely, vicious cats, cats that frequently fight with other pets, or cats that are too efficient at predation of songbirds <i>etc.</i> are declawed.<p>Many veterinarians are critical of the procedure, and some refuse to perform it because the absence of claws in a cat:<ol>
       <li>Deprives it of its main defense abilities, both fighting as well as escaping by climbing trees;<li>Can impair its stretching and exercise habits, leading to muscle atrophy;<li>Compromises its ability to grip and balance on thin surfaces such as railings and fence tops, leading to injury from falls;<li>Can cause insecurity and a subsequent tendency to bite.</ol>
      <p>For these reasons, all authorities recommend that declawed cats never be allowed to freely roam outdoors. This surgery is generally not recommended for an adult animal, and is rare outside of North America, being considered an act of <!--del_lnk--> animal cruelty in many Western countries. In Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, declawing is forbidden by the laws against <!--del_lnk--> cruelty to animals. In many other European countries, it is forbidden under the terms of the <!--del_lnk--> European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals, unless &quot;a <!--del_lnk--> veterinarian considers [such] non-curative procedures necessary either for veterinary medical reasons or for the benefit of (the) animal&quot;. In Britain, animal shelters find it difficult to place imported cats that have been declawed and subsequently most are <!--del_lnk--> euthanized. In 2003, <!--del_lnk--> West Hollywood, California became the first U.S. jurisdiction to outlaw declawing by veterinarians or animal groomers practicing in city limits.<p>While some people suggest cats not be declawed until 5-6 months of age, many veterinarians who practice this surgery are of the opinion that it is advantageous to declaw the cat as soon as it is old enough to sustain surgery (around 2-3 months of age, depending on size), reasoning that younger cats are more adaptable to the amputation, and that distal phalanges in the cat at this age are still flexible <!--del_lnk--> cartilage rather than <!--del_lnk--> bone, making the operation less severe.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After a cat has been declawed, it should be allowed to rest, and restrained from jumping (if possible) for a few days. After being declawed, as with after any surgery, there may be a period of about a week, sometimes less, when the cat will be uncomfortable being played with or picked up. As with any surgery, there is a slight risk of death, as well as complications which may leave the cat with an increased risk of infection and/or life-long discomfort in its paws.<p>An alternative to declawing is the application of blunt, vinyl nail caps that are affixed to the claws with nontoxic glue, requiring periodic replacement when the cat sheds its claw sheaths (about every four to six weeks). However, the cat will still experience difficulties because the capped nails are not as effective as claws.<p><a id="Environment" name="Environment"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Environment</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/w/Wild_cat.htm" title="Wild cat">wild cat</a>, ancestor of the domestic cat, is believed to have evolved in a desert climate, as evident in the behaviour common to both the domestic and wild forms. Wild cats are native to all continents other than Australia and Antarctica. Their feces are usually dry, and cats prefer to bury them in sandy places. Urine is highly concentrated, which allows the cat to retain as much fluid as possible. They are able to remain motionless for long periods, especially when observing prey and preparing to pounce. In North Africa there are still small wildcats that are probably related closely to the ancestors of today&#39;s domesticated breeds.<p>Cats enjoy heat and solar exposure, often sleeping in a sunny area during the heat of the day. Cats prefer warmer temperatures than humans do. People start to feel uncomfortable when their skin&#39;s temperature gets higher than about 44.5&nbsp;&deg;C (112&nbsp;&deg;F), but cats don&#39;t start to show signs of discomfort until their skin reaches about 52&nbsp;&deg;C (126&nbsp;&deg;F).<p>Being closely related to desert animals, cats can easily withstand the heat and cold of a <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> climate, but not for extended periods. Although certain breeds such as the <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian Forest Cat and <!--del_lnk--> Maine Coon have developed heavier coats of fur than other cats, they have little resistance against moist cold (eg, fog, rain and snow) and struggle to maintain their 39&nbsp;&deg;C (102&nbsp;&deg;F) body temperature when wet.<p>Most cats dislike immersion in water; one major exception is the <!--del_lnk--> Turkish Van breed which has an unusual fondness for water . <!--del_lnk--> Abyssinians are also reported to be more tolerant of water than most cats.<p><a id="Reproduction_and_genetics" name="Reproduction_and_genetics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Reproduction and genetics</span></h2>

      <p>Cats are seasonally <!--del_lnk--> polyestrous, which means they may have many periods of heat over the course of a year. A heat period lasts about 4 to 7 days if the female is bred; if she is not, the heat period lasts longer.<p>The male cat&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> penis has spines which point backwards. Upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> vagina. The female needs this stimulation for ovulation to begin. Because this does not always occur, females are rarely impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are <!--del_lnk--> superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, meaning different <!--del_lnk--> kittens in a litter may have different fathers.<p>The reproduction process can be very loud, as both cats vocalize loudly. If one is not used to the sounds of cats mating, it will sound like a cat fight.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> gestation period for cats is approximately 63-65 days. The size of a <!--del_lnk--> litter averages three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned at between six and seven weeks, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 4-10 months (females) and to 5-7 months (males).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The pregnant cat will exhibit physical and personality changes. Pregnant cat physical changes include abdominal enlargement, vomiting, increased appetite, pinking of nipples, and cessation of heat cycle. Pregnant cat personality changes include nesting behaviour during the terminal stages of pregnancy and also increased affection throughout the stages of pregnancy.<p>Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks old (the recommended minimum age by F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale F&eacute;line), or when they are ready to leave their mother. Cats can be surgically <!--del_lnk--> sterilized (spayed or neutered) as early as 6-8 weeks to limit unwanted reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behaviour, such as <!--del_lnk--> territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. If an animal is neutered after such behaviour has been learned, however, it may persist.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor both possess 38 <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes, in which over 200 heritable genetic defects have been identified, many homologous to human inborn errors. Specific metabolic defects have been identified underlying many of these feline diseases. There are several <!--del_lnk--> genes responsible for the hair colour identified. The combination of them gives different <!--del_lnk--> phenotypes. See <!--del_lnk--> Cat coat genetics.<p>Features like hair length, lack of tail or presence of a very short tail (bobtail cat) are also determined by single alleles and modified by polygenes.<p>The <b>Cat Genome Project</b>, sponsored by the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> National Cancer Institute Frederick Cancer Research and Development Centre in <!--del_lnk--> Frederick, Maryland, focuses on the development of the cat as an animal model for human hereditary disease, infectious disease, genome evolution, comparative research initiatives within the family Felidae, and forensic potential.<p><a id="Domestication" name="Domestication"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Domestication</span></h2>
      <p>In 2004, a grave was excavated in <a href="../../wp/c/Cyprus.htm" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> that contained the skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly. Like some other domesticated animals, cats live in a <!--del_lnk--> mutualistic arrangement with humans. It is believed that the benefit of removing rats and mice from humans&#39; food stores outweighed the trouble of extending the protection of a human settlement to a formerly wild animal, almost certainly for humans who had adopted a farming economy. Unlike the dog, which also hunts and kills rodents, the cat does not eat grains, fruits, or vegetables. A cat that is good at hunting rodents is referred to as a mouser.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> simile &quot;like herding cats&quot; refers to the seeming intractability of the ordinary house cat to training in anything, unlike dogs. Despite cohabitation in colonies, cats are lone hunters. It is no coincidence that cats are also &quot;clean&quot; animals; the chemistry of their saliva, expended during their frequent grooming, appears to be a natural deodorant. If so, the function of this cleanliness is to decrease the chance a prey animal will notice the cat&#39;s presence in time. In contrast, dog&#39;s odour is an advantage in hunting, for a dog is a pack hunter; part of the pack stations itself upwind, and its odour drives prey towards the rest of the pack stationed downwind. This requires a cooperative effort, which in turn requires communications skills. No such communications skills are required of a lone hunter. It is likely this is part of the reason interacting with such an animal is problematic; cats in particular are labeled as opaque or inscrutable, if not obtuse, as well as aloof and self-sufficient. However, cats can be very affectionate towards their human companions, especially if they <!--del_lnk--> imprint on them at a very young age and are treated with consistent affection.<p>Human attitudes toward cats vary widely. Some people keep cats for companionship as <!--del_lnk--> pets. Others go to great lengths to pamper their cats, sometimes treating them as if they were children. When a cat bonds with its owner, the cat may, at times, display behaviors similar to that of a human. Such behavior may include a trip to the litter box before bedtime or snuggling up close to its companion in bed or on the sofa. Other such behaviour includes mimicking sounds of the owner or using certain sounds the cat picks up from the human; sounds representing specific needs of the cat, which the owner would recognize, such as a specific tone of <!--del_lnk--> meow along with eye contact that may represent &quot;I&#39;m hungry.&quot; The cat may also be capable of learning to communicate with the human using non-spoken language or <!--del_lnk--> body language such as rubbing for affection (confirmation), facial expressions and making eye contact with the owner if something needs to be addressed (e.g., finding a bug crawling on the floor for the owner to get rid of). Some owners like to train their cat to perform &quot;tricks&quot; commonly exhibited by dogs such as jumping, though this is rare.<p>Allergies to cat <!--del_lnk--> dander are one of the most common reasons people cite for disliking cats. However, in some instances, humans find the rewards of cat companionship outweigh the discomfort and problems associated with these allergies. Many choose to cope with cat allergies by taking prescription allergy medicine and bathing their cats frequently, since weekly bathing will eliminate about 90% of the cat dander present in the environment. Recent studies have indicated that humans who are exposed to cats or dogs within the first year of their lives develop few animal allergies, while most adults who are allergic to animals did not have a cat or a dog as a pet in childhood .<p>In urban areas, some people find feral and free-roaming pet cats annoying and intrusive. Unaltered animals can engage in persistent nighttime calling (termed caterwauling) and defecation or &quot;marking&quot; of private property. Indoor confinement of pets and TNR (trap, neuter, return) programs for feral cats can help; some people also use <!--del_lnk--> cat deterrents to discourage cats from entering their property.<p>In rural areas, farms often have dozens of semi-feral cats. Hunting in the barns and the fields, they kill and eat rodents that would otherwise spoil large parts of the grain crop. Many pet cats successfully hunt and kill <a href="../../wp/r/Rabbit.htm" title="Rabbits">rabbits</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rodents, <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lizards, <a href="../../wp/f/Frog.htm" title="Frog">frogs</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, and large <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> by <!--del_lnk--> instinct, but might not eat their prey. They may even present their kills, dead or maimed, to their humans, perhaps expecting them to praise or reward them, or possibly even to complete the kill and eat the mouse. Others speculate that the behaviour is a part of the odd relationship between human and cat, in which the cat is sometimes a &#39;kitten&#39; (playing, being picked up and carried) and sometimes an adult (teaching these very large and peculiar kittens how to hunt by demonstrating what the point of it all is).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Despite its reputation as a solitary animal, the domestic cat is social enough to form <!--del_lnk--> colonies, but does not attack in groups as <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lions</a> do. Some breeds like <!--del_lnk--> bengal, <!--del_lnk--> ocicat and <!--del_lnk--> manx are very social, but are exceptions. While each cat holds a distinct territory (sexually active males having the largest territories, and neutered cats having the smallest), there are &quot;neutral&quot; areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually aggressively chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. <!--del_lnk--> Fighting cats make themselves appear more impressive and threatening by raising their fur and arching their backs, thus increasing their visual size. Cats also behave this way while playing. Attacks usually comprise powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites, but serious damage is rare; usually the loser runs away with little more than a few scratches to the face, and perhaps the ears. Normally, serious negative effects will be limited to possible infections of the scratches and bites; though these have been known to sometimes kill cats if untreated. In addition, such fighting is believed to be the primary route of transmission of <!--del_lnk--> feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Sexually active males will usually be in many fights during their lives, and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to the ears and nose. Not only males will fight; females will also fight over territory or to defend their kittens, and even neutered cats will defend their (smaller) territories aggressively.<p><a id="Feral_cats" name="Feral_cats"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Feral cats</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large groups called <!--del_lnk--> feral colonies with communal nurseries, depending on resource availability. Some lost or abandoned pet cats succeed in joining these colonies, probably for lack of an alternative. The average lifespan of such feral cats is much shorter than a domestic housecat, which can live sixteen years or more. Urban areas in the developed world are not friendly, nor adapted environments for cats; most domestic cats are descended from cats in desert climates and were distributed throughout the world by humans. Nevertheless, some feral cat colonies are found in large cities, e.g., around the <!--del_lnk--> Colosseum and <!--del_lnk--> Forum Romanum in Rome.<p>Although cats are adaptable, feral felines are unable to thrive in extreme cold and heat, and with a very high protein requirement, few find adequate nutrition on their own in cities. They have little protection or understanding of the dangers from dogs, <!--del_lnk--> coyotes, and even automobiles. However, there are thousands of volunteers and organizations that trap these unadoptable feral felines, <!--del_lnk--> spay or neuter them, <!--del_lnk--> immunize the cats against rabies and <!--del_lnk--> feline leukemia, and treat them with long-lasting <!--del_lnk--> flea products. Before release back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark the feral as spayed/neutered and inoculated, since these cats will more than likely find themselves trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives, and not only is their lifespan greatly increased, but behaviour and nuisance problems, due to competition for food, are also greatly reduced. In time, if an entire colony is successfully spayed and neutered, no additional kittens are born and the feral colony disappears. Many hope to see an end to urban feral cat colonies through these efforts.<p><a id="Environmental_issues" name="Environmental_issues"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Environmental issues</span></h3>
      <p>There are two divergent views about cats&rsquo; relationship with the <!--del_lnk--> natural environment.<ul>
       <li>The first says: The environmental impact of feral cat programs and of indoor/outdoor cats is a subject of debate. Part of this stems from humane concern for the cats themselves and part arises from concerns about cat predation on endangered species. Nearly all studies agree that abandoned animals lead hard lives. Owners who can no longer keep their cats would do best to give them to friends, rescue organizations, or shelters. The amount of ecological damage done by indoor/outdoor cats depends on local conditions. The most severe effect occurs to island ecologies. Serious concerns also exist in places such as Florida where housecats are not native, where several small-sized endangered species live near human populations, and where the climate allows cats to breed throughout the year. Environmental concerns may be minimal in most of the UK where cats are an established species and few to none of the local prey species are endangered. Pet owners can contact veterinarians, ecological organizations, and universities for opinions about whether local conditions are suitable for outdoor cats. Additional concerns include potential dangers from larger predators and infectious diseases. Coyotes kill large numbers of housecats in the Southwestern United States, even in urban zones. FELV (feline leukemia), FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), or rabies may be present in the area. If faced with conflicting evidence, the safe choice is to keep a cat indoors. Experts recommend a gradual transition to indoor life for cats who are accustomed to going outside.<li>Those opposing this view stress this allegation has never been proved. They say that damaging effects do not follow necessarily from the fact that cats are predators. They point out that cats have played a useful role in vermin control for centuries, and that for many animals, especially in urban areas, cats are the only animal available to fill the vital role of predator. Without cats these species would overpopulate.</ul>
      <p><a id="Overpopulation" name="Overpopulation"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Overpopulation</span></h2>
      <p>According to the Humane Society of the United States, 3-4 million cats and dogs are <!--del_lnk--> euthanized each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are significantly more animals being born than there are homes. Spaying or neutering pets helps keep the overpopulation down.  Local humane societies, SPCA&#39;s and other animal protection organizations urge people to spay or neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.<p><a id="Varieties_of_domestic_cat" name="Varieties_of_domestic_cat"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Varieties of domestic cat</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> list of cat breeds is quite large: most cat registries recognize between 35 and 70 breeds of cats, and several more are in development, with one or more new breeds being recognized each year on average, having distinct features and heritage. The owners and breeders of show cats compete to see whose animal bears the closest resemblance to the &quot;ideal&quot; definition of the breed (see <!--del_lnk--> selective breeding). Because of common crossbreeding in populated areas, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the homogeneous breeds of <!--del_lnk--> domestic longhair and <!--del_lnk--> domestic shorthair, depending on their type of fur. In the United Kingdom and Australia, non-purebred cats are referred in slang as <!--del_lnk--> moggies (derived from &quot;Maggie&quot;, short for Margaret, reputed to have been a common name for cows and calves in 18th-century England and latter applied to housecats during the Victorian era). In the United States, a non-purebred cat is sometimes referred to in slang as a barn or alley cat, even if it is not a <!--del_lnk--> stray.<p>Cats come in a variety of colors and patterns. These are physical properties and should not be confused with a breed of cat.<p>Household cats are divided into:<ul>

There are several other terms for amounts of white between these two extremes, such as <i>harlequin</i> or <i>jellicle cat</i>. Bicolor cats can have as their primary (non-white) colour black, red, any dilution thereof and tortoiseshell (see below for definition).</dl>

The classic &quot;blotched&quot; tabby (or &quot;marbled&quot;) pattern is the most common and consists of butterflies and bullseyes. The &quot;mackerel&quot; or &quot;striped&quot; tabby is a series of vertical stripes down the cat&#39;s side (resembling the fish). This pattern broken into spots is referred to as a &quot;spotted&quot; tabby. Finally, the tabby markings may look like a series of ticks on the fur, thus the &quot;ticked&quot; tabby, which is almost exclusively associated with the Abyssinian breed of cats. The worldwide evolution of the cat means that certain types of tabby are associated with certain countries; for instance, blotched tabbies are quite rare outside NW Europe, where they are the most common type.</dl>

       <dt><!--del_lnk--> Tortoiseshell and Calico<dd>This cat is also known as a Calimanco cat or Clouded Tiger cat, and by the nickname &quot;tortie&quot;. In the cat fancy, a tortoiseshell cat is randomly patched over with red (or its dilute form, cream) and black (or its dilute blue) mottled throughout the coat. Additionally, the cat may have white spots in its fur, which make it a &quot;tortoiseshell and white&quot; cat or, if there is a significant amount of white in the fur and the red and black colors form a patchwork rather than a mottled aspect, the cat will be called a &quot;calico&quot;. All calicos are tortoiseshell (as they carry both black and red), but not all tortoiseshells are calicos (which requires a significant amount of white in the fur and patching rather than mottling of the colors). The calico is also sometimes called a &quot;tricolor cat&quot;. The Japanese refer to this pattern as <i>mi-ke</i> (meaning &quot;triple fur&quot;), while the Dutch call these cats <i>lapjeskat</i> (meaning &quot;patches cat&quot;). A true tricolor must consist of three colors: a reddish color, dark or light; white; and one other colour, typically a brown, black or blue, as described by American breeder Barbara French, writing for the Cat Fanciers community. Both tortoiseshell and calico cats are typically female because the <!--del_lnk--> coat pattern is the result of differential <!--del_lnk--> X chromosome <!--del_lnk--> inactivation in <!--del_lnk--> females (which, as with all normal female <!--del_lnk--> mammals, have two X <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes). Those male tortoiseshells that are created are usually sterile; conversely, cats where the overall colour is ginger (orange) are commonly male (roughly in a 3:1 ratio). In a litter sired by a ginger tom, the females will be tortoiseshell or ginger. See &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tortoiseshell and Tricolour Cats&quot; for an extensive genetic explanation for tricolor cats, and detailing the possible combinations of coloring.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Colorpoint<dd>

       <dd>The colorpoint pattern is most commonly associated with <!--del_lnk--> Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domestic cat. A colorpoint cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter version of the same color on the rest of the body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual colour, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac points (silvery gray-pink), flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. It should also be noted that colorpoint cats tend to darken with age, and the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten depending on circumstances because pigment synthesis in the fur is temperature-sensitive.</dl>

      <p>Cats can also come in several body types, ranging between two extremes:<dl>

      <p>Cats have been kept by humans since at least <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. In ancient Egypt, the cat god, <!--del_lnk--> Bast, was a goddess of the home and of the domestic cat, although she sometimes took on the war-like aspect of a lioness. She was the daughter of the sun god <!--del_lnk--> Ra, although she was sometimes regarded as the daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Amun. She was the wife of <!--del_lnk--> Ptah and mother of the lion-god <!--del_lnk--> Mihos. Her cult was centered on her sanctuary at <!--del_lnk--> Bubastis in the <!--del_lnk--> Nile Delta, where a <!--del_lnk--> necropolis has been found containing mummified cats. Bast was also associated with the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> eye of Ra,&quot; acting as the instrument of the <!--del_lnk--> sun god&#39;s vengeance. She was depicted as a cat or in human form with the head of a cat, often holding the sacred rattle known as the <!--del_lnk--> sistrum.<p>It has been speculated that because of circumstantial evidence (which to date is unproved by DNA testing) cats resident in Kenya&#39;s Islands in the Lamu Archipelago may be the last living direct descendants of the sacred cats of ancient Egypt. The suggestive evidence is: similar body conformation, archeologically proven history of 1000 years habitation, ancient Red Sea trade between Lamu and Egypt, genetic insular isolation. <p>According to Norse legend, <!--del_lnk--> Gleipnir (the fine ribbon used to bind <!--del_lnk--> Fenrir) was crafted by dwarfs from, among other items, the sound a cat makes when walking.<p>Several ancient religions believe that cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that they are all-knowing but are mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans.<p><!--del_lnk--> Muezza (Arabic: &#xFEE3;&#xFEEE;&#xFEF4;&#xFEB0;&#x627;&lrm; &#x200B;) was the Prophet <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>&#39;s favorite cat. The most famous story about Muezza recounts how the call to prayer was given, and as Muhammad went to put on one of his robes, he found his cat sleeping on one of the sleeves, and instead of disturbing the cat he cut off the sleeve and let him sleep. When he returned, Muezza awoke and bowed down to Muhammad, and in return he stroked him three times. A similar story is told about an unnamed <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of China.<p>It is common lore that cats have nine lives. It is a tribute to their perceived durability, their occasional apparent lack of instinct for self-preservation, and their seeming ability to survive falls that would be fatal to other animals.<p>A medieval King of Wales, <!--del_lnk--> Hywel Dda (the Good) passed legislation making it illegal to kill or harm a cat. Other cultures of the time considered them evil, unlucky, or the consorts of <!--del_lnk--> witches.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat&quot;</div>
