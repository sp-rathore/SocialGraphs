      <p><b>Charles II</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 29 May <!--del_lnk--> 1630 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 6 February <!--del_lnk--> 1685) was the <!--del_lnk--> King of England, <!--del_lnk--> King of Scots, and <!--del_lnk--> King of Ireland from <!--del_lnk--> 30 January <!--del_lnk--> 1649 (<i><!--del_lnk--> de jure</i>) or <!--del_lnk--> 29 May <!--del_lnk--> 1660 (<i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i>) until his death. His father <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_I_of_England.htm" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649, following the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War; the monarchy was then abolished and <!--del_lnk--> England, and subsequently <!--del_lnk--> Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> Ireland became a united republic under <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Protector (see <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of England and <!--del_lnk--> The Protectorate), albeit with Scotland and Ireland under military occupation and de facto <!--del_lnk--> martial law. In 1660, shortly after Cromwell&#39;s death, the monarchy was <!--del_lnk--> restored under Charles II. He was popularly known as the &quot;Merry Monarch&quot; in reference to the liveliness and <!--del_lnk--> hedonism of his court.<p>The exact date at which Charles became King is vague due to the uncertain political situation of the time. His father was executed on <!--del_lnk--> 30 January <!--del_lnk--> 1649, making him in theory King Charles II from that moment. He was immediately proclaimed King in Scotland on <!--del_lnk--> 5 February and Jersey on <!--del_lnk--> 16 February <!--del_lnk--> 1649&mdash;but also recognised in a few British colonies (especially the <!--del_lnk--> Colony and Dominion of Virginia). In Scotland Charles was for some time King in title only. It took two years of negotiation with the Presbyterians before he was finally crowned King of Scots in Scone on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1651. However, his reign there was shortlived as he was soon driven out by the republican armies, led by Oliver Cromwell. His coronation in England would not be until after Cromwell&#39;s death and the monarchy&#39;s restoration in May 1660, Charles spending most of the intervening time exiled in France.<p>Much like his father, Charles II struggled for most of his life in his relations with Parliament, although the tensions between the two never reached the same levels of hostility. He was only able to achieve true success towards the end of his reign, by dispensing with Parliament and ruling alone. Unlike his father&#39;s however, this policy did not lead to widespread popular opposition, as he avoided the imposition of any new taxes, thanks in part to money he received as a result of his close relationship with the French king, <!--del_lnk--> Louis XIV. The principal conflicts of his reign revolved around a number of interlinked issues in domestic and foreign policy, most of which were related to the conflict between Protestants and Catholics then raging across Europe. As a consequence of this, Charles&#39; reign was racked by political factions and intrigue, and it was at this time that the <!--del_lnk--> Whig and <!--del_lnk--> Tory <!--del_lnk--> political parties first developed.<p>He famously fathered numerous <!--del_lnk--> illegitimate children, of whom he acknowledged fourteen, but no <!--del_lnk--> legitimate children who lived. Charles was also a <!--del_lnk--> patron of the arts, and he and his court were largely responsible for the revival of public drama and music, after their virtual prohibition under the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Protectorate. Some historians, such as Maurice Ashley, believe that Charles was secretly a <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> for much of his life like his brother <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James</a> while others, such as <!--del_lnk--> Antonia Fraser, disagree. All that is known for certain is that he had converted to <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholicism</a> by the time of his death.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During the 1640s, when the Prince of Wales was still young, his father Charles I fought parliamentary and <!--del_lnk--> Puritan forces in the English Civil War. The prince accompanied his father during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Edgehill and, at the age of fifteen, participated in the campaigns of 1645, when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the West Country. In 1647, due to fears for his safety, he left England, going first to the <a href="../../wp/i/Isles_of_Scilly.htm" title="Isles of Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>, then to <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Jersey">Jersey</a>, and finally to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, where his mother was already living in exile. (His cousin, <!--del_lnk--> Louis XIV sat on the French throne.) In 1648, during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Civil War, Charles moved to <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">The Hague</a>, where his sister <!--del_lnk--> Mary and his brother-in-law <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Orange seemed more likely to provide substantial aid to the Royalist cause than the Queen&#39;s French relations. However Charles was neither able to use the royalist fleet that came under his control to any advantage, nor to reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Engagers&quot; army of the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Hamilton, before it was defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Preston.<p>At the Hague, Charles II had an affair with <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Walter (whom, some alleged, he secretly married). Their son, <!--del_lnk--> James Crofts (afterwards <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Monmouth and <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Buccleuch), was to become the most prominent of Charles&#39;s many illegitimate sons in English political life, and famously led a rebellion on Charles&#39; death, aimed at placing himself (a staunch Protestant) on the throne instead of Charles&#39; Catholic brother James.<p>Charles I was captured in 1647. He escaped and was recaptured in 1648. Despite his son&#39;s efforts to save him, Charles I was executed in 1649, and England was proclaimed a <!--del_lnk--> republic.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>At the same time, however, Scotland recognized Charles as his father&#39;s successor&mdash;even the <!--del_lnk--> Covenanters (led by the <!--del_lnk--> Marquess of Argyll), the most extreme Presbyterian group in Scotland, proved unwilling to allow the English to decide the fate of their monarchy. Consequently, on <!--del_lnk--> 5 February <!--del_lnk--> 1649, Charles II was proclaimed King of Scots in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. He would not be allowed to enjoy the powers that followed from his title until such time as he signed the <!--del_lnk--> Solemn League and Covenant (an agreement between England and Scotland that the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland should not be remodelled on <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> lines but should remain <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian &ndash; the form of church governance preferred by most in Scotland &ndash; and that the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> should be reformed along the same lines) (see also <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Breda (1650)). Upon his arrival in Scotland on <!--del_lnk--> 23 June <!--del_lnk--> 1650, he formally agreed to the Covenant; his abandonment of Anglicanism, although winning him support in Scotland, left him unpopular in England. Charles himself soon came to despise his Scottish hosts (or &quot;gaolers&quot;, as he came to see the dour Covenanters), and supposedly celebrated at the news of the Covenanters&#39; defeat at <!--del_lnk--> Dunbar in September 1650. Nevertheless, the Scots remained Charles&#39;s best hope of restoration, and he was crowned King of Scots at <!--del_lnk--> Scone on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1651. With <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell&#39;s</a> forces threatening Charles&#39;s position in Scotland, it was decided to mount an attack on England. With many of the Scots (including Argyll and other leading Covenanters) refusing to participate, and with few English royalists joining the force as it moved south into England, the invasion ended in defeat at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Worcester on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1651, following which Charles is said to have hidden in the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Oak at <!--del_lnk--> Boscobel House, subsequently escaping to France in disguise. Parliament put a reward of <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">&pound;</a>1,000 on the king&#39;s head, and the penalty of death for anyone caught helping him. Through six weeks of narrow escapes Charles managed to flee England. (See also <!--del_lnk--> Escape of Charles II.)<p>Impoverished, Charles could not obtain sufficient support to mount a serious challenge to Cromwell&#39;s government. Despite the Stuart familial connections through Henrietta Maria and the Princess of Orange, France and the <!--del_lnk--> United Provinces allied themselves with Cromwell&#39;s government, forcing Charles to turn to <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> for aid. He attempted to raise an army, but failed due to his financial shortcomings.<p><a id="Restoration" name="Restoration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Restoration</span></h2>

      <p>After the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, Charles&#39; chances of regaining the Crown seemed slim. Oliver Cromwell was succeeded as <!--del_lnk--> Lord Protector by his son, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Cromwell. However, the new Lord Protector, with no power base in either Parliament or the New Model Army, was forced to abdicate in 1659. The Protectorate of England was abolished, and the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of England re-established. During the civil and military unrest which followed, <!--del_lnk--> George Monck, the Governor of Scotland, was concerned that the nation would descend into anarchy. Monck and his army marched into the <!--del_lnk--> City of London and forced the <!--del_lnk--> Long Parliament to dissolve itself. For the first time in almost twenty years, the members of Parliament faced a general election.<p>A predominantly Royalist House of Commons was elected. The <!--del_lnk--> Convention Parliament, soon after it assembled on <!--del_lnk--> 25 April <!--del_lnk--> 1660, received news of the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of Breda (<!--del_lnk--> 8 May <!--del_lnk--> 1660), in which Charles agreed, amongst other things, to pardon many of his father&#39;s enemies. It also subsequently declared that Charles II had been the lawful Sovereign since Charles I&#39;s execution in 1649.<p>Charles set out for England, arriving in <a href="../../wp/d/Dover.htm" title="Dover">Dover</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 23 May <!--del_lnk--> 1660 and reaching London on <!--del_lnk--> 29 May (which is considered the date of the <!--del_lnk--> Restoration, and was Charles&#39; thirtieth birthday).

      <p>The Convention Parliament was dissolved in December 1660. Shortly after Charles&#39;s coronation at <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 23 April <!--del_lnk--> 1661, the second Parliament of the reign&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Cavalier Parliament&mdash;assembled. As the Cavalier Parliament was overwhelmingly Royalist, Charles saw no reason to dissolve it and force another general election for seventeen years.<p>The Cavalier Parliament concerned itself with the agenda of Charles&#39; chief advisor, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Clarendon (Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon). Lord Clarendon sought to discourage <!--del_lnk--> non-conformity to the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>; at his instigation, the Cavalier Parliament passed several acts which became part of the &quot;Clarendon Code&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> Conventicle Act 1664 prohibited religious assemblies of more than five people, except under the auspices of the Church of England. The <!--del_lnk--> Five Mile Act 1665 prohibited clergymen from coming within five miles of a parish from which they had been banished. The Conventicle and Five Mile Acts remained in effect for the remainder of Charles&#39; reign. Other parts of the Clarendon Code included the <!--del_lnk--> Corporation Act 1661 and the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Uniformity 1662.<p>Charles agreed to give up antiquated feudal dues which had been revived by his father; in return, he was granted an annual income of &pound;1,200,000 by Parliament. The grant, however, proved to be of little use for most of Charles&#39; reign. The aforesaid sum was only an indication of the maximum the King was allowed to withdraw from the Treasury each year; for the most part, the amount actually in the coffers was much lower. To avoid further financial problems, Charles appointed <!--del_lnk--> George Downing (the builder of <!--del_lnk--> Downing Street) to reform the management of the Treasury and the collection of taxes.<p><a id="Foreign_policy" name="Foreign_policy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign policy</span></h2>
      <p>In 1662 Charles married a <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> princess, <!--del_lnk--> Catherine of Braganza, who brought him the territories of <!--del_lnk--> Bombay and <!--del_lnk--> Tangier as <!--del_lnk--> dowry. During the same year, however, he sold <!--del_lnk--> Dunkirk&mdash;a much more valuable strategic outpost&mdash;to his first cousin King <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a> of France for &pound;40,000.<p>Appreciative of the assistance given to him in gaining the throne, Charles awarded <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North American</a> lands then known as <!--del_lnk--> Carolina&mdash;named after his father&mdash;to eight nobles (known as Lords Proprietors) in 1663.<p>Whereas the <!--del_lnk--> Navigation Acts (1650), which hurt <!--del_lnk--> Dutch trade, started the <!--del_lnk--> First Dutch War (1652-1654), responsible for starting the <!--del_lnk--> Second Dutch War (1665-1667) was mainly the King&#39;s new advisor <!--del_lnk--> Lord Arlington, who hoped for much personal gain if the Dutch possessions in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">America</a> could be conquered. This conflict began well for the English, with the capture of <!--del_lnk--> New Amsterdam (later renamed <!--del_lnk--> New York in honour of Charles&#39; brother <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James, Duke of York</a>, the future James II of England/James VII of Scotland), but in 1667 the Dutch launched a surprise attack upon the English (the <!--del_lnk--> Raid on the Medway) when they sailed up the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> to where the better part of the English fleet was docked. Almost all of the ships were sunk except for the flagship, the <i><!--del_lnk--> HMS Royal Charles</i>, which was taken back to <!--del_lnk--> the Netherlands as a trophy. (The ship&#39;s transom remains on display, now at the <!--del_lnk--> Rijksmuseum in <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>.) The Second Dutch War ended with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Breda in 1667.<p>As a result of the Second Dutch War, Charles dismissed his advisor <!--del_lnk--> Lord Clarendon, whom he used as a scapegoat for the war. Clarendon fled to France when impeached by the House of Commons for <!--del_lnk--> high treason (which carried the penalty of death). Power passed to a group of five politicians known as the <!--del_lnk--> Cabal&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, <!--del_lnk--> George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Baron Ashley (afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury) and <!--del_lnk--> John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale.<p>In 1668, England allied itself with <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and with its former enemy the Netherlands, in order to oppose Louis XIV in the <!--del_lnk--> War of Devolution. Louis was forced to make peace with the <!--del_lnk--> Triple Alliance, but he continued to maintain his aggressive intentions. In 1670, Charles, seeking to solve his financial troubles, agreed to the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Dover, under which Louis XIV would pay him &pound;200,000 each year. In exchange, Charles agreed to supply Louis with troops and to convert himself to Roman Catholicism &quot;as soon as the welfare of his realm will permit.&quot; Louis was to provide him with 6,000 troops to suppress those who opposed the conversion. Charles endeavoured to ensure that the Treaty&mdash;especially the conversion clause&mdash;remained secret. It remains unclear if Charles ever seriously intended to follow through on the conversion clause.<p>Meanwhile, by a series of five acts around 1670, Charles granted the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops, to form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Earlier in 1668 he leased the islands of <!--del_lnk--> Bombay for a paltry sum of ten <!--del_lnk--> pounds sterling paid in <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>.<p><a id="Great_Plague_and_Fire" name="Great_Plague_and_Fire"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Great Plague and Fire</span></h2>
      <p>In 1665, Charles II was faced with a great health crisis: an outbreak of <!--del_lnk--> Bubonic Plague in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> commonly referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Plague. Believed to have been introduced by <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> shipping vessels carrying <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> from <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, the plague was carried by rats and fleas and the death toll at one point reached up to 7000 per week. Charles, his family and court fled London in July 1665 to <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Various attempts at containing the disease by London public health officials all fell in vain and the disease continued to spread rapidly.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 2 September <!--del_lnk--> 1666, adding to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s woes was what later became famously known as the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of London. Although effectively ending the spreading of the Great Plague due to the burning of all plague-carrying rats and fleas, the fire consumed about 13,200 houses and 87 churches, including <!--del_lnk--> St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral. Charles II is famously remembered for joining the fire-fighters in combating the fire.<p>At the time, a <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> was visible in the night sky. The supposition of the day claimed it was <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>&#39;s message, and that the above crises were as a result of God&#39;s anger. Blame was placed upon Charles and his Court, but later the people shifted their blame to the hated <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics. The situation was not helped by Charles&#39;s brother, <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James II</a>&#39;s conversion to Roman Catholicism in <!--del_lnk--> 1667.<p><a id="Conflict_with_Parliament" name="Conflict_with_Parliament"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Conflict with Parliament</span></h2>

      <p>Although previously favourable to the Crown, the Cavalier Parliament was alienated by the king&#39;s wars and religious policies during the 1670s. In 1672, Charles issued the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Declaration of Indulgence, in which he purported to suspend all laws punishing Roman Catholics and other religious dissenters. In the same year, he openly supported Catholic France and started the <!--del_lnk--> Third Anglo-Dutch War.<p>The Cavalier Parliament opposed the Declaration of Indulgence on constitutional grounds (claiming that the King had no right to arbitrarily suspend laws) rather than on political ones. Charles II withdrew the Declaration, and also agreed to the <!--del_lnk--> Test Act, which not only required public officials to receive the <!--del_lnk--> sacrament under the forms prescribed by the Church of England, but also forced them to denounce certain teachings of the Roman Catholic Church as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> superstitious and <a href="../../wp/i/Idolatry.htm" title="Idolatry">idolatrous</a>.&quot; The Cavalier Parliament also refused to further fund the Anglo-Dutch War, which England was losing, forcing Charles to make peace in 1674.<p>Charles&#39; wife Queen Catherine was unable to produce an heir, her pregnancies instead ending in <!--del_lnk--> miscarriages and <!--del_lnk--> stillbirths. Charles&#39; heir-presumptive was therefore his unpopular Roman Catholic brother, <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James, Duke of York</a>. In 1678, <!--del_lnk--> Titus Oates, a former Anglican cleric, falsely warned of a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Popish Plot&quot; to assassinate the king and replace him with the Duke of York. Charles did not believe the allegations, but ordered his chief minister <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Osborne, 1st Earl of Danby to investigate. Danby was highly sceptical about Oates&#39; revelations, but reported the matter to Parliament. The people were seized with an anti-Catholic hysteria; judges and juries across the land condemned the supposed conspirators; numerous innocent individuals were executed.<p>Later in 1678, Lord Danby was impeached by the House of Commons on the charge of <!--del_lnk--> high treason. Although much of the nation had sought war with Catholic France, Charles II had secretly negotiated with Louis XIV, trying to reach an agreement under which England would remain neutral in return for money. Lord Danby was hostile to France, but reservedly agreed to abide by Charles&#39; wishes. Unfortunately for him, the House of Commons failed to view him as a reluctant participant in the scandal, instead believing that he was the author of the policy. To save Lord Danby from the impeachment trial in the House of Lords, Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament in January 1679.<p>A new Parliament, which met in March of the same year, was quite hostile to the king. Lord Danby was forced to resign the post of <!--del_lnk--> Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, Parliament declared that a dissolution did not interrupt impeachment proceedings. When the House of Lords seemed ready to impose the punishment of exile&mdash;which the House of Commons thought too mild&mdash;the impeachment was abandoned, and a <!--del_lnk--> bill of attainder introduced. As he had had to do so many times during his reign, Charles II bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Lord Danby to the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>. Lord Danby would be held without <!--del_lnk--> bail for another five years.<p><a id="Later_years" name="Later_years"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later years</span></h2>
      <p>Another political storm which faced Charles was that of succession to the Throne. The Parliament of 1679 was vehemently opposed to the prospect of a Catholic monarch. Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley and a member of the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1672) introduced the <!--del_lnk--> Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown to the Protestant <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles&#39;s illegitimate children. The &quot;Abhorrers&quot;&mdash;those who opposed the Exclusion Bill&mdash;would develop into the <!--del_lnk--> Tory Party, whilst the &quot;Petitioners&quot;&mdash;those who supported the Exclusion Bill&mdash;became the <!--del_lnk--> Whig Party.<p>Fearing that the Exclusion Bill would be passed, Charles dissolved Parliament in December 1679. Two further Parliaments were called in Charles&#39; reign (one in 1680, the other in 1681), but both were dissolved because they sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill began to dissolve, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty, for many of his subjects felt that Parliament had been too assertive. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled as an absolute monarch.<p>Charles&#39; opposition to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the <!--del_lnk--> Rye House Plot, a plan to murder the King and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in <a href="../../wp/n/Newmarket.htm" title="Newmarket">Newmarket</a>. A great fire, however, destroyed much of Newmarket and caused the cancellation of the races; thus, the planned attack could not take place. Before news of the plot leaked, the chief conspirators fled. Protestant politicians such as <!--del_lnk--> Algernon Sydney and the <!--del_lnk--> Lord William Russell were implicated in the plot and executed for high treason, albeit on very flimsy evidence.<p>Charles suffered an <!--del_lnk--> apopleptic fit and died suddenly on Wednesday, <!--del_lnk--> 6 February <!--del_lnk--> 1685 (at the age of 54) at 11:45am at <!--del_lnk--> Whitehall Palace of <!--del_lnk--> uremia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). He is purported to have said to his brother, the <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">Duke of York</a> on his deathbed: &#39;Let not poor <!--del_lnk--> Nelly starve.&#39; and to his courtiers: &#39;I am sorry, gentlemen, for being such a time a-dying.&#39; He was buried in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> &#39;without any manner of pomp&#39; and was succeeded by his brother who became <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James II</a> of England and Ireland, and James VII of Scotland.<p><a id="Posterity_and_legacy" name="Posterity_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Posterity and legacy</span></h2>

      <p>Charles II left no legitimate issue. He did, however, have several children by a number of mistresses (many of whom were wives of noblemen); many of his mistresses and illegitimate children received dukedoms or earldoms. He publicly acknowledged fourteen children by seven mistresses; six of those children were borne by a single woman, the notorious <!--del_lnk--> Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine, for whom the <!--del_lnk--> Dukedom of Cleveland was created. His other favourite mistresses were <!--del_lnk--> Nell Gwynne and <!--del_lnk--> Louise Ren&eacute;e de Penanco&euml;t de K&eacute;rouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. Charles also acknowledged children by <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Walter, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Killigrew, Viscountess Shannon and <!--del_lnk--> Catherine Pegge, Lady Greene. The present <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Richmond and Gordon, <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Grafton and <!--del_lnk--> Duke of St Albans all descend from Charles in direct male line. Charles&#39; relationships, as well as the politics of his time, are depicted in the historical drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Charles II: The Power and The Passion</i> (produced in 2003 by the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>).<p><!--del_lnk--> Diana, Princess of Wales was descended from two of Charles&#39; illegitimate sons, the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Grafton and the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Richmond (who is also a direct ancestor of <!--del_lnk--> Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, second wife of <!--del_lnk--> Charles, Prince of Wales). Thus Diana&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Prince William of Wales, currently (2006) second in line to the British Throne, is likely to be the first monarch descended from Charles I since <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a>.<p>Charles II&#39;s eldest son, the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Monmouth, led a rebellion against James II, but was defeated at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Sedgemoor on <!--del_lnk--> 6 July <!--del_lnk--> 1685, captured, and executed. James II, however, was eventually dethroned in 1688 in the course of the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>. James was the last Catholic monarch to rule England.<p>Charles, a patron of the arts and sciences, helped found the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included <!--del_lnk--> Robert Hooke, <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Isaac_Newton.htm" title="Isaac Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a>. Charles was the personal patron of <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Wren.htm" title="Christopher Wren">Sir Christopher Wren</a>, the architect who helped rebuild London after the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire in 1666. Wren also constructed the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Hospital Chelsea, which Charles founded as a home for retired soldiers in 1681. Since 1692, a statue of Charles II in ancient Roman dress (created by <!--del_lnk--> Grinling Gibbons in 1676) has stood in the Figure Court of the Royal Hospital.<p>The anniversary of Charles&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Restoration (which is also his birthday) &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> 29 May &mdash; is recognised in the United Kingdom as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Oak Apple Day&quot;, after the Royal Oak in which Charles is said to have hid to escape from the forces of Oliver Cromwell. Traditional celebrations involved the wearing of oak leaves, but these have now died out. The anniversary of the Restoration is also an official <!--del_lnk--> Collar Day.<div class="thumb tright">
