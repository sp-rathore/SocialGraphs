      <p><b>Canberra</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> capital city of <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and with a population of just over 325,000, is Australia&#39;s largest inland city. The city is located at the northern end of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Capital Territory, 300 <!--del_lnk--> kilometres (190&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) southwest of <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, and 650 kilometres (400&nbsp;mi) north-east of <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation&#39;s capital in 1908 as a compromise between Sydney and Melbourne, the two largest cities. It is unusual among Australian cities as an entirely purpose-built, <!--del_lnk--> planned city. Following an international contest for the city&#39;s design, a design by <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> architect <!--del_lnk--> Walter Burley Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913. The city&#39;s design was heavily influenced by the <!--del_lnk--> garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title &quot;bush capital&quot;. Although the growth and development of Canberra was hindered by the World Wars and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, it emerged as a thriving city after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>As the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> government of Australia, Canberra is the site of <!--del_lnk--> Parliament House, the <!--del_lnk--> High Court of Australia and numerous government departments and agencies. It is also the location of several social and cultural institutions of national significance. The federal government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest employer in Canberra. Canberra is also a popular destination for domestic and international tourists.<p>Most Australians <!--del_lnk--> pronounce the city&#39;s name in two syllables as either <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;k&aelig;n.b&#x279;&#x259;/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;k&aelig;m.b&#x279;&#x259;/</span> (&#39;Can-bra&#39; or &#39;Cam-bra&#39;). It is also less commonly known as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x2C8;k&aelig;n.b&#x259;.&#x279;&#x259;/</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/k&aelig;n.&#x2C8;be.&#x279;&#x259;/</span>.

      <p>Before European settlement, the area in which Canberra would eventually be constructed was seasonally inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> Ngunnawal and Walgalu <!--del_lnk--> tribes. The Ngarigo lived south-east of the Canberra area, the Gundungurra to the north, the Yuin on the coast and the <!--del_lnk--> Wiradjuri to the west. Archaeological evidence from the Canberra region suggests human habitation of the area for at least 21,000 years. The word &quot;Canberra&quot; is said to be derived from the name of the local Ngabri people, one of the Ngunnawal family groups, or alternatively from the word <i>Kambera</i> meaning &quot;meeting place&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Ngunnawal language. The Ngunnawal name was apparently used as a reference to <!--del_lnk--> corroborees held during the seasonal migration of the Ngunawal people to feast on the <!--del_lnk--> Bogong moths that pass through the region each spring.<p>European exploration and settlement started in the Canberra area as early as the 1820s. There were four expeditions between 1820 and 1824. White settlement of the area probably dates from 1824, when a homestead or station was built on what is now the Acton peninsula by stockmen employed by Joshua John Moore. He formally purchased the site in 1826, and named the property Canberry. The European population in the Canberra area continued to grow slowly throughout the 19th century. Foremost among them was the Campbell family of &quot;Duntroon&quot;; their imposing stone house is now the officers&#39; mess of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Military College, Duntroon. The Campbells sponsored settlement by other <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Weetangera&quot;. As the European presence increased, the indigenous population dwindled, mainly from disease such as smallpox and measles.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The district&#39;s change from a New South Wales (NSW) rural area to the national capital started during debates over <!--del_lnk--> Federation in the late 19th century. Following a long dispute over whether <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> or <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> should be the national capital, a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was no closer than 100 miles to Sydney, with Melbourne to be the temporary capital while the new capital was built. Canberra was chosen as the site in 1908, as a result of survey work done by the government <!--del_lnk--> surveyor <!--del_lnk--> Charles Scrivener. The NSW government ceded the Federal Capital Territory (as it was then known) to the federal government. In an international design competition conducted by the Department of Home Affairs, on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1910, the design of <!--del_lnk--> Walter Burley Griffin was chosen for the city, and in 1913 Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began. On <!--del_lnk--> 12 March <!--del_lnk--> 1913, the city was officially given its name by <!--del_lnk--> Lady Denman, the wife of the then <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General <!--del_lnk--> Lord Denman at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill, which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present <!--del_lnk--> Parliament House. <!--del_lnk--> Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the city and the surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Australian Capital Territory (ACT) on the third Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The federal government moved to Canberra on <!--del_lnk--> 9 May <!--del_lnk--> 1927, with the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Provisional Parliament House. The Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Bruce, had officially taken up residence in <!--del_lnk--> The Lodge a few days earlier. Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the <!--del_lnk--> depression of the 1930s and during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Some projects planned for that time, for example, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic and <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Church_of_Australia.htm" title="Anglican Church of Australia">Anglican</a> cathedrals, were never completed. The development of Canberra gained pace after the Second World War, and it has grown beyond the original planners&rsquo; expectations since then. Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> following the war. <!--del_lnk--> Government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the city&#39;s growing population. Parts of Canberra&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> north and <!--del_lnk--> south were further developed in the 1950s, and urban development in the <!--del_lnk--> districts of <!--del_lnk--> Woden Valley and <!--del_lnk--> Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s, respectively. <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Burley_Griffin.htm" title="Lake Burley Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a> was completed in 1963.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 27 January <!--del_lnk--> 1972 the <!--del_lnk--> Aboriginal Tent Embassy was first established on the grounds of Parliament House; it was created to draw attention to indigenous rights and land issues and has been continuously occupied since 1992. On <!--del_lnk--> 9 May <!--del_lnk--> 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia&#39;s bicentenary celebrations, and the Federal Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House. In December 1988, the ACT was granted full self-government through an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament. Following the first elections in February 1989, a 17-member Legislative Assembly sat at its offices in London Circuit, Civic, on <!--del_lnk--> 11 May <!--del_lnk--> 1989. The <!--del_lnk--> Australian Labor Party formed the ACT&#39;s first government, led by the Chief Minister <!--del_lnk--> Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia&#39;s first female head of government.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 18 January <!--del_lnk--> 2003, parts of Canberra were engulfed by <!--del_lnk--> a bushfire that killed four people and destroyed 491 homes and the major research telescopes and workshop at the <!--del_lnk--> Australian National University&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mount Stromlo Observatory.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Canberra covers an area of 805.6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (311.0&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> sq.&nbsp;mi) and is located near the <!--del_lnk--> Brindabella Ranges, approximately 150&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilometres (93&nbsp;mi) inland from Australia&#39;s east coast. It is located at altitudes that range from 550&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres to 700&nbsp;metres (1,800 to 2,300&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) <!--del_lnk--> AHD. The highest point is <!--del_lnk--> Mount Majura at 888&nbsp;metres (2,913&nbsp;ft). Other large hills include <!--del_lnk--> Mt Taylor, <!--del_lnk--> Mt Ainslie, Mt Mugga Mugga and <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountain. The surrounding <!--del_lnk--> bushland and the original bushland that Canberra was built in is a mixture of eucalyptus <!--del_lnk--> savanna, <!--del_lnk--> scrubland, <!--del_lnk--> swamp and dry eucalyptus forests.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Molonglo River flows through Canberra and has been dammed to form the body of water in the centre of the city called <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Burley_Griffin.htm" title="Lake Burley Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>. The Molonglo then flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The <!--del_lnk--> Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT. A number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee. Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form <!--del_lnk--> Lakes Ginninderra and <!--del_lnk--> Tuggeranong. Until recently the Molonglo had a history of sometimes lethal floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Because of its latitude, elevation and distance from the coast, Canberra has four distinct seasons. The climates of most Australian coastal areas, which include all the state capital cities, are moderated by the sea. Canberra experiences hot, dry summers, and mild winters with heavy <!--del_lnk--> fog and frequent <!--del_lnk--> frosts, with a rare spot of <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> CBD and surrounding areas. The highest recorded maximum temperature was 42.2&nbsp;&deg;C (108&nbsp;&deg;F) on <!--del_lnk--> 1 February <!--del_lnk--> 1968. The lowest recorded minimum temperature is &minus;10.0&nbsp;&deg;C (14&nbsp;&deg;F) on <!--del_lnk--> 11 July <!--del_lnk--> 1971. Light snow falls in the city in one out of approximately three winters but is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates. <a href="../../wp/t/Thunderstorm.htm" title="Thunderstorm">Thunderstorms</a> can occur between October and March, with rainfall maximums in spring and summer.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>Canberra is a <!--del_lnk--> planned city that was originally designed by <!--del_lnk--> Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th century American architect. The city centre is laid out on two perpendicular axes: a water axis stretching along <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Burley_Griffin.htm" title="Lake Burley Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>, and a ceremonial land axis stretching from Parliament House on <!--del_lnk--> Capital Hill north-eastward along <!--del_lnk--> ANZAC Avenue to the <!--del_lnk--> Australian War Memorial at the foot of <!--del_lnk--> Mt Ainslie. The area known as the <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentary Triangle is formed by three of Burley Griffin&#39;s axes, stretching from Capital Hill along <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Avenue to the Civic Centre around City Hill, along Constitution Avenue to the Defence precinct on Russell Hill, and along Kings Avenue back to Capital Hill.<p>The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> North Canberra, mostly settled in the 1920s and &#39;30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 15 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> South Canberra, settled from the 1920s to &#39;60s, 12 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> Woden Valley, first settled in 1963, 13 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> Belconnen, first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> Weston Creek, settled in 1969, 8 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> Tuggeranong, settled in 1974, 19 suburbs<li><!--del_lnk--> Gungahlin, settled in the early 1990s, 7 suburbs to date</ul>

      <p>The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin&#39;s designs. In 1967 the then <!--del_lnk--> National Capital Development Commission adopted the &quot;Y Plan&quot; which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the &#39;town centres&#39; linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y, with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y. Development in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through the town planning process, but also through the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. All land in the ACT is held on 99 year leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.<p>Most suburbs have their own local shops, and are located close to a larger shopping centre serving a group of suburbs. Community facilites and schools are often also located near local shops or group shopping centres. Many of Canberra&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> suburbs are named after famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. <!--del_lnk--> Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of <!--del_lnk--> Duffy are named after Australian dams and weirs, and the streets of <!--del_lnk--> Page are named after biologists and naturalists. Most <!--del_lnk--> diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of <a href="../../wp/y/Yarralumla%252C_Australian_Capital_Territory.htm" title="Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory">Yarralumla</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Deakin and <!--del_lnk--> O&#39;Malley. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of <!--del_lnk--> Fyshwick, <!--del_lnk--> Mitchell and <!--del_lnk--> Hume.<p><a id="Governance" name="Governance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Governance</span></h2>

      <p>Outside Canberra, the Australian Capital Territory has no settlements larger than a village. The <!--del_lnk--> Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a <!--del_lnk--> city council and territory government. The Assembly consists of 17 members, elected from three districts using proportional representation. The three districts are Molongolo, Gininderra and Brindabella, which elect seven, five and five members, respectively. The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects another four MLAs to serve as Ministers to form, with the Chief Minister, an Executive (known informally as the <!--del_lnk--> cabinet.) At the 2004 election the Australian Labor Party, headed by Chief Minister <!--del_lnk--> Jon Stanhope, won nine of the 17 seats and formed the ACT&#39;s first majority government.<p>The Australian national government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the <!--del_lnk--> National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin&#39;s plan for the city, such as the Parliamentary Triangle, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park). The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988</i>. This Act of the national Parliament is the constitution for the ACT and limits the range of matters upon which the Assembly can legislate.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Australian Federal Police provides all of the police services of a state police force under a contractual agreement with the Australian Capital Territory Government. People who have been charged with offences are tried either in the <!--del_lnk--> ACT Magistrate&#39;s Court or, for more severe offences, the <!--del_lnk--> ACT Supreme Court. Prisoners can be held in <!--del_lnk--> remand at the <!--del_lnk--> Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT; as at 2006 there is no prison in the ACT, so people who have been sentenced to imprisonment serve their sentence in <!--del_lnk--> NSW. Courts such as a Small Claims Tribunal and a <!--del_lnk--> Family Court exist for civil law actions and other non-criminal legal matters.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>As of July 2006, the unemployment rate in Canberra is 2.8%, well below the national unemployment rate of 4.8%, with labour shortages reported in some sectors. As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest mean weekly disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage of a Canberra resident is <!--del_lnk--> $1,208.50, compared with the Australia wide average of $1,043.10. The median house price in Canberra as of June 2005 was $352,500, lower than Sydney and Melbourne but higher than all other capital cities. The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories. As at the June quarter of 2006 the median rent for a 3 bedroom house was $320 per week. This is the highest of all capital cities in Australia. The median rent for &#39;other&#39; dwellings is $300 per week.<p>The city&#39;s main industry is government administration and defence, which accounted for 26.1% of Gross Territory Product in 2003&ndash;04 and employed over 40% of Canberra&#39;s workforce. The major public-sector employers in Canberra include the parliament, government departments such as Department of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Treasury. A number of <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Force establishments are located in or near Canberra, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and <!--del_lnk--> HMAS <i>Harman</i>, which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multiuser depot. The former <!--del_lnk--> RAAF Fairbairn, adjacent to the Canberra International Airport was sold to the operators of the Airport, but the base continues to be used for <!--del_lnk--> RAAF VIP flights.<p>Property and business services, construction, health and community services, and education are other significant contributors to the economy of Canberra. A large amount of Australian and international visitors make tourism a significant contributor to the economy. The most popular seasons are spring and autumn; the annual <!--del_lnk--> Floriade spring flower display in September is a major attraction.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>As of 2003, the population of Canberra was 323,004 people, and the city has a population density of 401.0&nbsp;persons per square kilometre (1,038.6/sq.&nbsp;mi), which is dense with respect to other Australian cities. The 2001 census showed that 1.2% of Canberra&#39;s population were of indigenous origin and 21.6% were born overseas.  The largest group of people born overseas came from English-speaking countries, led by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and then <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

The average age is 32 years, and only 8.3% of the population is aged over 65 years. Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which is the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city. As of May 2004, 30% of people in the ACT aged 15&ndash;64 had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a <!--del_lnk--> bachelor&#39;s degree, significantly higher that the national average of 19%. Approximately 63% of Canberra residents describe themselves as <!--del_lnk--> Christian, the most common denominations being <!--del_lnk--> Catholic and <!--del_lnk--> Anglican; less than 3% of the population practice a non-Christian religion and 19% are not religious.<p>As of 2002 the most common <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crimes</a> in Canberra are property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and <!--del_lnk--> motor vehicle theft. They affect 1,961 and 630 of every 100,000 persons respectively. <!--del_lnk--> Homicide and related offences affect 1.5/100,000 persons which is below the national average of 4.9/100,000 persons.

      <p>The two main tertiary institutions are the <!--del_lnk--> Australian National University (ANU) in <!--del_lnk--> Acton and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Canberra (UC) in <!--del_lnk--> Bruce. The ANU was established as a research university in 1946; it continues to have a strong research focus and is ranked among the best universities in the world in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times Higher Education Supplement</i> and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings, and is ranked as Australia&#39;s best university. Both ANU and UC also have campuses interstate and overseas. There are also two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the North Canberra suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Watson is a campus of the <!--del_lnk--> Australian Catholic University; St Mark&#39;s Theological College adjacent to the Parliament House is a campus of <!--del_lnk--> Charles Sturt University.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Military College, Duntroon are near the suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Campbell in Canberra&#39;s inner north-east. ADFA teaches <!--del_lnk--> military <!--del_lnk--> undergraduates and <!--del_lnk--> postgraduates and is officially a <!--del_lnk--> campus of the <!--del_lnk--> University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides <!--del_lnk--> Australian Army <!--del_lnk--> Officer <!--del_lnk--> training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus <!--del_lnk--> Canberra Institute of Technology.<p>In February 2004 there were 140 <!--del_lnk--> public and non-governmental schools in Canberra; 96 were operated by the Government and 44 are non-Government. Most suburbs are planned to include a <!--del_lnk--> primary school and a nearby preschool, and schools are usually located near open areas for play and sports. Preschool is not a compulsory year, but many children attend for the government-funded 10.5 hours a week (12 from 2006). Primary school consists of seven grades: kindergarten and years 1 to 6. From years 7 to 10 children attend high school and in years 11 to 12 attend a college, unlike the rest of Australia where high school comprises year 7 to year 12. The ACT has the highest retention rate in Australia with 89% of students who were enrolled in year 7 in 1999 being enrolled full-time in year 12 in 2004. This retention rate has declined from a peak in 1994 when the rate was nearly 5% more, probably because of poor job prospects for young people at that time compared with 2004.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and <!--del_lnk--> Healthscope&#39;s National Capital Private in Garran are also major healthcare providers. The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra&#39;s hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales. The <!--del_lnk--> ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the <!--del_lnk--> ACT Emergency Services Authority.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h3>
      <p>The car is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra. Past planning policies have resulted in well developed good quality roads and a low population density spread over a relatively large area of the city. <!--del_lnk--> Canberra&#39;s districts are generally connected by &#39;parkways&#39; - limited access dual carriageway roads with speed limits generally set at 80 km/h to 100 km/h. An example is the <!--del_lnk--> Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra&#39;s CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek. In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by access roads.<p>A publicly run bus service,<!--del_lnk--> the Australian Capital Territory Internal Omnibus Network (ACTION), provides <!--del_lnk--> public transport throughout the city. A very good and widepread network of cycleways has been established. Only 4.6% of the population use the bus system. Another 5.5% walk or cycle to work, a higher proportion than in any other Australian capital city. There is no urban rail network in Canberra, although the Griffin&#39;s original plans contemplated both a heavy rail line servicing the north of the city and trams servicing other areas. A private bus service operates between Canberra and <!--del_lnk--> Queanbeyan, an adjoining town in <!--del_lnk--> New South Wales.<p>An interstate <!--del_lnk--> CountryLink railway service connects Canberra to <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Canberra&#39;s railway station is in the inner south suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Kingston. Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt. Train services to <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> are provided by way of a CountryLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in <!--del_lnk--> Yass, about one hour&#39;s drive from Canberra. Plans to establish a very fast <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> , or <a href="../../wp/t/TGV.htm" title="TGV">TGV</a> service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney have been contemplated, but not implemented by both government and private enterprise, as various proposals have not been deemed economically viable.<p>Canberra is about three hours by road from <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Federal Highway (National Highway 23), which connects with the <!--del_lnk--> Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near <!--del_lnk--> Goulburn, and seven hours by road from <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two hour drive on the <!--del_lnk--> Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the <!--del_lnk--> Snowy Mountains and the <!--del_lnk--> Kosciuszko National Park. <!--del_lnk--> Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the <!--del_lnk--> Kings Highway.<p><!--del_lnk--> Canberra International Airport provides direct domestic services to <a href="../../wp/s/Sydney.htm" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brisbane.htm" title="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Adelaide.htm" title="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Perth%252C_Western_Australia.htm" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>, with connections to other domestic centres. There are direct daily flights to <!--del_lnk--> Albury and <!--del_lnk--> Newcastle in New South Wales. Regular international flights have been considered, but to date only chartered international flights have connected Canberra directly with overseas destinations. Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with <!--del_lnk--> RAAF Base Fairbairn. On 27 June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control.<p><a id="Utilities" name="Utilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Utilities</span></h3>

      <p>The ACT government owned <!--del_lnk--> ACTEW Corporation manages Canberra&#39;s water and sewerage infrastructure. <!--del_lnk--> ActewAGL is a joint venture between ACTEW and <!--del_lnk--> AGL, and is the retail provider of Canberra&#39;s utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary <!--del_lnk--> TransACT. Canberra&#39;s water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the <!--del_lnk--> Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. The Googong Dam is in New South Wales but it is managed by the ACT government. ACTEW Corporation owns Canberra&#39;s two wastewater treatment plants, located at <!--del_lnk--> Fyshwick and at Lower Molonglo on the <!--del_lnk--> Molonglo River.<p>Electricity for Canberra comes from the national power grid through substations at <!--del_lnk--> Holt and <!--del_lnk--> Fyshwick (via <!--del_lnk--> Queanbeyan). Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at <!--del_lnk--> Belconnen and Mugga Lane. The first domestic power supply in Canberra was in 1913 for the suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Acton. Unlike most <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> cities, the power poles in Canberra&#39;s older suburbs are located along the rear boundaries of residential housing lots rather than on the street front. In newer areas the power supply and communications cabling are located underground.<p>As in other parts of Australia, terrestrial and mobile telecommunications services are provided by a range of competing companies. The majority of the infrastructure is owned by <!--del_lnk--> Telstra but some is owned by <!--del_lnk--> TransACT (a Canberra-based communications company) as well as other providers. The ACT has the highest rate of computer use and internet connection in Australia.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra&quot;</div>
