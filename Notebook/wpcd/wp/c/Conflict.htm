      <p><b>Conflict</b> is a state of opposition, disagreement or incompatibility between two or more people or groups of people, which is sometimes characterized by physical <!--del_lnk--> violence. Military conflict between <!--del_lnk--> states may constitute <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a>.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">political</a> terms, &quot;conflict&quot; refers to an ongoing state of hostility between two or more groups of people.<p>Conflict as taught for graduate and professional work in <!--del_lnk--> conflict resolution commonly has the definition: &quot;when two or more parties, with perceived incompatible goals, seek to undermine each other&#39;s goal-seeking capability&quot;.<p>One should not confuse the distinction between the presence and absence of conflict with the difference between <!--del_lnk--> competition and <!--del_lnk--> co-operation. In competitive situations, the two or more parties each have mutually inconsistent goals, so that when either party tries to reach their goal it will undermine the attempts of the other to reach theirs. Therefore, competitive situations will by their nature cause conflict. However, conflict can also occur in cooperative situations, in which two or more parties have consistent goals, because the manner in which one party tries to reach their goal can still undermine the other.<p>A clash of interests, values, actions or directions often sparks a conflict. Conflicts refer to the existence of that clash. Psychologically, a conflict exists when the reduction of one motivating stimulus involves an increase in another, so that a new adjustment is demanded. The word is applicable from the instant that the clash occurs. Even when we say that there is a potential conflict we are implying that there is already a conflict of direction even though a clash may not yet have occurred so to speak<p><a id="Types_and_Modes_of_Conflict" name="Types_and_Modes_of_Conflict"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Types and Modes of Conflict</span></h2>
      <p>A conceptual conflict can escalate into a verbal exchange and/or result in <!--del_lnk--> fighting.<p>Conflict can exist at a variety of levels of analysis:<ul>
       <li>intrapersonal conflict (though this usually just gets delegated out to <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>)<li>interpersonal conflict<li><!--del_lnk--> emotional conflict<li><!--del_lnk--> group conflict<li>organizational conflict<li>community conflict<li>intra-state conflict (for example: <!--del_lnk--> civil wars, <a href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Election">election</a> campaigns)<li>international conflict<li>environmental resources conflict<li>intersocietal conflict<li>intra-societal conflict<li>ideological conflict<li>diplomatic conflict<li>economic conflict<li>military conflict<li>religious-based conflict (for example: <!--del_lnk--> Centre For Reduction of Religious-Based Conflict)</ul>
      <p>Conflicts in these levels may appear &quot;nested&quot; in conflicts residing at larger levels of analysis. For example, conflict within a work team may play out the dynamics of a broader conflict in the organization as a whole. (See <!--del_lnk--> Marie Dugan&#39;s article on Nested Conflict. <!--del_lnk--> John Paul Lederach has also written on this.)<p>Theorists have claimed that parties can conceptualize responses to conflict according to a two-dimensional scheme; concern for one&#39;s own outcomes and concern for the outcomes of the other party. This scheme leads to the following hypotheses:<ul>
       <li>High concern for both one&#39;s own and the other party&#39;s outcomes leads to attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions.<li>High concern for one&#39;s own outcomes only leads to attempts to &quot;win&quot; the conflict.<li>High concern for the other party&#39;s outcomes only leads to allowing the other to &quot;win&quot; the conflict.<li>No concern for either side&#39;s outcomes leads to attempts to avoid the conflict.</ul>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Western society, practitioners usually suggest that attempts to find mutually beneficial solutions lead to the most satisfactory outcomes, but this may not hold true for many Asian societies.<p>Several theorists detect successive phases in the development of conflicts.<p>Often a group finds itself in conflict over <!--del_lnk--> facts, <!--del_lnk--> goals, <!--del_lnk--> methods or <!--del_lnk--> values. It is critical that it properly identify the type of conflict it is experiencing if it hopes to manage the conflict through to resolution. For example, a group will often treat an <!--del_lnk--> assumption as a fact.<p>The more difficult type of conflict is when values are the <!--del_lnk--> root cause. It is more likely that a conflict over facts, or assumptions, will be resolved than one over values. It is extremely difficult to &quot;prove&quot; that a value is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;.<p>In some instances, a group will benefit from the use of a <!--del_lnk--> facilitator or <!--del_lnk--> process consultant to help identify the specific type of conflict.<p>Practitioners of <!--del_lnk--> nonviolence have developed many practices to solve social and political conflicts without resorting to violence or coercion.<p><a id="Examples" name="Examples"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Examples</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Causes_of_Conflict" name="Causes_of_Conflict"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Causes of Conflict</span></h2>
      <p><b>Structural Factors</b> (How the company is set up)<ul>

      <p>&quot;Conflict is an emotionally defined and driven,&quot; and &quot;does not exist in the absence of emotion.&quot;<p>There are many components to the emotions that are intertwined with conflict. There is a behavioural, physiological, cognitive component.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Behavioural- The way emotional experience gets expressed which can be verbal or non-verbal and intentional or un-intentional.<li><!--del_lnk--> Physiological- The bodily experience of emotion. The way emotions make us feel in comparison to our identity.<li><!--del_lnk--> Cognitive- The idea that we &ldquo;assess or appraise&rdquo; an event to reveal its relevancy to ourselves.</ul>
      <p>These three components collectively advise that &ldquo;the meanings of emotional experience and expression are determined by cultural values, beliefs, and practices.&rdquo;<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Cultural values- culture tells people who are a part of it, &ldquo;Which emotions ought to be expressed in particular situations&rdquo; and &ldquo;what emotions are to be felt.&rdquo;<li><!--del_lnk--> Physical- This escalation results from &ldquo;anger or frustration.&rdquo;<li><!--del_lnk--> Verbal- This escalation results from &ldquo;negative perceptions of the annoyer&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</ul>
      <p>There are several principles of conflict and emotion.<ul>
       <li>1. Conflict is emotionally Defined-conflict involves emotion because something &ldquo;triggers&rdquo; it. The conflict is with the parties involved and how they decide to resolve it &ldquo;Events that trigger conflict are events that elicit emotion.&rdquo;<li>2. Conflict is emotionally Valenced- Emotion levels during conflict can be intense or less intense. The &ldquo;intensity&rdquo; levels &ldquo;may be indicative of the importance and meaning of the conflict issues for each&rdquo; party.<li>3. Conflict Invokes a Moral Stance- When an event occurs it can be interpreted as moral or immoral. The judging of this morality &ldquo;Influences one&rsquo;s orientation to the conflict, relationship to the parties involved, and the conflict issues&rdquo;.<li>4. Conflict is Identity based- Emotions and Identity are a part of conflict. When a person knows there values, beliefs, and morals they are able to determine whether the conflict is personal, relevant, and moral. &ldquo;Identity related conflicts are potentially more destructive.&rdquo;<li>5. Conflict is Relational- &ldquo;conflict is relational in the sense that emotional communication conveys relational definitions that impact conflict.&rdquo; &ldquo;Key relational elements are power and social status.&rdquo;</ul>
      <p>Emotions are acceptable in the workplace as long as they can be controlled and utilized for productive organizational outcomes.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict&quot;</div>
