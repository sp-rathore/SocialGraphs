      <p>The name <i>Canada</i> comes from a <!--del_lnk--> First Nations word, <i>kanata</i>, meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> 1535, inhabitants of the area near present-day <!--del_lnk--> Quebec City used the word to direct <a href="../../wp/j/Jacques_Cartier.htm" title="Jacques Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> towards the village of <!--del_lnk--> Stadacona. Cartier used the word &#39;Canada&#39; to refer to not only that village, but the entire area subject to <!--del_lnk--> Donnacona, Chief at Stadacona; by 1547, maps began referring to this and the surrounding area as Canada.<p>The French colony of <!--del_lnk--> Canada, <!--del_lnk--> New France, was set up along the <!--del_lnk--> Saint Lawrence River and the northern shores of the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. Later, it was split into two British colonies, called <!--del_lnk--> Upper Canada and <!--del_lnk--> Lower Canada until their union as the British <!--del_lnk--> Province of Canada in 1841. Upon <!--del_lnk--> Confederation in 1867, the name Canada was officially adopted for the new <!--del_lnk--> dominion, which was referred to as the <i>Dominion of Canada</i> until the 1950s. As Canada increasingly acquired political authority and autonomy from <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, the federal government increasingly simply used <i>Canada</i> on state documents and treaties. The <!--del_lnk--> Canada Act 1982 refers only to &quot;Canada&quot; and, as such, it is currently the only legal (and bilingual) name. This was reflected again in 1982 with the renaming of the national holiday from <!--del_lnk--> Dominion Day to <!--del_lnk--> Canada Day.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Aboriginal tradition holds that the <!--del_lnk--> First Peoples inhabited parts of Canada for a very long time, and some archaeological studies support human presence in northern <!--del_lnk--> Yukon to 26,500 years ago, and in southern <!--del_lnk--> Ontario to 9,500 years ago. Europeans first arrived when the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> settled briefly at <!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Anse aux Meadows circa AD 1000. The next Europeans to explore Canada&#39;s Atlantic coast included <a href="../../wp/j/John_Cabot.htm" title="John Cabot">John Cabot</a> in 1497 and <!--del_lnk--> Martin Frobisher in 1576, for <!--del_lnk--> England; and <a href="../../wp/j/Jacques_Cartier.htm" title="Jacques Cartier">Jacques Cartier</a> in 1534 and <!--del_lnk--> Samuel de Champlain in 1603, for <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. The first permanent European settlements were established by the French at <!--del_lnk--> Port Royal in 1605 and <!--del_lnk--> Quebec City in 1608, and by the English in <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland, around 1610. European explorers and trappers unwittingly brought diseases that spread rapidly through native trade routes and decimated the Aboriginal population.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>For much of the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">seventeenth century</a>, the English and French colonies in North America were able to develop in relative isolation from each other. French colonists extensively settled the <!--del_lnk--> St. Lawrence River valley, while English colonists largely settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Thirteen Colonies to the south. However, as competition for territory, naval bases, furs and fish escalated, several wars broke out between the French, <!--del_lnk--> English and Native tribes. The <!--del_lnk--> French and Iroquois Wars erupted between the <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois Confederation and the <!--del_lnk--> Algonquin, with their French allies, over control of the fur trade. A series of four <!--del_lnk--> French and Indian Wars were fought between 1689 and 1763; these culminated with a complete British victory in the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War. By the terms of <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Paris in 1763, Britain gained control of all of France&#39;s North American territory east of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, except for the remote islands of <!--del_lnk--> St. Pierre and Miquelon.<p>Following the war, the British found themselves in possession of a mostly French-speaking, <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic territory, whose inhabitants had recently taken up arms against Britain. To avert conflict, Britain passed the <!--del_lnk--> Quebec Act of 1774, re-establishing the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law in Quebec. The act had unforseen consequences for Britain, however, as it angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, helping to fuel the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution. Following the independence of the United States, approximately 50,000 <!--del_lnk--> United Empire Loyalists moved to <!--del_lnk--> Quebec, <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. As they were unwelcome in Nova Scotia, <!--del_lnk--> New Brunswick was carved out of that colony for them in 1784. To accommodate the English-speaking Loyalists in Quebec, the province was divided into francophone <!--del_lnk--> Lower Canada and anglophone <!--del_lnk--> Upper Canada under the <!--del_lnk--> Constitutional Act in 1791.<p>Canada was a major front in the <!--del_lnk--> War of 1812 between the United States and British Empire and its successful defence had important long-term <!--del_lnk--> effects on Canada, including the building of a sense of unity and nationalism among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland. A series of agreements led to long-term peace between Canada and the United States, interrupted only briefly by raids made by political insurgents such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hunters&#39; Lodges and the <!--del_lnk--> Fenian Brotherhood.<p>Following the failed <!--del_lnk--> Rebellions of 1837, which demanded <!--del_lnk--> responsible government, colonial officials studied the political situation and issued the <!--del_lnk--> Durham Report in 1839. One goal&mdash;which proved unacceptable for the alliance of anglophone and francophone reformers that had rebelled in 1837&mdash;was to assimilate the French Canadians into British culture. <!--del_lnk--> The Canadas were merged into a single, quasi-federal colony, the <!--del_lnk--> United Province of Canada, with the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union (1840). The signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the <!--del_lnk--> Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the <!--del_lnk--> 49th parallel and ending joint occupation of the <!--del_lnk--> Oregon Country/<!--del_lnk--> Columbia District. This led to the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849 and, with the outbreak of the <!--del_lnk--> Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, the colony of <!--del_lnk--> British Columbia in 1858, but both were entirely separate from the United Province of Canada. By the late 1850s, leaders in Canada launched a series of western exploratory expeditions, with the intention of assuming control of <!--del_lnk--> Rupert&#39;s Land and the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> region. The Canadian population grew rapidly because of high birth rates; high European immigration was offset by emigration to the United States, especially by French Canadians moving to <!--del_lnk--> New England.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> Great Coalition, the <!--del_lnk--> Charlottetown Conference, the <!--del_lnk--> Quebec Conference of 1864, and the <!--del_lnk--> London Conference of 1866, the three colonies&mdash;Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick&mdash;undertook the process of <!--del_lnk--> Confederation. The <!--del_lnk--> British North America Act created &quot;one dominion under the name of <!--del_lnk--> Canada&quot;, with four provinces: Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. After Canada assumed control of Rupert&#39;s Land and the <!--del_lnk--> North-Western Territory, which together formed the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territories in 1870, inattention to the <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;tis led to the <!--del_lnk--> Red River Rebellion and ultimately to the creation of the province of <!--del_lnk--> Manitoba and its entry into Confederation in July 1870. British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which had <!--del_lnk--> united in 1866) and the colony of <!--del_lnk--> Prince Edward Island joined the Confederation in 1871 and 1873, respectively. To connect the union and assert authority over the western provinces, Canada constructed three trans-continental railways, most notably the <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_Pacific_Railway.htm" title="Canadian Pacific Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, encouraged immigrants to develop the prairies with the <!--del_lnk--> Dominion Lands Act, and established the <!--del_lnk--> North West Mounted Police. As settlers went to the prairies on the railway and the population grew, regions of the Northwest Territories were given provincial status forming <!--del_lnk--> Alberta and <!--del_lnk--> Saskatchewan in 1905.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Canada automatically entered the <!--del_lnk--> First World War in 1914 with Britain&#39;s declaration of war, and sent formed divisions, composed almost entirely of volunteers, to the Western Front to fight as a national contingent. Casualties were so high that Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Robert Borden was forced to bring in <!--del_lnk--> conscription in 1917; this move was extremely unpopular in Quebec, resulting in his Conservative party losing support in that province. Although the Liberals were deeply divided over conscription, they became the dominant political party.<p>In 1919, Canada joined the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> in its own right, and in 1931 the <!--del_lnk--> Statute of Westminster confirmed that no act of the <!--del_lnk--> British Parliament would extend to Canada without its consent. At the same time, the worldwide <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression of 1929 affected Canadians of every class; the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Alberta and Saskatchewan presaged a welfare state as pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Tommy Douglas in the 1940s and 1950s. After supporting appeasement of Germany in the late 1930s, Liberal Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> William Lyon Mackenzie King secured Parliament&rsquo;s approval for <!--del_lnk--> entry into the Second World War in September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland. The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939.  The economy boomed during the war mainly due to the amount of military <!--del_lnk--> materiel being produced for Canada, Britain, China and the Soviet Union. Canada finished the war with one of the largest militaries in the world. In 1949, the formerly independent <!--del_lnk--> Dominion of Newfoundland joined the Confederation as Canada&#39;s 10th province.<p>By Canada&#39;s centennial in 1967, heavy post-war immigration from various war-ravaged European countries had changed the country&#39;s demographics. In addition, throughout the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, thousands of American <!--del_lnk--> draft dodgers fled to and settled in various parts of Canada. Increased immigration, combined with the baby boom, an economic strength parallelling that of the 1960s United States, and reaction to the <!--del_lnk--> Quiet Revolution in Quebec, initiated a new type of Canadian nationalism.<p>At a meeting of First Ministers in November 1981, the federal and provincial governments agreed to the <!--del_lnk--> patriation of the constitution, with <!--del_lnk--> procedures for amending it. Despite the fact that the Quebec government did not agree to the changes, on <!--del_lnk--> 17 April <!--del_lnk--> 1982, Canada, by Proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II, patriated its Constitution from Britain, thereby making Canada wholly sovereign, though the two countries continue to share the same monarch.<p>After Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes during the <!--del_lnk--> Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, some <!--del_lnk--> Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois began pressing for greater provincial autonomy, or partial or complete independence from Canada. Alienation between English-speaking Canadians and the Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois over the language, cultural and social divide had been exacerbated by many events, including the <!--del_lnk--> Conscription Crisis of 1944. While a referendum on <!--del_lnk--> sovereignty-association in <!--del_lnk--> 1980 was rejected by a solid majority of the population, a second referendum in <!--del_lnk--> 1995 was rejected by a margin of just 50.6% to 49.4%. In 1997, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled <!--del_lnk--> unilateral secession by a province to be unconstitutional; Quebec&#39;s sovereignty movement has continued nonetheless. <p>Economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The <!--del_lnk--> Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1987 was a defining moment in integrating the two countries. In recent decades, Canadians have worried about their cultural autonomy as American television shows, movies and corporations became omnipresent. However, Canadians take special pride in their <!--del_lnk--> system of universal health care and their commitment to multiculturalism.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

The Constitution includes the <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms.htm" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, which guarantees basic rights and freedoms for Canadians that, generally, cannot be overridden by legislation of any level of government in Canada. It contains, however, a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> notwithstanding clause&quot;, which allows the federal parliament and the provincial legislatures the power to override some other sections of the Charter temporarily, for a period of five years.<p>The position of <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, Canada&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> head of government, belongs to the leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority in the <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_House_of_Commons.htm" title="Canadian House of Commons">House of Commons</a>. The Prime Minister and their Cabinet are formally appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor General (who is the Monarch&#39;s representative in Canada). However, the Prime Minister chooses the Cabinet, and by convention, the Governor General respects the Prime Minister&#39;s choices. The <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet is traditionally drawn from members of the Prime Minister&#39;s party in both legislative houses, and mostly from the House of Commons. Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the <!--del_lnk--> Queen&#39;s Privy Council for Canada, and become Ministers of the Crown. The Prime Minister exercises vast political power, especially in the appointment of other officials within the government and <!--del_lnk--> civil service. <!--del_lnk--> Micha&euml;lle Jean has served as Governor General since <!--del_lnk--> September 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, and <a href="../../wp/s/Stephen_Harper.htm" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party, has served as Prime Minister since <!--del_lnk--> February 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_Canada.htm" title="Parliament of Canada">federal parliament</a> is made up of the Queen and two houses: an elected House of Commons and an appointed <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_Senate.htm" title="Canadian Senate">Senate</a>. Each member in the House of Commons is elected by <!--del_lnk--> simple plurality in a <!--del_lnk--> &quot;riding&quot; or electoral district; general elections are called by the Governor General when the Prime Minister so advises. While there is no minimum term for a Parliament, a new election must be called within five years of the last general election. Members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, are chosen by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the Governor General, and serve until age 75.<p>Canada&#39;s four major political parties are the <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party of Canada, <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Party of Canada, <!--del_lnk--> New Democratic Party (NDP), and the <!--del_lnk--> Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. The current government is formed by the Conservative Party of Canada.

      <p>Canada has a close <!--del_lnk--> relationship with the United States, sharing the world&#39;s longest undefended border, co-operating on some military campaigns and exercises, and being each other&#39;s largest trading partners. Canada also shares history and long relationships with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the two former imperial powers most influential in its founding. These relations extend to other former-members of the British and French empires, through Canada&#39;s membership in the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations and <!--del_lnk--> La Francophonie.<p>Canada joined the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of American States (OAS) in 1990 and hosted the OAS General Assembly in Windsor in June 2000, and the third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City in April 2001. Canada seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the <!--del_lnk--> Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).<p>Over the past sixty years, Canada has been an advocate for <!--del_lnk--> multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. This was clearly demonstrated during the <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis of 1956 when <!--del_lnk--> Lester B.

In that spirit, Canada developed and has tried to maintain a leading role in UN peacekeeping efforts; Canada has served in 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989. Canada&#39;s UN peacekeeping contributions have diminished over the first years of the 21st century. Although Canadian foreign policy is often similar to that of the United States, Canada has always maintained an independent foreign policy in such areas as maintaining full diplomatic and trade relations with Cuba.<div class="thumb tleft">

The three territories are the <!--del_lnk--> Northwest Territories, <!--del_lnk--> Nunavut, and <!--del_lnk--> Yukon Territory. The provinces have a <!--del_lnk--> large degree of autonomy from the federal government, the territories somewhat less. Each has its own <!--del_lnk--> provincial or territorial symbols.<p>The provinces are responsible for most of Canada&#39;s social programs (such as <!--del_lnk--> health care, <!--del_lnk--> education, and <!--del_lnk--> welfare) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. <!--del_lnk--> Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<p>All provinces have <!--del_lnk--> unicameral, elected <!--del_lnk--> legislatures headed by a <!--del_lnk--> Premier selected in the same way as the Prime Minister of Canada.

      <p>Canada is one of the world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> wealthiest nations with a high per capita income, a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and <!--del_lnk--> Group of Eight (G8). Canada is a <!--del_lnk--> free market economy with slightly more government intervention than the United States, but much less than most European nations. Canada has traditionally had a lower per capita <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product (GDP) than its southern neighbour (whereas wealth has been more equally divided), but higher than the large western European economies. For the past decade, after a period of turbulence, the Canadian economy has been growing rapidly with low <!--del_lnk--> unemployment and large government surpluses on the <!--del_lnk--> federal level. Today Canada closely resembles the U.S. in its market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and high living standards. While <!--del_lnk--> as of October 2006, Canada&#39;s national unemployment rate of 6.3% is among its lowest in 30 years, provincial unemployment rates vary from a low of 3.6% in Alberta to a high of 14.6% in Newfoundland and Labrador.<p>In the past century, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial and urban. As with other <!--del_lnk--> first world nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> service industry, which employs about three quarters of Canadians. However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the <!--del_lnk--> primary sector, with the <!--del_lnk--> logging and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> industries being two of Canada&#39;s most important.<p>Canada is one of the few developed nations that is a net exporter of energy. Canada has vast deposits of natural gas on the east coast and large oil and gas resources centred in Alberta, and also present in neighbouring British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The vast <!--del_lnk--> Athabasca Tar Sands give Canada the world&#39;s second largest reserves of oil behind <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. In Quebec, British Columbia, Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Ontario and Manitoba, <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power is a cheap and relatively environmentally friendly source of abundant energy.<p>Canada is one of the world&#39;s most important suppliers of agricultural products, with the Canadian Prairies one of the most important suppliers of wheat and other grains. Canada is the world&#39;s largest producer of zinc and uranium and a world leader in many other natural resources such as gold, nickel, aluminium, and lead; many, if not most, towns in the northern part of the country, where agriculture is difficult, exist because of a nearby mine or source of timber. Canada also has a sizeable manufacturing sector, centred in southern Ontario and Quebec, with the <!--del_lnk--> automobile industry especially important.<p>Canada is highly dependent on <!--del_lnk--> international trade, especially trade with the United States. The 1989 <!--del_lnk--> Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and 1994 <!--del_lnk--> North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which included Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic integration with the U.S. Since 2001, Canada has successfully avoided economic recession and has maintained the best overall economic performance in the G8. Since the mid 1990s, Canada&#39;s federal government has posted annual budgetary surpluses and has steadily paid down the national debt.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2001 national census recorded 30,007,094 people; the population is currently estimated by <!--del_lnk--> Statistics Canada to be 32.623 million people. Population growth is largely accomplished through <!--del_lnk--> immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth. About three-quarters of Canada&#39;s population live within 160 kilometres (100&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) of the U.S. border. A similar proportion live in <!--del_lnk--> urban areas concentrated in the <!--del_lnk--> Quebec City-Windsor Corridor (notably the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horseshoe, <a href="../../wp/m/Montreal.htm" title="Montreal">Montreal</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Ottawa <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan areas), the BC <!--del_lnk--> Lower Mainland (<a href="../../wp/v/Vancouver.htm" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and environs), and the <!--del_lnk--> Calgary-Edmonton Corridor in Alberta.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Canada is an ethnically diverse nation. According to the 2001 census, it has 34 ethnic groups with at least one hundred thousand members each. The largest ethnic group is &quot;Canadian&quot; (39.4%), followed by <!--del_lnk--> English (20.2%), <!--del_lnk--> French (15.8%), <!--del_lnk--> Scottish (14.0%), <!--del_lnk--> Irish (12.9%), <!--del_lnk--> German (9.3%), <!--del_lnk--> Italian (4.3%), <!--del_lnk--> Chinese (3.7%), <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian (3.6%) and <!--del_lnk--> First Nations (3.4%). Canada&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> aboriginal population is growing almost twice as fast as the rest of the Canadian population. In 2001, 13.4% of the population belonged to <!--del_lnk--> visible minorities. In comparison with most developed countries, Canada maintains a relatively high immigration rate. Immigrants are particularly attracted to the major urban areas of Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal.<p>Canadians adhere to a <!--del_lnk--> wide variety of religions, as people in Canada have the freedom of religion as one of their rights. According to 2001 census, 77.1% of Canadians identified as being <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a>; of this, <!--del_lnk--> Catholics make up the largest group (43.6% of Canadians). The largest <!--del_lnk--> Protestant denomination is the <!--del_lnk--> United Church of Canada; about 16.5% of Canadians declared no religious affiliation, and the remaining 6.3% were affiliated with religions other than Christianity, of which the largest is <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>.<p>In Canada, the provinces and territories are responsible for education; thus Canada has no national department of education. Each of the thirteen education systems are similar while reflecting their own regional history, culture and geography. The mandatory school age varies across Canada but generally ranges between the ages of 5-7 to 16-18, contributing to an adult literacy rate that is 99%. Postsecondary education is the responsibility of the provincial and territorial governments that provide most of their funding; the federal government provides additional funding through research grants. In 2002, 43% of Canadians aged between 25 and 64 had post-secondary education; for those aged 25 to 34 the postsecondary attainment reaches 51%.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h2>

      <p>Canada&#39;s two official languages, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, are the <!--del_lnk--> mother tongues of 59.7% and 23.2% of the population, respectively. On <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1969, under the <!--del_lnk--> Official Languages Act, French was made commensurate to English throughout the federal government. This started a process that led to Canada redefining itself as an officially &quot;<!--del_lnk--> bilingual&quot; nation.<p>English and French have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal institutions. The public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. While <!--del_lnk--> multiculturalism is official policy, to become a citizen one must be able to speak either English or French, and 98.5% of Canadians speak at least one (English only: 67.5%, French only: 13.3%, both: 17.7%).<p>French is mostly spoken in Quebec, but there are substantial francophone populations elsewhere, mainly in the northern parts of New Brunswick, eastern, northern and southwestern Ontario, and southern Manitoba. Of those who speak French as a first language, 85% live in Quebec. Ontario has the largest French population outside Quebec. French is the official language of Quebec; New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province in the country. No provinces other than Quebec and New Brunswick have constitutionally official language(s) as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and other government services in all of the majority English or <!--del_lnk--> Inuktitut speaking provinces and territories. In Ontario, French has some legal status but is not fully co-official. Several aboriginal languages have official status in Northwest Territories. <!--del_lnk--> Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and one of three official languages in the territory.<p>Non-official languages are important in Canada, with 5,202,245 people listing one as a first language. Some significant non-official first languages include <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> (853,745 first-language speakers), <!--del_lnk--> Italian (469,485), <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> (438,080), and <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi (271,220).<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Canadian culture has historically been heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> English, <!--del_lnk--> French, <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_people.htm" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Scottish and <!--del_lnk--> Aboriginal cultures and traditions, and over time has been greatly influenced by <!--del_lnk--> American culture because of its proximity and the interchange of <!--del_lnk--> human capital between the two countries. Many forms of American media and entertainment are popular, if not dominant in Canada; conversely, many Canadian cultural products and entertainers are successful in the US and worldwide. Many cultural products are now marketed toward a unified &quot;North American&quot; market, or a global market generally.<p>The creation and preservation of distinctly Canadian culture has been partly influenced by federal government programs, laws and institutions such as the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the <!--del_lnk--> National Film Board of Canada (NFB), and the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>As Canada is a geographically vast and ethnically diverse country, there are cultural variations and distinctions from province to province and region to region. Canadian culture has also been greatly influenced by more recent immigration of people from all over the world. Many Canadians value <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>, indeed some see Canadian culture as being inherently multicultural. Multicultural heritage is enshrined in <!--del_lnk--> Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<p><!--del_lnk--> National symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and <!--del_lnk--> First Nations sources. Particularly, the use of the <!--del_lnk--> maple leaf, as a Canadian symbol, dates back to the early 18th century and is depicted on its <!--del_lnk--> current and <!--del_lnk--> previous flags, the <!--del_lnk--> penny, and on the <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms. Other prominent symbols include the <a href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver">beaver</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Canada goose, <!--del_lnk--> common loon, <!--del_lnk--> the Crown, and the <!--del_lnk--> RCMP.<p>Canada&#39;s official national sports are <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> (winter) and <!--del_lnk--> lacrosse (summer). Hockey is a <!--del_lnk--> national pastime, and is by far the most popular spectator sport in the country. It is also the most popular sport Canadians play, with 1.65 million active participants in 2004. Canada&#39;s six largest metropolitan areas - Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, and Edmonton - have franchises in the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL), and there are more Canadian players in the league than from all other countries combined. After hockey, other popular spectator sports include <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_football.htm" title="Canadian football">Canadian football</a> and <!--del_lnk--> curling. The <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Football League (CFL) is the nation&#39;s second most popular professional sports league, and plays a large role in Canada&#39;s national identity. <!--del_lnk--> Golf, <a href="../../wp/b/Baseball.htm" title="Baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Skiing.htm" title="Skiing">skiing</a>, <!--del_lnk--> soccer, <a href="../../wp/v/Volleyball.htm" title="Volleyball">volleyball</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Basketball.htm" title="Basketball">basketball</a> are also widely played at youth and amateur levels, but professional leagues and franchises are not as widespread.
