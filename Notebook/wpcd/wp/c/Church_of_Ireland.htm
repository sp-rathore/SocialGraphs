The Church of Ireland, in its cathedrals and churches and property, retains much of the island&#39;s heritage of the medieval occupation. The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> was and is the church of the vast majority of the populace; nevertheless, the Church of Ireland was imposed as the state church until <!--del_lnk--> 1869 when it was <!--del_lnk--> disestablished.<p>

      <p>The Church of Ireland traces its origins back to the missions of <!--del_lnk--> Saint Patrick.<p>A monastically-centred institution, the early Celtic Church of Ireland had a unique calendar and usages, but was a full part of the wider Western Church, remaining in communion with Rome. In 1166, basing his action on the disputed Papal Bull <i><!--del_lnk--> Laudabiliter</i>, which is claimed to have given him lordship over Ireland, the french-born <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry II of England</a> came to Ireland and in 1171 made himself &quot;Overlord&quot; of Ireland.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1536 <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a> had the Irish Parliament declare him head of the Irish Church. When the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> travelled in a more <!--del_lnk--> Protestant direction under <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VI_of_England.htm" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI</a> so too did the Church of Ireland. All but two of the Irish bishops accepted the <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan Settlement and there is therefore continuity and <!--del_lnk--> Apostolic succession in the Church of Ireland, separate from that of the Church of England and the doubts raised by the consecration of <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Parker as Archbishop of Canterbury.<p>The established church in Ireland underwent a period of more radical <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist doctrine than occurred in England. <!--del_lnk--> James Ussher (later <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Armagh) authored the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Articles, adopted in <!--del_lnk--> 1615. In <!--del_lnk--> 1634 the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Convocation adopted the English <!--del_lnk--> Thirty-Nine Articles alongside the Irish Articles. After the Restoration of 1660, it seems that the Thirty-Nine Articles took precedence, and remain the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after <!--del_lnk--> disestablishment.<p>The reformed Church of Ireland undertook the first publication of Scripture in Irish. The first Irish translation of the New Testament was begun by <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Ossory, who worked on it until his untimely death in 1585. The work was continued by John Kearny, his assistant, and Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Nehemiah Donellan, Archbishop of Tuam, and it was finally completed by <!--del_lnk--> William O&#39;Domhnuill (William Daniell, Archbishop of Tuam in succession to Donellan). Their work was printed in 1602. The work of translating the Old Testament was undertaken by William Bedel (1571-1642), Bishop of <!--del_lnk--> Kilmore, who completed his translation within the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Charles the First, however it was not published until <!--del_lnk--> 1680, in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh (1638-1713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell had undertaken a translation of the <a href="../../wp/b/Book_of_Common_Prayer.htm" title="Book of Common Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was effected by John Richardson (1664 - 1747) and published in 1712.<p>However, the delay in providing scripture and liturgy in the vernacular of the majority of the population, caused a rift between the English-speaking minority who mostly adhered to the reformed church or to presbyterianism and the Irish-speaking majority who remained faithful to the Latin liturgy of <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism which thus remained the majority denomination in Ireland.<p>As before the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, some clergymen of the Church of Ireland sat as <!--del_lnk--> Lords Spiritual in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish House of Lords; under the provisions of the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union 1800, one archbishop and the three bishops chosen by rotation would be Lords Spiritual in the newly united <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in Westminster, joining the two archbishops (<a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and <!--del_lnk--> York) and the twenty-four bishops from the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>.<p>In 1833 the British Government proposed the <i>Irish Church Measure</i> to reduce the 22 archbishops and bishops who oversaw the Anglican minority in Ireland to a total of 12 by amalgamating sees and to use the revenues saved for the use of parishes. This sparked the <!--del_lnk--> Tractarian movement and wider repercussions in the Anglican communion.<p>Though the religion of a minority of Irish people at the time, it remained the official, &quot;established&quot; religion of Ireland, until its <!--del_lnk--> disestablishment by an <!--del_lnk--> 1869 Act of Parliament, which came into effect in <!--del_lnk--> 1871.<p>Up to this, it had been funded by <!--del_lnk--> tithes. Tithes were <!--del_lnk--> tax-like payments paid in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> by members of other faiths as well as its own adherents to maintain and fund the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican <strong class="selflink">Church of Ireland</strong>, to which only a small minority of the population belonged. The collection of tithes was violently resisted by the Catholic majority in the period 1831-36, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Tithe War. With the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, tithes were abolished. To deal with its new situation, it made provision in <!--del_lnk--> 1870 for its own government (General Synod) and financial management (Representative Church Body).<p>The representation of the Church of Ireland in the House of Lords also ceased.<p>Like other Irish churches, it did not divide when Ireland was <!--del_lnk--> partitioned in <!--del_lnk--> 1920, and continues to be governed on an all-island basis, with twelve dioceses organized as two provinces (<!--del_lnk--> Armagh and <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>).<p><a id="Church_today" name="Church_today"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Church today</span></h2>

      <p>The contemporary Church of Ireland, despite having a number of <!--del_lnk--> High Church (often described as <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Catholic) parishes, is generally on the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant end of the spectrum of world <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. Historically, it had little of the difference in churchmanship between parishes characteristic of other Anglican Provinces, although a number of markedly liberal, High Church or <!--del_lnk--> evangelical parishes have developed in recent decades. It was the second province of the Anglican Communion after the <!--del_lnk--> Anglican Church of New Zealand (<!--del_lnk--> 1857) to adopt, on its <!--del_lnk--> 1871 disestablishment, <!--del_lnk--> synodical government, and was one of the first provinces to ordain women to the priesthood, in <!--del_lnk--> 1991.<p>The church is structured on a model inherited from pre-<!--del_lnk--> Reformation times. The <!--del_lnk--> Primate of All Ireland is the <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland), whose seat is the medieval <!--del_lnk--> Saint Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, Armagh.<p>The Church is organised on diocesan or bishopric lines. The <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Dublin, like his Catholic counterpart, is called the <!--del_lnk--> Primate of Ireland.<p>Canon law and church policy are decided by its <!--del_lnk--> General Synod, and changes in policy must be passed by both the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives (Clergy and Laity). Important changes, e.g. the decision to ordain female priests, must be passed by two-thirds majorities. While the House of Representatives always votes publicly, often by orders, the House of Bishops has tended to vote in private, coming to a decision before matters reach the floor of the Synod. This practice has been broken only once, when in <!--del_lnk--> 1999 the House of Bishops voted unanimously in public to <!--del_lnk--> endorse the efforts of the Archbishop of Armagh, the Diocese of Armagh and the Standing Committee of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland in their attempts to resolve the crisis at the Church of the Ascension at <!--del_lnk--> Drumcree, near <!--del_lnk--> Portadown.<p>The current Archbishop of Armagh is Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Robin Eames, who is due to retire at the end of 2006. (He is also called Lord Eames, having been appointed to the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> as a <!--del_lnk--> life peer). The Archbishop of Dublin is Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> John Neill.<p>The Church of Ireland experienced major decline during the <!--del_lnk--> 20th Century, both in Northern Ireland, where 75% of its members live, and in the Republic of Ireland. However, recent censuses shown an unexpected increase in Church membership, the first in almost a century. This is largely explained by the great number of Anglican immigrants who moved to Ireland, particularly ex-colonists from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>; but some parishes, especially in middle-class areas of the larger cities, report some former <!--del_lnk--> Catholics joining. There are a number of clergy originally ordained for the Catholic Church who have now become Church of Ireland clergy.<p>The church has two cathedrals in Dublin: within the walls of the old city is <!--del_lnk--> Christ Church Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop, and just outside the old walls is <!--del_lnk--> St. Patrick&#39;s Cathedral, the church&#39;s National Cathedral of Ireland.<p><a id="Current_bishops" name="Current_bishops"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current bishops</span></h2>
