      <p>A minor <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> princess with a very remote <!--del_lnk--> Russian ancestry, and a first cousin of <!--del_lnk--> Gustav III of Sweden and of <!--del_lnk--> Charles XIII of Sweden, <b>Sophie Augusta Frederica</b> (Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst), nicknamed &quot;Figchen&quot;, was born in Stettin (now <!--del_lnk--> Szczecin, Poland) to Christian Augustus, Prince of <!--del_lnk--> Anhalt-Zerbst, who held the rank of a <!--del_lnk--> Prussian general in his capacity as Governor of the city in the name of the king of <!--del_lnk--> Prussia. In accordance with the custom then prevailing in German nobility, she received her education chiefly from a French governess and from tutors.<p>The choice of Sophie as wife of the prospective tsar &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Peter of Holstein-Gottorp &mdash; resulted from some amount of diplomatic management in which <!--del_lnk--> Count Lestocq and <a href="../../wp/f/Frederick_II_of_Prussia.htm" title="Frederick II of Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a> took an active part. Lestocq and Frederick wanted to strengthen the friendship between Prussia and Russia to weaken the influence of <a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> and to ruin the chancellor <!--del_lnk--> Bestuzhev, on whom <!--del_lnk--> Tsarina <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth relied, and who acted as a known partisan of Russo&ndash;Austrian co-operation.<p>The diplomatic intrigue failed, largely through the intervention of Figchen&#39;s mother, <!--del_lnk--> Johanna Elizabeth of Holstein, a clever and ambitious woman. Historical accounts portray Catherine&#39;s mother as emotionally cold and physically abusive, as well as a social climber who loved gossip and court intrigues. Johanna aspired to become famous through her daughter becoming a future Empress of Russia, but her pushy, arrogant behaviour infuriated the Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country. But Elizabeth took a strong liking to the daughter, and the marriage finally took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1744. The Empress knew the family well because Princess Johanna&#39;s brother Karl had gone to Russia to marry Elizabeth years earlier, but had died of smallpox before the planned wedding took place.<p>Princess Sophie spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with the Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people. She applied herself to learning the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian language</a> with such zeal that she rose at night and walked about her bedroom barefoot repeating her lessons. This resulted in a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. When she wrote her <!--del_lnk--> memoirs she represented herself as having made up her mind when she came to Russia to do whatever had to be done, and to profess to believe whatever required of her, in order to become qualified to wear the crown. The consistency of her character throughout life makes it highly probable that even at the age of fifteen she possessed sufficient maturity to adopt this worldly-wise line of conduct.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Her father, a very devout <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran, strongly opposed his daughter&#39;s conversion. Despite his instructions, on <!--del_lnk--> 28 June 1744 the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church received her as a member with the name Catherine Alexeyevna (<i>Yekaterina</i> or <i>Ekaterina</i>). On the following day the formal betrothal took place, and Catherine married the Grand Duke Peter on <!--del_lnk--> 21 August <!--del_lnk--> 1745 at <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="Saint Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. The newlyweds settled in the palace of <!--del_lnk--> Oranienbaum, which would remain the residence of the &quot;young court&quot; for 16 years.<p><a id="Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat" name="Coup_d.27.C3.A9tat"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Coup d&#39;&eacute;tat</span></h2>
      <p>The marriage proved unsuccessful &mdash; due to the Grand Duke Peter&#39;s impotence and mental immaturity he may not have consummated it for twelve years. While Peter took a mistress (Elizabeth Vorontsova), Catherine carried on liaisons with <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Saltykov and <!--del_lnk--> Stanislaw Poniatowski. She became friends with <!--del_lnk--> Ekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova, the sister of her husband&#39;s mistress, who introduced Catherine to several powerful political groups that opposed her husband. Catherine read widely and kept up-to-date on current events in Russia and in the rest of Europe. She corresponded with many of the prominent minds of her era, including <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Diderot.<p>After the death of the Empress Elizabeth on <!--del_lnk--> January 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1762 (<!--del_lnk--> N.S.) or <!--del_lnk--> 25 December <!--del_lnk--> 1761 (<!--del_lnk--> O.S.), Peter succeeded to the throne as <!--del_lnk--> Peter III of Russia and moved into the new <!--del_lnk--> Winter Palace in <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Petersburg.htm" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>; Catherine thus became Empress Consort of Russia. However, his eccentricities and policies, including a great admiration for the Prussian king Frederick II, whose capital the Russian army had briefly occupied (1760) in the course of the <!--del_lnk--> Seven Years&#39; War (1756&ndash;1763), alienated the same groups that Catherine had cultivated. Compounding matters, he insisted upon Russian intervention in a dispute between <!--del_lnk--> Holstein and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> over the province of <!--del_lnk--> Schleswig. Peter&#39;s insistence on supporting his native <!--del_lnk--> Holstein in an unpopular war eroded much of the support he had in the nobility.<p>In July 1762 Catherine&#39;s husband committed the grave error of retiring with his <!--del_lnk--> Holstein-born courtiers and relatives to Oranienbaum, leaving his wife at Saint Petersburg. In the course of <!--del_lnk--> July 13 and <!--del_lnk--> July 14, the revolt of the <!--del_lnk--> Leib Guard removed Peter from the throne and proclaimed Catherine as reigning empress. The bloodless coup succeeded; <!--del_lnk--> Ekaterina Dashkova, a confidante of Catherine, remarked that Peter seemed rather glad to have rid himself of the throne, and requested only a quiet estate and a ready supply of tobacco and burgundy in which to rest his sorrows.<p>Six months after his ascension to the throne and three days after his deposition, on <!--del_lnk--> July 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1762, Peter III died at <!--del_lnk--> Ropsha at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Alexei Orlov (younger brother to <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Orlov, then court favorite and a participant in the <!--del_lnk--> coup) in a supposedly accidental killing, the result of Alexei&#39;s over-indulgence in <!--del_lnk--> vodka. During the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet period, historians assumed that Catherine had ordered the murder, as she also disposed of other potential claimants to the throne (<!--del_lnk--> Ivan VI and <!--del_lnk--> Princess Tarakanova) at about the same time. But today it is agreed by almost all historians that Catherine was probably not involved in the killing.<p>Catherine, although not descended from any previous Russian emperor, succeeded her husband and became reigning empress, following an earlier precedent when <!--del_lnk--> Catherine I succeeded <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_I_of_Russia.htm" title="Peter I of Russia">Peter I</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1725. Her ascension <!--del_lnk--> manifesto justified her succession by citing the &quot;unanimous election&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> nation. However a great part of nobility regarded her reign as a <!--del_lnk--> usurpation, tolerable only during the minority of her son <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duke Paul. In the 1770s and 1780s a group of nobles connected with Paul (<!--del_lnk--> Nikita Panin and others) admitted the possibility of a new coup that would depose Catherine and transfer the crown to Paul, whose power they envisaged restricting in a kind of <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. These plans however never came to effect, and Catherine reigned until her death.<p><a id="Foreign_affairs" name="Foreign_affairs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign affairs</span></h2>

      <p>During her reign Catherine extended the borders of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire southward and westward to absorb <!--del_lnk--> New Russia, <!--del_lnk--> Crimea, <!--del_lnk--> Right-Bank Ukraine, <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Courland at the expense of two powers &mdash; the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. All told, she added some 200,000 miles&sup2; (518,000 km&sup2;) to Russian territory, and she further shaped the Russian destiny to a greater extent than almost anyone before or since, with the possible exceptions of <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Stalin, and <!--del_lnk--> Peter the Great.<p>Catherine&#39;s foreign minister, <!--del_lnk--> Nikita Panin, exercised considerable influence from the beginning of her reign. Though a shrewd statesman, Panin dedicated much effort and millions of <!--del_lnk--> rubles to setting up a &quot;Northern Accord&quot; between Russia, Prussia, Poland, and Sweden, to counter the power of the <!--del_lnk--> Bourbon&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> Habsburg League. When it became apparent that his plan could not succeed, Panin fell out of favour and Catherine dismissed him in <!--del_lnk--> 1781.<p><a id="Russo.E2.80.93Turkish_Wars" name="Russo.E2.80.93Turkish_Wars"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Russo&ndash;Turkish Wars</span></h3>
      <p>Catherine made Russia the dominant power in south-eastern <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> after her <!--del_lnk--> first Russo&ndash;Turkish War against the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1768&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1774), which saw some of the greatest defeats in Turkish history, including the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Chesma (1770) and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Kagul (1770). The Russian victories allowed Catherine&#39;s government to obtain access to the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> and to incorporate the vast <!--del_lnk--> steppes of present-day southern <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, where the Russians founded the new cities of <!--del_lnk--> Odessa, <!--del_lnk--> Nikolayev, Yekaterinoslav (literally: &quot;the Glory of Catherine&quot;; the future <!--del_lnk--> Dnepropetrovsk), and <!--del_lnk--> Kherson.<p>Catherine annexed <!--del_lnk--> Crimea in <!--del_lnk--> 1783, a mere nine years after it had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire as a result of her first war against the Turks. The Ottomans started a <!--del_lnk--> second Russo-Turkish War (1787&ndash;1792) during Catherine&#39;s reign. This war proved catastrophic for them and ended with the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Jassy (1792), which legitimized the Russian claim to Crimea.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the European political theatre, Catherine remained ever conscious of her legacy and longed for recognition as an enlightened sovereign. She pioneered for Russia the role that England would later play with aplomb throughout most of the nineteenth and early twentieth century &mdash; that of international <!--del_lnk--> mediator in disputes that could, or did, lead to war. Accordingly, she acted as mediator in the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Bavarian Succession (<!--del_lnk--> 1778&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1779) between Prussia and Austria. In <!--del_lnk--> 1780 she set up a group designed to defend neutral shipping against <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution, and she refused to intervene in that revolution on the side of the British when asked.<p>From 1788 to 1790, Russia fought the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Swedish War against Sweden, instigated by Catherine&#39;s cousin, the King <!--del_lnk--> Gustav III of Sweden. Expecting to simply overtake the Russian armies still engaged in war against the Ottoman Turks and hoping to strike Saint Petersburg directly, the Swedes ultimately faced mounting human and territorial losses when opposed by Russia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Baltic Fleet. After <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> declared war on Sweden in <!--del_lnk--> 1789, things looked bleak for the Swedes. After the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Svensksund in 1790, the parties signed the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of V&auml;r&auml;l&auml; (<!--del_lnk--> August 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1790) returning all conquered territories to their respective nations, and peace ensued for twenty years.<p><a id="Partitions_of_Poland" name="Partitions_of_Poland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Partitions of Poland</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1763 Catherine placed <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Poniatowski, her former lover, on the <!--del_lnk--> Polish throne. Although the idea came from the Prussian king, Catherine took a leading role in the <!--del_lnk--> partitions of Poland in the <!--del_lnk--> 1790s, afraid that the <!--del_lnk--> May Constitution of Poland (1791) might lead to a resurgence in the power of the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> and that the growing democratic movements inside the commonwealth might become a threat to the European monarchies.<p>After the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789, Catherine rejected many of the principles of the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> which she once viewed favorably. In order to stop the reforms of the May Constitution and to prevent the modernization of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, she provided support to a Polish anti-reform group known as the <!--del_lnk--> Targowica Confederation. After defeating Polish loyalist forces in the Polish <!--del_lnk--> War in Defense of the Constitution (1792) and in the <!--del_lnk--> Kosciuszko Uprising (1794), Russia completed the <!--del_lnk--> partitioning of Poland, dividing all of the Commonwealth territory with Prussia and Austria (1795).<p><a id="Arts_and_culture" name="Arts_and_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Arts and culture</span></h2>
      <p>Catherine did subscribe to the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and considered herself a &quot;philosopher on the throne&quot;. She showed great awareness of her image abroad, and ever desired that Europe should perceive her as a civilized and enlightened monarch, despite the fact that in Russia she often played the part of the <!--del_lnk--> tyrant. Even as she proclaimed her love for the ideals of liberty and freedom, she did more to tie the <!--del_lnk--> Russian serf to his land and to his lord than any sovereign since <!--del_lnk--> Boris Godunov.<p>Catherine had a reputation as a patron of the arts, literature and education. The <!--del_lnk--> Hermitage Museum, which now occupies the whole of the <!--del_lnk--> Winter Palace, began as Catherine&#39;s personal collection. At the instigation of her factotum, <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Betskoi, she wrote a manual for the education of young children, drawing from the ideas of <a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>, and founded the famous <!--del_lnk--> Smolny Institute for noble young ladies. This school would become one of the best of its kind in Europe, and even went so far as to admit young girls born to wealthy merchants alongside the daughters of the nobility. She wrote comedies, fiction and memoirs, while cultivating <a href="../../wp/v/Voltaire.htm" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Diderot and <!--del_lnk--> D&#39;Alembert &mdash; all French <!--del_lnk--> encyclopedists who later cemented her reputation in their writings. The leading economists of her day, such as <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Young and <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Necker, became foreign members of the <!--del_lnk--> Free Economic Society, established on her suggestion in Saint Petersburg. She lured the scientists <a href="../../wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm" title="Leonhard Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Peter Simon Pallas from Berlin to the Russian capital.<p>As much subtle as forceful, Catherine enlisted to her cause one of the great minds of the age, Voltaire, with whom she corresponded for fifteen years, from her accession to his death in 1778. He lauded her with epithets, calling her &quot;The Star of the North&quot; and the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Semiramis of Russia&quot; (in reference to the legendary Queen of Babylon). Though she never met him face-to-face, she mourned him bitterly when he died, acquired his collection of books from his heirs, and placed them in the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Public Library.<p>Within a few months of her accession, having heard that the French government threatened to stop the publication of the famous French <i><!--del_lnk--> Encyclop&eacute;die</i> on account of its irreligious spirit, she proposed to <!--del_lnk--> Diderot that he should complete his great work in Russia under her protection. Four years later she endeavoured to embody in a legislative form the principles of Enlightenment which she had imbibed from the study of the French philosophers. She called together at Moscow a Grand Commission &mdash; almost a consultative <!--del_lnk--> parliament &mdash; composed of 652 members of all classes (officials, nobles, burghers and peasants) and of various nationalities. The Commission had to consider the needs of the Russian Empire and the means of satisfying them. The Empress herself prepared the <!--del_lnk--> Instructions for the Guidance of the Assembly, pillaging (as she frankly admitted) the philosophers of the West, especially <!--del_lnk--> Montesquieu and <!--del_lnk--> Cesare Beccaria. As many of the democratic principles frightened her more moderate and experienced advisers, she wisely refrained from immediately putting them into execution. After holding more than 200 sittings the so-called Commission dissolved without getting beyond the realm of theory.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Catherine&#39;s patronage furthered the evolution of the arts in Russia more than that of any Russian sovereign before or after her. Under her reign, Russians imported and studied the classical and European influences which inspired the &quot;Age of Imitation&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> Gavrila Derzhavin, <!--del_lnk--> Denis Fonvizin and <!--del_lnk--> Ippolit Bogdanovich laid the groundwork for the great writers of the nineteenth century, especially for <a href="../../wp/a/Aleksandr_Pushkin.htm" title="Aleksandr Pushkin">Pushkin</a>. Catherine became a great patron of <!--del_lnk--> Russian opera (see <!--del_lnk--> Catherine II and opera for details). However, her reign also featured omnipresent censorship and state control of publications. When <!--del_lnk--> Radishchev published his <i><!--del_lnk--> Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</i> in 1790, warning of uprisings because of the deplorable social conditions of the peasants held as serfs, Catherine exiled him to <!--del_lnk--> Siberia.<p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p>Catherine, throughout her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions for as long as they held her interest, and then pensioning them off with large estates and gifts of serfs. After her affair with <!--del_lnk--> Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin, he selected a candidate who had both the physical beauty as well as the mental faculties to hold Catherine&#39;s interest (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Dmitriev-Mamonov). Some of these men loved her in return: she had a reputation as a beauty by the standards of the day, and always showed generosity towards her lovers, even after the end of an affair. The last of her lovers, <!--del_lnk--> Prince Zubov, 40 years her junior, proved the most capricious and extravagant of them all.<p>Catherine behaved harshly to her son <!--del_lnk--> Paul. In her memoirs, Catherine indicated that her first lover, <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Saltykov, had fathered Paul; but Paul physically resembled her husband, Peter. (Her illegitimate son by Grigori <!--del_lnk--> Orlov, <!--del_lnk--> Alexis Bobrinskoy {later created Count Bobrinskoy by Paul}, she sequestered from the court.) It seems highly probable that she intended to exclude Paul from the succession, and to leave the crown to her eldest grandson Alexander, afterwards the emperor <!--del_lnk--> Alexander I. Her harshness to Paul stemmed probably as much from political distrust as from what she saw of his character. Whatever Catherine&#39;s other activities, she emphatically functioned as a sovereign and as a politician, guided in the last resort by interests of state. Keeping Paul in a state of semi-captivity in <!--del_lnk--> Gatchina and <!--del_lnk--> Pavlovsk, she resolved not to allow her son to dispute or to share in her authority.<div class="thumb tright">
