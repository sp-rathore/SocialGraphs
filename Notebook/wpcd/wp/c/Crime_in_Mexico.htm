      <p><b>Crime</b> is among the most urgent concerns facing <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, as is the case for many other <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries. Mexican <!--del_lnk--> drug trafficking rings play a major role in the flow of <!--del_lnk--> cocaine, <!--del_lnk--> heroin, and <!--del_lnk--> marijuana transiting between <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Drug trafficking has led to <!--del_lnk--> corruption, which has had a deleterious effect on Mexico&#39;s <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. Drug trafficking and <!--del_lnk--> organized crime have also been a major source of <!--del_lnk--> violent crime in Mexico.<p>Mexico has experienced increasingly high <!--del_lnk--> crime rates, especially in major urban centers. The country&#39;s great economic polarization has stimulated criminal activity in the lower <!--del_lnk--> socioeconomic strata, which includes the majority of the country&#39;s population. Crime continues at high levels, and is repeatedly marked by violence, especially in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tijuana.htm" title="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, <!--del_lnk--> Nuevo Laredo, and the state of <!--del_lnk--> Sinaloa. Other metropolitan areas have lower, yet still serious, levels of crime. Low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to the high crime rate.<p>The high incidence of crime in Mexico has also poured across the border and influenced crime in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, aggravating problems including <!--del_lnk--> drugs, <!--del_lnk--> illegal immigration, and <!--del_lnk--> gangs. To combat this increasing problem, cross-border cooperation has increased between <!--del_lnk--> law enforcement agencies in the United States and Mexico in recent years.<p>

      <p>Analysis of crime statistics in Mexico indicate that although the crime rate has declined over the last 100 years, there has been a significant upswing within the last two decades led by Mexico City.  Since many crimes go unreported, the rates may be much higher than reported by the government. <p><!--del_lnk--> Rape is rarely reported or punished, owing to old <!--del_lnk--> social norms, minor penalties for the crime, and <!--del_lnk--> criminal laws. In some rural areas, penalties for rape may consist of a few hours in jail, or minor fines. <p>Assault and theft make up the vast majority of crimes. While urban areas tend to have higher crimes rates, as is typical in most countries, the <!--del_lnk--> United States&ndash;Mexico border has also been a problem area. However, with increased awareness and resources, the crime rate along the border has declined faster than in the rest of the country. <p><a id="Drug_trafficking" name="Drug_trafficking"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Drug trafficking</span></h2>
      <p>The United States is a lucrative market for <!--del_lnk--> illegal drugs. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> estimates that nearly 90% of <!--del_lnk--> cocaine sold in the United States originates in <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> and is smuggled through Mexico.  Mexico is the largest foreign supplier of <!--del_lnk--> marijuana and the second largest source of <!--del_lnk--> heroin for the U.S. market. The majority of methamphetamines sold in the United States are made in Mexico, and Mexican-run <!--del_lnk--> methamphetamine labs that operate north of the border account for much of the remainder.<p><a id="Drug_cartels" name="Drug_cartels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Drug cartels</span></h3>
      <p>Mexican drug cartels play a major role in the flow of <!--del_lnk--> cocaine, <!--del_lnk--> heroin, and <!--del_lnk--> marijuana transiting between <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. These drug cartels often use Mexican-American gangs to distribute their narcotics.<p>Mexican drug cartels also have ties to Colombian drug traffickers, and other international organized crime. A sharp spike in drug-related violence has some analysts worrying about the &#39;Colombianization&#39; of Mexico. <div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Some illegal drugs are also produced in Mexico, including significant amounts of <!--del_lnk--> opium poppy, and marijuana in the western <!--del_lnk--> Sierra Madre Mountains region. <p><a id="Domestic_consumption_of_illegal_drugs" name="Domestic_consumption_of_illegal_drugs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Domestic consumption of illegal drugs</span></h3>
      <p>Marijuana, crack cocaine, <!--del_lnk--> methamphetamines, and other drugs are increasingly consumed in Mexico, especially by youths in urban areas and northern parts of the country. <p><a id="Corruption" name="Corruption"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Corruption</span></h2>
      <p>High levels of corruption in the police, judiciary, and government in general have contributed greatly to the crime problem. Corruption is a significant obstacle to Mexico&#39;s achieving a stable democracy. <p><a id="Corruption_in_the_police_force" name="Corruption_in_the_police_force"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corruption in the police force</span></h3>
      <p>The organization of police forces in Mexico is complex; each police force has a different level of jurisdiction and authority, and those levels often overlap. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Procuradur&iacute;a General de la Rep&uacute;blica</i> (Federal Attorney General&#39;s office) along with the law enforcement agencies <i><!--del_lnk--> Policia Federal Preventiva</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Agencia Federal de Investigaci&oacute;n</i> , has responsibility for overseeing law enforcements across the entire country. In addition, there are several police organizations at the state, district, and city level. Since pay is generally poor (US$285-$400 per month), police officers are more likely to accept bribes to protect criminals or ignore crime entirely. <p>Corruption plagues the various levels of police, and is frequently difficult to track down and prosecute since police officers may be protected by district attorneys and other members of the judiciary. The problem is especially pronounced in northern border areas such as Tijuana, where police are engaged by drug traffickers to protect and enforce their illicit interests. <p><a id="Corruption_in_the_judiciary" name="Corruption_in_the_judiciary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corruption in the judiciary</span></h3>
      <p>A United Nations Special <!--del_lnk--> Rapporteur undertook a mission to Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> judiciary and administration of law was not independent.  During the course of his visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, because the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts. <p>Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the <!--del_lnk--> legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor <!--del_lnk--> trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre <!--del_lnk--> investigation of many crimes. <p><a id="Violent_crime_against_journalists" name="Violent_crime_against_journalists"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Violent crime against journalists</span></h2>
      <p>A significant trend of violent crime against journalists has appeared in the country in recent years. Although the problem has existed since at least 1970, 15 journalists have been murdered in Mexico since 2000 alone. Few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. One of the more prominent cases was that of syndicated columnist <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Arratia Saldierna, a prominent and well-known journalist who wrote a column called <i>Portavoz</i> (or &quot;Spokesman&quot;). The column featured topics such as corruption, organized crime, and drug trafficking. <p>Arratia&#39;s murder, which was particularly brutal, and others like it, have sparked demands from other journalists that President <!--del_lnk--> Vicente Fox do more to enforce security and bring those responsible for the murders to justice. In 2004, a group of 215 reporters and editors sent an urgent letter to President Fox and other federal authorities, demanding that they address these concerns. The letter represented a massive communication effort coming from professionals from 19 of the nation&#39;s 31 states. The key demand was that violent crimes against journalists be made federal crimes, so they would be investigated and prosecuted by federal officers and not by local officials whom the letter claims could be the same people who commit the crimes.<p>The effect of these crimes has been the voluntary self-censorship of many journalists, due to fears of retribution from criminals. The situation has earned attention from prominent global organziations such as the office of the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the <!--del_lnk--> Centre for Journalism and Public Ethics (CEPET). Amerigo Incalcaterra of the OHCHR advocated the protection of journalists and the preservation of freedom of speech, calling it &quot;essential for the consolidation of democracy and the rule of law in this country&quot;. <p><a id="Crime_in_Mexico_City" name="Crime_in_Mexico_City"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime in Mexico City</span></h2>
      <p><a href="../../wp/m/Mexico_City.htm" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a>&#39;s crime rate has begun rising again, after having previously peaked in the late 1990s. Mexico City&#39;s inner core has about 8 million people &mdash; about the same number as <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>. However, Mexico City&#39;s police force is only two-thirds the size of New York City&#39;s and is organized into several ill-co-ordinated forces. Policemen earn less than a quarter of their U.S. counterparts, so many officers turn to corruption to augment their pay. And even in the rare cases where criminals do get caught, the courts are often too corrupt and inefficient to punish them. <p><a id="Effects_on_tourism" name="Effects_on_tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Effects on tourism</span></h2>
      <p>A significant number of United States citizens visit Mexico; the U.S. State Department estimates it at 15 to 16 million per year.  Tourists visiting Mexico face a number of problems related to criminal activity, including:<ul>
       <li>Extortion by law enforcement and other officials.<li>Highway crime in which bandits prey on passenger vehicles and tour buses.<li>Kidnappings, particularly in northern border cities, Mexico City, and <!--del_lnk--> Chiapas. <li>Taxi robberies and armed robbery.<li>Purse-snatching and pickpocketing.</ul>
      <p>Due to crime reaching a critical level in Mexico City and many other areas, tourism to Mexico has suffered. <p><a id="Efforts_to_combat_crime_in_Mexico" name="Efforts_to_combat_crime_in_Mexico"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Efforts to combat crime in Mexico</span></h2>
      <p>President <!--del_lnk--> Vicente Fox took power in December 2000 promising to crack down on crime and improve a <!--del_lnk--> judicial system rife with corruption and ineptitude. Upon taking office, he established a new ministry of Security and Police, doubled the pay for police officers, and committed to other ethics reforms.  President Fox also cited <!--del_lnk--> drug trafficking and drug consumption as the top cross-border priority issue. <p>During the first three years of Fox&#39;s government, the official number of reported kidnappings showed a slight decrease, from 505 in 2001 to 438 in 2003. The new Federal Investigation Agency (<i>Procuraduria de Justicia</i>) reported dismantling 48 kidnapping rings and saving 419 victims. <p><a id="Cooperation_between_Mexico_and_the_United_States" name="Cooperation_between_Mexico_and_the_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cooperation between Mexico and the United States</span></h3>
      <p>In 1996, Mexico changed its policy to allow <!--del_lnk--> extradition of its citizens to the United States to face <!--del_lnk--> trial.  Previously, the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution had forbidden its citizens to be extradited.<p>In 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. State Department defended efforts by the two countries to reduce violence and drug trafficking on the border following decisions by governors in the <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">U.S. states</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Arizona and <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico to declare an emergency in their border counties. The two governors stated that the federal government&#39;s inability to control crime and violence related to illegal immigration had forced them to take matters into their own hands. The Mexican government criticized the emergency declarations. <p>The U.S. state of <!--del_lnk--> Texas and Mexican police officials held a conference in <!--del_lnk--> San Antonio to discuss ways of coordinating efforts to stop crime but there are questions about how successful the program will be. <p>Many Mexican police officials in border towns have been targets of assassination by drug cartels, who have even threatened local law enforcement in the United States. . Drug cartels have even acquired equipment like Mexican Army uniforms, <!--del_lnk--> Humvees, grenades and .50 calibre sniper rifles which can penetrate most light armour including armoured cars. The United States ambassador launched a formal complaint with the government on this issue.<p><a id="Rudolph_Giuliani_in_Mexico_City" name="Rudolph_Giuliani_in_Mexico_City"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rudolph Giuliani in Mexico City</span></h3>
      <p>In January 2003, the security consulting company of former <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph Giuliani was hired by business leaders to come up with a plan to clean up Mexico City, which has the second-highest crime rate in Latin America. <p><a id="Protest_march_against_crime" name="Protest_march_against_crime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Protest march against crime</span></h3>
      <p>In June 2004, at least a quarter of a million people marched through the capital and other cities to protest the failure of federal and local governments to control crime in one of the world&#39;s most crime-ridden countries. <p><a id="Federal_forces_at_the_border" name="Federal_forces_at_the_border"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Federal forces at the border</span></h3>
      <p>In June 2005, the government deployed federal forces to three <!--del_lnk--> states to contain surging violence linked to organized crime. At a news conference in Mexico City, presidential spokesman <!--del_lnk--> Rub&eacute;n Aguilar told reporters that the new deployment was the result of evidence that organized crime has penetrated some local police departments. <p><a id="Technology_in_Tijuana" name="Technology_in_Tijuana"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Technology in Tijuana</span></h3>

The technology includes surveillance equipment, handheld computers, and alarm systems. Since tourism is a staple of the economy in Tijuana, the mayor has tried to make reforms to highlight the safety of tourist areas.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Mexico&quot;</div>
