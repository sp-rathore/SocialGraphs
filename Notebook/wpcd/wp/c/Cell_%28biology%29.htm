      <p><!--del_lnk--> Prokaryotes are distinguished from eukaryotes on the basis of nuclear organization, specifically their lack of a nuclear membrane. Prokaryotes also lack most of the intracellular organelles and structures that are characteristic of eukaryotic cells (an important exception is the ribosomes, which are present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells). Most of the functions of organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and the Golgi apparatus, are taken over by the prokaryotic plasma membrane. Prokaryotic cells have three architectural regions: appendages called <!--del_lnk--> flagella and <!--del_lnk--> pili &mdash; proteins attached to the cell surface; a <!--del_lnk--> cell envelope consisting of a capsule, a <!--del_lnk--> cell wall, and a <!--del_lnk--> plasma membrane; and a <!--del_lnk--> cytoplasmic region that contains the <!--del_lnk--> cell genome (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. Other differences include:<ul>
       <li>The <i>plasma membrane</i> (a phospholipid bilayer) separates the interior of the cell from its environment and serves as a filter and communications beacon.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Most prokaryotes have a <i><!--del_lnk--> cell wall</i> (some exceptions are <i><!--del_lnk--> Mycoplasma</i> (a bacterium) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Thermoplasma</i> (an archaeon)). It consists of <i><!--del_lnk--> peptidoglycan</i> in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from &quot;exploding&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> cytolysis) from <!--del_lnk--> osmotic pressure against a <!--del_lnk--> hypotonic environment. A cell wall is also present in some eukaryotes like <!--del_lnk--> fungi, but has a different chemical composition.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>A prokaryotic chromosome is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, which causes <a href="../../wp/l/Lyme_disease.htm" title="Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a>). Even without a real <i>nucleus</i>, the DNA is condensed in a <i>nucleoid</i>. Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called <i><!--del_lnk--> plasmids</i>, which are usually circular. Plasmids can carry additional functions, such as antibiotic resistance.</ul>

      <p><a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">Eukaryotic</a> cells are about 10 times the size of a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is the presence of a <!--del_lnk--> cell nucleus, a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell&#39;s DNA. It is this nucleus that gives the eukaryote its name, which means &quot;true nucleus&quot;. Other differences include:<ul>
       <li>The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.<li>The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes, which are associated with <!--del_lnk--> histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the <i><!--del_lnk--> cell nucleus</i>, separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic <!--del_lnk--> organelles also contain some DNA.<li>Eukaryotes can move using <i>cilia</i> or <i>flagella</i>. The flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.</ul>

Inside the membrane, a <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salty</a> <!--del_lnk--> cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume.

There are also other kinds of <!--del_lnk--> biomolecules in cells. This article will list these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function.<p><a id="Cell_membrane:_A_cell.27s_defining_boundary" name="Cell_membrane:_A_cell.27s_defining_boundary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cell membrane: A cell&#39;s defining boundary</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>Main article:</i> <!--del_lnk--> Cell membrane</dl>
      <p>The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a <i>plasma membrane</i>. The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a <!--del_lnk--> cell wall. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a <!--del_lnk--> double layer of lipids (<!--del_lnk--> hydrophobic fat-like molecules) and <!--del_lnk--> hydrophilic <!--del_lnk--> phosphorous molecules. Hence, the layer is called a <!--del_lnk--> phospholipid bilayer. It may also be called a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">protein</a> molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be &#39;semi-permeable&#39;, in that it can either let a substance (<!--del_lnk--> molecule or <!--del_lnk--> ion) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain <!--del_lnk--> receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signalling molecules such as <!--del_lnk--> hormones.<p><a id="Cytoskeleton:_A_cell.27s_scaffold" name="Cytoskeleton:_A_cell.27s_scaffold"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cytoskeleton: A cell&#39;s scaffold</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>Main article:</i> <!--del_lnk--> Cytoskeleton</dl>
      <p>The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell&#39;s shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during <!--del_lnk--> endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and <!--del_lnk--> cytokinesis, the separation of daughter cells after <!--del_lnk--> cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. Eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of <!--del_lnk--> microfilaments, <!--del_lnk--> intermediate filaments and <!--del_lnk--> microtubules. There is a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell&#39;s structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments.<p><a id="Genetic_material" name="Genetic_material"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Genetic material</span></h3>
      <p>Two different kinds of genetic material exist: <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA) and <!--del_lnk--> ribonucleic acid (RNA). Most organisms use DNA for their long-term information storage, but <!--del_lnk--> some viruses (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> retroviruses) have RNA as their genetic material. The biological information contained in an organism is <a href="../../wp/g/Genetic_code.htm" title="Genetic code">encoded</a> in its DNA or RNA sequence. RNA is also used for information transport (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> mRNA) and <!--del_lnk--> enzymatic functions (e.g., <!--del_lnk--> ribosomal RNA) in organisms that use <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> for the genetic code itself.<p>Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial <!--del_lnk--> chromosome) in the <!--del_lnk--> nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called <!--del_lnk--> chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like <!--del_lnk--> mitochondria and <!--del_lnk--> chloroplasts (see <!--del_lnk--> endosymbiotic theory).<p>A human cell has genetic material in the nucleus (the <!--del_lnk--> nuclear genome) and in the mitochondria (the <!--del_lnk--> mitochondrial genome). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule separate from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial genome is very small, it codes for some important proteins.<p>Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called <!--del_lnk--> transfection. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> genome, or stable, if it is.<p><a id="Organelles" name="Organelles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Organelles</span></h3>

Cell metabolism is the process by which individual <strong class="selflink">cells</strong> process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: <!--del_lnk--> catabolism, in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and <!--del_lnk--> anabolism, wherein the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions. Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically-complex sugar molecule called <!--del_lnk--> glucose. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate (<a href="../../wp/a/Adenosine_triphosphate.htm" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a>), a form of energy, via two different pathways.<p>The first pathway, <!--del_lnk--> glycolysis, requires no oxygen and is referred to as <!--del_lnk--> anaerobic metabolism. Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy. The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or <!--del_lnk--> citric acid cycle, occurs inside the mitochondria and is capable of generating enough ATP to run all the cell functions.<div class="thumb tright">

         <p>Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from <!--del_lnk--> amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: <!--del_lnk--> transcription and <!--del_lnk--> translation.<p>Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complimentary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give <!--del_lnk--> messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called <!--del_lnk--> ribosomes located in the <!--del_lnk--> cytosol, where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to <!--del_lnk--> transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional 3D protein molecule.<a id="Origins_of_cells" name="Origins_of_cells"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of cells</span></h2>

         <p>The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, and was one of the most important steps in evolution of life as we know it. The birth of the cell marked the passage from prebiotic chemistry to biological life.<a id="Origin_of_the_first_cell" name="Origin_of_the_first_cell"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of the first cell</span></h3>
         <p>If life is viewed from the point of view of <!--del_lnk--> replicators, that is <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> molecules in the organism, cells satisfy two fundamental conditions: protection from the outside environment and confinement of biochemical activity. The former condition is needed to maintain the fragile <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> chains stable in a varying and sometimes aggressive environment, and may have been the main reason for which cells evolved. The latter is fundamental for the evolution of <!--del_lnk--> biological complexity. If freely-floating DNA molecules that code for <!--del_lnk--> enzymes are not enclosed into cells, the enzymes that benefit a given DNA molecule (for example, by producing nucleotides) will automatically benefit the neighbouring DNA molecules. This might be viewed as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> parasitism by default.&quot; Therefore the <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">selection pressure</a> on DNA molecules will be much lower, since there is not a definitive advantage for the &quot;lucky&quot; DNA molecule that produces the better enzyme over the others: All molecules in a given neighbourhood are almost equally advantaged.<p>If all the DNA molecule is enclosed in a cell, then the enzymes coded from the molecule will be kept close to the DNA molecule itself. The DNA molecule will directly enjoy the benefits of the enzymes it codes, and not of others. This means other DNA molecules won&#39;t benefit from a positive mutation in a neighbouring molecule: this in turn means that positive mutations give immediate and selective advantage to the replicator bearing it, and not on others. This is thought to have been the one of the main driving force of evolution of life as we know it. (Note. This is more a metaphor given for simplicity than complete accuracy since the earliest molecules of life, probably up to the stage of cellular life, were most likely <!--del_lnk--> RNA molecules that acted as both replicators and enzymes: see <!--del_lnk--> RNA world hypothesis. However, the core of the reasoning is the same.)<p>Biochemically, cell-like spheroids formed by <!--del_lnk--> proteinoids are observed by heating <!--del_lnk--> amino acids with <!--del_lnk--> phosphoric acid as a catalyst. They bear much of the basic features provided by <!--del_lnk--> cell membranes. Proteinoid-based protocells enclosing RNA molecules could (but not necessarily should) have been the first cellular life forms on Earth.<p>Another theory holds that the turbulent shores of the ancient coastal waters may have served as a mammoth laboratory, aiding in the countless experiments necessary to bring about the first cell. Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive things to shore, much like driftwood collecting on the beach. It is possible that organic molecules were concentrated on the shorelines in much the same way. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through <!--del_lnk--> evaporation. While bubbles comprised of mostly water tend to burst quickly, oily bubbles happen to be much more stable, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments. The <!--del_lnk--> Phospholipid is a good example of a common oily compound prevalent in the prebiotic seas. Phospholipids can be constructed in one&#39;s mind as a <!--del_lnk--> hydrophilic head on one end, and a <!--del_lnk--> hydrophobic tail on the other. Phospholipids also possess an important characteristic, that is being able to link together to form a <!--del_lnk--> bilayer membrane. A lipid monolayer bubble can only contain oil, and is therefore not conducive to harbouring water-soluble organic molecules. On the other hand, a lipid bilayer bubble <!--del_lnk-->  can contain water, and was a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane. If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage, and was placed at the top of the <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_selection.htm" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> waiting list. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the &#39;right stuff&#39; was released into the medium, the development of the first <!--del_lnk--> prokaryotes, <!--del_lnk--> eukaryotes, and multi-cellular organisms could be achieved. This theory is expanded upon in the book, <i>The Cell: Evolution of the First Organism</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Panno Ph.D.<a id="Origin_of_eukaryotic_cells" name="Origin_of_eukaryotic_cells"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of eukaryotic cells</span></h3>
