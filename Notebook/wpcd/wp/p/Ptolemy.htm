      <p><i>Claudius</i> is a Roman name. Claudius Ptolemy was almost certainly a Roman citizen, and he or his ancestor adopted the <i><!--del_lnk--> nomen</i> of a Roman called Claudius, who was in some sense responsible for the citizenship. If, as was not uncommon, this Roman was the Emperor, the citizenship would have been granted between <!--del_lnk--> 14 and <!--del_lnk--> 68 CE. The astronomer would also have had a <i><!--del_lnk--> praenomen</i>, which we do not know.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Ptolemy</i> is a Greek name. It occurs once in Greek mythology, and is of Homeric form. It was quite common among the Macedonian upper class at the time of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, and there are several among Alexander&#39;s army, one of whom made himself King of Egypt; all the Kings after him, until Rome conquered Egypt, were also Ptolemies. Whether the astronomer&#39;s name represents royal blood, loyalty, or chance is also not known.<p>Ptolemy read, and wrote in, Greek; he used Babylonian data, probably in translation. He worked in <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, which was a primarily Greek and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> city on the edge of Egypt; there is relatively little evidence of native Egyptian inhabitants.<p><a id="Astronomy" name="Astronomy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Astronomy</span></h2>

      <p>In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Almagest</i>, one of the most influential books of <!--del_lnk--> classical antiquity, Ptolemy compiled and extended the astronomical knowledge and theories of the ancient Greek and <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian world; he relied mainly on the work of <!--del_lnk--> Hipparchus of three centuries earlier. It was preserved, like most of Classical Greek science, in <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> manuscripts (hence its familiar name) and only made available in Latin translation (by <!--del_lnk--> Gerard of Cremona) in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>. Ptolemy formulated a <!--del_lnk--> geocentric model that was widely accepted until it was superseded by the <!--del_lnk--> heliocentric <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Copernicus. Likewise his computational methods (supplemented in the 12th century with the Arabic computational <i><!--del_lnk--> Tables of Toledo</i>) were of sufficient accuracy to satisfy the needs of astronomers, astrologers and <!--del_lnk--> navigators, until the time of the great explorations. They were also adopted in the Arab world and in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. The <i>Almagest</i> also contains a <!--del_lnk--> star catalogue, which is probably an updated version of a catalogue created by Hipparchus. Its list of forty-eight <!--del_lnk--> constellations is ancestral to the modern system of constellations, but unlike the modern system they did not cover the whole sky (only the sky Ptolemy could see). The <i>Almagest</i> is also known as the <i>Great Syntaxis of Astronomy</i>.<p>Ptolemy&#39;s astronomy has been wideley criticized for its incorrect geocentric view. But according to Manly Hall, an expert on arcane wisdom traditions and occult mathematics and science, this was meant to describe man&#39;s spiritual nature, not the actual astronomical scheme of the universe, he wrote &quot;in ridiculing the geocentric system of astronomy expounded by Claudius Ptolemy, modern astronomers have overlooked the philosophic key to the Ptolemaic system. The universe of Ptolemy is a diagram of the relationships existing between the various divine and elemental parts of every creature, and is not concerned with astronomy as that science is now comprehended. In the above figure, special attention is called to the three circles of zodiacs surrounding the orbits of the planets. These zodiacs represent the threefold spiritual constitution of the universe. The orbits of the planets are the Governors of the World and the four elemental spheres in the centre represent the physical constitution of both man and the universe. Ptolemy&#39;s scheme of the universe is a cross section of the universal aura, the planets and elements to which he refers having no relation to those recognized by modern astronomers.&quot; (source:<!--del_lnk--> http://prs.org/gallery-classic.htm).<p>
       <br /> In the <i>Phaseis</i> (<i>Risings of the Fixed Stars</i>) Ptolemy gave a <i>parapegma</i>, a star <!--del_lnk--> calendar or <!--del_lnk--> almanac based on the appearances and disappearances of stars over the course of the solar year.<p><a id="Geographia" name="Geographia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geographia</span></h2>

      <p>Ptolemy&#39;s other main work is his <i>Geographia</i>. This too is a compilation of what was known about the world&#39;s <a href="../../wp/g/Geography.htm" title="Geography">geography</a> in the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> during his time. He relied mainly on the work of an earlier geographer, <!--del_lnk--> Marinos of Tyre, and on <!--del_lnk--> gazetteers of the Roman and ancient <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, but most of his sources beyond the perimeter of the Empire were unreliable.<p>The first part of the <i>Geographia</i> is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. Like with the model of the solar system in the <i>Almagest</i>, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned <!--del_lnk--> coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a <!--del_lnk--> grid that spanned the globe. <!--del_lnk--> Latitude was measured from the <!--del_lnk--> equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than <!--del_lnk--> degrees of arc (the length of the <!--del_lnk--> midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the <!--del_lnk--> polar circle). He put the <!--del_lnk--> meridian of 0 <!--del_lnk--> longitude at the most western land he knew, the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Ptolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (<i>oikoumen&egrave;</i>) and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the <i>Geographia</i> he provided the necessary <!--del_lnk--> topographic lists, and captions for the maps. His <i>oikoumen&egrave;</i> spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary islands in the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the middle of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and about 80 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the <!--del_lnk--> East Indies and deep into <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>; Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe, and he knew that his information did not extend to the Eastern Sea.<p>The maps in surviving manuscripts of Ptolemy&#39;s <i>Geographia</i>, however, date only from about 1300, after the text was rediscovered by <!--del_lnk--> Maximus Planudes. It seems likely that the topographical tables in books 2-7 are cumulative texts - texts which were altered and added to as new knowledge became available in the centuries after Ptolemy (Bagrow 1945). This means that information contained in different parts of the Geography is likely to be of different date.<p><!--del_lnk--> Maps based on scientific principles had been made since the time of <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes (<!--del_lnk--> 3rd century BC), but Ptolemy improved <a href="../../wp/m/Map_projection.htm" title="Map projection">projections</a>. It is known that a world map based on the <i>Geographia</i> was on display in <!--del_lnk--> Autun, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in late Roman times. In the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a> Ptolemy&#39;s <i>Geographia</i> began to be printed with engraved maps; the earliest printed edition with engraved maps was produced in Bologna in 1477, followed quickly by a Roman edition in 1478 (Campbell, 1987). An edition printed at <!--del_lnk--> Ulm in 1482, including woodcut maps, was the first one printed north of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps. The maps look distorted as compared to modern maps, because Ptolemy&#39;s data were inaccurate. One reason is that Ptolemy estimated the size of the Earth as too small: while <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes found 700 <i>stadia</i> for a degree on the globe, in the <i>Geographia</i> Ptolemy uses 500 <i>stadia</i>. It is not certain if these geographers used the same <i>stadion</i>. If they both used the traditional Attic <i>stadion</i> of about 185 meters, then the older estimate is 1/6 too large, and Ptolemy&#39;s value is 1/6 too small. See also <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Greek units of measurement and <!--del_lnk--> History of geodesy.<p>Because Ptolemy derived most of his topographic coordinates by converting measured distances to angles, his maps get distorted. So his values for the latitude were in error by up to 2 degrees. For longitude this was even worse, because there was no reliable method to determine geographic longitude; Ptolemy was well aware of this. It remained a problem in geography until the invention of <!--del_lnk--> chronometers at the end of the 18th century. It must be added that his original topographic list cannot be reconstructed: the long tables with numbers were transmitted to posterity through copies containing many scribal errors, and people have always been adding or improving the topographic data: this is a testimony to the persistent popularity of this influential work in the <!--del_lnk--> history of cartography.<p><a id="Astrology" name="Astrology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Astrology</span></h2>

      <p>Ptolemy&#39;s treatise on <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, the <i>Tetrabiblos</i>, was the most popular astrological work of antiquity and also enjoyed great influence in the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic world and the <!--del_lnk--> medieval <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <!--del_lnk--> West. The <i>Tetrabiblos</i> is an extensive and continually reprinted treatise on the ancient principles of <!--del_lnk--> Horoscopic astrology in four books (Greek <i>tetra</i> means &quot;four&quot;, <i>biblos</i> is &quot;book&quot;). That it did not quite attain the unrivalled status of the <i>Syntaxis</i> was perhaps because it did not cover some popular areas of the subject, particularly <!--del_lnk--> electional astrology (interpreting astrological charts for a particular moment to determine the outcome of a course of action to be initiated at that time), and <!--del_lnk--> medical astrology.<p>The great popularity that the <i>Tetrabiblos</i> did possess might be attributed to its nature as an exposition of the art of astrology and as a compendium of astrological lore, rather than as a manual. It speaks in general terms, avoiding illustrations and details of practice. Ptolemy was concerned to defend astrology by defining its limits, <!--del_lnk--> compiling astronomical data that he believed was reliable and dismissing practices (such as considering the <!--del_lnk--> numerological significance of names) that he believed to be without sound basis.<p>Much of the content of the <i>Tetrabiblos</i> may well have been collected from earlier sources; Ptolemy&#39;s achievement was to order his material in a systematic way, showing how the subject could, in his view, be rationalized. It is, indeed, presented as the second part of the study of astronomy of which the <i>Syntaxis</i> was the first, concerned with the influences of the celestial bodies in the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">sublunar</a> sphere. Thus explanations of a sort are provided for the astrological effects of the <!--del_lnk--> planets, based upon their combined effects of heating, cooling, moistening, and drying.<p>Ptolemy&#39;s astrological outlook was quite practical: he thought that astrology was like <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, that is <i>conjectural</i>, because of the many variable factors to be taken into account: the <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Country">country</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> upbringing of a person affects an individual&#39;s personality as much if not more than the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the precise moment of their birth, so Ptolemy saw astrology as something to be used in life but in no way relied on entirely.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h2>
      <p>Ptolemy also wrote an influential work, <i>Harmonics</i>, on <!--del_lnk--> music theory and the mathematics of music. After criticizing the approaches of his predecessors, Ptolemy argued for basing musical intervals on mathematical ratios (in contrast to the followers of <!--del_lnk--> Aristoxenus and in agreement with the followers of Pythagoras) backed up by empirical observation (in contrast to the overly-theoretical approach of the <!--del_lnk--> Pythagoreans). Ptolemy wrote about how musical notes could be translated into mathematical equations and vice versa in <i>Harmonics</i>. This is called Pythagorean tuning because it was first discovered by Pythagoras. However, Pythagoras believed that the mathematics of music should be based on the specific ratio of 3:2 whereas Ptolemy merely believed that it should just generally involve tetrachords and octaves. He presented his own divisions of the <!--del_lnk--> tetrachord and the <!--del_lnk--> octave, which he derived with the help of a <!--del_lnk--> monochord. Ptolemy&#39;s astronomical interests also appeared in a discussion of the <!--del_lnk--> music of the spheres.<p><a id="Other_works" name="Other_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other works</span></h2>
      <p>In his <i>Optics</i>, a work which survives only in a poor Arabic translation, he writes about properties of <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>, including <!--del_lnk--> reflection, <!--del_lnk--> refraction and <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Colour">colour</a>.
