      <p><b>Popular culture</b>, or <b>pop culture</b>, (literally: &quot;the culture of the people&quot;) consists of the <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">cultural</a> elements that prevail (at least numerically) in any given <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a>, mainly using the more popular media, in that society&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> vernacular language and/or an established <i><!--del_lnk--> lingua franca</i>. It results from the daily interactions, needs and desires and cultural &#39;moments&#39; that make up the <!--del_lnk--> everyday lives of the <!--del_lnk--> mainstream. It can include any number of practices, including those pertaining to <!--del_lnk--> cooking, <a href="../../wp/c/Clothing.htm" title="Clothing">clothing</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mass_media.htm" title="Mass media">mass media</a> and the many facets of <!--del_lnk--> entertainment such as <a href="../../wp/s/Sport.htm" title="Sports">sports</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">literature</a>. (Compare <!--del_lnk--> meme.) Popular culture often contrasts with a more exclusive, even <!--del_lnk--> elitist &quot;<!--del_lnk--> high culture&quot;.<p>If one regards culture as a way of defining oneself (an extremely individualist approach), a culture needs to attract the interest of people (potential members) and to persuade them to invest a part of themselves in it. People like to feel a part of a group and to understand their <a href="../../wp/c/Cultural_identity.htm" title="Cultural identity">cultural identity</a> within that group, which tends to happen naturally in a small, somewhat isolated community. Mass culture, however, lets people define themselves in relation to everybody else in mass society at the level of a city, a country, an international community (such as a wide-spread language, a former colonial empire, a religion...) or even of a whole planet.<p>Pop culture finds its expression in the mass circulation of items from areas such as <a href="../../wp/f/Fashion.htm" title="Fashion">fashion</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, sport and <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a>. The world of pop culture had a particular influence on <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> from the early 1960s, through <!--del_lnk--> Pop Art.<p>

      <p>Popular culture can describe even contemporary popular culture as just the aggregate product of industrial developments; instead, contemporary Western popular culture results from a continuing interaction between those industries and those who <!--del_lnk--> consume their products(Bennett 1980, p.153-218). distinguishes between &#39;primary&#39; and &#39;secondary&#39; popular culture, defining primary popular culture as <!--del_lnk--> mass product and secondary popular culture as local re-production.jkjkjh<p>Popular culture changes constantly and occurs uniquely in place and <a href="../../wp/t/Time.htm" title="Time">time</a>. It forms currents and eddies, in the sense that a <!--del_lnk--> small group of people will have a strong interest in an area of which the <!--del_lnk--> mainstream popular culture has only partial awareness; thus, for example, the electro-pop group <!--del_lnk--> Kraftwerk has &quot;impinged on mainstream popular culture to the extent that they have been referenced in <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Father Ted</i>.&quot;<p>Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of <!--del_lnk--> the public. Some argue that broad-appeal items dominate popular culture because profit-making <!--del_lnk--> companies that produce and sell items of popular culture attempt to maximize their <!--del_lnk--> profits by emphasizing broadly appealing items (see <!--del_lnk--> culture industry). But that may over-simplify the issue. To take the example of popular music: the <!--del_lnk--> music industry can impose any product they wish. In fact, highly popular types of music have often first evolved in small, <!--del_lnk--> counter-cultural circles (<!--del_lnk--> punk rock and <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">rap</a> provide two examples).<p>Since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> a significant shift in pop culture has taken place: from the production of culture to the consumption of culture. Commentators have noted that those in <!--del_lnk--> power exploit <!--del_lnk--> consumers to do more of the work themselves (for example, <!--del_lnk--> do-it-yourself checkout lines), and <a href="../../wp/a/Advertising.htm" title="Advertising">advertising</a> on television, movies, radio, and in other places helps those in power to guide consumers towards what those in power consider needed or important.<p>Popular culture has multiple origins. In conditions of <!--del_lnk--> modernity the set of industries that make profit by inventing and promulgating cultural material have become a principal source. These industries include those of:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> popular music<li><a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a><li><a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a><li><a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a><li><!--del_lnk--> video games<li><!--del_lnk--> book publishing<li><a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">internet</a><li><a href="../../wp/c/Comics.htm" title="Comics">comics</a></ul>
      <p><a href="../../wp/f/Folklore.htm" title="Folklore">Folklore</a> provides a second and very different source of popular culture. In pre-industrial times, <!--del_lnk--> mass culture equaled <!--del_lnk--> folk culture. This earlier layer of culture still persists today, sometimes in the form of <!--del_lnk--> jokes or <!--del_lnk--> slang, which spread through the population by <!--del_lnk--> word of mouth and via the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. By providing a new channel for transmission, cyberspace has renewed the strength of this element of popular culture.<p>Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the <!--del_lnk--> commercial element, the public has its own tastes and it may not embrace every cultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture (for example: &quot;My favorite character is <!--del_lnk--> SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;) spread by <!--del_lnk--> word-of-mouth, and become modified in the process in the same manner that folklore evolves.<p>A different source of popular culture lies in the set of professional communities that provide the public with facts about the world, frequently accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> interpretation, usually as <!--del_lnk--> vulgarisation, i.e. adapted for consumption by the public at large (which may lack the training to appreciate academic language). Such communities include the <!--del_lnk--> news media, and <!--del_lnk--> scientific and <!--del_lnk--> scholarly communities. The <!--del_lnk--> news media mines the work of <!--del_lnk--> scientists and <!--del_lnk--> scholars and conveys it to the <!--del_lnk--> general public, often emphasizing &quot;<!--del_lnk--> factoids&quot; that have inherent appeal or the power to amaze. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> giant pandas (a species in remote Chinese woodlands) have become well-known items of popular culture; <!--del_lnk--> parasitic worms, though of greater practical importance, have not.<p>Both scholarly facts and news stories get modified through popular transmission, often to the point of outright falsehoods. At this point, they become known as <!--del_lnk--> urban legends. Other urban myths may have no factual basis at all, having simply originated as <!--del_lnk--> jokes.<p><a id="Criticisms_of_popular_culture" name="Criticisms_of_popular_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms of popular culture</span></h2>
      <p>Given its wide availability, popular culture has attracted much criticism.<p>Some charge that popular culture tends to endorse a limited understanding and experience of life through common, unsophisticated feelings and attitudes and its emphasis on the banal, the <!--del_lnk--> superficial, the capricious and the disposable. Critics may also claim that popular culture stems more from <!--del_lnk--> sensationalism and <!--del_lnk--> narcissistic <!--del_lnk--> wish-fulfillment fantasies than from soberly considered <!--del_lnk--> reality and mature personal and spiritual development. Cultural items that require extensive experience, education, training, taste, insight or reflection for their fuller appreciation seldom become items of popular culture.<p><!--del_lnk--> Corporations and advertisers have acquired a reputation for pushing popular memes in order to generate the mass <!--del_lnk--> consumption of their products and services. Some <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxists</a> complain that popular culture &mdash; and its implied insistence on a necessary causal relationship between consumption and <!--del_lnk--> self-actualization &mdash; perpetuates pernicious, deep-seated social and economic divisions which alienate the <!--del_lnk--> working class from the ruling <!--del_lnk--> professional and <!--del_lnk--> leisure classes and result in general discontent and a diminished quality and enjoyment of life for all (compare <!--del_lnk--> situationism).<p>
