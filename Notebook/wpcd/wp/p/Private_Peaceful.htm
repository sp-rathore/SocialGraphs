      <p><i><b>Private Peaceful</b></i> is a novel written by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Morpurgo. It is about a soldier called Thomas, or Tommo Peaceful, who is looking back on his life from the trenches of WWI. But as he thinks back, the time ticks ever closer to something which will change his life forever. The book was shortlisted for the children&#39;s section of the Whitbread Award. Since 2006, this has been known as the <!--del_lnk--> Costa Book Awards.<p>In 2005 and 2006 Michael Morporgo presented a series of concerts called &quot;Private Peaceful&quot;. This was a set of readings by Michael and some songs and tunes by <!--del_lnk--> Coope Boyes and Simpson. Back in 1995 the trio had been commissioned to create a concert in <!--del_lnk--> Passchendaele church with Flemish muscians. This was released as &quot;We&#39;re Here Because We&#39;re Here:Concert Party Passchendaele&quot;, a live album. Morporgo met up with them in September 2000 at a conference on &quot;Children&#39;s Literature in Peace and War&quot;. He was so impressed by the songs that the trio sang that he invited them to add music to &quot;Some Desperate Glory&quot;. This was a set of readings of war poetry devised by Morpurgo, and read by <!--del_lnk--> Jim Broadbent and others. Soon after they put together the material for &quot;Private Peaceful&quot;.<p><a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Plot summary</span></h2>
