      <p><i><b>Pac-Man</b></i> is an <!--del_lnk--> arcade game developed by <!--del_lnk--> Namco and licensed for distribution in the USA by <!--del_lnk--> Midway, first released in Japan in <!--del_lnk--> 1979. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, <i>Pac-Man</i> is universally considered as one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of <!--del_lnk--> 1980s <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>. Upon its release, the game became a social phenomenon that sold a bevy of merchandise and also inspired <!--del_lnk--> an animated television series and a Top 40 <!--del_lnk--> pop single.<p>When <i>Pac-Man</i> was released, most arcade video games in North America were primarily <!--del_lnk--> space shooters such as <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Invaders.htm" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a></i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Defender</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Asteroids</i>; the most visible minority were sports games (mostly derivative of <i><a href="../../wp/p/PONG.htm" title="PONG">PONG</a></i>). Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both males and females. <i>Pac-Man</i> is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. The character also appears in over 30 officially licensed games and sequels, as well as in numerous unauthorized clones and bootlegs.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Gameplay" name="Gameplay"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Gameplay</span></h2>
      <p>The player controls Pac-Man as he moves through a maze, eating pac-dots. When all dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage. 4 ghosts roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If a ghost touches Pac-Man, a life is lost. When all lives have been lost, the game ends. During Pac-Man gameplay, lives are usually lost by &quot;digging your own grave&quot;; it is easy to situate Pac-Man within the maze so that escape from the ghosts is impossible<p>Near the corners of the maze are four large round power-up objects known as &quot;energizers&quot; or &quot;power pellets&quot;, which provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts. The ghosts turn a deep blue and reverse direction immediately when Pac-Man eats an energizer, and they move more slowly while they are vulnerable. The ghosts are worth 200, 400, 800, and 1600 points, in sequence. The values reset back to 200 each time another Power Pellet is eaten, so it is advantageous for the player to eat all four ghosts on each pellet. If a ghost is eaten, its eyes return to the &quot;ghost pen&quot; where it is regenerated in its normal colour. (This may happen while the other ghosts are still blue, if the ghost is near the pen when eaten.) The ghosts flash white up to five times before they become dangerous again. The amount of time the ghosts remain vulnerable varies from one board to the next, but the time period generally becomes shorter as the game progresses. Starting with the 17th board (the 5th key), then continuing from board 19 to the end, the ghosts no longer turn blue at all, though eating an energizer still causes them to reverse direction. The 240 regular dots on each level are worth ten points each, and energizers are worth fifty points each. Additionally, prizes commonly referred to as &ldquo;fruit&rdquo; (even though several of them are not <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruits</a>) appear twice during each board just below the ghost pen &mdash; eating a fruit scores extra bonus points. The prizes change throughout the game, and their point values increase (see the table at right).<p>Pac-Man is awarded a bonus life one time only, at 10&nbsp;000 points (the default setting; <!--del_lnk--> DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points to 15&nbsp;000 or 20&nbsp;000 or disable the bonus life altogether).<p>Fruits appear in the middle of the maze sometimes; Pac-Man can eat these for bonus points. As the levels get higher, the fruit score more points.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The game was developed primarily by Namco employee <!--del_lnk--> Toru Iwatani over eighteen months. The original title was pronounced <i>pakku-man</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x30D1;&#x30C3;&#x30AF;&#x30DE;&#x30F3;</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji"><i>pakku-man</i></span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><!--del_lnk--> <span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></sup></span>)</span> and was inspired by the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> onomatopoeic phrase <i>paku-paku taberu</i> <span style="font-weight: normal">(<span class="t_nihongo_kanji" lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x30D1;&#x30AF;&#x30D1;&#x30AF;&#x98DF;&#x3079;&#x308B;</span><span class="t_nihongo_norom" style="display:none"><span class="t_nihongo_comma" style="display:none">,</span> <i><span class="t_nihongo_romaji"><i>paku-paku taberu</i></span></i></span><span class="t_nihongo_help"><sup><!--del_lnk--> <span class="t_nihongo_icon" style="color:#00e;font:bold 80% sans-serif;text-decoration:none;padding:0 .1em;">?</span></sup></span>)</span>, where <i>paku-paku</i> describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession. Although it is often cited that the character&rsquo;s shape was inspired by a <!--del_lnk--> pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that it was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, <i>kuchi</i> (&#x53E3;) as well as the basic concept of eating. Iwatani&#39;s efforts to appeal to a wider audience &mdash; beyond the typical demographics of young boys and <!--del_lnk--> teenagers &mdash; would eventually lead him to adding elements of a <!--del_lnk--> maze. The result was a game he entitled <i>PUCK MAN</i>. When first launched in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1979 by Namco, the game received a lukewarm response, as <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Invaders.htm" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a></i> and other games of similar type were far more popular at the time.<p>The following year, however, the game was picked up for manufacture in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Bally division <!--del_lnk--> Midway, under the altered title <i>Pac-Man</i> (see below). American audiences welcomed a breakaway from conventions set by <i>Space Invaders</i>, which resulted in unprecedented popularity and revenue that rivaled its successful predecessor, as even Iwatani was impressed with U.S. sales. The game soon became a worldwide phenomenon within the <!--del_lnk--> video game industry, resulting in numerous sequels and merchandising tie-ins. Pac-Man&rsquo;s success bred imitation, and an entire genre of maze-chase video games soon emerged, but none equalled the original in profit or popularity.<div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>Competitors and distributors were taken completely by surprise by <i>Pac-Man</i>&rsquo;s success in North America in 1980. Marketing executives who saw <i>Pac-Man</i> at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic <i><!--del_lnk--> Defender</i>), while they looked to a racing car game called <i><!--del_lnk--> Rally-X</i> as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of <i>Pac-Man</i> was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry before. <i>Pac-Man</i> outstripped <!--del_lnk--> Asteroids as the greatest selling arcade game of the time, and would go on to sell over 350,000 units.<p><a id="Localization" name="Localization"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Localization</span></h3>
      <p>For the North American market, the name was changed from <i>PUCK MAN</i> to <i>Pac-Man</i> (actually closer to the original Japanese pronunciation) because <i>puck</i> was similar in spelling and pronunciation to <!--del_lnk--> a common English expletive, and vandals could easily change it. Both <i>PUCK MAN</i> and <i>Pac-Man</i> machines can be found throughout Europe.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>When Midway released <i>Pac-Man</i> in the United States, the company also redesigned the cabinet&#39;s artwork, as the Namco-style artwork was more costly to mass produce, as well as being considered too stylish for the American market. <i>PUCK MAN</i> was painted overall white featuring multicolored artwork on both sides with cheerful Puck-Man characters in different poses while <i>Pac-Man</i> was painted yellow, with very simple and easy-to-stencil artwork on both sides and front.<p>The unique and original game design inspired game publishers to be innovative rather than conservative, and encouraged them to speculate on game designs that broke from existing genres. <i>Pac-Man</i> introduced an element of humor into video games that designers sought to imitate, and appealed to a wider demographic than the teenage boys who flocked to the action-oriented games. Many popular video games of the 1980s, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Q*bert</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Donkey Kong</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Frogger</i> partially owe their publication to the success of <i>Pac-Man</i>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Killer List of Videogames lists <i>Pac-Man</i> as the #1 video game of all time on its &quot;Top 10 Most Popular Video games&quot; list. <i>Pac-Man</i>, and other <!--del_lnk--> video games of the same general type, are often cited as an identifying cultural experience of <!--del_lnk--> Generation X, particularly its older members, sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> Baby Busters.<table align="right" class="wikitable">

      <p><a id="Intermissions" name="Intermissions"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Intermissions</span></h3>
      <p>During the opening boards of the game, the linearity of the game&#39;s progression is interrupted by &quot;intermissions&quot; - humorous animated scenes featuring Pac-Man and the ghosts. There are three different intermissions:<ol>
       <li>Blinky chases Pac-Man off the screen. Blinky reappears as a vulnerable blue monster coming the opposite direction, being chased by a giant Pac-Man. This intermission plays after Board 2.<li>Blinky chases Pac-Man across the screen, but his pelt gets caught on a tack in the floor, and part of it is ripped off revealing his pinkness. This intermission plays after Board 5.<li>Blinky, with the corner of his pelt sewn back on, chases Pac-Man across the screen. Blinky reappears coming back the opposite direction, pinked, dragging his pelt behind him. This intermission plays after Boards 9, 13 and 17.</ol>
      <p><a id="Perfect_play" name="Perfect_play"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Perfect play</span></h3>
      <p>A perfect <i>Pac-Man</i> game is defined as one where the player completes all 256 levels with a maximum point score and without losing a life. The first such game was verified by the <!--del_lnk--> Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard on <!--del_lnk--> July 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1999. <!--del_lnk--> Billy Mitchell, of Hollywood, FL, achieved the feat in six hours. To attain the maximum possible score of 3,333,360 points, it was necessary for Mitchell to eat every fruit, every Power Pellet, every blue ghost and every dot for 256 boards without losing a single life.<p><a id="Split-screen_level" name="Split-screen_level"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Split-screen level</span></h3>
      <div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>This game technically has no end; the player will be given new boards to clear as long as Pac-Man does not lose all of his lives. However, due to a glitch in the game, the right side of the <!--del_lnk--> 256th board is a garbled mess of text and symbols rendering the level unplayable. This occurs because of a bug in the subroutine that draws the fruit at the bottom of the screen that indicate the current level. Normally, at most 7 fruits are displayed, regardless of the current screen, but since the level number is stored in a single byte, level 255 (&quot;FF&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> hexadecimal) rolls over to 0 in the subroutine, and 256 fruit are drawn, corrupting the bottom of the screen and the entire right half of the maze. Enthusiasts refer to this as the &quot;Final Level,&quot; the &quot;Split-Screen Level,&quot; or simply as the ending. Although there are claims that someone with enough knowledge of the maze pattern can play through it, it is generally considered impossible to be cleared via legitimate means.<p>However, in December 1982, an eight-year-old boy named <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey R. Yee received a letter from <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">U.S. President</a> <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> congratulating him on a worldwide record of 6,131,940 points, a score only possible if the player has passed the <!--del_lnk--> Split-Screen Level. Whether or not this event happened as described has remained in heated debate amongst video game circles since its supposed occurrence. In September, 1983, Walter Day, Chief Scorekeeper at the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard, took the U.S. National Video Game Team on a tour of the East Coast to visit video game players who claimed they could get through the &quot;Split-Screen.&quot; No video game player could demonstrate this ability. Later, in 1999, <!--del_lnk--> Billy Mitchell offered $100,000 to anyone who could provably pass through the Split-Screen Level before <!--del_lnk--> January 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2000; there is no evidence that anyone could.<p>Through tinkering, the details of the Split-Screen Level can be revealed. As playable through arcade game emulator <!--del_lnk--> MAME some <!--del_lnk--> ROMs of the game are equipped with a &quot;rack test&quot; within the DIP switches that will automatically clear a level of all dots as soon as it begins. This method not only makes reaching the long-mythical 256th board easier (thus making detailed analysis possible) but also allows a demonstration of what happens after the board has been cleared:<p>Because the right side of the map does not exist, Pac-Man and the ghosts can move freely throughout the right side of the screen, barring some of the garbled symbols which are fractured pieces of the maze. Other symbols also entail power pills, which must be eaten for the player to continue (unlike the unglitched boards, if Pac-Man loses a life, the pills on the right side of the screen will reset after being eaten). Because the maze fracture blockades are &quot;placed&quot; in many locations, it is difficult - if not impossible - to locate them all.<p>If the board is cleared, the game restarts from the first board without error, once again repeating through 256. However, while the power-ups and intermissions repeat from the opening of the game, the monsters will retain their speed and invulnerability to power pellets from the later boards.<br clear="all" />

In the handheld world, it was released on the <!--del_lnk--> Game Boy (1991), <!--del_lnk--> Sega Game Gear (1991), <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Geo Pocket Colour (1999), <i><!--del_lnk--> Pac-Man: Special Colour Edition</i> for the <!--del_lnk--> Game Boy Colour (1999), Apple <a href="../../wp/i/IPod.htm" title="IPod">iPods</a> (fifth generation), <i><!--del_lnk--> Pac-Man Collection</i> for the <!--del_lnk--> Game Boy Advance (2001), and it is unlockable in <i><!--del_lnk--> Pac &#39;n Roll</i> for the <i><a href="../../wp/n/Nintendo_DS.htm" title="Nintendo DS">Nintendo DS</a></i>. However, it has been most widely distributed in Namco&#39;s long-running <!--del_lnk--> Namco Museum series, starting on the <!--del_lnk--> PlayStation in <!--del_lnk--> 1996 and continuing to this day on every major console (as well as the <!--del_lnk--> PSP and <!--del_lnk--> Game Boy Advance) with the <!--del_lnk--> 50th Anniversary Collection (2005). An <!--del_lnk--> Xbox 360 port was released via <!--del_lnk--> Xbox Live Arcade on <!--del_lnk--> August 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Pac-Man is also available in its original form as part of the <!--del_lnk--> GameTap service. On <!--del_lnk--> September 12, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 a port was released for play on the popular iPod music player along with other arcade/puzzle games. Pac-Man was never ported to the <!--del_lnk--> Atari 7800 home video game system. However, there have been efforts to hack the pre-existing <!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man cartridge to create the original Pac-Man (as well as other Pac-Variants) for it <!--del_lnk--> .<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Namco has repeatedly re-released this game in arcades. In 2001, Namco released a <i>20-Year Reunion</i> game that combined <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Galaga</i> in one cabinet. To play the original Pac-Man on this machine, move the joystick in this order on the &quot;Press Start Button&quot; that appears after one inserts one&#39;s coins: up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left. If done correctly, one should hear a sound, and Ms. Pac-Man will change colour. Press the Ms. Pac-Man start button, and one will be able to play Pac-Man. It should be noted that <i><!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man</i> machines are far easier to locate in today&#39;s arcades than a dedicated Pac-Man. In 2005, Namco released a board openly featuring all three of the games on the <i>20-Year Reunion</i> board in honour of <i>Pac-Man&#39;</i>s 25th Anniversary.<p>Namco&#39;s wireless division released a line of PAC-MAN games for the cell phone in 2002, starting with the original arcade version and following up with <b>Pac-Man</b> game extensions like <b>Pac-Man Bowling</b> and <b>Pac-Man Pinball</b>. This division (Namco Networks America Inc.) also launched a networked game, <b>Ms. Pac-Man For Prizes</b>, in 2004. Pac-Man mobile games are available on both <!--del_lnk--> BREW and <!--del_lnk--> Java platforms across major cellular carriers, as well as on Palm PDAs and Windows PC phones.<p><a id="Atari_2600" name="Atari_2600"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Atari 2600</span></h4>

      <p>The Atari 2600 version of Pac-Man was developed and published by Atari in <!--del_lnk--> 1982. It was the first <!--del_lnk--> port of the arcade game, Atari being the licensee for the <!--del_lnk--> video game console rights. Although Atari sold seven million units, out of a ten-million 2600-user base, this port may have been rushed to market and its quality was widely criticized. Atari, having manufactured twelve million cartridges under the expectation that the game would increase the number of sales of the console, was left with a large unsold inventory that had to be written-off, incurring in large financial losses for the company. This was one of the catalysts that led to the <!--del_lnk--> video game crash of 1983.<p><a id="Gallery" name="Gallery"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Gallery</span></h4>

      <p><i>Pac-Man</i> spawned numerous sequels, though none of them were as popular as the original. Of these, the most significant title was <i><!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man</i>. Originally created as an unauthorized hack of the original game called <i>Crazy Otto</i> by a small group known as <!--del_lnk--> General Computer Corporation, it was eventually sold to Bally Midway without Namco&#39;s permission. <i>Crazy Otto</i> was actually seen in a photograph in <i><!--del_lnk--> Time</i> magazine, mislabeled as the original <i>Pac-Man</i>. The game featured several improvements and changes from the original <i>Pac-Man</i>, including faster gameplay, more mazes, new intermissions, and moving bonus items. Some consider <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> to be a superior game to the original, and even the best in the entire series. Eventually Bally Midway struck a deal with Namco to make <i>Ms. Pac-Man</i> an officially licensed sequel, although the American company continued to release several unauthorized spin-off games later on, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Pac-Man Plus</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Baby Pac-Man</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Professor Pac-Man</i>. These other titles were generally considered inferior and unimportant, serving to oversaturate the market for <i>Pac-Man</i> games.<p><a id="Clones_and_bootlegs" name="Clones_and_bootlegs"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Clones and bootlegs</span></h3>

      <p>Unauthorized &quot;pirate&quot; versions of the game were also created, most notably <i><!--del_lnk--> Hangly-Man</i> (a mangling of &quot;Hungry-Man&quot;), one variant of which replaced the Pac-Man character with the head of <!--del_lnk--> Popeye. There was another hack of Hangly-Man called <!--del_lnk--> Caterpillar Pac-Man made in 1981 by Phi. In this game, one plays as a <!--del_lnk--> caterpillar, and the <!--del_lnk--> ghosts are replaced by four <!--del_lnk--> spiders.<p>Another popular <!--del_lnk--> clone game was <i>Piranha</i>, which replaced Pac-Man with a munching <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>. The maze was replaced with a <!--del_lnk--> coral reef, and the ghosts were replaced with <!--del_lnk--> squid. (In an earlier variant, they were little more than ghosts with extended <!--del_lnk--> sprites for the tentacles). A brief reference to the game was even included in the <i>Pac-Man</i> TV series, when in an underwater scene, a fish is shown eating a ghost-squid.<p><!--del_lnk--> Acorn&#39;s software division, Acornsoft, released an exceptionally accurate clone of Pac-Man called <i><!--del_lnk--> Snapper</i> for their <!--del_lnk--> BBC Micro and <!--del_lnk--> Acorn Electron home computers. After allegedly receiving a sternly worded <!--del_lnk--> cease and desist letter from Atari, Acornsoft modified the game, changing the maze layout and character graphics.<p>A game called <!--del_lnk--> Pacdude has also been released as freeware. It is almost a Pacman clone, but with a few differences. It is available to download via the official site at <!--del_lnk--> http://pacdudegame.wik.is/.<p>In addition, soon after the release of the original <i>Pac-Man</i>, many other maze-themed video games entered the arcade market (<i><!--del_lnk--> Make Trax</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Thief</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Lady Bug</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mouse Trap</i> being the most prominent). In the home video game market, <i><!--del_lnk--> K.C. Munchkin</i> was actually withdrawn after Atari successfully sued its creator, citing its imitation of the <i>Pac-Man</i> characters as blatant and undisguised.<p>Several handheld versions were released in 1981, most using <!--del_lnk--> VFD technology. The playability of most handheld games of this age was limited by today&#39;s standards, since each ghost and Pac-Man position was represented by an immovable fixed-cell character that lit up accordingly. Game titles included the following:<ul>
       <li>PacMan by Tomy<li>PacMan2 by Entex<li>Pac-Man by Coleco. As the official adaptation of the game, Coleco Pac-Man was shaped like a miniature Midway arcade cabinet.<li>Epoch Man by Epoch&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> LCD-based, this game can be seen in <i><!--del_lnk--> National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation</i> (1983) in Russ&#39;s hand.</ul>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Texas Instruments released a clone called <i>Munch Man</i> for the <!--del_lnk--> TI-99 home computer line in 1982, in which the player lays down a &quot;track&quot; (or &quot;links&quot;, in Munch Man parlance), as he progresses through the maze instead of eating pills &ndash; a change made by TI to avoid possible lawsuits from Midway.<p>In 1981, <!--del_lnk--> Leisure and Allied released <!--del_lnk--> Ghostmuncher/<!--del_lnk--> Galaxian. This game was a dual bootleg of Pac-Man and Galaxian. One could change the game with the Dip Switch. In this bootleg, the colors, sounds and names of the ghosts have been changed. The &quot;Galaxian&quot; bootleg is also sped up significantly.<!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> Data East released <!--del_lnk--> Lock&#39;n&#39;Chase in 1981. Here Pac-Man was replaced with a thief stealing coins from a bank vault. The Ghosts were replaced with police, and the thief could temporarily block passages with doors. A popular port of this game was released for the <!--del_lnk--> Mattel Intellivision in 1982.<p>In the 1990s, Microhard/Magic Games released <!--del_lnk--> Funny Strip. This was a maze game and a clone of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man featuring nudity. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Also in the 1990s, <!--del_lnk--> Best Before Yesterday released a game called Maniac, which merged Pac-Man with the game of <!--del_lnk--> hangman against a time limit. One notable feature was the turbo boost, temporarily making Pac-Man go faster. Upon acquiring this turbo boost, the phrase &quot;Thunderbirds are go!&quot; would be heard. Another feature was added background music.<p>In 1992, <!--del_lnk--> Creative Dimensions released a Pac-Man clone called CD-Man. CD-Man ate dots and ran from enemies such as spiders and sharks. <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 1993, <!--del_lnk--> Christophe de Dinechin wrote a Pac-Man clone for the <!--del_lnk--> HP-48 series of calculator.<p>In 1995, <!--del_lnk--> SemiCom released <!--del_lnk--> Hyper Pac-Man<!--del_lnk--> , a clone similar to <!--del_lnk--> Pac-Mania with some <!--del_lnk--> Bomberman-style elements. This was followed up by a sequel called <!--del_lnk--> Twinkle<!--del_lnk--> ; in this version Pac-Man is orange and wears sunglasses.<p>In 1999, <!--del_lnk--> ESD released <i>Multi Champ Deluxe</i>. Multi Champ Deluxe is an adult-oriented multi-game system in which the player chooses a girl and then one of six games, with the object being to win the game to save the girl. The games include a clone of Pac-Man.<!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 2000, Genie released <!--del_lnk--> Puckman Pokemon<!--del_lnk-->  which teamed up Pac-man and <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon. Player 1 controls Puckman and Player 2 controls <a href="../../wp/p/Pikachu.htm" title="Pikachu">Pikachu</a>&#39;s head.<p><!--del_lnk--> eGames has released several 3D clones of Pac-Man, including 3D Maze Man, 3D Chomper, and 3D Ms. Maze. These were made without license, and prompted a lawsuit including Hasbro, Atari America and Elorg. The games have not been discontinued as a term of the settlement.<p><i>Grandpa Pac-Man</i> was an unofficial sequel created by Lafe Travis Games for the PC, and is available as <!--del_lnk--> freeware. Grandpa Pac-Man has 13 mazes to master, 12 intermissions, and 30 different prizes to gobble up. <!--del_lnk--> <p>In 2003, an <a href="../../wp/o/Open_source.htm" title="Open source">open source</a> Pac-Man clone called Njam was released. The source code is freely available under <!--del_lnk--> GPL license, and besides regular gameplay it features two multiplayer modes where players can play either together or against each other. It also has networking support, so up to four players can play simultaneously. The game is available on <a href="../../wp/m/Microsoft_Windows.htm" title="Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Linux.htm" title="Linux">Linux</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mac OS X and many other operating systems. <!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> DirecTV&#39;s new interactive channel, Game Lounge, features a game called Hot Wheels Monster Truck Smashdown. A red monster truck takes the place of Pac-Man, and other monster trucks replace the ghosts, but otherwise, the game plays very much like regular Pac-Man.<p><!--del_lnk--> Topfield Digital Set Top boxes also feature a Pac-Man clone game, along with a clone of <!--del_lnk--> Tetris and a clone of <!--del_lnk--> Brick as part of their extras included in their menus.<p><a id="Non-video_games" name="Non-video_games"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Non-video games</span></h3>
      <p>In 1982, <!--del_lnk--> Milton Bradley released a <a href="../../wp/b/Board_game.htm" title="Board game">board game</a> based on Pac-Man and another based on Ms. Pac-Man. Several other pocket games and a card game were also produced.<p>A group of students from the Computer Science department of <!--del_lnk--> Simon Fraser University had developed a &quot;life-sized&quot; Pac-Man system, using laptops and <!--del_lnk--> cell phone tracking to track the location of the dots, ghost, and the Pac-Man. It has become a regular activity of Computer Science Frosh Week, and is usually played in <!--del_lnk--> Downtown Vancouver.<p>Pac-Man is also available to download and play on 5th-generation <a href="../../wp/i/IPod.htm" title="IPod">iPods</a>.<p><a id="Pac-Man_in_popular_culture" name="Pac-Man_in_popular_culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Pac-Man in popular culture</span></h2>

      <p>A great deal of <i>Pac-Man</i> merchandise was marketed in the 1980s, from <!--del_lnk--> t-shirts to <a href="../../wp/t/Toy.htm" title="Toy">toys</a> to hand-held video game imitations to pasta. There was also the aforementioned Saturday morning TV <!--del_lnk--> cartoon called <i><!--del_lnk--> Pac-Man</i>. This show, based on the game, was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Hanna-Barbera and lasted two years, from <!--del_lnk--> 1982 to <!--del_lnk--> 1984. It was also the basis for a Pac-Man <!--del_lnk--> Christmas special titled <i>Christmas Comes to Pac-Land</i>. In the series and the special, the &quot;nicknames&quot; given to Pac-Man&#39;s enemies in the game &mdash; Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde &mdash; became their official names, and Sue was a new ghost, colored purple. They were led by the evil Mezmaron, who employed them in his plots to raid the Power Pellet Forest.<p>The makers of the <!--del_lnk--> 1982 <!--del_lnk--> Disney feature-film <i><!--del_lnk--> Tron</i> sneaked a tiny Pac-Man into one quick shot when <!--del_lnk--> Sark is ordering the tanks to be sent out, giving the character a movie <!--del_lnk--> cameo appearance in effect.<p>A Pac-Man-inspired set of <!--del_lnk--> crop circles is located near Grazely, Reading, England, viewable by satellite imaging. <!--del_lnk--> Map at Google Sightseeing<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> video game-oriented <!--del_lnk--> webcomic <i><!--del_lnk--> Penny Arcade</i>, Gabe is almost always seen wearing a yellow shirt with a black outline of Pac-Man. Other strips reveal that his room is decorated with Pac-Man sheets and matching curtains, and his car&#39;s license plate reads &quot;PCMNFN&quot; (Pac-Man Fan). <!--del_lnk--> Mike Krahulik, the Penny Arcade artist who uses Gabe as an alter-ego, actually has a tattoo of Pac-Man eating pellets around his arm.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> VG Cats</i>, another <!--del_lnk--> video game <!--del_lnk--> webcomic, also uses Pac-Man in one of its logos. The logo is identical to Pac-Man; however, it is colored blue instead of yellow, and has a cat-like tail added to it, along with tiny cat-like ears atop it.<p>The 2004 movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Club Dread</i> featured a live version of Pac-Man played on &quot;Coconut Pete&#39;s&quot; tropical island, in which four bikini-clad girls would chase one man through a hedge maze; drinking from a cup of alcohol was the equivalent of a Power Pellet. Other characters dressed in costumes resembling the various fruit pieces of the game.<p>Pac-Man appears as a character in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Drawn Together</i> episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gay Bash&quot;. In a comic twist, <!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man is revealed to actually be Pac-Man himself, but in <!--del_lnk--> drag.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#39;s music video for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> White &amp; Nerdy&quot;, flares arranged in the shape of Pac-Man are shown in the background of some scenes.<p>In the animated series <!--del_lnk--> Class of 3000, on the episode <!--del_lnk--> The Hunt for Red Blobtober, there is a Pac-Man like screen with the kid&#39;s heads. After the scene, Philly Phil pulls grapes out of the hole. Also, Eddie makes the classic &quot;Wakka wakka wakka&quot; noise.<p>Pac-Man is shown for almost thirty seconds at high speed in the 1982 cult movie <!--del_lnk--> Koyaanisqatsi.<p><a id="Other_video_games" name="Other_video_games"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Other video games</span></h3>

      <p>Namco often puts the characters of Pac-Man into their other games, as actual opponents or subtle references. Some of the most prominent uses include the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ridge Racer</i> series of games and <i><!--del_lnk--> Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune</i>. In addition, similar to <i><!--del_lnk--> Namco x Capcom</i>, Pac-Man appears as a statue in <i><!--del_lnk--> Tales of Symphonia</i>, and also as a part of alternative costume of Presea that is based on the Namco character <!--del_lnk--> Klonoa. In another <i>Tales</i> game, <i><!--del_lnk--> Tales of the Abyss</i>, playable character Jade Curtiss&#39;s main outfit has a belt with a buckle shaped like Pac-Man. Because of this, the Pac-Man appears to be eating the belt holes, much like an in-game Pac-Man eating dots. <!--del_lnk--> Talim&#39;s 1P costume in Soul Calibur II and III both feature a Pac-Man emblem on her necklace.<p>Pac-Man is a playable character in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mario Kart Arcade GP</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mario Kart Arcade GP 2</i> games; in fact, Pac-Man is one of the first non-Nintendo characters to appear in a Nintendo game. <!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man and the red ghost Blinky are also playable. <!--del_lnk--> Klonoa, a Namco character, always wears a blue cap with a little Pac-Man on it. Curiously, this mark was erased in <i>Namco x Capcom</i>, in which Pac-Man&#39;s only appearance is as a statue in a single stage.<p>Pac-Man made a guest appearance in <i><!--del_lnk--> Kick Man</i> (1981), also once known as <i>Kick</i>. The object of Kickman was to catch falling balloons on the head of a unicycle rider. In some levels of the game, a Pac-Man might descend and, with his familiar sound effects, eat the already-caught balloons for bonus points. Ghosts appeared as well in higher levels.<p><i>Anna Kournikova&#39;s Smash Court Tennis</i> featured Pac-Man as a secret unlockable character. He looked exactly like his 3D render. To unlock him, the player had to complete the Times Square court under &quot;Street Tournament&quot; six times.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Wolfenstein 3D</i> (1992), there was a secret level that was a remake of one of the mazes in Pac-Man, complete with Pac-Man ghosts that would chase the player. They could not be killed. The dots were replaced with treasure items and the power pills were replaced with extra lives.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Baten Kaitos</i>, Pac-Man appeared as a card/weapon that was unlocked by performing a combo involving fruit.<p>A carving of Pac-Man eating a pill, along with a ghost from Pac-Man, could be seen in the fighting game <!--del_lnk--> Mortal Kombat.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Jak III</i>, when Daxter needed the codes to get into the KG Sky Factory, he went through a <i>Pac-Man</i>-like game to get the codes.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Top Secret!</i>, a map showing the protagonist&#39;s travel through Berlin changed into a <i>Pac-Man</i> game.<p>In <i><a href="../../wp/t/The_Simpsons.htm" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, Mr. Burns plays a generic version of Ms. Pac-Man.<p>In the section &quot;Raiders of the Lost Arcade&quot; of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Futurama</i> episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Anthology of Interest II&quot;, the Planet Express Crew and &#39;General&#39; Pac-Man went through a Pac-Man maze. During this <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Zoidberg ate various in-game items, including the key, the dots (which he said tasted like stale marshmallows), the fruit and <!--del_lnk--> Phillip J. Fry (who was okay because he &quot;had another guy&quot;). Pac-Man was inadvertently killed by laser fire from <i><a href="../../wp/s/Space_Invaders.htm" title="Space Invaders">Space Invaders</a></i>. Fry asked <!--del_lnk--> Amy Wong to tend to the <!--del_lnk--> Widow Pac-Man.<p>In an episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> Family Guy</i> they showed a flashback of when <!--del_lnk--> Ms. Pac-Man broke up with Pac-Man and the ghosts try to cheer him up by letting him eat them, but he was too depressed to acknowledge them, instead sitting silently, staring ahead and smoking a cigarette.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story</i>, a <i>Family Guy</i> movie, Brian is telling Stewie to get the fruit in a Pac-Man game.
