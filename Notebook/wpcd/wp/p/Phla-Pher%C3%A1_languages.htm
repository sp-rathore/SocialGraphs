      <p>The <b>Phla-Pher&aacute;</b> languages form a subgroup of <!--del_lnk--> Gbe languages spoken mainly in south-eastern and south-western <a href="../../wp/b/Benin.htm" title="Benin">Benin</a>; some communities are found in south-eastern <a href="../../wp/t/Togo.htm" title="Togo">Togo</a> and south-western <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. The group, comprised of about ten <!--del_lnk--> lects, was introduced by H.B. Capo in his 1988 <!--del_lnk--> classification of Gbe languages as one of the five main branches of Gbe. Additional research carried out by <!--del_lnk--> SIL International in the nineties corroborated many of Capo&#39;s findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings; in particular, Phla-Pher&aacute; was divided in an eastern and a western cluster. Phla-Pher&aacute; is one the smaller Gbe branches in terms of number of speakers. It is also the most linguistically diverse branch of Gbe, due partly to the existence of several geographically separated communities, but mainly because of considerable influence by several non-Gbe languages in the past. Some of the Phla-Pher&aacute; peoples are thought to be the original inhabitants of the region having intermingled with Gbe immigrants.<p>The term Phla-Pher&aacute; is a conjunction of the names of two major dialects of this grouping. There exist many spelling variants of both names. Phla, pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&chi;&#x2B7;l&agrave;]</span>, has been previously spelt <i>Pla</i>, <i>Kpla</i>, <i>Xwla</i>, <i>Hwla</i>, and <i>Fla</i> <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_failure"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Pher&aacute;, pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&chi;&#x2B7;&egrave;l&aacute;]</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&chi;&#x2B7;&egrave;r&aacute;]</span>, has been previously spelt <i>Peda</i>, <i>Fida</i>, <i>P&eacute;da</i>, and <i>Hou&eacute;da</i>. For simplicity&#39;s sake, this article will use the unified standard orthography of Gbe set forth by Capo.<p>

      <p>Most Phla-Pher&aacute; languages are spoken in the Mono, Atlantique, and Oueme (Weme) provinces of <a href="../../wp/b/Benin.htm" title="Benin">Benin</a>. Alada, a lect that is sometimes included in the Phla-Pher&aacute; group, is spoken in southwestern <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> just southeast of Benin&#39;s administrative capital <a href="../../wp/p/Porto-Novo.htm" title="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a>. One Phla-Pher&aacute; language, <!--del_lnk--> Xwla, is spoken west of the Mono river, along the coast between Anexo (Togo) and Grand Popo (Benin); this language has been called Popo in the past <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_popo"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. <!--del_lnk--> Fon in its various shapes, representing another branch of Gbe, is the dominant language in this area and communities of Phla-Pher&aacute; speakers are scattered across the Fon area.<p>The Phla-Pher&aacute; languages are among the least investigated of the Gbe languages. In some cases, barely more is known than the name of a dialect and the village where it is spoken. Because of this, it is difficult to determine the total number of speakers of Phla-Pher&aacute; languages. A tentative approximation, based on the scanty demographic data available in the <!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue, is 400 000 speakers excluding Alada, or 600 000 to 700 000 including Alada.<p><a id="Capo.27s_initial_classification" name="Capo.27s_initial_classification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Capo&#39;s initial classification</span></h2>
      <p>Much of the comparative research for Hounkpati B.C. Capo&#39;s influental classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the seventies, and partial results trickled down in the late seventies and early eighties in the form of articles on specific <!--del_lnk--> phonological developments in various branches of Gbe. In his 1988 work <i>Renaissance du Gbe</i>, the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time (part of the introduction in his 1991 <i>A Comparative Phonology of Gbe</i> is an English translation of this). In this classification, Phla-Pher&aacute; is considered one of the five branches of Gbe, the others being <!--del_lnk--> Ewe, <!--del_lnk--> Gen, <!--del_lnk--> Fon, and <!--del_lnk--> Aj&aacute;. According to Capo (1988:15), the Phla-Pher&aacute; group consists of the following lects:<ul>
       <li>Alada (Allada, Arda) &mdash; southwest Nigeria, southeast of <a href="../../wp/p/Porto-Novo.htm" title="Porto-Novo">Porto-Novo</a>.<li>T&#x254;li (Tori) &mdash; Atlantique and <!--del_lnk--> Weme province, west of the Ayiz&#x254; area.<li>T&#x254;fin (Toffi, Tofin) &mdash; Weme province, Benin, north of <!--del_lnk--> Nokou&eacute; Lake.<li>Phel&aacute; (Fida, P&eacute;da) &mdash; east of <!--del_lnk--> Ah&eacute;me Lake in the Atlantique province of Benin.<li>Phla (Pla, Xwla, Hwla, Popo) &mdash; in the coastal borderland of Togo and Benin, between <!--del_lnk--> Anexo and <!--del_lnk--> Grand Popo.<li>Ayiz&#x254; (Ayizo, Ayize) &mdash; Weme province, Benin.<li>Kotafon (Kotafohn) &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Mono province, Benin.<li>Ts&aacute;ph&#x25B; (Sahwe, Saxwe) &mdash; northern Mono province, Benin.<li>Gb&eacute;si (Gbesi) &mdash; Mono province, north of Ah&eacute;me Lake, Benin.<li>S&#x25B; (Se) &mdash; west Mono province, Benin.</ul>
      <p>Capo grouped the Phla-Pher&aacute; lects mainly on the basis of a number of shared phonological and <!--del_lnk--> morphological features, including the development of proto-Gbe *t<sup>h</sup> and *d<sup>h</sup> into /s/ and /z/, the retained distinction between *&#x25B; and *e, and the occurrence of various nominal prefixes.<p>Capo noted that &lsquo;the name Phla-Pher&aacute; is not used by speakers of the various lects which it comprises&rsquo; and that &lsquo;in fact, the Phla-Pher&aacute; section is less unified than the others&rsquo; <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_name"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. However, according to Capo, their speakers &lsquo;recognise a closer link between the lects listed here than between any of those listed in other [branches]&rsquo;. He marked the Alada variety as an exception, as some people &#39;consider Alada and the Fon language <i>Gun</i> to be one and the same language&#39;.<p><a id="Subsequent_research" name="Subsequent_research"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subsequent research</span></h2>
      <p>In the early nineties, the Summer Institute of Linguistics initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">literacy</a> efforts and whether additional development programs in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Linguistic research carried out in the course of this study was to shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe. Some of the results of this study were presented in Kluge (2000, 2005, 2006).<p>Based on a synchronic analysis of lexical and grammatical features elicited among 49 Gbe varieties, Kluge divided the Gbe languages into three major groupings: western, central, and eastern <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_kluge"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The eastern grouping consists of three clusters: Fon (roughly equivalent to Capo&#39;s &#39;Fon&#39; branch), western Phla-Phera, and eastern Phla-Phera (together roughly equivalent to Capo&#39;s Phla-Pher&aacute; languages). Among other things, this part of Kluge&#39;s analysis confirmed the uncertainty of the classification of the Alada dialect: some possible results point to inclusion in the Fon group, while others suggest membership of one of the Phla-Pher&aacute; clusters <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_kluge2"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. Likewise, Kluge&#39;s results indicate uncertainty regarding the classification of Ayizo and Kotafon <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_kluge3"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>A number of lects considered by Kluge were not included in Capo&#39;s research (cf. Capo 1991:14ff), namely Ajra, Daxe, Gbesi, Gbokpa, Movolo, Se, and Seto, all of which Kluge 2000:32, 2005:41ff,47, 2006:74ff,79)classified as Phla-Phera.<p><a id="Linguistic_diversity" name="Linguistic_diversity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Linguistic diversity</span></h2>
      <p>Just like Capo readily admitted the considerable diversity of the Phla-Pher&aacute; branch, Kluge&#39;s analysis did not result in conclusive evidence regarding the exact make-up of the western and eastern Phla-Pher&aacute; branches &mdash; various modes of computation yielded different configurations of the respective dialects (cf. 2000:62&ndash;3, 2005:45ff). The diversity in this subfamily is probably due in part to the fact that the various Phla-Pher&aacute; communities do not occupy one specific geographical area but are scattered along the coast of the <!--del_lnk--> Bight of Benin.<p>However, a more substantial reason for the noted diversity is one of historical nature. In a 1979 work on the history of the Gbe peoples (called <i>Adjatado</i> back then), the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic <!--del_lnk--> missionary Roberto Pazzi pointed out that &#39;three dialects emerged out of the half-breeding between immigrant groups and the indigenes from T&aacute;d&oacute;: they are G&#x25B;&#x300;n, S&aacute;hw&egrave; and Xwe&#x256;&aacute;.&#39; <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_pazzi"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>. The latter two dialects are part of Capo&#39;s Phla-Pher&aacute; branch, and Capo adds that Ts&aacute;ph&#x25B; and Phel&aacute; have C&aacute;b&#x25B; (<!--del_lnk--> Yoruboid) and <!--del_lnk--> E&#x31F;do respectively as <!--del_lnk--> substrata. This contact and intermingling of non-Gbe peoples with Gbe peoples and the influence of this processes on language inevitably diffuses the picture presented by comparative linguistic research. Further research into the historical origins of the Phla and Pher&aacute; peoples has yet to take place <span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_research"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span>.<p>Due to the uncertainty about the internal structure of the eastern Gbe major grouping, the <!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue has omitted Phla-Pher&aacute; altogether from its subclassification of Gbe languages. Some of the lects of Capo&#39;s and Kluge&#39;s Phla-Pher&aacute; are included in other branches (for example, <!--del_lnk--> Xwla is found under Aja) while others are not included in any subgroup of Gbe (e.g. Xwela).<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phla-Pher%C3%A1_languages&quot;</div>
