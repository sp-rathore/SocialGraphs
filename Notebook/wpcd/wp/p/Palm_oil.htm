      <p><b>Palm oil</b> is a form of edible <!--del_lnk--> vegetable oil obtained from the <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> oil palm tree. It is the second-most widely produced edible oil, after <!--del_lnk--> soybean oil. However, it may have now surpassed soybean oil as the most widely produced vegetable oil in the world.<p>The palm fruit is the source of both palm oil (extracted from palm fruit) and palm kernel oil (extracted from the fruit seeds).<p>Palm oil itself is reddish because it contains a high amount of <!--del_lnk--> betacarotene. It is used as <!--del_lnk--> cooking oil, to make <!--del_lnk--> margarine and is a component of many processed foods. Boiling it a few minutes destroys the <!--del_lnk--> carotenoids and the oil becomes white.<p>Palm oil is one of the few vegetable oils relatively high in saturated fats (such as coconut oil) and thus semi-solid at room temperature.<p>

      <p>Palm oil was long known of in <!--del_lnk--> West African states, and amongst West African peoples, saw widespread use as a cooking oil. European merchants trading with West Africa occasionally purchased palm oil for use in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, but as the oil was bulky and cheap, and due to the much higher profits available from <!--del_lnk--> slave-trading, palm oil remained rare outside West Africa. During the early <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century, the decline of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_slave_trade.htm" title="Atlantic slave trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> and Europe&#39;s demand for <!--del_lnk--> legitimate commerce (trade in material goods rather than human lives) obliged African states to seek new sources of trade revenue. In the <!--del_lnk--> Asante Confederacy, state-owned <!--del_lnk--> slaves built large plantations of <!--del_lnk--> oil palm trees, while in the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Dahomey, King <!--del_lnk--> Ghezo passed a law in <!--del_lnk--> 1856 forbidding his subjects from cutting down oil palms. Palm oil became a highly sought-after commodity by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> traders, the oil being used as industrial <!--del_lnk--> lubricant for the machines of Britain&#39;s ongoing <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, as well as forming the basis for <!--del_lnk--> soaps such as <!--del_lnk--> Palmolive. By c.1870, palm oil constituted the primary export of West Africa. By the 1880&#39;s, <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a> became more highly sought-after, leading to the decline of the palm oil trade.<p><a id="Chemical_composition" name="Chemical_composition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical composition</span></h2>
      <p>The palm oil and palm kernel oil are composed of <!--del_lnk--> fatty acids, <!--del_lnk--> esterified with <!--del_lnk--> glycerol just like any ordinary <!--del_lnk--> fat. Both are high in <!--del_lnk--> saturated fatty acids, about 50% resp 80%. The oil palm gives its name to the 16 carbon saturated fatty acid <!--del_lnk--> palmitic acid found in palm oil; monounsaturated oleic acid is also a constituent of palm oil while palm kernel oil contains mainly <!--del_lnk--> lauric acid. Palm oil is the largest natural source of tocotrienol, part of the <!--del_lnk--> vitamin E family. Palm oil is also high in <!--del_lnk--> vitamin K and dietary <a href="../../wp/m/Magnesium.htm" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Napalm derives its name from <!--del_lnk--> naphthenic acid, <!--del_lnk--> palmitic acid and pyrotechnics or simply from a recipe using naphtha and palm oil.<p>The proximate concentration of fatty acids (FAs) in palm oil is as follows:&nbsp;:<ul>
       <li>Saturated (total&nbsp;: 49.9%) <ul>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Palmitic C16:0 44.3%<li><!--del_lnk--> Stearic C18:0 4.6%<li><!--del_lnk--> Myristic C14:0 1.0%</ul>
       <li>Monounsaturated <ul>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Oleic C18:1 38.7%</ul>
       <li>Polyunsaturated <ul>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Linoleic C18:2 10.5%</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>For palm kernel oil the fatty acid content is&nbsp;:<ul>
       <li>Saturated (total&nbsp;: 82%) <ul>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Lauric C12:0 48.2%<li><!--del_lnk--> Myristic C14:0 16.2%<li><!--del_lnk--> Palmitic C16:0 8.4%<li><!--del_lnk--> Capric C10:0 3.4%<li><!--del_lnk--> Caprylic C8:0 3.3%<li><!--del_lnk--> Stearic C18:0 2.5%</ul>

      <p>Its high caloric value means that the palm nut is eaten by a wide variety of animals, including, rather improbably, two <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Palm Nut Vulture and the <a href="../../wp/h/Harrier_Hawk.htm" title="Harrier Hawk">Harrier Hawk</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Saturated fat, found in palm oil and palm kernal oil but also in coconut oil, beef fat, and milk fat is correlated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.<p>Unrefined palm and coconut oils do not increase the risk of atherosclerosis.<p><a id="Environmental_and_cultural_impact" name="Environmental_and_cultural_impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environmental and cultural impact</span></h2>
      <p>Demand for palm oil is rising and is expected to climb further, particularly for use in <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a>. Biodiesel is promoted as a form of <!--del_lnk--> renewable energy that greatly reduces net emissions of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> into the atmosphere, and therefore its use is being touted as a way to decrease the impact of the <a href="../../wp/g/Greenhouse_effect.htm" title="Greenhouse effect">greenhouse effect</a> and also the possibility of <!--del_lnk--> peak oil.<p>However, there is increasing concern from environmental and other <!--del_lnk--> NGOs about the social and environmental impacts of the palm oil industry. It is said that <a href="../../wp/r/Rainforest.htm" title="Rainforest">rainforests</a> are being cleared to make room for the plantations, thus reducing the habitat for some threatened species, such as the <!--del_lnk--> orangutan (on Borneo and Sumatra). The plantations are often run by <!--del_lnk--> agribusiness, and locals in places such as <!--del_lnk--> West Papua and <!--del_lnk--> Kalimantan are missing out on jobs to migrant workers. However most of the rainforest is actually cleared for tropical wood production, sometimes illegal. There is far more forest cleared that ever necessary for palm oil production.<p>Orangutan experts around the world have unified to recognise that continued development of the palm oil sector, if done unsustainably, is the single greatest threat to the future of orangutans in the wild. The best professional estimates state that if the industry is not regulated then within 12 years we may witness the disappearance of orangutans from the wild. Other species that are critically threatened by disappearance of the forests include the <!--del_lnk--> Sumatran tiger and <!--del_lnk--> rhinoceros.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Malaysian government is refocusing the use of palm oil to the production of <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiesel.htm" title="Biodiesel">biodiesel</a> to cater to the huge demand from European countries; it has encouraged the building of biodiesel plants. This is due to the higher prices of fuel and increasing demand for alternative sources of energy in the Western world.<p>The plants will start operating middle of next year and produce 100,000 tonnes of biodiesel annually. Strong demand for biodiesel from Europe as well as Colombia, India, South Korea and Turkey has fueled the industry&#39;s growth as more countries seek to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.<p>Malaysia has already begun preparations to change from diesel to bio-fuels by 2008, including drafting legislation that will make the switch mandatory. From 2007, all diesel sold in Malaysia must contain 5% palm oil. Being the world&#39;s largest producer of crude palm oil, Malaysia intends to take advantage of the rush to find cleaner fuels.<p>With the growing emphasis on biodiesels presenting a sustainable alternative to <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil_fuel.htm" title="Fossil fuel">fossil fuels</a> it is important to recognise that these benefits are partly negated when forest is cleared to make room for biodiesel crops such as oil palm. <!--del_lnk--> NGOs are now alerting the international arena to the fact that despite millions of hectares of land standing unplanted in Indonesia there is still clearance of tropical hardwood forest for palm oil plantations. Furthermore, as the remaining unprotected lowland forest dwindles, developers are looking to <!--del_lnk--> peat swamp for conversion, which causes a draining of the peat, which not only unlocks the carbon in the surface covering of trees, but begins an <!--del_lnk--> oxidation process of the carbon in the peat reserve--which can be between 5,000 to 10,000 years worth of carbon locked into the ground. Drained peat is also at very high risk of forest fire, and there is a clear record of fire being used to clear vegetation for palm oil development in <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.<p><a id="Health" name="Health"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Health</span></h2>
      <p>Among the touted health benefits of palm oil, most notably red palm oil, are:<ul>
       <li>Rich in <!--del_lnk--> betacarotenes, especially red palm oil.</ul>
      <p>Crude palm oil is considered the richest natural source of carotenoids (about 15 times more than in carrots). Carotenoids are a group of more than 700 compounds (e.g. alpha-carotene, beta-carotene) that produce the red, yellow, and orange colours found in many fruits and vegetables. The human body uses carotenoids as Vitamin A which enhances eye health. Carotenoids also play an important potential role by acting as biological antioxidants, protecting cells and tissues from the damaging effect of <!--del_lnk--> free radicals, which could cause cancer. Studies also suggest that carotenoids enhance immune function by a variety of mechanisms, and improve cardiovascular health. Red palm oil is a form of processed palm oil (deacidified and deodorised) which retains 80% of the original carotenoids, making it a remarkable source of Vitamin A.<ul>
       <li>High in <!--del_lnk--> tocotrienols, an <!--del_lnk--> antioxidant with other possible health benefits</ul>
      <p>Natural vitamin E exists in eight different forms or isomers, four tocopherols and four tocotrienols. Natural palm oil contains alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-tocopherols and alpha, beta, gamma, and delta-tocotrienols. No other natural source contains this much vitamin E (though the only form of vitamin E active in the human body is alpha-tocopherol). Tocotrienols in Vitamin E have been found to have many beneficial properties, among them antioxidant and anti-cancer activities. Probably the most important finding in recent research on tocotrienol was its role in inhibiting human breast cancer cells. Tocotrienols have also been demonstrated to lower blood cholesterol levels, by reacting with certain enzymes in the liver which produces cholesterol. Its antioxidant properties bring many benefits to the human body, such as preventing skin aging, preventing fat oxidation, reducing blood pressure and many more.<ul>
       <li>Other minor nutrients</ul>
      <p>Palm oil contained about 10% linoleic acid, which is an unsaturated <!--del_lnk--> omega-6 fatty acid. Linoleic acid is one of the two essential fatty acids that humans require. Palm oil also contains small amounts of squalene (possible cholesterol lowering and anti-cancer properties) and ubiquinone (energy booster).<ul>
       <li>Red palm oil is rich in <!--del_lnk--> co-enzyme Q10</ul>
      <p>Reasons for choosing palm oil:<ul>
       <li>Palm oil is an excellent dietary energy source.<li>Palm oil is a very rich source of Vitamin A and E.<li>Palm oil is a stable oil in high temperatures (good for frying).<li>Palm oil is a cheap vegetable oil (due to the oil palm&#39;s high productivity).</ul>
      <p><a id="Palm_oil_and_blood_cholesterol_controversy" name="Palm_oil_and_blood_cholesterol_controversy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Palm oil and blood cholesterol controversy</span></h2>
      <p>For many years now, it has been established that the primary cholesterol-elevating fatty acids are the saturated fatty acids with 12 (<!--del_lnk--> lauric acid), 14 (<!--del_lnk--> myristic acid) and 16 (<!--del_lnk--> palmitic acid) carbon atoms with a concomitant increase in the risk of coronary heart disease. Monounsaturated fatty acids such as <!--del_lnk--> oleic acid is as effective in reducing serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels as polyunsaturated fatty acids such as <!--del_lnk--> alpha-linoleic acid.  The <a href="../../wp/w/World_Health_Organization.htm" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases.<p>A study by a group of researchers in China comparing palm, soybean, peanut oils and lard showed that palm oil actually increased the levels of good cholesterol and reduced the levels of bad cholesterol in the blood (Zhang, et al, 1995, 1997 cited by Koh, 2006).<p>A study by Hornstra in 1990 also showed similar results.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Social and environmental palm oil links</span></h2>
