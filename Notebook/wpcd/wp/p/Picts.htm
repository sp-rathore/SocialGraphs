      <p>The <b>Picts</b> were a <!--del_lnk--> confederation of tribes in central and northern <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> from <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> times until the 10th century. They lived to the north of the <!--del_lnk--> Forth and <!--del_lnk--> Clyde. They were the descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> Caledonii and other tribes named by Roman historians or found on the <!--del_lnk--> world map of <a href="../../wp/p/Ptolemy.htm" title="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. Pictland, also known as Pictavia, became the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Alba during the 10th century and the Picts became the <i>Albannach</i> or Scots.<p>The name by which the Picts called themselves is unknown. The <!--del_lnk--> Greek word <i>&Pi;&iota;&kappa;&tau;&omicron;&#x3AF;</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>Picti</i>) first appears in a <!--del_lnk--> panegyric written by <!--del_lnk--> Eumenius in AD 297 and is taken to mean &quot;painted or <!--del_lnk--> tattooed people&quot; (Latin <i>pingere</i> &quot;paint&quot;). This may, however, be due to early <!--del_lnk--> folk etymology and the term likely has a <!--del_lnk--> Celtic origin, perhaps <i>Pehta, Peihta</i> (meaning &quot;fighters&quot;). The <!--del_lnk--> Gaels of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/D%25C3%25A1l_Riata.htm" title="D&aacute;l Riata">D&aacute;l Riata</a> called the Picts <i><!--del_lnk--> Cruithne</i>, (<!--del_lnk--> Old Irish <i>cru(i)then-t&uacute;ath</i>), presumably from <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Celtic *<i>k<sup>w</sup>riteno-tout&#x101;</i>. There were also <i>Cruithne</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, in particular the kings of <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;l nAraidi. The <!--del_lnk--> Britons (later the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh and Cornish) in the south knew them, in the P-Celtic form of &quot;Cruithne&quot;, as <i>Prydyn</i>; the terms &quot;Britain&quot; and &quot;Briton&quot; come from the same root. Their <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a> name gave the modern <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> form <i>Pechts</i>.<p>Archaeology gives some impression of the society of the Picts. Although very little in the way of Pictish writing has survived, Pictish history, from the late 6th century onwards, is known from a variety of sources, including Saints&#39; lives, such as that of <a href="../../wp/c/Columba.htm" title="Columba">Columba</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Adomn&aacute;n, and various <!--del_lnk--> Irish annals. Although the popular impression of the Picts may be one of an obscure, mysterious people, this is far from being the case. When compared with the generality of <!--del_lnk--> Northern, <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe in <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity and the <!--del_lnk--> Early Middle Ages, Pictish history and society are well attested.<p>

      <p>The archaeological record provides evidence of the <!--del_lnk--> material culture of the Picts. It tells of a society not readily distinguishable from its similar Gaelic and British neighbours, nor very different from the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons to the south. Although analogy and knowledge of other &quot;Celtic&quot; societies may be a useful guide, these extended across a very large area. Relying on knowledge of pre-Roman <!--del_lnk--> Gaul, or 13th century Ireland, as a guide to the Picts of the 6th century may be misleading if analogy is pursued too far.<p>As with most peoples in the north of Europe in <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity, the Picts were farmers living in small communities. Cattle and horses were an obvious sign of wealth and prestige, sheep and pigs were kept in large numbers, and place names suggest that <!--del_lnk--> transhumance was common. Animals were small by later standards, although horses from Britain were imported into Ireland as breed-stock to enlarge native horses. From Irish sources it appears that the &eacute;lite engaged in competitive cattle-breeding for size, and this may have been the case in Pictland also. Carvings show hunting with dogs, and also, unlike in Ireland, with falcons. Cereal crops included <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, <a href="../../wp/o/Oat.htm" title="Oats">oats</a> and <!--del_lnk--> rye. Vegetables included <!--del_lnk--> kale, <!--del_lnk--> cabbage, <!--del_lnk--> onions and <!--del_lnk--> leeks, <!--del_lnk--> peas and <!--del_lnk--> beans, <!--del_lnk--> turnips and <!--del_lnk--> carrots, and some types no longer common, such as <!--del_lnk--> skirret. Plants such as <!--del_lnk--> wild garlic, <!--del_lnk--> nettles and <!--del_lnk--> watercress may have been gathered in the wild. The pastoral economy meant that hides and leather were readily available. <!--del_lnk--> Wool was the main source of fibres for clothing, and <!--del_lnk--> flax was also common, although it is not clear if it was grown for fibres, for oil, or as a foodstuff. Fish, shellfish, seals and whales were exploited along coasts and rivers. The importance of domesticated animals argues that meat and milk products were a major part of the diet of ordinary people, while the &eacute;lite would have eaten a diet rich in meat from farming and hunting.<p>No Pictish counterparts to the areas of denser settlement around important fortresses in <!--del_lnk--> Gaul and southern Britain, or any other significant urban settlements, are known. Larger, but not large, settlements existed around royal forts, such as at <!--del_lnk--> Burghead, or associated with religious foundations. No towns are known in Scotland until the 12th century.<p>The technology of everyday life is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been similar to that in Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of <!--del_lnk--> watermills in Pictland. <!--del_lnk--> Kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate.<p>The early Picts are associated with piracy and raiding along the coasts of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>. Even in the <!--del_lnk--> Late Middle Ages, the line between traders and pirates was unclear, so that Pictish pirates were probably merchants on other occasions. It is generally assumed that trade collapsed with the Roman Empire, but this is to overstate the case. There is only limited evidence of long-distance trade with Pictland, but tableware and storage vessels from Gaul, probably transported up the <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_Sea.htm" title="Irish Sea">Irish Sea</a>, have been found. This trade may have been controlled from <!--del_lnk--> Dunadd in D&aacute;l Riata, where such goods appear to have been common. While long-distance travel was unusual in Pictish times, it was far from unknown as stories of missionaries, travelling clerics and exiles show.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Brochs are popularly associated with the Picts. Although these were built earlier in the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, with construction ending around 100 AD, they remained in use into and beyond the Pictish period. <!--del_lnk--> Crannogs, which may originate in <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic Scotland, may have been rebuilt, and some were still in use in the time of the Picts. The most common sort of buildings would have been <!--del_lnk--> roundhouses and rectangular timbered halls. While many churches were built in wood, from the early 8th century, if not earlier, some were built in stone.<p>The Picts are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. See Legends of the &quot;Painted People&quot; below. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on <!--del_lnk--> monumental stones. These stones include inscriptions in Latin and <!--del_lnk--> Ogham script, not all of which have been deciphered. The well known Pictish symbols found on stones, and elsewhere, are obscure in meaning. A variety of esoteric explanations have been offered, but the simplest conclusion may be that these symbols represent the names of those who had raised, or are commemorated on the stones. Pictish art can be classed as <!--del_lnk--> Celtic, and later as <!--del_lnk--> Insular. Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.<br clear="all" />
      <p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>Early Pictish religion is presumed to have resembled <!--del_lnk--> Celtic polytheism in general, although only place names remain from the pre-Christian era. The date at which the Pictish elite converted to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is uncertain, but there are traditions which place Saint <!--del_lnk--> Palladius in Pictland after leaving <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, and link <!--del_lnk--> Abernethy with Saint <!--del_lnk--> Brigid of Kildare. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Patrick refers to &quot;apostate Picts&quot;, while the poem <i><!--del_lnk--> Y Gododdin</i> does not remark on the Picts as pagans. Bede wrote that Saint Ninian (that is Saint <!--del_lnk--> Finnian of Moville, who died c. 589), had converted the southern Picts. Recent archaeological work at <!--del_lnk--> Portmahomack places the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> monastery there, an area once assumed to be among the last converted, in the late 6th century. This is contemporary with <!--del_lnk--> Bridei mac Maelchon and Columba, but the process of establishing Christianity throughout Pictland will have extended over a much longer period.<p>Pictland was not solely influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Iona and Ireland. It also had ties to churches in Northumbria, as seen in the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Nechtan mac Der Ilei. The reported expulsion of Ionan monks and clergy by Nechtan in 717 may have been related to the controversy over the dating of Easter, and the manner of tonsure, where Nechtan appears to have supported the Roman usages, but may equally have been intended to increase royal power over the church. Nonetheless, the evidence of place names suggests a wide area of Ionan influence in Pictland. Likewise, the <i><!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;in Adomn&aacute;in</i> (Law of <!--del_lnk--> Adomn&aacute;n, <i>Lex Innocentium</i>) counts Nechtan&#39;s brother <!--del_lnk--> Bridei among its guarantors.<p>The importance of monastic centres in Pictland was not perhaps as great as in Ireland. In areas which had been studied, such as <!--del_lnk--> Strathspey and <!--del_lnk--> Perthshire, it appears that the parochial structure of the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland_in_the_High_Middle_Ages.htm" title="Scotland in the High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a> existed in early medieval times. Among the major religious sites of eastern Pictland were Portmahomack, Cennr&iacute;gmonaid (later <!--del_lnk--> St Andrews), <!--del_lnk--> Dunkeld, <!--del_lnk--> Abernethy and <!--del_lnk--> Rosemarkie. It appears that these are associated with Pictish kings, which argues for a considerable degree of royal patronage and control of the church.<p>The cult of Saints was, as throughout Christian lands, of great importance in later Pictland. While kings might patronise great Saints, such as <!--del_lnk--> Saint Peter in the case of Nechtan, and perhaps <!--del_lnk--> Saint Andrew in the case of the second <!--del_lnk--> &Oacute;engus mac Fergusa, many lesser Saints, some now obscure, were important. The Pictish Saint <!--del_lnk--> Drostan appears to have had a wide following in the north in earlier times, although all but forgotten by the 12th century. Saint Serf of <!--del_lnk--> Culross was associated with Nechtan&#39;s brother Bridei. It appears, as is well known in later times, that noble kin groups had their own patron saints, and their own churches or abbeys.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The means by which the Pictish confederation formed in <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity from a number of tribes are as obscure as the processes which created the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Alamanni and similar confederations in Germany. The presence of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, unfamiliar in size, culture, political systems and ways of making war, should be noted. Nor can we ignore the wealth and prestige that control of trade with Rome offered.<p>Pictland had previously been described as the home of the <i>Caledonii</i>. Other tribes said to have lived in the area included the <i><!--del_lnk--> Verturiones</i>, <i>Taexali</i> and <i>Venicones</i>. Except for the Caledonians, the names may be second- or third-hand: perhaps as reported to the Romans by speakers of Brythonic or Gaulish languages.<p>Pictish recorded history begins in the so-called <a href="../../wp/d/Dark_Ages.htm" title="Dark Ages">Dark Ages</a>. It appears that they were not the dominant power in Northern Britain for the entire period. Firstly the Gaels of D&aacute;l Riata dominated the region, but suffered a series of defeats in the first third of the 7th century. The <!--del_lnk--> Angles of <!--del_lnk--> Bernicia overwhelmed the adjacent British kingdoms, and the neighbouring Anglian kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Deira (Bernicia and Deira later being called <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria), was to become the most powerful kingdom in Britain. The Picts were probably tributary to Northumbria until the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Bridei map Beli, when the Anglians suffered a defeat at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Dunnichen which halted their expansion northwards. The Northumbrians continued to dominate southern Scotland for the remainder of the Pictish period.<p>In the reign of <a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2593engus_I_of_the_Picts.htm" title="&Oacute;engus I of the Picts">&Oacute;engus mac Fergusa</a> (729&ndash;761), D&aacute;l Riata was very much subject to the Pictish king. Although it had its own kings from the 760s, it appears that D&aacute;l Riata did not recover. A later Pictish king, <!--del_lnk--> Caustant&iacute;n mac Fergusa (793&ndash;820) placed his son Domnall on the throne of D&aacute;l Riata (811&ndash;835). Pictish attempts to achieve a similar dominance over the Britons of <!--del_lnk--> Alt Clut (<!--del_lnk--> Dumbarton) were not successful.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Viking Age brought great changes in Britain and Ireland, no less in Scotland than elsewhere. The kingdom of D&aacute;l Riata was destroyed, certainly by the middle of the 9th century, when <!--del_lnk--> Ketil Flatnose is said to have founded the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of the Isles. Northumbria too succumbed to the Vikings, who founded the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of York, and the <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Strathclyde was also greatly affected. The king of Fortriu <!--del_lnk--> E&oacute;gan mac &Oacute;engusa, the king of D&aacute;l Riata <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;ed mac Boanta, and many more, were killed in a major battle against the Vikings in 839. The rise of <!--del_lnk--> C&iacute;naed mac Ailp&iacute;n (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, in the aftermath of this disaster, brought to power the family who would preside over the last days of the Pictish kingdom and found the new kingdom of Alba, although C&iacute;naed himself was never other than king of the Picts.<p>In the reign of C&iacute;naed&#39;s grandson, <a href="../../wp/c/Constantine_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Constantine II of Scotland">Caustant&iacute;n mac &Aacute;eda</a> (900&ndash;943), the kingdom of the Picts became the kingdom of Alba. The change from Pictland to Alba may not have been noticeable at first; indeed, as we do not know the Pictish name for their land, it may not have been a change at all. The Picts, along with their language, did not disappear suddenly. The process of Gaelicisation, which may have begun generations earlier, continued under Caustant&iacute;n and his successors. When the last inhabitants of Alba were fully Gaelicised, becoming Scots, probably during the 11th century, the Picts were soon forgotten. Later they would reappear in <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">myth</a> and <!--del_lnk--> legend.<p><a id="Pictish_kings_and_kingdoms" name="Pictish_kings_and_kingdoms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pictish kings and kingdoms</span></h2>

      <p>The early history of Pictland is, as has been said, unclear. In later periods multiple kings existed, ruling over separate kingdoms, with one king, sometimes two, more or less dominating their lesser neighbours. <i><!--del_lnk--> De Situ Albanie</i>, a late document, the <!--del_lnk--> Pictish Chronicle, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Duan Albanach</i>, along with Irish legends, have been used to argue the existence of seven Pictish kingdoms. These are as follows, those in <b>bold</b> are known to have had kings, or are otherwise attested in the Pictish period:<ul>
       <li>Cait, situated in modern <!--del_lnk--> Caithness and <!--del_lnk--> Sutherland<li>Ce, situated in modern <!--del_lnk--> Mar and <!--del_lnk--> Buchan<li><b>Circinn</b>, perhaps situated in modern <!--del_lnk--> Angus and <!--del_lnk--> the Mearns<li>Fib, the modern <!--del_lnk--> Fife, known to this day as &#39;the Kingdom of Fife&#39;<li>Fidach, location unknown<li><b>Fotla</b>, modern <!--del_lnk--> Atholl (<i>Ath-Fotla</i>)<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Fortriu</b>, cognate with the <i>Verturiones</i> of the Romans; recently shown to be centered around <!--del_lnk--> Moray</ul>
      <p>More small kingdoms may have existed. Some evidence suggest that a Pictish kingdom also existed in <a href="../../wp/o/Orkney.htm" title="Orkney">Orkney</a>. <i>De Situ Albanie</i> is not the most reliable of sources, and the number of kingdoms, one for each of the seven sons of <i>Cruithne</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> eponymous founder of the Picts, may well be grounds enough for disbelief. Regardless of the exact number of kingdoms and their names, the Pictish nation was not a united one.<p>For most of Pictish recorded history the kingdom of Fortriu appears dominant, so much so that <i>king of Fortriu</i> and <i>king of the Picts</i> may mean one and the same thing in the annals. This was previously thought to lie in the area around <!--del_lnk--> Perth and the southern <!--del_lnk--> Strathearn, whereas recent work has convinced those working in the field that Moray (a name referring to a very much larger area in the High Middle Ages than the county of <!--del_lnk--> Moray), was the core of Fortriu.<p>The Picts are often said to have practised <!--del_lnk--> matrilineal succession on the basis of Irish legends and a statement in <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a>&#39;s history. In fact, Bede merely says that the Picts used matrilineal succession in exceptional cases. The kings of the Picts when Bede was writing were Bridei and Nechtan, sons of Der Ilei, who indeed claimed the throne through their mother Der Ilei, daughter of an earlier Pictish king.<p>In Ireland, kings were expected to come from among those who had a great-grandfather who had been king. Kingly fathers were not frequently succeeded by their sons, not because the Picts practised matrilineal succession, but because they were usually followed by their brothers or cousins, more likely to be experienced men with the authority and the support necessary to be king.<p>The nature of kingship changed considerably during the centuries of Pictish history. While kings had to be successful war leaders to maintain their authority, kingship became rather less personalised and more institutionalised during this time. Bureaucratic kingship was still far in the future when Pictland became Alba, but the support of the church, and the apparent ability of a small number of families to control the kingship for much of the period from the later 7th century onwards, provided a considerable degree of continuity. In the much same period, the Picts&#39; neighbours in D&aacute;l Riata and Northumbria faced considerable difficulties as the stability of succession and rule which they had previously benefitted from came to an end.<p>The later <!--del_lnk--> Mormaers are thought to have originated in Pictish times, and to have been copied from, or inspired by, Northumbrian usages. It is unclear whether the Mormaers were originally former kings, royal officials, or local nobles, or some combination of these. Likewise, the Pictish shires and thanages, traces of which are found in later times, are thought to have been adopted from their southern neighbours.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h2>

      <p>The Pictish language has not survived. Evidence is limited to place names and to the names of people found on monuments and the contemporary records. The evidence of <!--del_lnk--> place-names and <!--del_lnk--> personal names argue strongly that the Picts spoke <!--del_lnk--> Insular Celtic languages related to the more southerly <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic languages. A number of inscriptions have been argued to be non-Celtic, and on this basis, it has been suggested that non-Celtic languages were also in use.<p>The absence of surviving written material in Pictish does not mean a pre-literate society. The church certainly required literacy, and could not function without copyists to produce liturgical documents. Pictish iconography shows books being read, and carried, and its naturalistic style gives every reason to suppose that such images were of real life. Literacy was not widespread, but among the senior clergy, and in monasteries, it will have been common enough.<p>Place-names often allow us to deduce the existence of historic Pictish settlements in Scotland. Those prefixed with &quot;Aber-&quot;, &quot;Lhan-&quot;, or &quot;Pit-&quot; indicate regions inhabited by Picts in the past (for example: <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Lhanbryde, <!--del_lnk--> Pitmedden, <!--del_lnk--> Pittodrie etc). Some of these, such as &quot;Pit-&quot; (portion, share), were formed after Pictish times, and may refer to previous &quot;shires&quot; or &quot;thanages&quot;.<p>The evidence of place-names may also reveal the advance of Gaelic into Pictland. As noted, <!--del_lnk--> Atholl, meaning <i>New Ireland</i>, is attested in the early 8th century. This may be an indication of the advance of Gaelic. Fortriu also contains place-names suggesting Gaelic settlement, or Gaelic influences.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts&quot;</div>
