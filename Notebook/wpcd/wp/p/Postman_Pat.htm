       <li>The first series had 13 episodes. For the first eight, Postman Pat&#39;s &quot;bright red van&quot; featured a generic crown-style symbol, which was designed to be similar to the official Royal Mail symbol. When the Royal Mail gave the programme makers permission to use their official symbol, the crown was replaced with the proper Royal Mail symbol.<li>Pat&#39;s van is a small &#39;box&#39; type van, with the registration, &quot;Pat 1&quot;. However there was one episode where Pat used a slightly longer &#39;minibus&#39; version of the van, which could carry passengers and freight, called &quot;Pat 2&quot;. And from series 4 onwards his post bus was painted yellow to become the school mini bus.</ul>
