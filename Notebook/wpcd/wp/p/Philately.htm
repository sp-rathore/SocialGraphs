      <p><b>Philately</b> is the study of <!--del_lnk--> revenue or <a href="../../wp/p/Postage_stamp.htm" title="Postage stamp">postage stamps</a>. This includes the design, production and uses of stamps after they are issued by <!--del_lnk--> postal authorities. Although many equate it with <!--del_lnk--> stamp collecting, it is a distinct activity. For instance, philatelists will study extremely rare stamps without expecting to own copies of them, whether because of cost, or because the sole survivors are in museums. Conversely, a stamp collector may choose to acquire and arrange the little pictures without being much troubled about their origin or usage. In practice, a basic knowledge of philately will save the collector from spending a great deal of money on a stamp that is really almost worthless.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The coining of the word &quot;philately&quot; in its French form has been circumstantially attributed to Georges Herpin in the publication <i>Le Collectioneur de timbres-postes</i>, Vol. 1, <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1864. It is formed from the Greek words <i>philos</i> (friend) and <i>ateleia</i> (exempt from charge, or &quot;franked&quot;), which is a stretch to relate to the study of stamps, but the alternatives of &quot;timbrophily&quot; &amp; &quot;timbrology&quot; or &quot;timbrologist&quot; never caught on.<p>The origin of philately is in the observation that in a pile of stamps all appearing to be the same type, closer examination reveals different kinds of paper, different <!--del_lnk--> watermarks embedded in the paper, variations in colour shades, different perforations, and other kinds of differences. Comparison with records of <!--del_lnk--> postal authorities may or may not show that the variations were intentional, which leads to further inquiry as to how the changes could have happened, and why. To make things more interesting, thousands of <!--del_lnk--> forgeries have been produced over the years, some of them very good, and only a thorough knowledge of philately gives any hope of detecting the fakes.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>One explanation for all the variation is that stamp printing was among the early attempts at large-scale <!--del_lnk--> mass production activity by <!--del_lnk--> postal authorities. Even in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, stamps were being issued by the billions, more than any other kind of manufactured object at the time.<p>

      <p><b>Topical</b> philately is the study of what is depicted on the stamps. There are hundreds of popular subjects, such as<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> People on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Maps on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Birds on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Insects on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Ships on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Stamps on stamps<li><!--del_lnk--> Chess on stamps</ul>
      <p>Interesting aspects of topical philately include design mistakes (such as use of the wrong picture on a <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">US</a> stamp honoring <!--del_lnk--> Bill Pickett), design alterations (for instance, the recent editing out of cigarettes from the pictures used for US stamps), and the stories of how particular images came to be used (one US stamp from the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s shows a <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> ship apparently flying an American flag, but this was not a mistake).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Postal history concentrates on the use of stamps on <!--del_lnk--> mail. It includes the study of <!--del_lnk--> postmarks, <!--del_lnk--> post offices, <!--del_lnk--> postal authorities and the process by which letters are moved from sender to recipient, including routes and choice of conveyance. A classic example is the <!--del_lnk--> Pony Express, which was the fastest way to send letters across the United States during the few months that it operated. Covers that can be proved to have been sent by the Pony Express are highly prized by collectors.<p><!--del_lnk--> Cinderella philately is the study of objects that look like stamps but aren&#39;t stamps. Examples include <!--del_lnk--> Easter Seals, propaganda labels, and so forth.<p>The results of philatelic study have been extensively documented by the <!--del_lnk--> philatelic literature, which includes many books and nearly 15,000 different periodical titles.<p>Philately is basically an activity of reading and study, but the human senses typically need augmentation. The stamps themselves are handled with <b>stamp tongs</b> so as to preserve them from large, clumsy, and possibly greasy fingers. A strong <b><!--del_lnk--> magnifier</b> reveals details of paper and printing, while the <b>odontometer</b> or <b>perforation gauge</b> helps distinguish a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> perf 12&quot; from a &quot;perf 13&quot;.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:122px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/104/10473.jpg.htm" title="Early stamps of India were watermarked with an elephant&#39;s head."><img alt="Early stamps of India were watermarked with an elephant&#39;s head." height="137" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Watermark_elephant_head.jpg" src="../../images/104/10473.jpg" width="120" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">Early stamps of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> were <!--del_lnk--> watermarked with an elephant&#39;s head.</div>
       </div>
      </div>
      <p>While many watermarks can be detected merely by turning the stamp over, or holding it up to the light, others require the services of <b>watermark fluid</b>, such as <!--del_lnk--> benzine (not to be confused with <a href="../../wp/b/Benzene.htm" title="Benzene">benzene</a>, which is toxic), <!--del_lnk--> carbon tetrachloride or <!--del_lnk--> trichloro-trifluoro-ethane that &quot;wets&quot; the stamp without dissolving gum or ink. Other techniques, such as using coloured light filters have been attempted in an effort to avoid the use of toxic substances.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Experts evaluating the authenticity of the rarest stamps use additional equipment such as <!--del_lnk--> fluoroscopes. Some stamps are printed with ink which fluoresces when exposed to ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light sources are also used to examine stamps and postal history for signs of repairs or various types of faults.<p><a id="Organizations" name="Organizations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Organizations</span></h2>
