      <p><b>Piccadilly Circus</b> is a famous <!--del_lnk--> traffic intersection and public space of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> West End in the <!--del_lnk--> City of Westminster. Built in 1819 to connect <!--del_lnk--> Regent Street with the major shopping street of <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly (the &quot;circus&quot; refers to &quot;circular open space at a street junction&quot;), it now links directly to the theatres on <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury Avenue as well as <!--del_lnk--> the Haymarket, <!--del_lnk--> Coventry Street (onwards to <!--del_lnk--> Leicester Square) and Glasshouse Street. The Circus is close to major shopping and entertainment areas in a central location at the heart of the <!--del_lnk--> West End. Its status as a major traffic intersection have made Piccadilly Circus a busy meeting point and a tourist attraction in its own right.<p>The Circus is particularly know for its video display and <!--del_lnk--> neon signs mounted on the corner building on the northern side, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury memorial fountain and statue known as &#39;Eros&#39; (sometimes called &#39;The Angel of Christian Charity&#39;, which would be better translated as &#39;Agape&#39;, but formally &#39;Anteros&#39; - see below). It is surrounded by several noted buildings, including the London Pavilion and <!--del_lnk--> Criterion Theatre. Directly underneath the plaza is the <a href="../../wp/l/London_Underground.htm" title="London Underground">London Underground</a> station <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly Circus.<p>

      <p>Piccadilly Circus connects to <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly, a thoroughfare whose name first appeared in <!--del_lnk--> 1626 as Pickadilly Hall, named after a house belonging to one Robert Baker, a tailor famous for selling <!--del_lnk--> piccadills or piccadillies, a term used for various kinds of <!--del_lnk--> collars. The street was known as Portugal Street in <!--del_lnk--> 1692 in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Catherine of Braganza, the <!--del_lnk--> queen consort of King <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a>, but was known as Piccadilly by <!--del_lnk--> 1743. Piccadilly Circus was created in <!--del_lnk--> 1819, at the junction with <!--del_lnk--> Regent Street, which was then being built under the planning of <!--del_lnk--> John Nash on the site of a house and garden belonging to a Lady Hutton. The circus lost its circular form in 1886 with the construction of Shaftesbury Avenue.<p>The junction has been a very busy traffic interchange since construction, as it lies at the centre of <!--del_lnk--> Theatreland and handles exit traffic from Piccadilly, which Charles C. B. Dickens, son of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, described as &quot;the great thoroughfare leading from the Haymarket and Regent-street westward to <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park-corner&quot; and &quot;the nearest approach to the <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Parisian</a> boulevard of which London can boast.&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly Circus tube station was opened <!--del_lnk--> 10 March <!--del_lnk--> 1906 on the Bakerloo Line, and on the <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly Line in December of that year. In <!--del_lnk--> 1928, the station was extensively rebuilt to handle an increase in traffic.<p>The intersection&#39;s first electric advertisements appeared in <!--del_lnk--> 1910, and from <!--del_lnk--> 1923 electric billboards were set up on the facade of the <!--del_lnk--> London Pavilion. Traffic lights were first installed in <!--del_lnk--> August 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1926 at the junction.<p>At the start of the 1960s, it was determined that the Circus needed to be redeveloped to allow for greater traffic flow. In <!--del_lnk--> 1962, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Holford presented a plan which would have created a &quot;double-decker&quot; Piccadilly Circus, with a new pedestrian concourse above the ground-level traffic. This concept was kept alive throughout the rest of 60s, before eventually being killed by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Keith Joseph and <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Marples in <!--del_lnk--> 1972; the key reason given was that Holford&#39;s scheme only allowed for a 20% increase in traffic, and the Government required 50%.<p>The Holford plan is referenced in the short-form <!--del_lnk--> documentary film &quot;Goodbye, Piccadilly&quot;, produced by the <!--del_lnk--> Rank Organisation in <!--del_lnk--> 1967. Piccadilly Circus has since escaped major redevelopment, apart from extensive ground-level pedestrianisation around its south side in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s.<p>The Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus was erected in <!--del_lnk--> 1893, to commemorate the philanthropic works of <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Ashley Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. During the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War, the statue atop the <!--del_lnk--> Shaftesbury memorial fountain, <i>The Angel of Christian Charity</i>, was removed, and was replaced by advertising hoardings. It was returned in 1948. When the circus underwent reconstruction work in the late 1980s, the entire fountain was moved from the centre of the junction at the beginning of Shaftesbury Avenue to its present position at the southwestern corner.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="gallery">

      <p>Piccadilly Circus used to be surrounded by illuminated advertising hoardings on buildings since the early 1900s, but only one building now carries them, namely the one in the northwestern corner, between Shaftesbury Avenue and Glasshouse Street. The site is unnamed (usually referred to as <i>Monico</i> after the Caf&eacute; Monico which used to be on the site); its addresses are 44/48 Regent Street, 1/6 Sherwood Street, 17/22 Denman Street and 1/17 Shaftesbury Avenue, and has been owned by property investor <!--del_lnk--> Land Securities Group since the 1970s.<p>The earliest signs used <!--del_lnk--> incandescent light bulbs, these were replaced with <!--del_lnk--> neon lamps, as well as moving signs (there was a large <a href="../../wp/g/Guinness.htm" title="Guinness">Guinness</a> clock at one time). Briefly <!--del_lnk--> digital projectors were used for the Coke sign, while the early 2000s have seen a gradual move to <!--del_lnk--> LED displays. The number of signs has reduced over the years as the rental costs have increased.<p><!--del_lnk--> As of 2005, the site has five illuminated advertising screens above three large retail units, facing Piccadilly Circus on the north side, occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Boots, <!--del_lnk--> Burger King and <!--del_lnk--> GAP and a mix of smaller retail, restaurant and office premises fronting the other streets. In September 2003, <!--del_lnk--> Coca Cola replaced its old illuminated board and the site formally occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Nescaf&eacute; with a state-of-the-art <!--del_lnk--> LED video display that curves round with the building. Below the <!--del_lnk--> Coca Cola sign, are <!--del_lnk--> Sanyo and <!--del_lnk--> TDK, together with the squarish <!--del_lnk--> McDonald&#39;s LED. On the left is the <!--del_lnk--> Samsung board, being upgraded from neon to LED in 2005.<p><a href="../../wp/v/Vodafone.htm" title="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> also has a sign installed on the roof of Coventry House facing Piccadilly Circus. In addition to the logo of the company, the sign displays personal messages that can be entered on a <!--del_lnk--> Vodafone website and displayed at a certain time and date.<p><a id="Shaftesbury_Memorial_and_Eros" name="Shaftesbury_Memorial_and_Eros"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Shaftesbury Memorial and Eros</span></h3>

      <p>At the south-western side of the Circus, moved from its original position in the centre, stands the Shaftesbury Monument memorial fountain, erected in 1892-1893 to commemorate the philanthropic works of <!--del_lnk--> Lord Shaftesbury. It is topped by <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Gilbert&#39;s winged nude statue, sometimes known as <i>The Angel of Christian Charity</i>. It is popularly known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Eros</i> after the mythical Greek God of Love, although he is intended to be Eros&#39; twin <!--del_lnk--> Anteros. The statue has become a London icon, and a graphical illustration of the statue is used as the symbol of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Evening Standard</i> <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> and appears on its masthead.<p>The use of a nude figure on a public monument was controversial at the time of its construction, but it was generally well-received by the public. The <i>Magazine of Art</i> described it as, &quot;...a striking contrast to the dull ugliness of the generality of our street sculpture, ... a work which, while beautifying one of our hitherto desolate open spaces, should do much towards the elevation of public taste in the direction of decorative sculpture, and serve freedom for the metropolis from any further additions of the old order of monumental monstrosities.&quot;&#39;<p>Technologically ground-breaking at the time, this statue was the first in the world to be cast in <a href="../../wp/a/Aluminium.htm" title="Aluminium">aluminium</a>. The statue originally pointed its bow to the north, up Shaftesbury Avenue. However, during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War the statue was removed for safe keeping, and when it was returned its bow was fixed pointing in to the south, towards Lower Regent Street.<p>The winged figure on the fountain is generally called <!--del_lnk--> Eros, is often supposed to be <!--del_lnk--> The Angel of Christian Charity, but was intended to be <!--del_lnk--> Anteros, a brother of Eros, and is recorded as such in the records of Westminster City Council. The sculptor <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Gilbert had already sculpted a statue of <!--del_lnk--> Anteros, when commissioned for the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, and chose to reproduce the same subject, who as &#39;The God of Selfless Love&#39; was deemed to suitably represent the philanthropic <!--del_lnk--> 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. Gilbert described <!--del_lnk--> Anteros as portraying &#39;reflective and mature love, as opposed to Eros or Cupid, the frivolous tyrant.&#39; The model for the sculpture was a 16-year-old Italian, whose name appears to have vanished from history. The fountain, when originally placed, was meant to have Anteros pointing his bow towards <!--del_lnk--> Wimborne Saint Giles in Dorset, which was the Earl&#39;s country seat.<p>When the memorial was unveiled, there were numerous complaints. Some felt it was sited in a vulgar part of town (the theatre district) and others felt that it was too sensual as a memorial for a famously sober and respectable Earl. Some of the objections were tempered by renaming the statue as The Angel of Christian Charity, which was the nearest approximation that could be invented in the Christian pantheon for the role of Anteros in the Greek. But the name never became widely known, and the original name came back, under the shortened form Eros, signifying the God of Sensual Love; quite inappropriate to commemorate the Earl, but just right to signify the carnal neighbourhood of London, into which Soho had developed.<p>The iconography deteriorated to the level where the memorial came to be seen as the lustful, half-naked Eros burying his shaft up Shaftesbury Avenue, absolutely typifying degenerate Soho. During his life-time Gilbert had already said of his sculpture &#39;There is more than &pound;3,000 worth of copper. take it down, melt it, and turn it into pence and give it to the unfortunate people who nightly find a resting place on the Thames Embankment, to the everlasting shame and disgrace of the greatest metropolis in the world&#39;.<p><a id="Criterion_Theatre" name="Criterion_Theatre"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Criterion Theatre</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Criterion Theatre, a grade II* <!--del_lnk--> listed building, stands on the south side of Piccadilly Circus. Apart from the box office area, the entire theatre, with nearly 600 seats, is underground and is reached by descending a tiled stairway. <!--del_lnk--> Columns are used to support both the dress circle and the upper circle, restricting the views of many of the seats inside.<p>The theatre was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Verity and opened as a theatre on <!--del_lnk--> March 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1874, although original plans were for it to become a concert hall. In 1883 it was forced to close to improve ventilation and to replace gaslights with electric lights, and was reopened the following year. The theatre closed in 1989 and was extensively refurbished, reopening in October 1992.<p><a id="London_Pavilion" name="London_Pavilion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">London Pavilion</span></h3>

      <p>On the north-eastern side of the Piccadilly Circus, on the corner between Shaftesbury Avenue and Coventry Street, is the <!--del_lnk--> London Pavilion. The first building bearing the name was built in 1859, and was a <!--del_lnk--> music hall. In 1885, Shaftesbury Avenue was built through the site of the Pavilion. A new London Pavilion was constructed, which also served as a music hall. In 1923, electric billboards were erected on the side of the building.<div class="thumb tright">

In 2000, the building was connected to the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Trocadero Centre, and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read &quot;London Trocadero.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> basement of the building connects with <!--del_lnk--> Piccadilly Circus tube station.<p><a id="Major_shops" name="Major_shops"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major shops</span></h3>
