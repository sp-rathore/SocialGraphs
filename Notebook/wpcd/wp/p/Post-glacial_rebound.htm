      <p><b>Post-glacial rebound</b> (sometimes called <b>continental rebound</b>, <b>isostatic rebound</b> or <b>isostatic adjustment</b>) is the rise of land masses that were depressed by the huge weight of <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a> during the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>, through a process known as <!--del_lnk--> isostatic depression. It affects northern Europe, especially <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia, <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> of Canada and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.<p>

      <p>By the end of the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a> about 11,000 years ago, much of northern <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> was covered by ice sheets up to 3&nbsp;km thick. The enormous weight of this ice caused the <a href="../../wp/c/Crust_%2528geology%2529.htm" title="Crust (geology)">crust</a> to sink into the fluid <!--del_lnk--> mantle. At the end of the ice age when the glaciers retreated, the removal of the weight from the depressed land led to a rapid uplift due to the buoyancy of crustal material relative to the mantle. Due to the extreme <!--del_lnk--> viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an <!--del_lnk--> equilibrium level.<p>Studies have shown that the uplift has taken place in two distinct stages. The initial uplift was rapid, proceeding at about 7.5&nbsp;cm/year. This phase lasted for about 2000 years, and took place as the ice was being unloaded. Once de-glaciation was complete, uplift slowed to about 2.5&nbsp;cm/year, and decreased <!--del_lnk--> exponentially after that. Today, typical uplift rates are of the order of 1&nbsp;cm/year or less, and studies suggest that rebound will continue for about another 10,000 years. The total uplift from the end of deglaciation will be about 400&nbsp;m.<p><a id="Effects" name="Effects"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Effects</span></h2>
      <p>Post-glacial rebound has caused numerous significant changes to coastlines and landscapes over the last several thousand years, and the effects continue to be significant. In <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, Lake <!--del_lnk--> M&auml;laren was formerly an arm of the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, but uplift eventually cut it off and led to it becoming a <!--del_lnk--> freshwater <!--del_lnk--> lake in about the 12th century, at the time then <a href="../../wp/s/Stockholm.htm" title="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> was founded at its outlet. Marine seashells found in <!--del_lnk--> Lake Ontario sediments imply a similar event in prehistoric times. In several Nordic ports, like <!--del_lnk--> Tornio, the harbour had to be relocated several times in the past centuries.<p>In <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, glaciation affected <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> but not Southern <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, and the post-glacial rebound of northern Great Britain is causing a corresponding downward movement of the southern half of the island <!--del_lnk--> . This is leading to an increased risk of <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">floods</a>, particularly in the areas surrounding the lower <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>. Along with rising sea levels caused by <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, the post-glacial sinking of southern <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> is likely to seriously compromise the effectiveness of the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Barrier, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s most important flood defence, after about <!--del_lnk--> 2030 <!--del_lnk--> .<p>The <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> lie approximately on the &#39;pivot&#39; line between rising and sinking land. <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Superior.htm" title="Lake Superior">Lake Superior</a> was formerly part of a much larger lake together with <!--del_lnk--> Lake Michigan and <!--del_lnk--> Lake Huron, but post-glacial rebound raised land dividing the three lakes about 2100 years ago. Today, southern shorelines of the lakes continue to experience rising water levels while northern shorelines see falling levels.<p>In <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> some of the most pronounced effects can be seen on the island of <!--del_lnk--> Oland, which has little topographic relief due to the presence of the very level <!--del_lnk--> Stora Alvaret. The rising land has caused the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> settlement area to recede from the <a href="../../wp/b/Baltic_Sea.htm" title="Baltic Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, making the present day villages on the west coast set back unexpectedly far from the shore. These effects are quite dramatic at the village of <!--del_lnk--> Alby, for example, where the <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> inhabitants were known to subsist on substantial coastal fishing.<p>Globally, post-glacial rebound was tending to make the earth more <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">spherical</a> over time. However, this effect has been reversed by other factors such as large scale movements of <a href="../../wp/o/Ocean.htm" title="Ocean">ocean</a> water caused by <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> and related effects.<p><a id="Legal_status" name="Legal_status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legal status</span></h2>
      <p>In areas where the rising of land is seen, it is necessary to define the exact limits of property. In Finland, the &quot;new land&quot; is legally the property of the owner of the water area, not any land owners on the shore. Therefore, paradoxically, if the owner of the land wishes to build a pier over the &quot;new land&quot;, he needs the permission of the owner of the water area.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound&quot;</div>
