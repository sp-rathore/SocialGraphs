      <p>Different species of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> varied in size and specific features of the <!--del_lnk--> skull and skeleton, but shared the same overall body shape. The best-known species, <i>P. mongoliensis</i>, reached 2&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> meters (6.5&nbsp;ft) in length. The maximum adult body weight was most likely over 20&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilograms (44&nbsp;lb) in <i>P. mongoliensis</i>.

      <p>The skull of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> was highly modified compared to other <a href="../../wp/o/Ornithischia.htm" title="Ornithischia">ornithischian</a> dinosaurs. The skull was extremely tall and short, with an almost round <!--del_lnk--> profile in some species. The portion in front of the <a href="../../wp/o/Orbit_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Orbit (anatomy)">orbit</a> (eye socket) was only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. Both upper and lower jaws sported a pronounced beak, formed from the <i>rostral</i> and <i>predentary</i> bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in <!--del_lnk--> keratin to provide a sharp cutting surface for cropping <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plant">plant</a> material. <i>Psittacosaurus</i> skulls shared several adaptations with more <!--del_lnk--> derived ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone at the tip of the upper jaw, and the widely flared <!--del_lnk--> jugal (cheek) bones. However, there was still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians.<p><i>Psittacosaurus</i> postcranial skeletons were much more typical of a &quot;basic&quot; bipedal ornithischian. In <i>P. mongoliensis</i>, similarly to other species, the forelimbs were only 58% as long as the hindlimbs, indicating that these animals were almost totally bipedal in life. There were only four digits on the hand, as opposed to the five fingers found in almost all other ornithischians (including more derived ceratopsians). Overall, the four-toed hindfoot was very similar to many other small ornithischians.<p>Like many psittacosaurs, <i>Psittacosaurus</i> had a remarkably deep skull, superficially like those of <a href="../../wp/p/Parrot.htm" title="Parrot">parrots</a>.<p><a id="Taxonomy" name="Taxonomy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Taxonomy</span></h2>
      <p><i>Psittacosaurus</i> was named in 1923 by <!--del_lnk--> Henry Fairfield Osborn, <!--del_lnk--> paleontologist and president of the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). The generic name is composed of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek words <b>&psi;&iota;&tau;&tau;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</b> (<i>psittakos</i>; &quot;parrot&quot;) and <b>&sigma;&alpha;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</b> (<i>sauros</i>; &quot;lizard&quot;), suggested by the superficially <a href="../../wp/p/Parrot.htm" title="Parrot">parrot</a>-like beak of these animals and their <a href="../../wp/r/Reptile.htm" title="Reptile">reptilian</a> nature.<p><a id="Species_of_Psittacosaurus" name="Species_of_Psittacosaurus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Species of <i>Psittacosaurus</i></span></h3>

      <p>Over a dozen species have been referred to the genus <i>Psittacosaurus</i>, although only eight to ten are considered valid today. This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are <i>monospecific</i>, containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to quirks of the fossil record. While <i>Psittacosaurus</i> is known from dozens of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> can be analyzed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most <!--del_lnk--> extant animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from <!--del_lnk--> bones and can only be evaluated from a <!--del_lnk--> morphological standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not be preserved in the fossil record. Therefore actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognized in this and other dinosaur genera.<ul>

      <p><i>Psittacosaurus</i> is the <!--del_lnk--> type genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Only one other genus, <i><!--del_lnk--> Hongshanosaurus</i>, is currently classified in this family alongside <i>Psittacosaurus</i>. Psittacosaurids were <!--del_lnk--> basal to almost all known ceratopsians except <i><!--del_lnk--> Yinlong</i> and perhaps <i><!--del_lnk--> Chaoyangsaurus</i>. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, <i>Psittacosaurus</i> itself was probably not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a <!--del_lnk--> plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the <i>antorbital fenestra</i>, an opening in the skull between the eye socket and <!--del_lnk--> nostril, was lost during the <a href="../../wp/e/Evolution.htm" title="Evolution">evolution</a> of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other <!--del_lnk--> archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would <!--del_lnk--> evolve a second time.<p><a id="Provenance" name="Provenance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Provenance</span></h2>
      <p><i>Psittacosaurus</i> is known from over 150 individual specimens, of which over 75 belong to the type species, <i>P. mongoliensis</i>. All <i>Psittacosaurus</i> fossils discovered so far have been found in <!--del_lnk--> Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia. The most common age of <!--del_lnk--> geologic formations bearing <i>Psittacosaurus</i> fossils is <!--del_lnk--> Aptian-<!--del_lnk--> Albian, or approximately 125 to 100 <!--del_lnk--> million years ago. However, specimens attributed to this genus have also been recovered from slightly older <!--del_lnk--> strata, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Yixian Formation, which is considered to date from the <!--del_lnk--> Hauterivian through <!--del_lnk--> Barremian stages of the Early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 136 to 125 million years ago. The genus may therefore have existed for more than 30 million years. Nearly all <!--del_lnk--> sedimentary formations of Barremian to Albian age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of <i>Psittacosaurus</i>, leading to its use as an index fossil for the region.<p><a id="Paleobiology" name="Paleobiology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Paleobiology</span></h2>
      <p><i>Psittacosaurus</i> is extremely well-known and represented by hundreds of specimens, allowing a more detailed analysis of its life history than is possible for the vast majority of dinosaurs.<p><a id="Diet" name="Diet"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Diet</span></h3>
      <p>Psittacosaurs had self-sharpening teeth that would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. However, unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used <!--del_lnk--> gastroliths, stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Gastroliths, sometimes numbering more than fifty, are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a <!--del_lnk--> gizzard, as in modern birds.<p><a id="Integument" name="Integument"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Integument</span></h3>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> integument, or body covering, of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> is known from a Chinese specimen, which most likely comes from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning. The specimen, which is not yet assigned to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by a <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> <!--del_lnk--> museum and arrangements are being made to return the specimen to China.<p>Most of the body was covered in <!--del_lnk--> scales. Larger scales were arranged in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Chasmosaurus</i>. However, a series of what appear to be hollow, tubular bristles, approximately 16&nbsp;centimeters (6.4&nbsp;in) long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the <!--del_lnk--> dorsal (upper) surface of the tail. The structures appear similar to the <a href="../../wp/f/Feather.htm" title="Feather">protofeathers</a> found on numerous <!--del_lnk--> theropod dinosaurs from the same formation, although they may or may not be <!--del_lnk--> homologous. As the structures are only found in a single row on the tail, it is unlikely that they were used for <!--del_lnk--> thermoregulation, but they may have been useful for <!--del_lnk--> communication through some sort of display.<p><a id="Growth_rate" name="Growth_rate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Growth rate</span></h3>

Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen. Adult <i>Psittacosaurus mongoliensis</i> approached 2&nbsp;meters (6.5&nbsp;ft) in length.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> histological examination of <i>P. mongoliensis</i> has determined the growth rate of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than 1&nbsp;kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb), while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost 20&nbsp;kilograms (44&nbsp;lb). This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and <!--del_lnk--> marsupial mammals, but slower than modern <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a> and <!--del_lnk--> placental mammals.<p><a id="Parental_Care" name="Parental_Care"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parental Care</span></h3>
      <p>An extremely well-preserved specimen found in the Yixian Formation of <!--del_lnk--> Liaoning Province, China provides some of the best evidence for parental care in dinosaurs. This specimen consists of an adult <i>Psittacosaurus</i> (not assigned to any particular species), which is closely associated with 34 articulated juvenile skeletons, all preserved in <!--del_lnk--> three dimensions. The young <i>Psittacosaurus</i>, all approximately the same age, are intertwined in a group underneath the adult, although all 34 skulls are positioned above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life. This suggests that the animals were alive at the time of burial, which must have been extremely rapid, perhaps due to the collapse of a <!--del_lnk--> burrow.<p>The juvenile bones are very small but are well-<!--del_lnk--> ossified. This has been taken as evidence of extensive parental care, as the young must have been in the nest long enough for their bones to become ossified. The sheer number of offspring in the nest suggest that they did not all belong to the preserved adult, indicating that <i>Psittacosaurus</i> may have engaged in some sort of communal <!--del_lnk--> nesting, perhaps similar to <a href="../../wp/o/Ostrich.htm" title="Ostrich">ostriches</a>. However, even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been <!--del_lnk--> precocial, although this does not rule out continued parental care.<p><a id="Predation" name="Predation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Predation</span></h3>
      <p>Another fossil from the Yixian Formation provides direct evidence of <i>Psittacosaurus</i> as a <!--del_lnk--> prey animal. One skeleton of <i><!--del_lnk--> Repenomamus giganticus</i>, a large, aquatic <!--del_lnk--> triconodont mammal, is preserved with the remains of a juvenile <i>Psittacosaurus</i> in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile&#39;s bones are still articulated, indicating that the <a href="../../wp/c/Carnivore.htm" title="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile <i>Psittacosaurus</i> may have resulted in <!--del_lnk--> R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.<p><a id="Related_Genera" name="Related_Genera"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Related Genera</span></h3>
