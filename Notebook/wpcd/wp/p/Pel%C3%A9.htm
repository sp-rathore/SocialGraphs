      <p><b>Edson Arantes do Nascimento</b>, <!--del_lnk--> KBE (born <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1940 in <!--del_lnk--> Tr&ecirc;s Cora&ccedil;&otilde;es, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>), best known by his nickname <b>Pel&eacute;</b>, is a former <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> player, and widely regarded to be the greatest of all time. In his native Brazil, Pel&eacute; is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments and contribution to the game,  in addition to being officially declared a national treasure by the Brazilian government. During his career, he became known as <b>&quot;The King of Football&quot;</b> (<i>O Rei do Futebol</i>) or simply <b>&quot;The King Pel&eacute;&quot;</b> (<i>O Rei Pel&eacute;</i>).<p>Spotted from a young age, Pel&eacute; began playing for <!--del_lnk--> Santos Futebol Clube at just 15, his national team at 16, and won his first World Cup at 17. He stayed loyal to his club, remaining with them for two decades until his semi-retirement in 1975, despite numerous offers from European clubs. Pel&eacute; played as an inside forward, <!--del_lnk--> striker, and what later became known as the <!--del_lnk--> playmaker position. Pel&eacute;&#39;s technique and natural athleticism have been universally praised; he was renowned for his brilliant dribbling and visionary passing, as well as his pace, powerful shot, and an exceptional heading ability.<p>He is the all-time top scorer in the history of the <!--del_lnk--> Brazil national team and is the only footballer ever to win three <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA_World_Cup.htm" title="FIFA World Cup">World Cup</a> titles as a player.<p>Since his full retirement in <!--del_lnk--> 1977 Pel&eacute; has been an ambassador for football and has also undertaken various <!--del_lnk--> acting roles and <!--del_lnk--> commercial ventures.<p>

</script><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
      <p>Born in Tr&ecirc;s Cora&ccedil;&otilde;es, <!--del_lnk--> Minas Gerais, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Fluminense footballer <!--del_lnk--> Dondinho (born Joao Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste. He was named after American inventor <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Edison.htm" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, and was originally nicknamed <b>Dico</b> by his family. He did not receive the <!--del_lnk--> nickname &quot;Pel&eacute;&quot; until his school days, when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favourite player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper <!--del_lnk--> Bil&eacute;, which he misspoke &quot;Pil&eacute;&quot;. He originally disliked the nickname, being suspended from school for punching the classmate that coined it, but the more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pel&eacute; stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends. Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bil&eacute;, the word has no known meaning, although it does resemble the <!--del_lnk--> Irish language word &#39;Peile&#39;, meaning football, and the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> word &#x5E4;&#x5B6;&#x5BC;&#x5DC;&#x5B6;&#x5D0;, meaning &quot;wonder&quot;.<p>Growing up in poverty in <!--del_lnk--> Bauru, <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Paulo, Pel&eacute; earned extra money by shining shoes at the <!--del_lnk--> Bauru Athletic Club on match days. Taught to play by his father, whose own professional football career with <!--del_lnk--> Atletico Mineiro ended prematurely due to a knee injury, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper, tied with a string or a <!--del_lnk--> grapefruit.<p>His first team was called the &quot;Shoeless Ones&quot; formed by himself and other boys from the Sete de Setembro and Rubens Arruda street but, when they entered a local tournament organised by the mayor of Bauru that required footwear, they were no longer shoeless and were renamed Ameriquinha. They reached the final in BAC Stadium in front of thousands of spectators and won with Pele ending up as the tournament top scorer.<p>In 1954, several members of the Ameriquinha team, including Pele, were invited to join the Baquinho boy&#39;s team to be managed by former Brazilian international Waldemar de Brito, who played in the 1934 World Cup in Italy. For the first time, Pele was paid to play football. The team won the 1954 Youth Championship organised by the newspapers Diario de Bauru and the S&atilde;o Paulo Sporting Gazette with Pele scoring 148 goals in 33 games.<p><a id="Club_career" name="Club_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Club career</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Santos" name="Santos"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Santos</span></h3>
      <p>In 1956, de Brito took Pel&eacute; to <!--del_lnk--> Santos, an industrial and port city in the eastern state of <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Paulo, to try out for professional club <!--del_lnk--> Santos Futebol Clube telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be &quot;the greatest football player in the world.&quot;<p><a id="National_team_career" name="National_team_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">National team career</span></h2>
      <p>Pel&eacute;&#39;s first international match was a 2-1 victory against <!--del_lnk--> Argentina on <!--del_lnk--> July 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1957. In that match, he scored his first goal for Brazil, three months before his 17th birthday.<p><a name="1958_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1958 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>His World Cup debut was against the <!--del_lnk--> USSR in the first round of the <!--del_lnk--> 1958 FIFA World Cup. He was the youngest player of that tournament, and at the time the youngest ever to play in the World Cup. He scored his first World Cup goal against <!--del_lnk--> Wales in quarterfinals, the only goal of the match, to help Brazil advance to semifinals, while becoming the youngest ever World Cup goalscorer at 17 years and 239 days. Against <!--del_lnk--> France in the semifinal, Brazil was leading 2-1 at halftime, and then Pel&eacute; scored a <!--del_lnk--> hat-trick, becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 19 June <!--del_lnk--> 1958 Pel&eacute; became the <!--del_lnk--> youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in the final as Brazil beat <!--del_lnk--> Sweden 5-2. His first goal, a lob over a defender followed by a precise volley shot, was selected as one of the <!--del_lnk--> best goals in the history of the World Cup. When the match ended, he passed out on the field, and had to be attended by the medical staff. He then recovered, and was visibly compelled by the victory, in tears as being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker <!--del_lnk--> Just Fontaine.<p><a name="1962_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1962 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>In the first match of the <!--del_lnk--> 1962 World Cup, against <!--del_lnk--> Mexico, Pel&eacute; assisted the first goal and then scored the final 2-0 after a run past four defenders. He injured himself while attempting a long-range shot against <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia. This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach <!--del_lnk--> Aymor&eacute; Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was <!--del_lnk--> Amarildo, who had a good performance in the tournament; it was, however, <!--del_lnk--> Garrincha, who would take the leading role and carried Brazil to their second World Cup title.<p><a name="1966_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1966 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> The 1966 tournament was remembered for its excessive physical play, and Pel&eacute; was one of the victims of such play. After becoming the first player ever to score in three World Cups, with a <!--del_lnk--> direct free kick against <!--del_lnk--> Bulgaria, he had to rest, due to tiredness, for the match against <!--del_lnk--> Hungary, which Brazil lost 1-3. He then faced <!--del_lnk--> Portugal, and several violent tackles by the Portuguese defenders caused him to leave the match and the tournament. Brazil lost that match and were eliminated in the first round of the World Cup for the first time since <!--del_lnk--> 1934. After the tournament, Pel&eacute; declared that he did not wish to play in the World Cup again.<p><a name="1970_World_Cup"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1970 World Cup</span></h3>
      <p>When Pel&eacute; was called to the national team in early <!--del_lnk--> 1969, he first refused, but then accepted and played in six <!--del_lnk--> World Cup qualifying matches, scoring six goals. <!--del_lnk--> The 1970 tournament in <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> was to be Pel&eacute;&#39;s last.<p>The 1970 squad featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad. Players like <!--del_lnk--> Garrincha, <!--del_lnk--> Nilton Santos, <!--del_lnk--> Djalma Santos, and <!--del_lnk--> Gilmar had already retired, but the team, with Pel&eacute;, <!--del_lnk--> Rivelino, <!--del_lnk--> Jairzinho, <!--del_lnk--> G&eacute;rson, <!--del_lnk--> Tost&atilde;o, and <!--del_lnk--> Clodoaldo, is widely considered one of the greatest football teams ever.<p>In the first match, against Czechoslovakia, Pel&eacute; scored the 2-1 after controlling Gerson&#39;s pass with his chest. Brazil won the match, 4-1. On the first half of the match against <!--del_lnk--> England, he nearly scored with a header that was spectacularly saved by <!--del_lnk--> Gordon Banks. On the second half, he assisted <!--del_lnk--> Jairzinho for the only goal of the match. Against <!--del_lnk--> Romania, he opened the score on a direct free kick goal, a strong strike with the outside of his right foot. Later on the match he scored again to put the score 3-1. Brazil won by a final score of 3-2. In quarterfinals against Peru, Brazil won 4-2, with Pel&eacute; assisting Tost&atilde;o on his team&#39;s third goal. In the semi-finals, Brazil faced <!--del_lnk--> Uruguay for the first time since the <!--del_lnk--> 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2-1, and Pel&eacute; assisted Rivelino for the 3-1. In that match, Pel&eacute; hit <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguayan</a> player Fontes with his elbow, at the same time the latter was fouling Pel&eacute;.<p>Brazil played <!--del_lnk--> Italy in the final, with Pel&eacute; scoring the opener on a header over defender <!--del_lnk--> Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Jairzinho&#39;s and <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Alberto&#39;s goals, the latter one after an impressive collective play. Brazil won the match 4-1, keeping the <!--del_lnk--> Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely. Burgnich, who marked Pel&eacute; during the match, was quoted saying &quot;I told myself before the game, <i>he&#39;s made of skin and bones just like everyone else</i> &mdash; but I was wrong&quot;.<p>His last international match was on <!--del_lnk--> July 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1971 against <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslavia in <a href="../../wp/r/Rio_de_Janeiro.htm" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. His record with the Brazilian team was 67 wins, 14 draws, and 11 losses. Brazil never lost a match with both Pel&eacute; and <!--del_lnk--> Garrincha on the field.<p><a id="Honours" name="Honours"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Honours</span></h2>

      <p>He was voted <i>Athlete of the Century</i> by the <!--del_lnk--> International Olympic Committee in 1999 for his Olympic successes.<p>In December 2000, Pel&eacute; was named <i>Footballer of the Century</i> by <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>. The award was intended to be based upon votes in a web poll, but after it became apparent that it favoured <a href="../../wp/d/Diego_Maradona.htm" title="Diego Maradona">Diego Maradona</a>, many observers complained that the internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play, but not Pele. FIFA then appointed a &quot;Family of Football&quot; committee of soccer experts to decide the winner of the award. Maradona was instead awarded the title of <i>FIFA Internet Player of the Century</i>. Allegations that the internet poll had been bombarded by Argentine fans still remain to this day.<p>In the same year, Pel&eacute; received the <!--del_lnk--> Laureus World Sports Awards Lifetime Achievement Award from <!--del_lnk--> South African President <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>.<p><a id="Career_Statistics" name="Career_Statistics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career Statistics</span></h2>

      <p>Pel&eacute;&#39;s goalscoring record is often reported as being 1281 goals in 1363 games. This figure includes goals scored by Pel&eacute; in non-competitive club matches, for example, international tours Pel&eacute; completed with Santos and the New York Cosmos, and games Pel&eacute; played in for armed forces teams during his national service in Brazil.<p>The tables below record every goal Pel&eacute; scored in major club competitions for Santos and the New York Cosmos. During much of Pel&eacute;&#39;s playing career in Brazil there was no national league championship. From 1960 onwards the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) were required to provide <!--del_lnk--> meritocratic entrants for the then-new <!--del_lnk--> Copa Libertadores, a South American international club competition broadly equivalent to the <!--del_lnk--> European Cup. To enable them to do this, the CBF organised two national competitions: the <!--del_lnk--> Ta&ccedil;a de Prata and <!--del_lnk--> Ta&ccedil;a Brasil. A national league championship, the <!--del_lnk--> Campeonato Brasileiro, was first played in 1971, alongside traditional state and interstate competitions such as the <!--del_lnk--> Campeonato Paulista and the <!--del_lnk--> Torneio Rio-S&atilde;o Paulo.<p>The number of league goals scored by Pel&eacute; is listed as 589 in 605 games. This number is the sum of the goals scored by Pel&eacute; in national <!--del_lnk--> league-based competitions: the Campeonato Paulista (SPS), Torneio Rio-S&atilde;o Paulo (RSPS), Ta&ccedil;a de Prata and Campeonato Brasileiro. The Ta&ccedil;a Brasil was a national competition organised on a <!--del_lnk--> knockout basis.<p><small><i>A dark grey cell in the table indicates that the relevant competition did not take place that year.</i></small><table class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;">

      <p>Pel&eacute; is in third place on the list of <!--del_lnk--> all-time top goalscorers in international matches; in 92 appearances for the <!--del_lnk--> Brazilian team, he scored 77 goals. He is in fourth place behind <!--del_lnk--> Ronaldo, <!--del_lnk--> Gerd M&uuml;ller, and <!--del_lnk--> Just Fontaine on the list of <!--del_lnk--> goalscorers in World Cup matches, with 12 goals. He was part of three World Cup winning teams, although he did not play in the 1962 final due to injury and did not receive a medal. Pel&eacute; is one of only four footballers to have achieved the feat of scoring in two different world cup final matches, sharing that honour with <!--del_lnk--> Paul Breitner, <!--del_lnk--> Vava, and <!--del_lnk--> Zinedine Zidane. He is one of five players to have scored twice from <!--del_lnk--> direct free kick in World Cups (The others are <!--del_lnk--> Rivelino, <!--del_lnk--> Te&oacute;filo Cubillas, <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Genghini, and <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a>). He is one of only two players to have scored in four World Cups (the other being <!--del_lnk--> Uwe Seeler, who did it in the same four tournaments as Pel&eacute;).<p>It is often claimed that Pel&eacute; is the most prolific scorer in football history. According to <a href="../../wp/f/FIFA.htm" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>, Pel&eacute; ended his career with a total of 1281 goals in 1363 matches. However, many of these goals were scored in non-competitive club matches. For instance, if one counts non-competitive goals when compiling the total of goals scored by <!--del_lnk--> Gerd M&uuml;ller, he would have a career total of 1455 goals in 1204 games. As non-competitive games are rarely counted in player&#39;s statistics it is unknown how many players could have passed Pel&eacute;&#39;s mark, but 1281 goals is certainly one of the highest totals achieved by a professional footballer. If one looks only at competitive goals, then Pel&eacute; is the third highest scorer of all time behind <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Friedenreich and <!--del_lnk--> Josef Bican. Bican never attempted to draw attention to his record, and when questioned about this, he quipped &quot;who&#39;d have believed me if I said I&#39;d scored five times as many goals as Pel&eacute;?&quot;<p>Although the Brazilian domestic league system provided every single starter from the 1958, 1962, and 1970 Brazil World Cup Champions, perhaps leading one to the assumption that it was the world&#39;s strongest league during the years of Pel&eacute;&#39;s career, one also has to take into account the state nature of the league. At the time Santos mainly played against other teams from the <!--del_lnk--> S&atilde;o Paulo region, whereas the best players were spread around teams all across Brazil. For instance Garrincha, <!--del_lnk--> Jairzinho and <!--del_lnk--> Altair played in the <!--del_lnk--> Rio de Janeiro League, <!--del_lnk--> Tost&atilde;o played in the <!--del_lnk--> Minas Gerais League, and of the players that actually competed in S&atilde;o Paulo, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Alberto, <!--del_lnk--> Zito, <!--del_lnk--> Pepe and <!--del_lnk--> Gilmar actually played with Pele for Santos. As of 2006, teams from S&atilde;o Paulo state have won 14 of a possible 36 national league titles (see <!--del_lnk--> Titles by state).<p><a id="After_football" name="After_football"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">After football</span></h2>

      <p>The most notable area of Pel&eacute;&#39;s life since football is his ambassadorial work for various bodies. In 1992, Pel&eacute; was appointed a <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> ambassador for ecology and the environment.<p>He was awarded Brazil&#39;s Gold Medal for outstanding services to the sport, and in 1995, Brazilian <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pel&eacute; to the position of &quot;Extraordinary Minister for Sport&quot;. During this time he proposed legislation to reduce corruption in Brazilian football, which became known as the <i>Pel&eacute; law</i>. When finally approved in 2000, the bill contained just 11% of the original text, causing Pel&eacute; to state that he wanted his name removed from it.
