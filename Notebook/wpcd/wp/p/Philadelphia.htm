      <p>Before Europeans arrived, the <!--del_lnk--> Delaware (Lenape) Indian town of <!--del_lnk--> Shackamaxon was located where Philadelphia now stands, specifically the <!--del_lnk--> Germantown neighbourhood. Although the area lay within the bounds described in the <!--del_lnk--> 1632 Charter of <!--del_lnk--> Maryland, the <!--del_lnk--> Calvert family&#39;s influence never reached this far north, and the first European settlers were mostly Swedes (see <!--del_lnk--> New Sweden), who called it Wiccacoa. A congregation was formed in <!--del_lnk--> 1646 on Tinicum Island by Swedish missionary Johannes Campanius; in <!--del_lnk--> 1700, the group built Gloria Dei Church, also known as <i>Old Swedes&#39;</i>.<p>Philadelphia is a <!--del_lnk--> planned city, founded and developed in <!--del_lnk--> 1682 by <!--del_lnk--> William Penn, a <!--del_lnk--> Quaker. The city&#39;s name means &quot;brotherly love&quot; in Greek (&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&alpha;&delta;&#x3AD;&lambda;&phi;&iota;&alpha;). Penn hoped that the city, as the capital of his <!--del_lnk--> new colony founded on principles of freedom and religious tolerance, would be a model of this philosophy. During early immigration by Quakers and others, immigrants who purchased land in the city also received farmland outside the city; this was intended to allow the population to leave the city easily. Penn also mandated the construction of alleyways and open spaces, in the hope of controlling fires and disease, which were then common problems in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and other major cities.<p><a id="New_Nation" name="New_Nation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">New Nation</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of Independence and <!--del_lnk--> US Constitution were drafted here and signed in the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Independence Hall. <!--del_lnk--> Tun Tavern in the city is traditionally regarded as the location where, in 1775, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Marine Corps was founded.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> Philadelphia&#39;s population was split between <!--del_lnk--> Loyalists and <!--del_lnk--> Patriots. When the British Army <!--del_lnk--> took the city in 1777 many <!--del_lnk--> Loyalists lined the streets and sang &#39;God Save the King&#39;. Upon the retaking of the city for the American cause in 1778 it was the turn of the Patriot population to line the streets in celebration, especially as the population had suffered through a bitter winter with many of the provisions going to the British Army. The British left a mess, says historian Allan Nevins:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 369.4 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; (142.6 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;). 349.9 km&sup2; (135.1 mi&sup2;) of it is land and 19.6 km&sup2; (7.6 mi&sup2;) of it (5.29%) is water. Bodies of water include the <!--del_lnk--> Delaware River, <!--del_lnk--> Schuylkill River, <!--del_lnk--> Cobbs Creek, <!--del_lnk--> Wissahickon Creek, and <!--del_lnk--> Pennypack Creek.<p>The lowest point in the city lies 10 feet above sea level near <!--del_lnk--> Fort Mifflin in <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Philadelphia at the convergence of the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers. The highest point is in <!--del_lnk--> Chestnut Hill, at 432 feet above sea level, near Evergreen Place, just north and west of Evergreen Avenue.<p>The counties adjacent to Philadelphia are <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery County to the north; <!--del_lnk--> Bucks County to the northeast; <!--del_lnk--> Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; <!--del_lnk--> Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; <!--del_lnk--> Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and <!--del_lnk--> Delaware County to the west.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Philadelphia&#39;s climate is considered to fall in the <!--del_lnk--> humid subtropical climate zone, although it is perhaps the northernmost city in the United States that meets this classification. Because Philadelphia is on the far northern end of this climate zone, some of its outlying suburbs, especially to the north and west, are considered to fall in the <!--del_lnk--> humid continental zone. Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cold, although infrequently very cold. Precipitation is almost uniformly distributed throughout the year.<p>January lows average 25 &deg;F (-4 &deg;C) and highs average 39 &deg;F (4 &deg;C). The lowest officially recorded temperature was -11 &deg;F (-24 &deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> February 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1934, but temperatures below 14 &deg;F are not common. July lows average 70 &deg;F (21 &deg;C) and highs average 86&deg; F (30 &deg;C), although heat waves see highs above 95 &deg;F (35 &deg;C) with the heat index running as high as 110 &deg;F (43 &deg;C). The highest temperature on record was 106 &deg;F (41 &deg;C) on <!--del_lnk--> August 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1918. Early fall and late winter are generally driest, with February being the driest month with only 2.74 in (69.8 mm) of average precipitation.<p>Snowfall is variable, with some winters bringing light snow and others bringing many significant snowstorms. It is common for the heavier snowfall to occur <!--del_lnk--> north and <!--del_lnk--> west of the city, where the climate is slightly colder. Rainfall is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month, at an average annual rate of 42 in (1068 mm).<p><a id="Cityscape" name="Cityscape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cityscape</span></h3>

      <p>Penn&#39;s surveyor, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Holme, laid out the city in a strict <!--del_lnk--> grid, with streets running either north-south or east-west. The north-south streets are numbered in ascending order from Front (instead of First), along the <!--del_lnk--> Delaware River, with the main north-south thoroughfare, <!--del_lnk--> Broad Street (instead of 14th) running midway between the two rivers. The east-west streets, many of them named for trees, e.g., <a href="../../wp/c/Chestnut.htm" title="Chestnut">Chestnut</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Walnut, <!--del_lnk--> Locust, and <!--del_lnk--> Spruce parallel the main thoroughfare named High Street by Penn, but called Market Street since at least the early 18th century. Six blocks south of Market is <!--del_lnk--> South Street, the original southern boundary of the city. Vine Street, three blocks north of Market, was the original northern boundary.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Holme also planned five public parks, one at the intersection of High and Broad Streets in the very centre of the city, now occupied by <!--del_lnk--> City Hall, and four others surrounding it now called <!--del_lnk--> Washington Square, <!--del_lnk--> Rittenhouse Square, <!--del_lnk--> Logan Square and <!--del_lnk--> Franklin Square. The eastern edge of Rittenhouse Square is on 18th St., four blocks west of City Hall, while the western edge of Washington Square is between 7th and 8th, about six and a half blocks east of City Hall. Both are the same distance south of City Hall. Both Logan Square and Franklin Square are located the same distances east and west of City Hall as Washington and Rittenhouse and two to three blocks north of Market Street, reflecting the southern squares. <!--del_lnk--> Fairmount Park is one of the largest municipal public parks in the world, at over 9,100 acres (37 km&sup2;). This figure includes all parkland within the city limits, as all 65 city parks are considered part of Fairmount Park and overseen by the Fairmount Park Commission, but the park proper, which runs north/south through the city, does occupy nearly half that area, at over 4,100 acres (17 km&sup2;) on both banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Schuylkill River and <!--del_lnk--> Wissahickon Creek.<p>The post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> era would see further changes. Under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Edmund N. Bacon, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission organized a master plan for the city, creating a variety of special planning, redevelopment, development districts and areas to coordinate their efforts. Projects that were headed by the new master plan were major redevelopment of Center City, including the Penn Centre Area (replacing an immense, elevated railroad connector, locally known as the &quot;Chinese Wall,&quot; located north of Market and West of Broad), Market East and Penn&#39;s Landing; new development and expansion in <!--del_lnk--> University City (focused mainly on the <!--del_lnk--> University of Pennsylvania); as well as the opening up of development on the fringes of the city, the Far Northeast and South Philadelphia Sports Complex. One of his enduring innovations is a group of small, semi-enclosed parks in the Society Hill residential area, connected by brick footpaths.<p>Bacon&#39;s efforts would also see changes in the transportation of the city, with the inclusion of the Centre City Rail Connector, <!--del_lnk--> Vine Street Expressway, Delaware Expressway, and improvements to the <!--del_lnk--> Schuylkill Expressway. Many of Bacon&#39;s ideas, though not entirely as he had envisioned, can be seen today, with the basis of his master plan still influencing development in the city.<p><a id="Buildings_and_architecture" name="Buildings_and_architecture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Buildings and architecture</span></h3>

      <p>Philadelphia&#39;s architectural history dates back to <!--del_lnk--> Colonial times and has included a wide range of styles, sometimes showcased within a range of several blocks. Most of the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> historic landmarks are in <!--del_lnk--> Old City and the Historical District in the <!--del_lnk--> Society Hill neighborhood east of Centre City, including Independence National Historical Park, home of <!--del_lnk--> Independence Hall and the <!--del_lnk--> Liberty Bell.<p>For almost a century, Philadelphia&#39;s most visible structure was its <!--del_lnk--> baroque <!--del_lnk--> City Hall building and William Penn tower. Begun in 1871, City Hall took 30 years to complete and is the tallest masonry load-bearing structure in the world at 548 feet, including the statue of <!--del_lnk--> William Penn at its crown.<p>The former headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS), at the corner of 12th and Market Streets, erected in <!--del_lnk--> 1932, is widely considered the nation&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> International Modernist <!--del_lnk--> skyscraper. The building was designed by Swiss-American architect <!--del_lnk--> William Lescaze and his partner <!--del_lnk--> George Howe. The building is a National Historic Landmark. In 1997, the building was purchased by the <!--del_lnk--> Loews Corporation, and in April 2000 it reopened as the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. The signature PSFS sign, however, is considered an integral part of the historic architectural design and remains atop the building.<p>Notable historic structures demolished in recent years include the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Civic Centre and <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Naval Hospital (both commonly regarded as masterpieces of 1930&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco architecture), <!--del_lnk--> JFK Stadium, a historic 1920&#39;s era athletic venue, and the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Commercial Museum, an 1890&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> neoclassical exhibit hall. Other important historic sites, including the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera House, and even the famous <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Museum of Art and <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia City Hall, have suffered from decades of neglect and poor upkeep.  A complete exterior cleaning of City Hall is nearing completion, and renovations, expansion and repairs are planned at the Museum of Art.<p>Urban abandonment in the central city and extensive sprawl in the suburbs has been a serious problem since the 1970&#39;s. By the 1990&#39;s there were an estimated 40,000 vacant properties in the city <!--del_lnk--> . Since then organizations and city agencies have been working to reverse this trend. Recently the city and several non-profit organizations put together an international competition, called <!--del_lnk--> LandVISIONS seeking solutions to the vacancy problem.<p>Since the 1980s, modern skyscrapers have been erected west of City Hall eclipsing Penn&#39;s statue. As of 2006, the tallest structures are <!--del_lnk--> One and <!--del_lnk--> Two Liberty Place. In <!--del_lnk--> 2007, the <!--del_lnk--> Comcast Centre, upon its expected completion, will become the tallest building in Philadelphia. Currently, thirteen skyrises, residential and commercial, are under construction, six have begun prep work, and seventeen are still in planning. Also nine skyrises are currently under renovation, and seven more are still in planning. Many of these projects will include multiple skyrises, adding to the number of actual buildings. Another seven cultural and commercial projects have begun, which consist of a slot facility, turning the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Naval Yard into a suburban style business park with urban amenities, new parks, educational towers, state of the art schools, and others. Another ten are in planning.<p>Most of the city&#39;s residential neighborhoods are <!--del_lnk--> rowhouse communities, noted for streets lined with attached, single-family homes. Newer <!--del_lnk--> duplexes and single homes, as well as some older mansions and estates, are more common in the city&#39;s outskirts.<p><a id="Neighborhoods" name="Neighborhoods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Neighborhoods</span></h3>
      <p>Philadelphia has many neighborhoods, each of which has its own identity. Many of these neighborhoods coincide with the borough and townships that made up Philadelphia County before their absorption by the city. These include <!--del_lnk--> Chestnut Hill, <!--del_lnk--> East Falls, <!--del_lnk--> Fishtown, <!--del_lnk--> Lawncrest, <!--del_lnk--> Fox Chase, <!--del_lnk--> Frankford, <!--del_lnk--> Germantown, <!--del_lnk--> Grays Ferry, <!--del_lnk--> Kensington, <!--del_lnk--> Manayunk, <!--del_lnk--> Mount Airy, <!--del_lnk--> North Philadelphia, <!--del_lnk--> Northern Liberties, <!--del_lnk--> Olney, <!--del_lnk--> Overbrook, <!--del_lnk--> Parkside, <!--del_lnk--> Parkwood, <!--del_lnk--> Port Richmond, <!--del_lnk--> Powelton Village, <!--del_lnk--> Queen Village, <!--del_lnk--> Roxborough, <!--del_lnk--> South Philadelphia, <!--del_lnk--> University City, <!--del_lnk--> West Oak Lane, and many others. Prominent neighborhoods in Centre City include <!--del_lnk--> Chinatown, <!--del_lnk--> Fairmount, <!--del_lnk--> Old City, <!--del_lnk--> Rittenhouse Square, <!--del_lnk--> Washington Square West and <!--del_lnk--> Society Hill.<p><a id="Suburbs" name="Suburbs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Suburbs</span></h3>
      <p>Philadelphia has a significant <!--del_lnk--> suburban area which depends on its <!--del_lnk--> economy and <!--del_lnk--> public transportation (provided by <!--del_lnk--> SEPTA), including areas of southeastern Pennsylvania (including the historic <!--del_lnk--> Main Line), <!--del_lnk--> southern New Jersey, and northern <!--del_lnk--> Delaware. Various Philadelphia area television stations sometimes consider a wide range of areas as suburbs of Philadelphia, including the New Jersey shore as far north as <!--del_lnk--> Monmouth County and as far south as <!--del_lnk--> Cape May, as well as southern <!--del_lnk--> Delaware. Pennsylvania areas which are sometimes considered as distant suburbs or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> exurbs&quot; of Philadelphia include <!--del_lnk--> Berks County, the <!--del_lnk--> Lehigh Valley (<!--del_lnk--> Lehigh County and <!--del_lnk--> Northampton County), <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster County, and even the southern most region of the <!--del_lnk--> Poconos, including parts of <!--del_lnk--> Monroe County and <!--del_lnk--> Carbon County. <!--del_lnk--> Cecil County, Maryland, which I-95 runs through, is also sometimes included as a Philadelphia exurb. The Philadelphia suburbs are home to some of the most affluent counties in the United States.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

Males had a median income of $34,199 versus $28,477 for females. The <!--del_lnk--> per capita income for the city was $16,509. About 18.4% of families and 22.9% of the population were below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line, including 31.3% of those under age 18 and 16.9% of those age 65 or over.<p>The ethnic makeup of the city is 43.2% <!--del_lnk--> African American, 13.5% <!--del_lnk--> Irish, 9.2% <!--del_lnk--> Italian, 8.1% <!--del_lnk--> German, 7.8% <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rican</a>, and 4.3% <!--del_lnk--> Polish.<p>Philadelphia has the second largest <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_people.htm" title="Irish people">Irish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Italian, and <!--del_lnk--> Jamaican populations, the third largest <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rican population, and the fourth largest <!--del_lnk--> African American population in the nation.

      <p>Like many American cities, Philadelphia saw a gradual, yet pronounced, rise in crime in the years following World War II. Murders peaked at 503 in <!--del_lnk--> 1990, for a rate of 31.5 per 100,000, and they averaged around 400 a year for most of the nineties. In <!--del_lnk--> 2002 the murder count hit a low of 288, but by <!--del_lnk--> 2005 the annual total had surged to 380, for a rate of 25.85 per 100,000.<p>According to <!--del_lnk--> statistics from 2004, there were 5,513.5 crimes per 100,000 people in Philadelphia. In <!--del_lnk--> 2005, going by these statistics, Philadelphia was ranked by Morgan Quitno as the <!--del_lnk--> 6th most-dangerous American city with a population of over 500,000, out of a total of 32 such cities. Among its neighboring Northeastern cities in the same population group, <a href="../../wp/b/Baltimore%252C_Maryland.htm" title="Baltimore, Maryland">Baltimore</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> were ranked second- and third- most dangerous cities in the U.S. respectively, and <!--del_lnk--> Camden, New Jersey, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was ranked as the number one most dangerous city in the U.S. <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> made the safest-city list, coming in at number four. In 2006, the Philadelphia crime rate, especially murder, has increased to the point where local television stations are having special reports on the issue,  and the police are attempting to stop the trend with special programs. The Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper now reports the 2006 homicide count relative to the same date in 2005 in every day&#39;s issue.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>From a governmental perspective, Philadelphia County is a <!--del_lnk--> legal nullity, as all county functions were assumed by the city in <!--del_lnk--> 1952, which has been coterminous with the county since <!--del_lnk--> 1854.<p>The city is headed by an elected <!--del_lnk--> mayor who is limited to two consecutive four-year terms but can run for the position again after an intervening term. The incumbent is former <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia City Council President <!--del_lnk--> John F. Street, elected in 1999 and re-elected by a larger majority in 2003. He is a <!--del_lnk--> Democrat, as have been all Philadelphia mayors since 1952.<p>The legislative branch, the Philadelphia City Council, consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at large. The current council president is <!--del_lnk--> Anna C. Verna.<p>The Philadelphia County <!--del_lnk--> Court of Common Pleas, also known as the Court of Common Pleas for the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, is the <!--del_lnk--> trial court of general jurisdiction for Philadelphia. It is funded and operated largely by city resources and employees.<p>The Philadelphia <!--del_lnk--> Municipal Court handles matters of limited jurisdiction as well as landlord-tenant disputes, appeals from traffic court, preliminary examinations for felony-level offenses, and the like. <!--del_lnk--> Traffic Court is a court of special jurisdiction that hears violations of traffic laws.<p>Pennsylvania&#39;s three <!--del_lnk--> appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia City Hall. Also, the <!--del_lnk--> Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania sit in Philadelphia several times a year. Judges for these courts are elected at large. Each court has a <!--del_lnk--> prothonotary&#39;s office in Philadelphia as well.<p>From the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> until the mid-20th Century, Philadelphia was a bastion of the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party, which arose from the staunch pro-Northern views of Philadelphia residents during and after the war. After the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, Democratic registrations increased, but the city was not carried by <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in his landslide victory of 1932 (in which Pennsylvania was one of the few states won by <a href="../../wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>). While other Northern industrial cities were electing Democratic mayors in the 1930s and 1940s, Philadelphia did not follow suit until 1951. That is, Philadelphia never had a &quot;New Deal&quot; coalition.<p>The city has voted for a Democrat in every presidential election since <!--del_lnk--> 1936, despite the frequent election of Republicans to statewide offices since the 1930s; in 2004, Democrat <!--del_lnk--> John Kerry drew 80% of the city&#39;s vote, and it is generally believed that his margin of victory in Philadelphia was enough for him to carry Pennsylvania.<p>Philadelphia was once split between six <!--del_lnk--> congressional districts. However, as a result of the city&#39;s declining population, it is now split between four--the 1st, represented by Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Bob Brady, the 2nd, represented by Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Chaka Fattah, the 8th, represented by Republican <!--del_lnk--> Michael Fitzpatrick, and the 16th, represented by Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Allyson Schwartz. A Republican has not represented a significant portion of Philadelphia since the 1950s; Fitzpatrick only represented a small portion of the city until his defeat in the 2006 elections by Democrat <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Murphy.<p>As of <!--del_lnk--> November 2006, there are 1,016,187 registered voters in Philadelphia <!--del_lnk--> .<ul>

      <p>Philadelphia has become notable in various arts and in culture. Philadelphia has had a prominent role in <!--del_lnk--> music including a Philadelphia own sound known as <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia soul. On July 13, 1985, Philadelphia hosted the American end of the <!--del_lnk--> Live Aid concert at <!--del_lnk--> JFK Stadium. On July 2, 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Bob Geldof, who organized the Live Aid concert, chose Philadelphia as the American host of his huge <!--del_lnk--> Live 8 concert. This time the show was held as a free concert on the <!--del_lnk--> Ben Franklin Parkway, where over 800,000 people showed up for the global supershow. The city is home to many art galleries, many of which participate in the First Friday event. The first Friday of every month galleries in Old City are open late and for free. Annual events include film festivals and parades, the most famous being <!--del_lnk--> New Year&#39;s Day <!--del_lnk--> Mummers Parade.

      <p>Philadelphia has a long and proud history of professional sports teams, and is one of thirteen United States cities to have <!--del_lnk--> all four major sports. Specifically, Philadelphia is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Eagles of the <!--del_lnk--> National Football League, the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Phillies in the <!--del_lnk--> National League of <!--del_lnk--> Major League Baseball, the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Flyers of the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Hockey_League.htm" title="National Hockey League">National Hockey League</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia 76ers in the <!--del_lnk--> National Basketball Association. The last major professional sport team to win a championship was the 76ers, which won the <!--del_lnk--> NBA Championship in 1983. The failure of Philadelphia&#39;s major professional sports teams to win championships since that date is sometimes attributed, in jest, to the so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Curse of Billy Penn&quot;.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Interstate 95 (I-95), which runs through the city along the Delaware River, is the main north-south artery.<p>The city is also served by the <!--del_lnk--> Schuylkill Expressway, a portion of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 76 that runs along the <!--del_lnk--> Schuylkill River. It meets the <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania Turnpike at <!--del_lnk--> King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, providing access to <!--del_lnk--> Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and points west.

In recent years, it has become a traffic bottleneck, and includes the second and third deadliest intersections in the U.S. within a single mile, according to a study by <!--del_lnk--> State Farm Insurance.<p>The Woodhaven Road (<!--del_lnk--> PA Route 63), built in 1966, serves the neighborhoods of <!--del_lnk--> Northeast Philadelphia, running between <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 95 and the <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt Boulevard (<!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 1). Plans to extend it westward into the suburbs were quashed by community opposition when the highway was first built. Severe traffic congestion over the past four decades on adjoining Byberry Road has led to renewed plans for extension and expansion. Several suggested plans would expand different roads using different methods to connect to the highway. A final decision has not yet been reached, and undoubtedly the construction phase will continue for several years after the planning stage is completed.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the <!--del_lnk--> Delaware River to <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey: the <!--del_lnk--> Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and <!--del_lnk--> US 30), the <!--del_lnk--> Betsy Ross Bridge (<!--del_lnk--> Route 90), and the <!--del_lnk--> Commodore Barry Bridge (<!--del_lnk--> US 322).

In addition to &quot;subway-surface&quot; trolleys (so called because during the years when the city was served by over 2000 trolleys and more than 65 lines, these were the &quot;surface&quot; cars that ran also in the streetcar subway), the city recently reintroduced trolley service to the <!--del_lnk--> Girard Avenue Line, Route 15, considered by some a &quot;heritage&quot; line; although the use of rebuilt <!--del_lnk--> 1947 PCC streetcars was primarily for budgetary reasons, rather than as an historic tribute.<p>Today Philadelphia is a hub of the semi-nationalized <a href="../../wp/a/Amtrak.htm" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> system, with 30th Street Station being the primary local stop on the Washington-Boston <!--del_lnk--> Northeast Corridor and the <!--del_lnk--> Keystone Corridor to <!--del_lnk--> Harrisburg and <!--del_lnk--> Pittsburgh, <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad&#39;s former <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania Main Line to <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. 30th Street is Amtrak&#39;s third-busiest station in terms of passengers as of <!--del_lnk--> fiscal year 2003.

      <p>Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. Dedicated in June 1976, the Sister Cities Plaza, a one-half-acre site located at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway, honours Philadelphia&#39;s relationships with <!--del_lnk--> Tel-Aviv, Israel and <!--del_lnk--> Florence, Italy, which were its first Sister Cities. Another landmark, the Torun Triangle, honoring the Sister City relationship with <!--del_lnk--> Toru&#x144;, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Fund building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Triangle contains the Copernicus monument. The Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of <!--del_lnk--> Tianjin, China, stands astride the intersection of 10th and Arch Streets as an elaborate and colorful symbol of the Sister City relationship.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia&quot;</div>
