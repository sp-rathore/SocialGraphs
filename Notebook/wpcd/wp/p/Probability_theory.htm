      <p><b>Probability theory</b> is a branch of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> concerned with analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory are <!--del_lnk--> random variables, <!--del_lnk--> stochastic processes, and <!--del_lnk--> events: mathematical abstractions of <!--del_lnk--> non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion. As a mathematical foundation for <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a>, probability theory is essential to most human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in <!--del_lnk--> statistical mechanics. A great discovery of twentieth century <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at microscopic scales, described in <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>The mathematical theory of <!--del_lnk--> probability has its roots in attempts to analyse <!--del_lnk--> games of chance by <!--del_lnk--> Girolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century, and by <!--del_lnk--> Pierre de Fermat and <a href="../../wp/b/Blaise_Pascal.htm" title="Blaise Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> in the seventeenth century. Although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event, if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns, which can be studied and predicted. Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the <!--del_lnk--> law of large numbers and the <!--del_lnk--> central limit theorem.<p>Initially, probability theory mainly considered <b>discrete</b> events, and its methods were mainly <!--del_lnk--> combinatorial. Eventually, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematical_analysis.htm" title="Mathematical analysis">analytical</a> considerations compelled the incorporation of <b>continuous</b> variables into the theory. This culminated in modern probability theory, the foundations of which were laid by <!--del_lnk--> Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov. Kolmogorov combined the notion of <!--del_lnk--> sample space, introduced by <!--del_lnk--> Richard von Mises, and <b><!--del_lnk--> measure theory</b> and presented his <!--del_lnk--> axiom system for probability theory 1933. Fairly quickly this became the undisputed <!--del_lnk--> axiomatic basis for modern probability theory.<p><a id="Treatment" name="Treatment"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Treatment</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Discrete_probability_theory" name="Discrete_probability_theory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Discrete probability theory</span></h3>
      <p><b>Discrete probability theory</b> deals with events which occur in <!--del_lnk--> countable sample spaces.<p>Examples: Throwing <a href="../../wp/d/Dice.htm" title="Dice">dice</a>, experiments with <!--del_lnk--> decks of cards, and <!--del_lnk--> random walk.<p><b>Classical definition:</b> Initially the probability of an event to occur was defined as number of cases favorable for the event, over the number of total outcomes possible.<p>For example, if the event is &quot;occurrence of an even number when a <a href="../../wp/d/Dice.htm" title="Dice">die</a> is rolled&quot;, the probability is given by <img alt="\tfrac{3}{6}=\tfrac{1}{2}" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8267.png" />, since 3 faces out of the 6 have even numbers.<p><b>Modern definition:</b> The modern definition starts with a set called the <b>sample space</b> which relates to the set of all <i>possible outcomes</i> in classical sense, denoted by <img alt="\Omega=\left \{ x_1,x_2,\dots\right \}" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8268.png" />. It is then assumed that for each element <img alt="x \in \Omega\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8269.png" />, an intrinsic &quot;probability&quot; value <img alt="f(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8270.png" /> is attached, which satisfies the following properties:<ol>
       <li><img alt="f(x)\in[0,1]\mbox{ for all }x\in \Omega" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8271.png" /><li><img alt="\sum_{x\in \Omega} f(x) = 1" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8272.png" /></ol>
      <p>An <b>event</b> is defined as any subset <img alt="E\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8274.png" /> of the sample space <img alt="\Omega\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8275.png" />. The <b>probability</b> of the event <img alt="E\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8274.png" /> defined as<dl>
       <dd><img alt="P(E)=\sum_{x\in E} f(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8276.png" /></dl>
      <p>So, the probability of the entire sample space is 1, and the probability of the null event is 0.<p>The function <img alt="f(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8270.png" /> mapping a point in the sample space to the &quot;probability&quot; value is called a <b><!--del_lnk--> probability mass function</b> abbreviated as <b>pmf</b>. The modern definition does not try to answer how probability mass functions are obtained; instead it builds a theory that assumes their existence.<p><a id="Continuous_probability_theory" name="Continuous_probability_theory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Continuous probability theory</span></h3>
      <p><b>Continuous probability theory</b> deals with events which occur in a continuous sample space.<p>If the sample space is the <!--del_lnk--> real numbers, then a function called the <b><!--del_lnk--> cumulative distribution function</b> or <b>cdf</b> <img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" /> is assumed to exist, which gives <img alt="P(X\le x) =  F(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8278.png" />.<p>The cdf must satisfy the following properties.<ol>
       <li><img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" /> is a <!--del_lnk--> monotonically non-decreasing <!--del_lnk--> right-continuous function<li><img alt="\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty} F(x)=0" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8279.png" /><li><img alt="\lim_{x\rightarrow \infty} F(x)=1" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8280.png" /></ol>
      <p>If <img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" /> is <!--del_lnk--> differentiable, then the random variable is said to have a <b><!--del_lnk--> probability density function</b> or <b>pdf</b> or simply <b>density</b> <img alt="f(x)=\frac{dF(x)}{dx}\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8281.png" />.<p>For a set <img alt="E \subseteq \mathbb{R}" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8283.png" />, the probability of the random variable being in <img alt="E\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8274.png" /> is defined as<dl>
       <dd><img alt="P(X\in E) = \int_{x\in E} dF(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8284.png" /></dl>
      <p>In case the density exists, then it can be written as<dl>
       <dd><img alt="P(X\in E) = \int_{x\in E} f(x)\,dx" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8286.png" /></dl>
      <p>Whereas the <i>pdf</i> exists only for continuous random variables, the <i>cdf</i> exists for all random variables (including discrete random variables) that take values on <img alt="\mathbb{R}" class="tex" src="../../images/96/9625.png" />.<p>These concepts can be generalized for multidimensional cases on <img alt="\mathbb{R}^n" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8287.png" />.<p><a id="Measure_theoretic_probability_theory" name="Measure_theoretic_probability_theory"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Measure theoretic probability theory</span></h3>
      <p>Certain distributions can be a mix of <i>discrete</i> and <i>continuous</i> distributions. For example, a sum of a discrete and continuous random variable will neither have a pmf nor a pdf. Other distributions may not even be a mix; for example the <!--del_lnk--> Cantor distribution which has no point mass and no density. The modern approach to probability theory solves these problems using <!--del_lnk--> measure theory and the definition of the <!--del_lnk--> probability space:<p>Given any set <img alt="\Omega\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8275.png" /> (also called <b>sample space</b>) and a <!--del_lnk--> &sigma;-algebra <img alt="\Sigma\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8288.png" /> on it, a measure <img alt="\mu\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8289.png" /> is called a <b>probability measure</b> if<ol>
       <li><img alt="\mu\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8289.png" /> is non-negative<li><img alt="\mu(\Omega)=1\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8290.png" /></ol>
      <p>For any cdf there is a unique probability measure on the <!--del_lnk--> Borel sigma field, and vice versa. The measure corresponding to a cdf is said to be <b>induced</b> by the cdf. This measure coincides with the pmf for discrete variables, and pdf for continuous variables, making the measure theoretic approach free of fallacies.<p>The <i>probability</i> of a set <img alt="E\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8274.png" /> in the sigma field <img alt="\Sigma\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8288.png" /> is defined as<dl>
       <dd><img alt="P(X\in E) = \int_{x\in E} dF(x)\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8284.png" /></dl>
      <p>where the integration is with respect to the measure induced by <img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" />.<p>Along with providing better understanding and unification of discrete and continuous probabilities, measure theoretic treatment also allows us to work on probabilities outside <img alt="\mathbb{R}^n" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8287.png" />, as in the theory of <!--del_lnk--> stochastic processes. For example to study <!--del_lnk--> Brownian motion, probability is defined on a space of functions.<p><a id="Probability_distributions" name="Probability_distributions"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Probability distributions</span></h2>

      <p>Certain random variables occur very often in probability theory due to many natural and physical processes. Their distributions therefore have gained <i>special importance</i> in probability theory. Some fundamental <i>discrete distributions</i> are the <!--del_lnk--> discrete uniform, <!--del_lnk--> Bernoulli, <!--del_lnk--> binomial, <!--del_lnk--> negative binomial, <!--del_lnk--> Poisson and <!--del_lnk--> geometric distributions. Important <i>continuous distributions</i> include the <!--del_lnk--> continuous uniform, <!--del_lnk--> normal, <!--del_lnk--> exponential, <!--del_lnk--> gamma and <!--del_lnk--> beta distributions.<p><a id="Convergence_of_random_variables" name="Convergence_of_random_variables"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Convergence of random variables</span></h2>

      <p>In probability theory, there are several notions of convergence for <!--del_lnk--> random variables. They are listed below in the order of strength, i.e., any subsequent notion convergence in the list implies convergence according to all of the preceding notions.<dl>
       <dd><b>Convergence in distribution:</b> As the name implies, a sequence of random variables <img alt="X_1,X_2,\dots,\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8291.png" /> converges to the random variable <img alt="X\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8292.png" /> <b>in distribution</b> if their respective cumulative <i>distribution functions</i> <img alt="F_1,F_2,\dots\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8293.png" /> converge to the cumulative distribution function <img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" /> of <img alt="X\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8292.png" />, wherever <img alt="F\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8277.png" /> is <!--del_lnk--> continuous.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><b>Weak convergence:</b> The sequence of random variables <img alt="X_1,X_2,\dots\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8294.png" /> is said to converge towards the random variable <img alt="X\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8292.png" /> <b>weakly</b> if <img alt="\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P\left(\left|X_n-X\right|\geq\varepsilon\right)=0" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8296.png" /> for every &epsilon; &gt; 0. Weak convergence is also called <b>convergence in probability</b>.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><b>Strong convergence:</b> The sequence of random variables <img alt="X_1,X_2,\dots\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8294.png" /> is said to converge towards the random variable <img alt="X\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8292.png" /> <b>strongly</b> if <img alt="P(\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} X_n=X)=1." class="tex" src="../../images/82/8297.png" /> Strong convergence is also known as <b>almost sure convergence</b>.</dl>
      <p>Intuitively, <i>strong</i> convergence is a stronger version of the <i>weak</i> convergence, and in both cases the random variables <img alt="X_1,X_2,\dots\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8294.png" /> show an increasing correlation with <img alt="X\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8292.png" />. However, in case of <i>convergence in distribution</i>, the realized values of the random variables do not need to converge, and any possible correlation among them is immaterial.<p><a id="Law_of_large_numbers" name="Law_of_large_numbers"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Law of large numbers</span></h2>

      <p>If a fair coin is tossed, we know that <i>roughly</i> half of the time it will turn up <i>heads</i>, and the other half it will turn up <i>tails</i>. It also seems that the more we toss it, the more likely it is that the ratio of <i>heads</i>:<i>tails</i> will approach 1:1. Modern probability allows us to formally arrive at the same result, dubbed the <b>law of large numbers</b>. This result is remarkable because it was nowhere assumed while building the theory and is completely an offshoot of the theory. Linking theoretically-derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, this result is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory.<!--del_lnk--> <p>
       <br /> The <b>strong law of large numbers</b> (SLLN) states that if an event of probability <i>p</i> is observed repeatedly during independent experiments, the ratio of the observed frequency of that event to the total number of repetitions converges towards <i>p</i> strongly in probability.<p>In other words, if <img alt="X_1,X_2,...\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8298.png" /> are independent <!--del_lnk--> Bernoulli random variables taking values 1 with probability <i>p</i> and 0 with probability 1-<i>p</i>, then the sequence of random numbers <img alt="\frac{\sum X_n}{n}\," class="tex" src="../../images/82/8299.png" /> converges to <i>p</i> <!--del_lnk--> almost surely, i.e.<dl>

      <p>The <b>central limit theorem</b> is the reason for the ubiquitous occurrence of the <!--del_lnk--> normal distribution in nature, for which it is one of the most celebrated theorems in probability and statistics.<p>The theorem states that the <!--del_lnk--> average of many independent and identically distributed random variables tends towards a <!--del_lnk--> normal distribution <i>irrespective</i> of which distribution the original random variables follow.
