      <p><a id="Ancient_period" name="Ancient_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ancient period</span></h3>
      <p>As an academic discipline, Western political philosophy has its origins in ancient Greek society, when city-states were experimenting with various forms of political organization including <a href="../../wp/m/Monarchy.htm" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, <!--del_lnk--> tyranny, <!--del_lnk--> aristocracy, <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a>, and <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a>. The first classic work of political philosophy is <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato&#39;s</a> The Republic, which was followed by <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle&#39;s</a> Politics. Roman political philosophy was influenced by the Stoics, and the Roman statesman <!--del_lnk--> Cicero wrote on political philosophy.<p>Independently, <a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mencius, <!--del_lnk--> Mozi and the <!--del_lnk--> Legalist school in China, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Laws of Manu</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Chanakya and in India, all sought to find means of restoring political unity and stability; in the case of the former three through the cultivation of virtue, in the last by imposition of discipline. In India, <!--del_lnk--> Kautilya, in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Arthashastra</i>, developed a viewpoint which recalls both the Legalists and <!--del_lnk--> Machiavelli. Ancient Chinese and Indian civilization resembled Greek in that there was a unified culture divided into rival states. In the case of China, philosophers found themselves obliged to confront social and political breakdown, and seek solutions to the crisis that confronted their entire civilization.<p>The early <!--del_lnk--> Christian philosophy of <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> was by and large a rewrite of Plato in a Christian context. The main change that Christian thought brought was to moderate the <a href="../../wp/s/Stoicism.htm" title="Stoicism">Stoicism</a> and theory of <!--del_lnk--> justice of the Roman world, and emphasize the role of the state in applying <!--del_lnk--> mercy as a <!--del_lnk--> moral example. Augustine&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The City of God</i> is an influential work of this period that refuted the thesis, after the <!--del_lnk--> First Sack of Rome, that the Christian view could be realized on <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> at all - a view many Christian Romans held.<p><a id="Islamic_period" name="Islamic_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Islamic period</span></h3>
      <p>The rise of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> based on both the <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a> and the political philosophy of <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. <!--del_lnk--> Early Muslim philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, and the process of <!--del_lnk--> ijtihad to find <!--del_lnk--> truth - in effect <i>all</i> philosophy was &quot;political&quot; as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the <!--del_lnk--> Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Greek view and were supported by secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a>. By the medieval period, however, the <!--del_lnk--> Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed.<p><a id="Medieval_period" name="Medieval_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval period</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Medieval political philosophy in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> was heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Christian thinking. It had much in common with the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic thinking in that the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics also subordinated philosophy to theology. Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of the medieval period was St. <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Aquinas.htm" title="Thomas Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> who helped reintroduce <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&#39;s works, which had been preserved in the interim only by the Muslims. Aquinas&#39;s use of them set the agenda for <!--del_lnk--> scholastic political philosophy, and dominated European thought for centuries.<p>The most influential work, however, was that which ended this period, that being <a href="../../wp/n/Niccol%25C3%25B2_Machiavelli.htm" title="Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli">Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</a>&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Prince</i>, 1532. It is that work, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Discourses</i>, a rigorous analysis of the <!--del_lnk--> classical period, from which modern political philosophy is largely derived.<p><a id="Enlightenment_period" name="Enlightenment_period"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Enlightenment period</span></h3>
      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> period, new theories about human psychology, the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution and the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>) led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Hobbes.htm" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Montesquieu and <a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> - known by most for his influential theory of the <!--del_lnk--> social contract.<p>These theorists were driven by two basic questions: by what right or need do people form &quot;states,&quot; and what is the best form for a &quot;state.&quot; These large questions involved a conceptual distinction between &quot;state&quot; and &quot;government.&quot; Basically, &quot;state&quot; refers to a set of enduring institutions through which power is distributed and its use justified. &quot;Government&quot; refers to a specific group of people who occupy these institutions, and exercise particular policies. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political science</a>, although some political scientists, philosophers, <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">historians</a> and <!--del_lnk--> cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states which nevertheless must be considered politically.<p>Political and economic relations were drastically changed by these views as the <a href="../../wp/g/Guild.htm" title="Guild">guild</a> was subordinated to <!--del_lnk--> free trade, and <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by <!--del_lnk--> Protestant churches subordinate to each <!--del_lnk--> nation-state and which preached in the &quot;vulgar&quot; or native language of each region.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, these reforms did not take place and these views did not spread until much later. Also, there was no contact with the <!--del_lnk--> New World and the advanced civilizations of the <a href="../../wp/a/Aztec.htm" title="Aztec">Aztec</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Maya_civilization.htm" title="Maya civilization">Maya</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mohican, <!--del_lnk--> Delaware, <!--del_lnk--> Huron and especially the <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois, who gave a great boost to Christian thought and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>: for example, <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Franklin.htm" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> was a great admirer of some of the methods of the <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois Confederacy, and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.<p><a id="Industrialization_and_the_early_modern_age" name="Industrialization_and_the_early_modern_age"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Industrialization and the early modern age</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution produced a parallel revolution in political thought. <!--del_lnk--> Urbanization and <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the <!--del_lnk--> socialist movement began to form. In the mid-19th century, <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> was developed, and <a href="../../wp/s/Socialism.htm" title="Socialism">socialism</a> in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. By the late 19th century, socialism and <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">trade unions</a> were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> syndicalism also gained some prominence.<p><a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> was a watershed event in human history. The <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> - and in particular the political theory of <!--del_lnk--> Leninism, but also on a smaller level <!--del_lnk--> Luxembourgism (gradually) - on the world stage. At the same time, <!--del_lnk--> social democratic parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage.<p>In response to the sweeping social changes that occurred in the years after the war, ultra-<!--del_lnk--> reactionary ideologies such as <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a> began to take shape. In particular, the rise of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazis</a> in Germany would later lead to the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War.<p>All political thought was deeply affected by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression, which led many theorists to reconsider the ideas they had previously held as axiomatic. In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, President <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> introduced the <!--del_lnk--> New Deal. In Europe, both the extreme left and the extreme right gained increasing popularity.<p><a id="Contemporary_political_philosophy" name="Contemporary_political_philosophy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary political philosophy</span></h2>
      <p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> political philosophy moved into a temporary eclipse in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and behavioralism. The 1950s saw pronouncements of the &#39;death&#39; of the discipline, followed by debates about that thesis. A handful of continental European emigres to Britain and the United States&mdash;including <!--del_lnk--> Hannah Arendt, <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Popper.htm" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Hayek, <!--del_lnk--> Leo Strauss, <!--del_lnk--> Isaiah Berlin, <!--del_lnk--> Eric Voegelin and <!--del_lnk--> Judith Shklar&mdash;encouraged continued study in the field, but in the 1950s and 60s they and their students remained somewhat marginal in their disciplines.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">Communism</a> remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 60s. <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionism</a>, <!--del_lnk--> racism and <!--del_lnk--> colonialism were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a <!--del_lnk--> pragmatic approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply <a href="../../wp/u/Utilitarianism.htm" title="Utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a> to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as <!--del_lnk--> rational choice theory) to political issues. The rise of <!--del_lnk--> feminism and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as <!--del_lnk--> African Americans in the developed world has led to feminist, <!--del_lnk--> postcolonial, and <!--del_lnk--> multicultural thought becoming significant.<p>In Anglo-American academic political philosophy the publication of <!--del_lnk--> John Rawls&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> A Theory of Justice</i> in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a <!--del_lnk--> thought experiment, the <!--del_lnk--> original position, in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Nozick&#39;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> Anarchy, State, and Utopia</i> responded to Rawls from a <!--del_lnk--> libertarian perspective.<p>Contemporary with analytic ethics-oriented work in Anglo-American thought, within Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Many of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the <!--del_lnk--> Frankfurt School, thinkers like <!--del_lnk--> Herbert Marcuse, <!--del_lnk--> Theodor W. Adorno, <!--del_lnk--> Max Horkheimer, and <!--del_lnk--> J&uuml;rgen Habermas combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers&mdash;still largely influenced by Marxism&mdash;put new emphases on <!--del_lnk--> structuralism and on a &quot;return to <!--del_lnk--> Hegel&quot;. Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as <!--del_lnk--> Gilles Deleuze, <!--del_lnk--> Michel Foucault, <!--del_lnk--> Claude Lefort, and <!--del_lnk--> Jean Baudrillard. The <!--del_lnk--> Situationists were more influenced by Hegel; <!--del_lnk--> Guy Debord, in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of commodity fetishism to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.<p>Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Williams and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Taylor. The <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberalism</a>-<!--del_lnk--> communitarianism debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspectives.<p>Today some debates regarding punishment and law centre on the question of <!--del_lnk--> natural law and the degree to which human constraints on action are determined by nature, as revealed by <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> in particular. Other debates focus on questions of cultural and gender identity as central to politics.<p><a id="Influential_political_philosophers" name="Influential_political_philosophers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Influential political philosophers</span></h2>
      <p>A larger <!--del_lnk--> list of political philosophers is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are a few of the most <!--del_lnk--> canonical or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.<ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>&nbsp;: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.<li><!--del_lnk--> Chanakya&nbsp;: Founder of an independent political thought in India, laid down rules and guidelines for social, law and political order in society.<li><!--del_lnk--> Mozi&nbsp;: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a strict utilitarianism.<li><a href="../../wp/s/Socrates.htm" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>/<a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>: Named their practice of inquiry &quot;philosophy&quot;, and thereby stand at the head of a prominent (often called &quot;Western&quot;) tradition of systematic intellectual analysis. Set as a partial basis to that tradition the relation between knowledge on the one hand, and a just and good society on the other. Socrates is widely considered founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.<li><a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>: Wrote his <!--del_lnk--> Politics as an extension of his <!--del_lnk--> Nicomachean Ethics. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the <!--del_lnk--> polis (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of <!--del_lnk--> perfectionism (as is <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Marx">Marx</a>&#39;s, on some readings).<li><!--del_lnk--> Mencius&nbsp;: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.<li><!--del_lnk--> Han Feizi&nbsp;: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia (<!--del_lnk--> Legalist) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.<li><a href="../../wp/n/Niccol%25C3%25B2_Machiavelli.htm" title="Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli">Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</a>: First systematic analyses of: (1) how consent of a populace is negotiated between and among rulers rather than simply a naturalistic (or theological) given of the structure of society; (2) precursor to the concept of ideology in articulating the epistemological structure of commands and law.<li><a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Hobbes.htm" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a <!--del_lnk--> social contract that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.<li><!--del_lnk--> Benedict Spinoza: Set forth the first analysis of &quot;rational egoism&quot; in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza&#39;s thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided of reason, political authority would be superfluous.<li><a href="../../wp/j/John_Locke.htm" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens&#39; fundamental rights in the <!--del_lnk--> state of nature. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Constitution.htm" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.<li><!--del_lnk--> Baron de Montesquieu: Analyzed protection of liberty by a &quot;balance of powers&quot; in the divisions of a state.<li><a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that consent of the governed was merely hypothetical.<li><a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the <!--del_lnk--> general will, and controversially argued in favour of absolute <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> where the people at large would act as <!--del_lnk--> sovereign.<li><a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hobbes, but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation.
