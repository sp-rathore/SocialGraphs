      <p>In <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, a <b>prime number</b> (or a <b>prime</b>) is a <!--del_lnk--> natural number that has exactly two (distinct) natural number <!--del_lnk--> divisors, which are <!--del_lnk--> 1 and the prime number itself. There exists an infinitude of prime numbers, as demonstrated by <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a>, in about <!--del_lnk--> 300 B.C.. The first 30 prime numbers are <!--del_lnk--> 2, <!--del_lnk--> 3, <!--del_lnk--> 5, <!--del_lnk--> 7, <!--del_lnk--> 11, <!--del_lnk--> 13, <!--del_lnk--> 17, <!--del_lnk--> 19, <!--del_lnk--> 23, <!--del_lnk--> 29, <!--del_lnk--> 31, <!--del_lnk--> 37, <!--del_lnk--> 41, <!--del_lnk--> 43, <!--del_lnk--> 47, <!--del_lnk--> 53, <!--del_lnk--> 59, <!--del_lnk--> 61, <!--del_lnk--> 67, <!--del_lnk--> 71, <!--del_lnk--> 73, <!--del_lnk--> 79, <!--del_lnk--> 83, <!--del_lnk--> 89, <!--del_lnk--> 97, <!--del_lnk--> 101, <!--del_lnk--> 103, <!--del_lnk--> 107, <!--del_lnk--> 109, and <!--del_lnk--> 113 (sequence <!--del_lnk--> A000040 in <!--del_lnk--> OEIS); see the <!--del_lnk--> list of prime numbers for a longer list.<p>The property of being a prime is called <i>primality</i>, and the word <i>prime</i> is also used as an adjective. Since 2 is the only even prime number, the term <i>odd prime</i> refers to all prime numbers greater than 2.<p>The study of prime numbers is part of <!--del_lnk--> number theory, the branch of mathematics which encompasses the study of natural numbers. Prime numbers have been the subject of intense research, yet some fundamental questions, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Riemann hypothesis and the <!--del_lnk--> Goldbach conjecture, have been unresolved for more than a century. The problem of modelling the distribution of prime numbers is a popular subject of investigation for number theorists: when looking at individual numbers, the primes seem to be randomly distributed, but the &quot;global&quot; distribution of primes follows well-defined laws.<p>The notion of prime number has been generalized in many different branches of mathematics.<ul>
       <li>In <!--del_lnk--> ring theory, a branch of <!--del_lnk--> abstract algebra, the term &quot;prime element&quot; has a specific meaning. Here, a non-zero, non-unit ring element <i>a</i> is defined to be prime if whenever <i>a</i> divides <i>b c</i> for ring elements <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, then <i>a</i> divides at least one of <i>b</i> or <i>c</i>. With this meaning, the additive inverse of any prime number is also prime. In other words, when considering the set of <!--del_lnk--> integers ( <img alt="\mathbb{Z}" class="tex" src="../../images/96/9623.png" /> ) as a <!--del_lnk--> ring, <span class="texhtml">&minus; 7</span> is a prime element. Without further specification, however, &quot;prime number&quot; always means a positive integer prime. Among rings of <!--del_lnk--> complex <!--del_lnk--> algebraic integers, <!--del_lnk--> Eisenstein primes, and <!--del_lnk--> Gaussian primes may also be of interest.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> knot theory, a <!--del_lnk--> prime knot is a <!--del_lnk--> knot which can not be disaggregated into a smaller prime knot.</ul>
      <p>In both the two above examples, the <a href="../../wp/f/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.htm" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> (<i>Every natural number can be &#39;<b>uniquely&#39;</b> decomposed into a product of primes</i>) does not apply.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>There are hints in the surviving records of the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptians</a> that they had some knowledge of prime numbers: the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian fraction expansions in the <!--del_lnk--> Rhind papyrus, for instance, have quite different forms for primes and for composites. However, the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Ancient Greeks</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Euclid&#39;s Elements (circa <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC) contain important theorems about primes, including the infinitude of primes and the <a href="../../wp/f/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.htm" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>. Euclid also showed how to construct a <a href="../../wp/p/Perfect_number.htm" title="Perfect number">perfect number</a> from a <!--del_lnk--> Mersenne prime. The <!--del_lnk--> Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes, is a simple, efficient and still widely used method to compute primes.<p>After the Greeks, little happened until the 17th century. In 1640 <!--del_lnk--> Pierre de Fermat stated (without proof) <!--del_lnk--> Fermat&#39;s little theorem (later proved by <!--del_lnk--> Leibnitz and <a href="../../wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm" title="Leonhard Euler">Euler</a>). A special case of it may have been known long before by the Chinese. Other conjectures by Fermat turned out to be false, e.g. that all <!--del_lnk--> Fermat numbers are prime. The French monk <!--del_lnk--> Marin Mersenne made partially false assertions about <!--del_lnk--> Mersenne primes.<p>In 1747 Euler showed that all even perfect numbers are on Euclid&#39;s form. It is still unknown whether there exist odd perfect numbers. Euler&#39;s extensive work included many significant results about primes, e.g. that the <!--del_lnk--> infinite sum 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + ... is divergent.<p>Several mathematicians made contributions towards the <!--del_lnk--> prime number theorem until it was proved independently by <!--del_lnk--> Hadamard and <!--del_lnk--> de la Vall&eacute;e Poussin in <!--del_lnk--> 1896.<p>Fermat&#39;s little theorem does not prove primality which can be determined by slow <!--del_lnk--> trial division for small numbers. Many mathematicians have worked on faster <!--del_lnk--> primality tests for large numbers, often restricted to specific number forms. This includes <!--del_lnk--> P&eacute;pin&#39;s test for Fermat numbers (1877), <!--del_lnk--> Proth&#39;s theorem (around 1878), the <!--del_lnk--> Lucas&ndash;Lehmer test for Mersenne numbers (originated 1878), and the generalized <!--del_lnk--> Lucas&ndash;Lehmer test. More recent algorithms like <!--del_lnk--> APRT-CL, <!--del_lnk--> ECPP and <!--del_lnk--> AKS work on arbitrary numbers but remain much slower.<p>Until the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a> most mathematicians considered the number 1 a prime, and there is still a large body of mathematical work that is valid despite labelling 1 a prime, such as the work of <!--del_lnk--> Stern and Zeisel. <!--del_lnk--> Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime. The change in label occurred so that it can be said &#39;each number has a unique factorization into primes.&#39; See also &quot;Arguments for and against the primality of 1&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> <p>For a long time, prime numbers were thought as having no possible application outside of <!--del_lnk--> number theory; this changed in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s when the concepts of <!--del_lnk--> public-key cryptography were invented, in which prime numbers formed the basis of the first algorithms such as the <!--del_lnk--> RSA cryptosystem or the <!--del_lnk--> Diffie-Hellman key-exchange algorithm.<p>Since 1951 all the <!--del_lnk--> largest known primes have been found by <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computers</a>. The search for ever larger primes has generated interest outside mathematical circles. <!--del_lnk--> Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search and other <!--del_lnk--> distributed computing projects to find large primes have become popular, while mathematicians continue to struggle with the theory of primes.<p><a id="Prime_divisors" name="Prime_divisors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Prime divisors</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/f/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic.htm" title="Fundamental theorem of arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> states that every positive integer larger than 1 can be written as a product of one or more primes in a <!--del_lnk--> unique way, i.e. unique except for the order. The same prime may occur multiple times. Primes can thus be considered the &quot;basic building blocks&quot; of the natural numbers. For example, we can write<dl>
       <dd><img alt="23244 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 13 \times 149" class="tex" src="../../images/82/8257.png" /></dl>
      <p>and any other factorization of 23244 as the product of primes will be identical except for the order of the factors. There are many <!--del_lnk--> prime factorization algorithms to do this in practice for larger numbers.<p>The importance of this theorem is one of the reasons for the exclusion of 1 from the set of prime numbers. If 1 were admitted as a prime, the precise statement of the theorem would require additional qualifications.<p><a id="Properties_of_primes" name="Properties_of_primes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Properties of primes</span></h2>

       <li>The base 10 numerals for all prime numbers except 2 and 5 end in 1, 3, 7, or 9. (Numerals ending in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 represent multiples of 2 and numerals ending in 5 represent multiples of 5, due to the use of the base 10 (2 &times; 5) system.)</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>If <i>p</i> is a prime number and <i>p</i> divides a product <i>ab</i> of integers, then <i>p</i> divides <i>a</i> or <i>p</i> divides <i>b</i>. This proposition was proved by Euclid and is known as <i>Euclid&#39;s lemma</i>. It is used in some proofs of the uniqueness of prime factorizations.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> ring <b>Z</b>/<i>n</i><b>Z</b> (see <!--del_lnk--> modular arithmetic) is a <!--del_lnk--> field if and only if <i>n</i> is a prime. Put another way: <i>n</i> is prime if and only if <!--del_lnk--> &phi;(<i>n</i>) = <i>n</i> &minus; 1.</ul>

      <ul>
       <li>If <i>p</i> is a prime number other than 2 and 5, 1/p is always a <!--del_lnk--> recurring decimal, with a period of p-1 or a divisor of p-1. This can be deduced directly from <!--del_lnk--> Fermat&#39;s little theorem. 1/p expressed likewise in base q (i.e. other than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. The article on <!--del_lnk--> recurring decimals shows some of the interesting properties.</ul>

       <li>If <i>p</i> is prime and <i>G</i> is a group with <i>p</i><sup><i>n</i></sup> elements, then <i>G</i> contains an element of order <i>p</i>.</ul>

       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> prime number theorem says that the proportion of primes less than <i>x</i> is asymptotic to 1/ln <i>x</i> (in other words, as <i>x</i> gets very large, the likelihood that a number less than <i>x</i> is prime is inversely proportional to the number of digits in <i>x</i>).</ul>

      <p>The oldest known proof for the statement that there are <!--del_lnk--> infinitely many prime numbers is given by the Greek mathematician <a href="../../wp/e/Euclid.htm" title="Euclid">Euclid</a> in his <i>Elements</i> (Book IX, Proposition 20). Euclid states the result as &quot;there are more than any given [finite] number of primes&quot;, and his proof is essentially the following:<dl>
       <dd>Suppose you have a finite number of primes. Call this number <i>m</i>. Multiply all <i>m</i> primes together and add one (see <!--del_lnk--> Euclid number). The resulting number is not divisible by any of the finite set of primes, because dividing by any of these would give a remainder of one. And one is not divisible by any primes. Therefore it must either be prime itself, or be divisible by some other prime that was not included in the finite set. Either way, there must be at least <i>m</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 primes. But this argument applies no matter what <i>m</i> is; it applies to <i>m</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, too. So there are more primes than any given finite number.</dl>
      <p>This previous argument explains why the product of <i>m</i> primes plus 1 must be divisible by some prime not among the <i>m</i> primes, or be prime itself. A common mistake is thinking Euclid&#39;s proof says the prime product plus 1 is always prime.<br /> (2 &middot; 3 &middot; 5 &middot; 7 &middot; 11 &middot; 13) + 1 = 30,031 = 59 &middot; 509 (both primes) shows this is not the case.<p>Other mathematicians have given their own proofs. One of those (due to <a href="../../wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm" title="Leonhard Euler">Euler</a>) shows that <!--del_lnk--> the sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers diverges to infinity. <!--del_lnk--> Kummer&#39;s is particularly elegant and <!--del_lnk--> Harry Furstenberg provides one using <!--del_lnk--> general topology.<p><a id="Counting_the_number_of_prime_numbers_below_a_given_number" name="Counting_the_number_of_prime_numbers_below_a_given_number"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Counting the number of prime numbers below a given number</span></h3>
      <p>Even though the total number of primes is infinite, one could still ask &quot;Approximately how many primes are there below 100,000?&quot;, or &quot;How likely is a random 20-digit number to be prime?&quot;.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> prime counting function &pi;(<i>x</i>) is defined as the number of primes up to <i>x</i>. There are known <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a> to compute exact values of &pi;(<i>x</i>) faster than it would be to compute each prime up to <i>x</i>. Values as large as &pi;(10<sup>20</sup>) can be calculated quickly and accurately with modern computers. Thus, e.g., &pi;(100000) = 9592, and &pi;(10<sup>20</sup>) = 2,220,819,602,560,918,840.<p>For larger values of <i>x</i>, beyond the reach of modern equipment, the <!--del_lnk--> prime number theorem provides a good estimate: &pi;(<i>x</i>) is approximately <i>x</i>/ln(<i>x</i>).

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple way, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sieve of Atkin a fast way, to compute the list of all prime numbers up to a given limit.<p>In practice, though, one usually wants to check whether a given number is prime, rather than generate a list of primes. Further, it is often satisfactory to know the answer with a high <!--del_lnk--> probability. It is possible to quickly check whether a given large number (say, up to a few thousand digits) is prime using probabilistic <!--del_lnk--> primality tests. These typically pick a random number called a &quot;witness&quot; and check some formula involving the witness and the potential prime <i>N</i>. After several iterations, they declare <i>N</i> to be &quot;definitely composite&quot; or &quot;probably prime&quot;. Some of these tests are not perfect: there may be some composite numbers, called <!--del_lnk--> pseudoprimes for the respective test, that will be declared &quot;probably prime&quot; no matter what witness is chosen. However, the most popular probabilistic tests do not suffer from this drawback.<p>One method for determining whether a number is prime is to divide by all primes less than or equal to the square root of that number. If any of the divisions come out as an integer, then the original number is not a prime. Otherwise, it is a prime. One need not actually calculate the square root; once one sees that the <!--del_lnk--> quotient is less than the <!--del_lnk--> divisor, one can stop. This is known as trial division; it is the simplest primality test and it quickly becomes impractical for testing large integers because the number of possible factors grows exponentially as the number of digits in the number-to-be-tested increases.<p><a id="Pseudocode_for_programs_to_find_primes" name="Pseudocode_for_programs_to_find_primes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pseudocode for programs to find primes</span></h3>

If it is not divisible evenly by any of them, it is added to the list. But if it is divisible evenly by any number already on the list, the program moves on to the next candidate.<p>The simplest, most elegant algorithm is perhaps the <!--del_lnk--> sieve of Eratosthenes.<pre>

       <dd>&quot;There are two facts about the distribution of prime numbers of which I hope to convince you so overwhelmingly that they will be permanently engraved in your hearts.

The second fact is even more astonishing, for it states just the opposite: that the prime numbers exhibit stunning regularity, that there are laws governing their behaviour, and that they obey these laws with almost military precision.&quot; (Havil 2003, p. 171)</dl>

      <p>For a long time, number theory in general, and the study of prime numbers in particular, was seen as the canonical example of <!--del_lnk--> pure mathematics, with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic. In particular, number theorists such as <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematician</a> <!--del_lnk--> G. H. Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance. However, this vision was shattered in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of <!--del_lnk--> public key cryptography <a href="../../wp/a/Algorithm.htm" title="Algorithm">algorithms</a>. Prime numbers are also used for <!--del_lnk--> hash tables and <!--del_lnk--> pseudorandom number generators.<p>Some <!--del_lnk--> rotor machines were designed with a different number of pins on each rotor, with the number of pins on any one rotor either prime, or <!--del_lnk--> coprime to the number of pins on any other rotor. This helped generate the <!--del_lnk--> full cycle of possible rotor positions before repeating any position.<p><a id="Public-key_cryptography" name="Public-key_cryptography"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public-key cryptography</span></h3>

      <p>Several public-key cryptography algorithms, such as <!--del_lnk--> RSA, are based on large prime numbers (that is, greater than 10<sup>100</sup>).<p><a id="Prime_numbers_in_nature" name="Prime_numbers_in_nature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prime numbers in nature</span></h3>
      <p>Many numbers occur in nature, and inevitably some of these are prime. There are, however, relatively few examples of numbers that appear in nature <i>because</i> they are prime. For example, most <!--del_lnk--> starfish have 5 arms, and 5 is a prime number. However there is no evidence to suggest that starfish have 5 arms <i>because</i> 5 is a prime number. Indeed, some starfish have different numbers of arms. <i>Echinaster luzonicus</i> normally has six arms, <i>Luidia senegalensis</i> has nine arms, and <i>Solaster endeca</i> can have as many as twenty arms. Why the majority of starfish (and most other <!--del_lnk--> echinoderms) have <!--del_lnk--> five-fold symmetry remains a mystery.<p>One example of the use of prime numbers in nature is as an evolutionary strategy used by <!--del_lnk--> cicadas of the genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Magicicada</i>. These insects spend most of their lives as <!--del_lnk--> grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences makes it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialise as predators on <i>Magicicadas</i>. If <i>Magicicadas</i> appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects.<p><a id="Primes_in_pop_culture" name="Primes_in_pop_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Primes in pop culture</span></h2>
