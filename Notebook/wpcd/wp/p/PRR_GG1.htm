      <p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a>&#39;s <b>GG1</b> class of <!--del_lnk--> electric locomotives were built between 1934 to 1943 at the PRR shops in <!--del_lnk--> Altoona, Pennsylvania, with a total of 139 units constructed. They remained in service with the PRR&#39;s successors until the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s. The GG1 became one of the most recognized and famous classes of locomotive worldwide.<p>

      <p>The GG1s were large locomotives, 79 <!--del_lnk--> ft 6 <!--del_lnk--> in (24.23 <!--del_lnk--> m) long and weighing 477,000 <!--del_lnk--> lb (216,000 <!--del_lnk--> kg). The main body was a single unit formed as a bridge-truss framework and clad in welded steel plate. The driving cabs were set up high about a third of the way along the locomotive from each end for greater crew safety in an accident. A narrower section of nose in front of the cab windows enabled view forward, although the nose remained full height to carry the current-collection <!--del_lnk--> pantographs. The bodywork as a whole was smoothly rounded.<p>This was mounted upon two great cast steel <!--del_lnk--> locomotive frames linked by a hinge at the locomotive&#39;s middle which allowed side-to-side movement. Six <!--del_lnk--> driving wheels (three axles) were fitted towards the centre of the locomotive on each truck (twelve in total) and a four-wheeled, unpowered guiding truck was mounted toward each end. In the <!--del_lnk--> Whyte notation for <!--del_lnk--> steam locomotives, each frame comprised a <a href="../../wp/4/4-6-0.htm" title="4-6-0">4-6-0</a> locomotive; in the <!--del_lnk--> PRR&#39;s classification system, 4-6-0s were class &quot;G&quot;. The GG1 consisted of two such locomotive frames mounted back to back, so it was classified <i>GG</i>&mdash;4-6-0+0-6-4. This arrangement is called <!--del_lnk--> 2-C+C-2 in <!--del_lnk--> AAR wheel arrangement notation. Each driven axle was powered by two 385 <!--del_lnk--> hp (305 <!--del_lnk--> kW) GEA-627-A1 <!--del_lnk--> traction motors mounted above and to either side of the axle. Drive was through a reduction gear and a <!--del_lnk--> quill drive assembly.<p>While the famous industrial designer <!--del_lnk--> Raymond Loewy did not design the shape of the GG1 electric locomotives, he did improve their looks by recommending a smooth welded construction be used (rather than riveted construction), along with a pinstriped paint scheme to highlight their smoothly rounded forms. The real design behind the GG1 came from the <!--del_lnk--> New Haven Railroad EP3 electric. The New Haven allowed the PRR to borrow a pair of EP3s for testing, and the PRR was quite impressed with their performance and decided to base the design of its electric locomotive on the EP3.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The GG1 was designed to run on the standard Pennsylvania Railroad catenary power of 11,000 <a href="../../wp/v/Volt.htm" title="Volt">V</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">AC</a>, 25 <!--del_lnk--> Hz. This high voltage was stepped down by a large <!--del_lnk--> transformer mounted in the centre of the locomotive body for the traction motors, cooling blowers and all other onboard equipment. The locomotive&#39;s power was controlled via a tap-switching arrangement; the number of secondary windings in use could be varied, thus adjusting the output voltage. The units were rated at 4,620 hp (385 hp per motor) continuous rating and a maximum of 9,500 hp at 49 <!--del_lnk--> mph (intermittent duty). For passenger service, the GG1 was geared to run at 100 mph maximum although it achieved 110 mph in testing. For freight service, the locomotive was geared to run at 90 mph maximum.<br style="clear:both;" />

      <p><a id="A_GG1_crash" name="A_GG1_crash"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">A GG1 crash</span></h3>
      <p>One of the more interesting moments in the history of the GG1 locomotive took place on the morning of <!--del_lnk--> January 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1953 at <!--del_lnk--> Washington&#39;s Union Station. Due to a brake line cock (valve) that closed due to poor location (its location caused the valve to close due to contact with the bottom cross member of the car), the <i><!--del_lnk--> Federal Express</i> from <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a> was unable to apply the brakes on part of the train. Pushed by the unbraked cars, the GG1 engine (#4876) and two passenger cars ran off the end of Track 16 and crashed through the floor of Union Station and into the baggage room. With President <a href="../../wp/d/Dwight_D._Eisenhower.htm" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Eisenhower&#39;s</a> inauguration in days, the cars were hauled out by the next day. The GG1 was left in the basement under a temporary flooring. After the inauguration, in a remarkable demonstration of the durability of the GG1 engines, Engine #4876 was later cut into three pieces, removed from the baggage room, and reassembled at the Altoona (PA) shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad. It then re-entered commercial service and went on to be one of the last-serving GG1 engines. As of August 2006 it is owned by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.<p><a id="Disposition" name="Disposition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Disposition</span></h3>
      <p>While it is widely believed that the GG1s were retired due to a change in the electric power supply on the former PRR electrified zone, other concerns led to the retirement of the GG1s. Aside from maintenance and performance issues, the nail in the GG1&#39;s coffin was an ever growing problem with frame cracks which were expensive to repair and occurring more and more frequently. Amtrak&#39;s first attempt to replace the GG1, the <!--del_lnk--> E60, did not live up to expectations. Amtrak&#39;s purchase of <!--del_lnk--> AEM-7 electric locomotives allowed it to retire its fleet of GG1s. With the AEM-7s on hand Amtrak was not only able to replace its own GG1s, but sell a number of E60s to New Jersey Transit to replace their GG1s operating commuter trains on the <!--del_lnk--> North Jersey Coast Line.<p>It has often been proposed for a GG1 to be restored to operating condition. While it would be theoretically possible to run a GG1 on the current <!--del_lnk--> Northeast Corridor&#39;s electrical system, surviving GG1s contain large amounts of toxic <!--del_lnk--> PCBs in their electrical systems as well as <!--del_lnk--> asbestos. These put a restoration far out of reach for most non-profit preservation groups.<p><a id="Surviving_examples" name="Surviving_examples"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Surviving examples</span></h3>
