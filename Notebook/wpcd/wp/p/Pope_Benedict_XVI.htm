He has taught about the importance for the Catholic Church and for humanity of contemplating <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>&#39;s salvific love and has reaffirmed the &quot;importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.&quot;<p>

      <p>Benedict XVI was <!--del_lnk--> elected Pope at the age of 78. He is the <!--del_lnk--> oldest person to have been elected Pope since <!--del_lnk--> Pope Clement XII (1730&ndash;40). He had served longer as a <!--del_lnk--> cardinal than any Pope since <!--del_lnk--> Benedict XIII (1724&ndash;30). He is the ninth German Pope, the eighth having been the Dutch-German <!--del_lnk--> Pope Adrian VI (1522&ndash;23) from <a href="../../wp/u/Utrecht_%2528city%2529.htm" title="Utrecht (city)">Utrecht</a>. The last Pope named Benedict was <!--del_lnk--> Benedict XV, an <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> (1914&ndash;18).<p>Born in 1927 in Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, Germany, Benedict XVI had a distinguished career as a university <!--del_lnk--> theologian before being appointed <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of Munich and Freising by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Paul VI (1963&ndash;78). Shortly afterwards, he was made a cardinal in the <!--del_lnk--> consistory of <!--del_lnk--> June 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1977. He was appointed Prefect of the <!--del_lnk--> Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was also assigned the honorific title of the <!--del_lnk--> cardinal bishop of the <!--del_lnk--> suburbicarian diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Velletri-<!--del_lnk--> Segni on <!--del_lnk--> April 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1993. In 1998, he was elected sub-dean of the <!--del_lnk--> College of Cardinals. And on <!--del_lnk--> November 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, he was elected dean, taking, as is customary, the title of Cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of <!--del_lnk--> Ostia. He was the first Dean of the College elected Pope since <!--del_lnk--> Paul IV (1555&ndash;59) and the first cardinal bishop elected Pope since <!--del_lnk--> Pius VIII (1829&ndash;30).<p>Before becoming Pope, Benedict XVI was one of the most influential men in the Roman Curia, and was a close associate of the late John Paul II. As Dean of the College of Cardinals, he presided over the <!--del_lnk--> funeral of John Paul II and over the Mass immediately preceding the 2005 conclave in which he was elected. During the service, he called on the assembled cardinals to hold fast to the doctrine of the faith. He was the public face of the church in the <i><!--del_lnk--> sede vacante</i> period, although, technically, he ranked below the <i><!--del_lnk--> camerlengo</i> in administrative authority during that time. Like his predecessor, Benedict XVI maintains the traditional Catholic doctrines on artificial <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a>, <!--del_lnk--> abortion, and <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality while promoting <a href="../../wp/c/Catholic_social_teaching.htm" title="Catholic social teaching">Catholic social teaching</a>.<p>As well as his native <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, Benedict XVI fluently speaks <!--del_lnk--> Italian, <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, and has a knowledge of <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>.

      <p>Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born on <!--del_lnk--> 16 April, <!--del_lnk--> Holy Saturday, 1927 at Schulstra&szlig;e 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents&#39; home in Marktl am Inn, Bavaria, Germany. He was baptized the same day. He was the third and youngest child of <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Ratzinger, Sr., a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (n&eacute;e Peintner). His mother&#39;s family was originally from <!--del_lnk--> South Tyrol. Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s brother, <!--del_lnk--> Georg Ratzinger, a priest and former director of the <!--del_lnk--> Regensburger Domspatzen choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger&#39;s household until her death in 1991. Their great-uncle was the German politician <!--del_lnk--> Georg Ratzinger.<p>The pope&#39;s relatives agree that his priestly vocation was apparent from boyhood. At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal Archbishop of Munich with flowers. Struck by the Cardinal&#39;s distinctive garb, he later announced the very same day that he wanted to be a cardinal.<p>Following his fourteenth birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the <!--del_lnk--> Hitler Youth (a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party) - membership being legally required after December 1936. -, but was an unenthusiastic member and refused to attend meetings. His father was a bitter enemy of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a>, believing it conflicted with the Catholic faith. In 1941, one of Ratzinger&#39;s cousins, a child with <a href="../../wp/d/Down_syndrome.htm" title="Down syndrome">Down syndrome</a>, was killed by the Nazi regime in its campaign of <!--del_lnk--> eugenics. In 1943 while still in seminary, he was drafted at age 16 into the German anti-aircraft corps. Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry, but a subsequent illness precluded him from the usual rigors of military duty. As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he returned to his family&#39;s home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established their headquarters in the Ratzinger household. As a German soldier, he was put in a POW camp but was released a few months later at the end of the War in summer 1945. He re-entered the seminary, along with his brother Georg, in November of that year.<p>Following repatriation in 1945, the two brothers entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, later studying at the <!--del_lnk--> Ducal Georgianum (<i>Herzogliches Georgianum</i>) of the <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich. They were both ordained on <!--del_lnk--> June 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1951 by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber of Munich. Joseph Ratzinger&#39;s dissertation (1953) was on <a href="../../wp/a/Augustine_of_Hippo.htm" title="Augustine of Hippo">St. Augustine</a> and was entitled &quot;The People and the House of God in Augustine&#39;s Doctrine of the Church&quot;. His <!--del_lnk--> Habilitation (which qualified him for a professorship) was on <!--del_lnk--> Bonaventure. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of <!--del_lnk--> Freising College in 1958.<p><a id="Pre-papal_career" name="Pre-papal_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-papal career</span></h2>

      <p>Ratzinger became a professor at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Bonn in 1959; his inaugural lecture was on &quot;The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy.&quot; In 1963, he moved to the <!--del_lnk--> University of M&uuml;nster, where his inaugural lecture was given in a packed lecture hall, as he was already well known as a theologian.<p>In 1966, Joseph Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the <!--del_lnk--> University of T&uuml;bingen, where he was a colleague of <!--del_lnk--> Hans K&uuml;ng. In his 1968 book <i>Introduction to Christianity</i>, he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. He also wrote that the Church of the time was too centralized, rule-bound and overly controlled from Rome. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of T&uuml;bingen and the <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in Germany, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students and the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> German gay rights movement) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings. Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles. During his years at the <!--del_lnk--> Second Vatican Council and T&uuml;bingen University, <!--del_lnk--> professor Joseph Ratzinger publicized articles in the reformist theological journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Concilium</i>, though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as <!--del_lnk--> Hans K&uuml;ng and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Schillebeeckx.<p>In 1969, he returned to <!--del_lnk--> Bavaria, to the <!--del_lnk--> University of Regensburg, a less reformist academic environment. He founded the theological journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Communio</i>, with <!--del_lnk--> Hans Urs von Balthasar, <!--del_lnk--> Henri de Lubac, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Kasper and others, in 1972. <i>Communio,</i> now published in seventeen languages, including <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>, has become a prominent <!--del_lnk--> journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as Pope, he remained one of the journal&#39;s most prolific contributors.<p><a id="Second_Vatican_Council_.281962.E2.80.931965.29" name="Second_Vatican_Council_.281962.E2.80.931965.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Second Vatican Council (1962&ndash;1965)</span></h4>
      <p>During this period, Ratzinger participated in the <!--del_lnk--> Second Vatican Council (1962&ndash;1965). Ratzinger served as a <i>peritus</i> or theological consultant to <!--del_lnk--> Josef Cardinal Frings of <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Germany, and has continued to defend the council, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Nostra Aetate,</i> the document on respect of other religions, <!--del_lnk--> ecumenism and the declaration of the right to <!--del_lnk--> freedom of religion. (Later, as the <!--del_lnk--> Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church&#39;s position on other religions in the document <i><!--del_lnk--> Dominus Iesus</i> (2000) which also talks about the proper way to engage in <i><!--del_lnk--> ecumenical dialogue</i>). He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with radical <!--del_lnk--> Modernist theologians like <!--del_lnk--> Hans K&uuml;ng and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Schillebeeckx. Ratzinger became an admirer of <!--del_lnk--> Karl Rahner, a well-known academic theologian of the <!--del_lnk--> Nouvelle Th&eacute;ologie and a proponent of church reform.<p><a id="Cardinal_and_Archbishop_of_Munich_and_Freising_.281977.E2.80.931982.29" name="Cardinal_and_Archbishop_of_Munich_and_Freising_.281977.E2.80.931982.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cardinal and Archbishop of Munich and Freising (1977&ndash;1982)</span></h3>

He was promoted within the <!--del_lnk--> College of Cardinals to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993, was made the College&#39;s vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002.<p>In office, Ratzinger fulfilled his institutional role, defending and reaffirming official Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as <a href="../../wp/b/Birth_control.htm" title="Birth control">birth control</a>, <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality, and inter-religious dialogue. During his period in office, the <!--del_lnk--> Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith took disciplinary measures against some outspoken <!--del_lnk--> liberation theologians in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Jesuit priest <!--del_lnk--> Anthony de Mello.<p><a id="Papacy" name="Papacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Papacy</span></h2>

      <p>Pope Benedict has confounded the expectations of many in his papacy by his gentle public persona and his promise to listen.<p>During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly <!--del_lnk--> confirmed people, submit to him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.)<p>He has begun using an open-topped <!--del_lnk--> papal automobile, saying that he wanted to be closer to the people.<p><!--del_lnk--> Benedict&#39;s coat of arms has officially omitted the <!--del_lnk--> papal tiara, which traditionally appears in the background to designate the Pope&#39;s position, and replaced it with a simple <!--del_lnk--> mitre. However, some papal documents since his inauguration have included with the papal tiara. Since it is the shield and not the background which is unique to the individual Pope, various backgrounds are possible (though rarely used) for even a single shield.<p>Pope Benedict XVI has been using papal clothing which had previously fallen into disuse. During his installment address, he spoke at length about the significance of the <!--del_lnk--> pallium and has returned to an ancient version, an Eastern design, used by first millennium pontiffs. He has also worn the red satin <!--del_lnk--> mozzetta and its ermine-trimmed winter version that has not been seen since <!--del_lnk--> Pope Paul VI. His house <!--del_lnk--> cassock (<!--del_lnk--> simar or cassock with shoulder cape) also includes the upper half-sleeves discontinued for all other clerics by the authority of Paul VI&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> motu proprio &quot;<i>Pontificalis Domus</i>&quot; of 1968. Pope Benedict XVI has also continued the use of the red papal outdoor cloak. On <!--del_lnk--> December 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the pope began wearing the <!--del_lnk--> camauro for his general audiences; the traditional papal hat had not been seen since the pontificate of <!--del_lnk--> Pope John XXIII (1958 - 1963). On <!--del_lnk--> September 6, 2006 the pope wore the red capello Romano (also called a saturno). Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.<p>One item of clothing that Benedict has not worn to date is the <!--del_lnk--> papal tiara. Like his two immediate predecessors, Benedict chose not to be crowned with the tiara during his Inauguration Mass, nor has he worn it since that time. Other traditional items unused by the pope include the vestmental gloves, known as <!--del_lnk--> gauntlets.<p><a id="Pastoral_activity" name="Pastoral_activity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pastoral activity</span></h3>
      <p>Pope Benedict has continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of 2006, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.<p><a id="Beatifications" name="Beatifications"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Beatifications</span></h4>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Benedict XVI began the <!--del_lnk--> beatification process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person&#39;s death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, <!--del_lnk--> Camillo Cardinal Ruini, <!--del_lnk--> Vicar General of the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the <!--del_lnk--> cause for canonization of any person who dies within that diocese, cited &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. The &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; apparently refer to the cries of &quot;Santo subito!&quot; (&quot;Saint now!&quot;) during the late pontiff&#39;s funeral (saints can be declared by popular acclaim, although this is rare). Therefore, the Pope waived the five year rule &quot;so that the cause of Beatification and Canonization of the same Servant of God can begin immediately.&quot; The decision was announced on <!--del_lnk--> May 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the Feast of <!--del_lnk--> Our Lady of Fatima and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II&#39;s life. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fatima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<p>The first beatification under the new Pope was celebrated on <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Cardinal Saraiva Martins. The new Blesseds were <!--del_lnk--> Mother Marianne Cope and <!--del_lnk--> Mother Ascensi&oacute;n Nicol Go&ntilde;i. <!--del_lnk--> Mariano de la Mata is reported to be beatified in November 2006, and Fr. <!--del_lnk--> Basil Moreau scheduled to be beatified by next year.<p>Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On <!--del_lnk--> September 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a communiqu&eacute; announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the Pope, usually the Prefect of that Congregation.<p><a id="Canonizations" name="Canonizations"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Canonizations</span></h4>
      <p>Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his first Canonizations on <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 in <!--del_lnk--> St. Peter&#39;s Square when he canonized <!--del_lnk--> Josef Bilczewski, <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Hurtado SJ, <!--del_lnk--> Zygmunt Gorazdowski, <!--del_lnk--> Gaetano Catanoso, and <!--del_lnk--> Felice da Nicosia. The canonizations were part of a Mass that marked the conclusion of the <!--del_lnk--> Synod of Bishops and the <!--del_lnk--> Year of the Eucharist. Pope Benedict XVI canonized <!--del_lnk--> Bishop Rafael Guizar Valencia, <!--del_lnk--> Mother Theodore Guerin, <!--del_lnk--> Filippo Smaldone, and <!--del_lnk--> Rosa Venerini on <!--del_lnk--> October 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p><a id="The_Curia" name="The_Curia"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Curia</span></h3>
      <p><a id="Appointments" name="Appointments"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Appointments</span></h4>
      <p>Since their terms had ended on the death of the previous pope, Benedict reappointed after his election all former senior officers of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Curia, though most only in a provisional manner. This assured an easy transition into a new pontificate.<p>Benedict&#39;s first major new appointment was that of his successor as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. On <!--del_lnk--> May 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Benedict XVI appointed Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> William Levada, <!--del_lnk--> Archbishop of San Francisco, of the United States of America. Levada participated in the drafting of the <!--del_lnk--> Catechism of the Catholic Church, although his private views are not well known.<p>This appointment was followed by that of Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Malcom Ranjith as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and Discipline of the Sacraments. Archbishop Ranjith, known to be a traditional Catholic who has long been close to the positions of Joseph Ratzinger, replaced Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Domenico Sorrentino, who was recently appointed Bishop of Assisi.<p>The principal political office, the <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal Secretary of State, which is often likened to the pope&#39;s Prime Minister, is <!--del_lnk--> Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, replacing <!--del_lnk--> Angelo Cardinal Sodano.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 31 October <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Pope Benedict appointed <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal Hummes to be the Prefect for the <!--del_lnk--> Congregation for the Clergy, succeeding <!--del_lnk--> Dar&iacute;o Cardinal Castrill&oacute;n Hoyos due to his age.<p><a id="Reform" name="Reform"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Reform</span></h4>
      <p>Pope Benedict began slimming the structure of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Curia, when he merged four existing pontifical councils into two in March 2006. The <!--del_lnk--> Pontifical Council for Migrants and the <!--del_lnk--> Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace were consolidated into one office headed by Justice and Peace Cardinal President <!--del_lnk--> Renato Raffaele Martino. Likewise, Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> Paul Poupard, who headed the <!--del_lnk--> Pontifical Council for Culture, now also oversees the operations of what had been the <!--del_lnk--> Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue. In the short term, two top prelates &mdash; Japanese Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Fumio Hamao and British Archbishop Michael Fitzgerald &mdash; lost their Curial positions in the mergers.<p><a id="Teachings" name="Teachings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Teachings</span></h3>
      <p>As Pope, Benedict XVI&#39;s main role is to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, a role that he can play well as a former head of the Church&#39;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in <!--del_lnk--> Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.<p><a id="Friendship_with_Jesus_Christ" name="Friendship_with_Jesus_Christ"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Friendship with Jesus Christ</span></h4>

      <p>&quot;Friendship with Jesus Christ&quot; is a theme of his preaching which is found in many of Benedict&#39;s homilies and addresses, for example his address to the priests of Rome, his Episcopal diocese, to the cardinals in the pre-conclave, and to an audience of 150,000 people, among whom were children going to their First Communion. He has also said: &quot;We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... (T)hat all we have to do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history.&quot;<p>He took up this theme once more in his first encyclical <!--del_lnk--> Deus Caritas Est. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: &quot;If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them.&quot; Thus, he said that <!--del_lnk--> prayer is &quot;urgently needed...It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work.&quot;<p><a name=".22Dictatorship_of_Relativism.22"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;Dictatorship of Relativism&quot;</span></h4>

      <p>He added that the world is &quot;moving towards a dictatorship of <!--del_lnk--> relativism.&quot; Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the twentieth century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides: during World Youth Day, he said &quot;Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism&quot;.<p>In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of <!--del_lnk--> St. John Lateran <!--del_lnk--> June 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of <!--del_lnk--> same-sex marriage and <!--del_lnk--> abortion:<dl>
       <dd>The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born.</dl>
      <p>This has drawn sharp criticism from Catholic <!--del_lnk--> gay rights advocates like journalist <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Sullivan, who claim that Benedict is espousing a form of <!--del_lnk--> fundamentalist edict, and is opposed to external questioning of his doctrines. Supporters of the Pope argue that traditional Catholic teachings hold homosexual acts (as opposed to merely a homosexual <i>orientation</i>) as sinful and that Benedict XVI is simply being loyal to these teachings.<p><a id="Christianity_as_the_Religion_according_to_Reason" name="Christianity_as_the_Religion_according_to_Reason"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Christianity as the Religion according to Reason</span></h4>

      <p>Speaking at his weekly audience in St Peter&#39;s Square on 7 June, 2006, Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle <!--del_lnk--> Peter. &quot;Peter&#39;s responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ,&quot; said Pope Benedict. &quot;Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us.&quot; The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the Pope has a leading role among Christians because as bishop of Rome he is successor to the apostle Peter who first held the office. The role of the Roman Catholic papacy remains a source of controversy, not only for <!--del_lnk--> Protestant denominations but also for <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Orthodox churches and members of the <!--del_lnk--> Restorationism movement, which does not accept the dogmas of the <!--del_lnk--> First Vatican Council.<p>The bishops of the Ecumenical <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox <!--del_lnk--> Patriarchate of Constantinople have expressed concern over Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s decision to drop &quot;patriarch of the West&quot; from his official titles in the Vatican yearbook. In a <!--del_lnk--> June 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 statement, the chief secretary of the <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox bishops&#39; synod said dropping &quot;patriarch of the West&quot; while retaining the titles &quot;vicar of Jesus Christ&quot; and &quot;supreme pontiff of the universal church&quot; is &quot;perceived as implying a universal jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome over the entire church, which is something the <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox have never accepted.&quot; The statement was issued after synod members discussed the change during their early June meeting. <!--del_lnk--> Cardinal <!--del_lnk--> Walter Kasper, president of the <!--del_lnk--> Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, said in a March statement that dropping the title of patriarch in reference to the pope does not minimize the importance of the patriarchal office, particularly in relation to the ancient Eastern churches. &quot;Even less can this suppression be seen as implying new claims&quot; of power or authority on the part of the Vatican, he said. However, members of the Orthodox synod disagreed. From their point of view, &quot;the geographical limits of each ecclesiastical jurisdiction&quot; have been a key part of the structure of the church from the earliest days of Christianity. The church as a whole is &quot;a unity of full local churches&quot; and not a monolith divided into local units simply for the sake of easier governance. The <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox synod&#39;s statement said that, with the international Catholic-Orthodox theological dialogue set to begin again in September with plans to deal with the &quot;thorny problem&quot; of papal primacy, it would have been better not to have dropped the title without consultation.<p>A leading <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian Orthodox spokesman has said that a visit to Ukraine by Pope Benedict XVI would be &quot;untimely,&quot; according to the country&#39;s RISU news service. &quot;If Pope Benedict is a moral and a spiritual person and wants only good for Ukraine and its people, he will never take such an unreasonable step,&quot; said Valentyn Lukianyk, the head of the Union of Orthodox Brotherhoods of <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. He was responding to the news that Ukrainian President <!--del_lnk--> Viktor Yushchenko has invited the Pope to visit the country. There have been numerous clashes between <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox and Catholic believers over the ownership of parish properties that were confiscated by the <!--del_lnk--> Communists and handed over to Orthodox clerics. At the same time, Orthodox leaders have complained that Catholics are engaged in &quot;proselytism,&quot; seeking converts among Orthodox believers. In his statement opposing a papal visit, Lukianyk said that relations between Catholics and Orthodox in Ukraine are now &quot;warming.&quot; A visit by Pope Benedict, he said, would place an undue burden on those sensitive ties.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> March 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Gov. <!--del_lnk--> Mitt Romney received a special invitation &mdash; to attend the elevation of Boston Archbishop <!--del_lnk--> Sean O&#39;Malley to cardinal at the Vatican.

Starting from <!--del_lnk--> 1870, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Patriarch of the West&quot; was also one of the pope&#39;s formal titles, but on <!--del_lnk--> 1 March <!--del_lnk--> 2006 the Vatican announced that it would no longer be used.<p>The title &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot;, which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before &quot;Primate of Italy,&quot; has rarely been employed since the <a href="../../wp/e/East-West_Schism.htm" title="East-West Schism">East-West Schism</a> of 1054. The title of &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; was first adopted in the year 642 by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Theodore I.

However, some Catholic theologians have argued that the term &quot;Patriarch of the West&quot; has no clear historical or theological basis and was introduced into papal court in 1870, at the time of the <!--del_lnk--> First Vatican Council. Pope Benedict chose to remove the title at a time when discussions with the Orthodox churches have centered on the issue of papal primacy. It has also been suggested that &quot;the West&quot; is a misnomer as the modern <!--del_lnk--> Latin Church is today global in its extent. <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> reportedly considered dropping the title during his own pontificate.<p>(Note on numbering: <!--del_lnk--> Pope Benedict X is now considered an <!--del_lnk--> anti-pope. At the time, however, this fact was not recognized and so the tenth true Pope Benedict took the official number XI. This caused the true fifteenth Pope Benedict to take the number XVI.

      <p>In an interview in 2004 for <i><!--del_lnk--> Le Figaro</i> magazine, Ratzinger said that <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, a country <!--del_lnk--> Muslim by heritage and population, but staunchly <!--del_lnk--> secularist by its state constitution, should seek its future in an association of <!--del_lnk--> Islamic nations rather than the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, which has <!--del_lnk--> Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been &quot;in permanent contrast to <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>&quot; and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake.<p>It was widely reported in April 2006 that the Vatican had launched a commission to investigate and prepare a document regarding the question of whether there are any cases when a married person may use condoms to protect against infection from their spouse. Though no conclusions have yet been reached, the investigation has surprised many Catholics in the wake of <a href="../../wp/p/Pope_John_Paul_II.htm" title="Pope John Paul II">John Paul II&#39;s</a> consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> and the widespread belief that his successor shared this view. In November 2005 the Pope had listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts with no mention of condoms. However, Time Magazine reported in its <!--del_lnk--> April 30, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 edition that the Vatican&#39;s position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials &quot;flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use.&quot;<p>In May 2006, Pope Benedict rebuked <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> for the &quot;painful&quot; social plight of <!--del_lnk--> Aborigines, and urged the Australian people to seek their forgiveness. He told the new Australian ambassador to the Holy See, <!--del_lnk--> Anne Plunkett, that Australians needed to match their reputation as international peace-brokers with a determination for justice on their own soil, saying, &quot;In regard to the Aboriginal people of your land, there is still much to be achieved&quot;. Benedict XVI - who intends to visit Sydney for <!--del_lnk--> World Youth Day in 2008 - said lasting reconciliation could be achieved through the &quot;healing process&quot; of forgiveness.<p>Pope Benedict has also promoted various <!--del_lnk--> UN events, such as <!--del_lnk--> World Refugee Day, on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees&#39; human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help. <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Pope Benedict XVI urged Christians to reject those who &ldquo;falsify the Word of Christ,&rdquo; which was seen as an allusion to the controversy over the novel <!--del_lnk--> Da Vinci Code. Addressing a huge open-air mass in central Warsaw on the second day of his visit to Poland, the pontiff used his homily to warn against the temptation of doctoring what he said were Biblical truths. He stated: &ldquo;As in past centuries, so today there are people or groups who seek to falsify the Word of Christ and to remove from the Gospel those truths which in their view are too uncomfortable for modern man.&quot; In US author <!--del_lnk--> Dan Brown&rsquo;s novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Da Vinci Code</i>, Jesus is said to have fathered a daughter with Mary Magdalene whose bloodline continues to this day.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, for the first time in more than five years, an official Vatican delegation visited <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and met with government officials, signaling a warming between the two nations that had previously been locked in conflict. &quot;This is a real gesture by the Vatican and its diplomats,&quot; said the Reverend Bernardo Cervellera, director of AsiaNews, a Catholic missionary news service with close links to the Vatican. In sending diplomats to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, the Vatican, under Pope Benedict XVI, is publicly expressing interest in improving relations with China despite the recent conflicts.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> August, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the pope granted an exclusive interview with the German TV station <!--del_lnk--> ZDF. It was aired on <!--del_lnk--> August 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. In this interview, he revealed a surprising and unexpected perspective in his thoughts, making amicable remarks about the Protestant churches, emphasizing the role of women in church, and said that &quot;church is not an accumulation of prohibitions, but a positive option&quot; (&quot;der Katholizismus ist nicht eine Ansammlung von Verboten, sondern eine positive Option&quot;). He also stressed several times that the church was a way to guide people, particularly in questions of AIDS and overpopulation, and therefore strong morals should be proclaimed. As a side note, he also stressed that humour is a good way to cope with stress, even for popes.<p>Shortly afterwards, Pope Benedict XVI also warned about the dangers of excessive work. He quoted <!--del_lnk--> St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who said, &quot;See where these accursed occupations can lead you, if you continue to lose yourself in them.&quot; The Pope himself said: &quot;Numerous occupations often lead to &#39;hardness of heart.&#39; They are no more than suffering for the spirit, loss of intelligence and dispersion of grace.&quot;<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Monday the North Korean nuclear dispute should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. &ldquo;The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearization of the <!--del_lnk--> Korean Peninsula.&quot; Benedict said in a speech to the new Japanese ambassador to Vatican.<p>In a message released <!--del_lnk--> November 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, exiles, evacuees and internally displaced people. &ldquo;The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families,&rdquo; the pope said. &ldquo;Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done.&rdquo;<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI&quot;</div>
