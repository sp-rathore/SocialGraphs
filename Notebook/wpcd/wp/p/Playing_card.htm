      <p>A <b>playing card</b> is a typically hand-sized piece of heavy paper or thin plastic. A complete set of cards is a <b>pack</b> or <b>deck</b>. A deck of cards is used for playing one of many <a href="../../wp/c/Card_game.htm" title="Card game">card games</a>, some of which include <!--del_lnk--> gambling. Because they are both standard and commonly available, playing cards are often adapted for other uses, such as <!--del_lnk--> magic tricks, <!--del_lnk--> cartomancy, or building a <!--del_lnk--> house of cards.<p>The front (or &quot;face&quot;) of each card carries markings that distinguish it from the other cards and determine its use under the rules of the game being played. The back of each card is identical for all cards, usually a plain colour or abstract design. In most games, the cards are assembled into a deck, and their order is <!--del_lnk--> randomized by <!--del_lnk--> shuffling<p>

      <p>The origin of playing cards is obscure, but it is almost certain that they began in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> after the invention of <!--del_lnk--> paper. Ancient Chinese &quot;money cards&quot; have four &quot;suits&quot;: coins (or cash), strings of coins (which may have been misinterpreted as sticks from crude drawings), myriads of strings, and tens of myriads. These were represented by <!--del_lnk--> ideograms, with numerals of 2&ndash;9 in the first three suits and numerals 1&ndash;9 in the &quot;tens of myriads&quot;. Wilkinson suggests in <!--del_lnk--> The Chinese origin of playing cards that the first cards may have been actual paper currency which were both the tools of gaming and the stakes being played for. The designs on modern <!--del_lnk--> Mahjong tiles likely evolved from those earliest playing cards. However it may be that the first deck of cards ever printed was a Chinese domino deck, in whose cards we can see all the 21 combinations of a pair of dice. In Kuei-t&#39;ien-lu, a chinese text redacted in the 11th century, we found that dominoes cards were printed during the T&rsquo;ang dynasty, contemporarily to the first books. The Chinese word <i>p&aacute;i</i> (&#x724C;) is used to describe both paper cards and gaming tiles.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> Indian origin for playing cards has been suggested by the resemblance of symbols on some early <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> decks (traditional <!--del_lnk--> Sicilian cards, for example) to the ring, sword, cup, and baton classically depicted in the four hands of Indian statues. This is an area that still needs research.<p>The time and manner of the introduction of cards into Europe are matters of dispute. The 38th canon of the council of Worcester (1240) is often quoted as evidence of cards having been known in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> in the middle of the 13th century; but the games <i>de rege et regina</i> there mentioned are now thought to more likely have been <a href="../../wp/c/Chess.htm" title="Chess">chess</a>. If cards were generally known in Europe as early as <!--del_lnk--> 1278, it is very remarkable that <!--del_lnk--> Petrarch, in his work <i>De remediis utriusque fortunae</i> that treats gaming, never once mentions them. <!--del_lnk--> Boccaccio, <!--del_lnk--> Chaucer and other writers of that time specifically refer to various games, but there is not a single passage in their works that can be fairly construed to refer to cards. Passages have been quoted from various works, of or relative to this period, but modern research leads to the supposition that the word rendered cards has often been mistranslated or <!--del_lnk--> interpolated.<p>It is likely that the ancestors of modern cards arrived in Europe from the <!--del_lnk--> Mamelukes of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in the late <!--del_lnk--> 1300s, by which time they had already assumed a form very close to those in use today. In particular, the Mameluke deck contained 52 cards comprising four &quot;suits&quot;: polo sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten &quot;spot&quot; cards (cards identified by the number of suit symbols or &quot;pips&quot; they show) and three &quot;court&quot; cards named <i>malik</i> (King), <i>n&#x101;&#39;ib malik</i> (Viceroy or Deputy King), and <i>th&#x101;n&#x12B; n&#x101;&#39;ib</i> (Second or Under-Deputy). The Mameluke court cards showed abstract designs not depicting persons (at least not in any surviving specimens) though they did bear the names of military officers. A complete pack of Mameluke playing cards was discovered by <!--del_lnk--> L.A. Mayer in the <!--del_lnk--> Topkapi Sarayi Museum, Istanbul, in 1939 <!--del_lnk--> ; this particular complete pack was not made before 1400, but the complete deck allowed matching to a private fragment dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century. In effect it&rsquo;s not a complete deck, but there are cards of three different packs of the same style (International Playing Cards Society Journal 30-3 page 139) There is some evidence to suggest that this deck may have evolved from an earlier 48-card deck that had only two court cards per suit, and some further evidence to suggest that earlier Chinese cards brought to Europe may have travelled to Persia, which then influenced the Mameluke and other Egyptian cards of the time before their reappearance in Europe.<p>It is not known whether these cards influenced the design of the Indian cards used for the game of <!--del_lnk--> Ganjifa, or whether the Indian cards may have influenced these. Regardless, the Indian cards have many distinctive features: they are round, generally hand painted with intricate designs, and comprise more than four suits (often as many as thirty two, like a deck in the Deutsches Spielkarten-Museum, painted in the Mewar, a city in Rajasthan, between the 18th and 19th century. Decks used to play have from eight up to twenty different suits).<p>In <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belarus.htm" title="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and other ex-<a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> countries, often 36 card Anglo-American card decks are used, with cards 2 to 5 left out, making 6 the lowest value.<p><a id="Spread_across_Europe_and_early_design_changes" name="Spread_across_Europe_and_early_design_changes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spread across Europe and early design changes</span></h3>
      <p>In the late 1300s, the use of playing cards spread rapidly across Europe. The first widely accepted references to cards are in <!--del_lnk--> 1371 in Spain, in 1377 in Switzerland, and, in 1380, they are referenced in many locations including Florence, Paris, and Barcelona <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> . A Paris ordinance dated 1369 does not mention cards; its 1377 update includes cards. In the account-books of <!--del_lnk--> Johanna, duchess of Brabant, and her husband, Wenceslaus of Luxemburg, there is an entry dated May 14, 1379 as follows: &quot;Given to Monsieur and Madame four peters, two forms, value eight and a half moutons, wherewith to buy a pack of cards&quot;. An early mention of a distinct series of playing cards is the entry of Charles or Charbot Poupart, treasurer of the household of <!--del_lnk--> Charles VI of France, in his book of accounts for 1392 or 1393, which records payment for the painting of three sets or packs of cards, which were evidently already well known.<p>It is clear that the earliest cards were executed by hand, like those designed for Charles VI. However, this was quite expensive, so other means were needed to mass-produce them. It is possible that the use of <!--del_lnk--> woodcut on <!--del_lnk--> paper, which led to the art of printing, developed because of the demand for implements of play. The technique of printing <!--del_lnk--> woodcuts was transferred from use to decorate fabric to use on <!--del_lnk--> paper around 1400, very shortly after the first recorded manufacture of paper in Christian Europe, as opposed to <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Spain where it was was much older (see <!--del_lnk--> Old master print for this]). No examples from before 1423 survive, but it is clear that most cards of that period were printed as <!--del_lnk--> woodcuts by the early card makers or cardpainters of Ulm, Nuremberg, and Augsburg, from about 1418 to 1450 <!--del_lnk--> , and that playing cards competed with devotional images as the most common uses for <!--del_lnk--> woodcut in this period.<p>Most early woodcuts of all types were coloured after printing, either by hand or, from about 1450 onwards, stencils. No playing cards engraved on wood exist whose creation can be confirmed as earlier than 1423 (the earliest dated <!--del_lnk--> woodcut generally accepted). However, in this period professional card makers were established in Germany, so it has been speculated that woodcut was employed to produce cuts for sacred subjects before it was applied to cards, but that hand-painting and stencilling were used for cards before images of saints. The German <i>Briefmaler</i> or card-painter probably progressed into the woodcut maker.<p>The first master of the newly invented <a href="../../wp/p/Printmaking.htm" title="Printmaking">printmaking</a> technique of <!--del_lnk--> engraving is known as the <i>Master of the Playing Cards</i> although he also produced religious images. He worked in Germany in the 1430&#39;s. Several other important <!--del_lnk--> engravers also made cards, including <!--del_lnk--> Master ES and <!--del_lnk--> Martin Schongauer , and the unknown masters of two &quot;tarocchi&quot; series from Italy. But in general <!--del_lnk--> engraving was much more expensive than <!--del_lnk--> woodcut, and engraved cards must have been relatively unusual.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Europeans experimented with the structure of playing cards, particularly in the 1400s. Europeans changed the court cards to represent European royalty and attendants, originally &quot;king&quot;, &quot;chevalier&quot;, and &quot;knave&quot; (or &quot;servant&quot;). Queens were introduced in a number of different ways. In an early surviving German pack (dated in the 1440s), Queens replace Kings in two of the suits as the highest card. Throughout the 1400s, 56-card decks containing a King, Queen, Knight, and Valet were common. Suits also varied; many makers saw no need to have a standard set of names for the suits, so early decks often had different suit names (typically 4 suits, although 5 suits also had been common and other structures are also known). The cards manufactured by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> printers used in the later standard the suits of hearts, bells, leaves, and acorns still present in Eastern and Southeastern German decks today used for <!--del_lnk--> Skat and other games, in the very early time suits took many variations, however. Later Italian and Spanish cards of the 15th century used swords, batons, cups, and coins. It is likely that the <!--del_lnk--> Tarot deck was invented in Italy at that time, though it is often mistakenly believed to have been imported into Europe by Gypsies (see <!--del_lnk--> detailed studies, also the article <!--del_lnk--> Tarot). While originally and still today in some places, notably Europe (where French suited cards have been substituted in many regions for the older Italian suited decks) used for the game of <!--del_lnk--> Tarot or<!--del_lnk--> Tarock, the Tarot deck today is more often used for <!--del_lnk--> cartomancy and other occult practices. This probably came about in the 1780s, when occult philosophers <!--del_lnk-->  mistakenly associated the symbols on Tarot cards with Egyptian hieroglyphs.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The four <!--del_lnk--> suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs) now used in most of the world originated in France, approximately in <!--del_lnk--> 1480. These suits have generally prevailed because decks using them could be made more cheaply; the former suits were all drawings which had to be reproduced by <!--del_lnk--> woodcuts, but the French suits could be made by <!--del_lnk--> stencil. The <i>tr&egrave;fle</i>, so named for its resemblance to the trefoil leaf, was probably copied from the acorn; the <i>pique</i> similarly from the leaf of the German suits, while its name derived from the sword of the Italian suits (alternative opinion: derived from the German word &quot;Spaten&quot;, which is a tool like &quot;Schippe&quot; and in optical sense similar to the Pique-sign; &quot;Schippe&quot; is a German slang-name for Pique) <!--del_lnk--> . In England the French suits were used, and are named hearts, clubs (corresponding to <i>tr&egrave;fle</i>, the French symbol being joined to the Italian name, <i>bastoni</i>), spades (corresponding to the French <i>pique</i>, but having the Italian name, <i>spade</i> = sword) and diamonds. This confusion of names and symbols is accounted for by Chatto thus:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;If cards were actually known in Italy and Spain in the latter part of the 14th century, it is not unlikely that the game was introduced into this country by some of the English soldiers who had served under <!--del_lnk--> Hawkwood and other <!--del_lnk--> free captains in the wars of Italy and Spain. However this may be, it seems certain that the earliest cards commonly used in this country were of the same kind, with respect to the marks of the suits, as those used in Italy and Spain.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p>Court cards have likewise undergone some changes in design and name. Early court cards were elaborate full-length figures; the French in particular often gave them the names of particular heroes and heroines from history and fable. A prolific manufacturing centre in the 1500s was <!--del_lnk--> Rouen, which originated many of the basic design elements of court cards still present in modern decks. It is likely that the Rouennais cards were popular imports in England, establishing their design as standard there, though other designs became more popular in Europe (particularly in France, where the Parisian design became standard). There is some speculation that the common King of Hearts was designed as a tribute to <!--del_lnk--> Donatello&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Judith and Holophernes</i>.<p>Rouen courts are traditionally named as follows: the kings of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs are <!--del_lnk--> David, Charles (<a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>), <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Caesar</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander</a>, respectively. The knaves (or &quot;jacks&quot;; French &quot;valet&quot;) are <!--del_lnk--> Hector (prince of Troy), <!--del_lnk--> La Hire (comrade-in-arms to Joan of Arc), <!--del_lnk--> Ogier (a knight of Charlemagne) and <!--del_lnk--> Judas Maccabeus (who led the Jewish rebellion against the Syrians). The queens are <!--del_lnk--> Pallas (warrior goddess; equivalent to the Greek Athena or Roman Minerva), <!--del_lnk--> Rachel (biblical mother of Joseph), Argine (the origin of which is obscure; it is an <!--del_lnk--> anagram of <i><!--del_lnk--> regina</i>, which is <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> for queen) and Judith (from <!--del_lnk--> Book of Judith). Parisian tradition uses the same names, but assigns them to different suits: the kings of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs are David, Charles, Caesar, and Alexander; the queens are Pallas, Judith, Rachel, and Argine; the knaves are Ogier, La Hire, Hector, and Judas Maccabee. Oddly, the Parisian names have become more common in modern use, even with cards of Rouennais design. (See the <!--del_lnk--> Nine Worthies for another medieval collection of knightly heroes.)<p><a id="Later_design_changes" name="Later_design_changes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later design changes</span></h3>
      <p>In early games the kings were <i>always</i> the highest card in their suit. However, as early as the late 1400s special significance began to be placed on the nominally lowest card, now called the Ace, so that it sometimes became the highest card and the Two, or Deuce, the lowest. This concept may have been hastened in the late 1700s by the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, where games began being played &quot;ace high&quot; as a symbol of lower classes rising in power above the royalty. The term &quot;Ace&quot; itself comes from a dicing term in <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman language, which is itself derived from the Latin <i>as</i> (the smallest unit of coinage). Another dicing term, <i>trey</i> (3), sometimes shows up in playing card games.<p>Corner and edge indices enabled people to hold their cards close together in a fan with one hand (instead of the two hands previously used). For cards with Latin suits the first pack known is a deck printed by Infirerra and dated 1693 (International Playing Cards Society Journal 30-1 page 34), but were commonly used only at the end of 18th century. Indices in the Anglo-American deck were used from 1875, when the New York Consolidated Card Company patented the Squeezers, the first cards with indices that had a large diffusion. However the first deck with this innovation was the Saladee&#39;s Patent, printed by Samuel Hart in 1864). Before this time, the lowest court card in an English deck was officially termed the <i>Knave</i>, but its abbreviation (&quot;Kn&quot;) was too similar to the King (&quot;K&quot;). However, from the 1600s on the Knave had often been termed the <i>Jack</i>, a term borrowed from the game <!--del_lnk--> All Fours where the Knave of trumps is termed the Jack. All Fours was considered a low-class game, so the use of the term Jack at one time was considered vulgar. The use of indices changed the formal name of the lowest court card to <!--del_lnk--> Jack.<p>This was followed by the innovation of reversible court cards. This invention is attributed to a French cards maker of Agen, main city in the <!--del_lnk--> Lot-et-Garonne department, that in 1745 had this idea. But the French government, that controlled the design of playing cards, prohibited the printing of cards with this innovation. In central Europe (trappola cards), Italy (tarocchino bolognese) and in Spain the innovation was adopted during the second half of 18th century. In Great Britain the deck with reversible court cards was patented in 1799 by Edmund Ludlow and Ann Wilcox. The Anglo-American pack with this design was printed around 1802 by Thomas Wheeler (International Playing Cards Society Journal XXVII-5 p. 186 and International Playing Cards Society Journal 31-1 p. 22). Reversible court cards meant that players would not be tempted to make upside-down court cards right side up. Before this, other players could often get a hint of what other players&#39; hands contained by watching them reverse their cards. This innovation required abandoning some of the design elements of the earlier full-length courts.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> joker is an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> innovation. Created for the Alsatian game of <!--del_lnk--> Euchre, it spread to Europe from America along with the spread of <!--del_lnk--> Poker.Was ideated around 1865 by Samuel Hart. The initial denomination of the card was Best or Imperial Bower (Bauer or Boer in German language is the name of the jack of trump in the game of Euchre). From the Alsatian name of the game, Juker, derived the actual appellative of the card. Although the joker card often bears the image of a fool (possibly derived from the stereotypical <!--del_lnk--> village idiot), which is one of the images of the Tarot deck, it is not believed that there is any relation. In contemporary decks, one of the two jokers is often more colorful or more intricately detailed than the other, though this feature is not used in most card games. The two jokers are often differentiated as &quot;Big&quot; and &quot;Little,&quot; or more commonly, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Black.&quot; In many card games the jokers are not used. Unlike face cards, the design of jokers varies widely. Many manufacturers use them to carry trademark designs.<p>In the twentieth century, a means for coating cards with plastic was invented, and has taken over the market, producing a durable product. An example of what the old cardboard product was like is documented in <!--del_lnk--> Buster Keaton&#39;s silent comedy <!--del_lnk--> The Navigator, in which the forlorn comic tries to shuffle and play cards during a rainstorm.<p><a id="Alleged_symbolism" name="Alleged_symbolism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alleged symbolism</span></h3>

      <p>Popular legend holds that the composition of a deck of cards has religious, metaphysical or astronomical significance: typical <!--del_lnk--> numerological elements of the explanation are that the four suits represent the four seasons, the 13 cards per suit are the 13 phases of the <!--del_lnk--> lunar cycle, black and red are for day and night, the 52 cards of the deck (joker excluded) symbolizes the number of weeks in a year, and finally, if the value of each card is added up &mdash; and 1 is added, which is generally explained away as being for a single joker &mdash; the result is 365, the number of days in a year.

      <p>The primary deck of fifty-two playing cards in use today, called <b>Anglo-American playing cards</b>, includes thirteen ranks of each of the four French <!--del_lnk--> suits, spades (<span style="color:black; background-color:white;">&spades;</span>), hearts (<span style="color:red; background-color:white;">&hearts;</span>), diamonds (<span style="color:red; background-color:white;">&diams;</span>) and clubs (<span style="color:black; background-color:white;">&clubs;</span>), with reversible Rouennais court cards. Each suit includes an <!--del_lnk--> ace, depicting a single symbol of its suit; a king, queen, and jack, each depicted with a symbol of its suit; and ranks two through ten, with each card depicting that many symbols (<i>pips</i>) of its suit. Two (sometimes one or four) Jokers, often distinguishable with one being more colorful than the other, are included in commercial decks but many games require one or both to be removed before play. Modern playing cards carry index labels on opposite corners (rarely, all four corners) to facilitate identifying the cards when they overlap.<p>The fanciful design and manufacturer&#39;s logo commonly displayed on the <!--del_lnk--> Ace of Spades began under the reign of <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>, who passed a law requiring an insignia on that card as proof of payment of a <!--del_lnk--> tax on local manufacture of cards. Until <!--del_lnk--> August 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1960, decks of playing cards printed and sold in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> were liable for taxable duty and the Ace of Spades carried an indication of the name of the printer and the fact that taxation had been paid on the cards. The packs were also sealed with a government <!--del_lnk--> duty wrapper.<p>Though specific design elements of the court cards are rarely used in game play, a few are notable. The Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts, and King of Diamonds are drawn in profile, while the rest of the courts are shown in full face, these cards are commonly called &quot;one-eyed&quot;. When deciding which cards are to be made wild in some games, the phrase, &quot;acey, deucey, one-eyed jack,&quot; is sometimes used, which means that <!--del_lnk--> aces, twos, and the one-eyed jacks are all wild. Another such variation, &quot;deuces, aces, one-eyed faces,&quot; is used to indicate aces, twos, the Jack of Hearts, the Jack of Spades, and the King of Diamonds are wild. The King of Hearts is shown with a <!--del_lnk--> sword behind his head, leading to the nickname &quot;suicide king&quot;. The Jack of Diamonds is sometimes known as &quot;laughing boy&quot;. The King of Diamonds is armed with an ax while the other three kings are armed with swords. The King of Diamonds is sometimes referred to as &quot;the man with the ax&quot; because of this. The Ace of Spades, unique in its large, ornate spade, is sometimes said to be the death card, and in some games is used as a trump card. The Queen of Spades appears to hold a <!--del_lnk--> scepter and is sometimes known as &quot;the bedpost queen.&quot;<p>There are theories about who the court cards represent. For example, the Queen of Hearts is believed by some to be a representation of <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth of York - the <!--del_lnk--> Queen consort of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VII of England">King Henry VII of England</a>. The United States Playing Card Company suggests that in the past, the King of Hearts was <a href="../../wp/c/Charlemagne.htm" title="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, the King of Diamonds was <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, the King of Clubs was <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, and the King of Spades was the Biblical <!--del_lnk--> King David. However the Kings, Queens and Jacks of standard Anglo/American cards today do not represent anyone. They stem from designs produced in <!--del_lnk--> Rouen before 1516 and by 1540-67 these Rouen designs show well-executed pictures in the court cards with the typical court costumes of the time. In these early cards the Jack of Spades, Jack of Hearts and the King of Diamonds are shown from the rear, with their heads turned back over the shoulder so that they are seen in profile. However the Rouen cards were so badly copied in England that the current designs are gross distortions of the originals.<p>Other oddities such as the lack of a moustache on the King of Hearts also have little significance. The King of Hearts did originally have a moustache but it was lost by poor copying of the original design. Similarly the objects carried by the court cards have no significance. They merely differentiate one court card from another and have also become distorted over time.<p>The most common sizes for playing cards are poker size (<i>2&frac12;in &times; 3&frac12;in</i>; <i>62 mm &times; 88 mm</i>, or B8 size according to <!--del_lnk--> ISO 216) and bridge size (<i>2&frac14;in &times; 3&frac12;in</i>, approx. <i>56 mm &times; 88 mm</i>), the latter being more suitable for games such as <!--del_lnk--> bridge in which a large number of cards must be held concealed in a player&#39;s hand. Interestingly, in most casino poker games, the bridge sized card is used. Other sizes are also available, such as a smaller size (usually <i>1&frac34;in &times; 2&#x215D;in</i>, approx. <i>44 mm &times; 66 mm</i>) for <!--del_lnk--> solitaire and larger ones for card tricks.<p>Some decks include additional design elements. <!--del_lnk--> Casino <a href="../../wp/b/Blackjack.htm" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> decks may include markings intended for a machine to check the ranks of cards, or shifts in rank location to allow a manual check via inlaid mirror. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of the usual two. Many decks have large indices, largely for use in <!--del_lnk--> stud poker games, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small. Some decks use <!--del_lnk--> four colors for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart: the most common set of colors is black (spades <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">&spades;</span>), red (hearts <span style="color:red; background-color:white;">&hearts;</span>), blue (diamonds <span style="color:blue; background-color:white;">&diams;</span>) and green (clubs <span style="color:green; background-color:white;">&clubs;</span>).<p>When giving the full written name of a specific card, the rank is given first followed by the suit, e.g., &quot;Ace of Spades&quot;. Shorthand notation may list the rank first &quot;A&spades;&quot; (as is typical when discussing <!--del_lnk--> poker) or list the suit first (as is typical in listing several cards in bridge) &quot;&spades;AKQ&quot;. Tens may be either abbreviated to T or written as 10.<p><a id="German" name="German"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">German</span></h3>
      <p>German suits may have different appearances. Many southern Germans prefer decks with hearts, bells, leaves, and acorns (for hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs), as mentioned above. In the game <!--del_lnk--> Skat, <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Germany players used the German deck, while players in western Germany mainly used the French deck. After the reunification a compromise deck was created, with French symbols, but German colors. Therefore, many &quot;French&quot; decks in Germany now have yellow or orange diamonds and green spades.<p>example <!--del_lnk--> Old German playing cards as produced by <!--del_lnk--> Altenburger Spielkartenfabrik<p><a id="Central_European" name="Central_European"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Central European</span></h3>

      <p>The cards of Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, and southern Tyrol use the same colors (hearts, bells, leaves and acorns) as the cards of Southern Germany. They usually have a deck of 32 or 36 cards. The numbering includes VII, VIII, IX, X, Under, Over, King and Ace. Some variations with 36 cards have also the number VI. The VI in bells also has the function like a joker in some games and it&#39;s named Welli or Weli.<p>These cards are illustrated with a special picture series that was born in the times before the 1848-49 Hungarian Freedom Fights, when revolutionary movements were awakening all over in Europe. The Aces show the four seasons: the ace of hearts is spring, the ace of bells is summer, the ace of leaves is autumn and the ace of acorns is winter. The characters of the Under and Over cards were taken from the drama, William Tell, written by Schiller in 1804, that was shown at Kolozsv&aacute;r (today Cluj-Napoca) in 1827. It was long believed that the card was invented in Vienna at the Card Painting Workshop of <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Piatnik, however in 1974 the very first deck was found in an English Private Collection, and it has shown the name of the inventor and creator of deck as Schneider J&oacute;zsef, a Master Card Painter at Pest, and the date of its creation as 1837. He has chosen the characters of a Swiss drama as his characters for his over and under cards; had he chosen Hungarian heroes or freedom fighters, his deck of cards would have never made it into distribution, due to the heavy censorship of the government at the time. Interestingly, although the characters on the cards are Swiss, these cards are unknown in Switzerland.<p>Games that are played with this deck in Hungary include Ulti, Snapszer (or 66), Zs&iacute;roz&aacute;s, Preferansz and L&oacute;rum. Explanations of these games can be found at <!--del_lnk--> The Card Games Website.<p><a id="Switzerland" name="Switzerland"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Switzerland</span></h3>
      <p>In the German speaking part of Switzerland, the prevalent deck consists of 36 playing cards with the following suits: roses, bells, acorns and shields. The ranks of the alternate deck, from low to high, are: 6, 7, 8, 9, banner (10), &quot;under&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, king and ace.<p><a id="Italian" name="Italian"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Italian</span></h3>
      <p>Italian playing cards most commonly consist of a deck of 40 cards (4 suits going 1 to 7 plus 3 face cards), and are used for playing Italian regional games such as <!--del_lnk--> Scopa or <!--del_lnk--> Briscola. 52 (or more rarely 36) card sets are also found in the north. Since these cards first appeared in the late 14th century when each region in Italy was a separately ruled province, there is no official Italian pattern. There are sixteen official regional patterns in use in different parts of the country (about one per <!--del_lnk--> province). These sixteen patterns are split amongst four regions:<ul>
       <li>Northern Italian Suits - <!--del_lnk--> Triestine, <!--del_lnk--> Trevigiane, <!--del_lnk--> Trentine, Primiera <a href="../../wp/b/Bologna.htm" title="Bologna">Bolognese</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bergamasche, <!--del_lnk--> Bresciane<li>Spanish-like Suits - <!--del_lnk--> Napoletane, <!--del_lnk--> Sarde, <!--del_lnk--> Romagnole, <!--del_lnk--> Siciliane, <!--del_lnk--> Piacentine.<li>French Suits - <!--del_lnk--> Genovesi, Lombarde or <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milanesi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Toscane, <!--del_lnk--> Piemontesi.<li>German Suits - <!--del_lnk--> Salisburghesi used in <!--del_lnk--> South Tyrol</ul>
      <p>The suits are coins (sometimes suns or sunbursts), swords, cups and clubs (sometimes batons), and each suit contains an ace (or one), numbers two through seven, and three face cards. The face cards are:<ul>
       <li>Re (<i>king</i>), the highest valued - a man standing, wearing a crown<li>Cavallo (lit. <i>horse</i>) [italo-spanish suits] - a man sitting on a horse / or Donna (lit. <i>woman</i> from latin <i>domina</i> = <i>mistress</i>) [french suits] - a standing woman with a crown<li>Fante (lit. <i>infantry soldier</i>) - a younger figure standing, without a crown</ul>
      <p>The spanish-like-suit knave (<i>fante</i> - the lowest face card) is depicted as a woman, and is sometimes referred to as <i>donna</i> like the next higher face card of the french-suit deck; this, when coupled with the french usage who puts a queen, also called <i>donna</i> (woman) in italian and not <i>regina</i> (queen), as the mid-valued face card, can very occasionally lead to a swap of the value of the french-suit <i>donna</i> (or more rarely of the international-card Queen) and the knave (or jack).<p>Unlike Anglo-American cards, some Italian cards do not have any numbers (or letters) identifying their value. The cards&#39; value is determined by identifying the face card or counting the number of suit characters.<p>Example: <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Triestine&quot; playing cards manufactured by <!--del_lnk--> Modiano<p><a id="Spanish" name="Spanish"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Spanish</span></h3>

      <p>The traditional <!--del_lnk--> Spanish deck (referred to as <i>baraja espa&ntilde;ola</i> in Spanish) uses Latin suit symbols, similar to Italian suited Tarots. However, the Spanish deck kept only the suit cards (with the exception of the 10s and the queens of each suit, which were dropped), while all of the trump cards from the Tarot deck were discarded. Being a <!--del_lnk--> Latin-suited deck (like the Italian deck), it is organized into four <i>palos</i> (suits) that closely match those of the Italian suited Tarot deck: <i>oros</i> (&quot;golds&quot; or coins), <i>copas</i> (beakers or cups), <i>espadas</i> (swords) and <i>bastos</i> (batons or clubs). Certain decks include two &quot;comodines&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> jokers) as well.<p>The cards (<i>naipes</i> or <i>cartas</i> in Spanish) are all numbered, but unlike in the standard Anglo-French deck, the card numbered 10 is the first of the court cards (instead of a card depicting ten coins/cups/swords/batons); so each suit has only twelve cards. The three court or face cards in each suit are as follows: <i>la sota</i> (&quot;the knave&quot; or jack, numbered 10 and equivalent to the Anglo-French card J), <i>el caballo</i> (&quot;the horse&quot;, horseman, knight or cavalier, numbered 11 and used instead of the Anglo-French card Q; note the Tarot decks have both a queen and a knight of each suit, while the Anglo-French deck uses the former, and the Spanish deck uses the latter), and finally <i>el rey</i> (&quot;the king&quot;, numbered 12 and equivalent to the Anglo-French card K). Many Spanish games involve forty-card decks, with the 8s and 9s removed, similar to the standard Italian deck.<p>The box that goes around the figure has a mark to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have an interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called &quot;la pinta&quot; and gave rise to the expression: &quot;le conoc&iacute; por la pinta&quot; (I knew him by his markings).<p>The Baraja have been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin-American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain which does not use the Anglo-French deck. Among other places, the Baraja have appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> and other Hispanic and Latin American literature.The Spanish deck is used not only in Spain, but also in other countries where Spain maintained an influence (<i>e.g.</i>, the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>) <!--del_lnk--> 1. Among the games played with this deck are: <i>el <!--del_lnk--> mus</i> (a very popular and highly regarded <!--del_lnk--> vying game of <!--del_lnk--> Basque origin), <i><!--del_lnk--> la brisca</i>, <i>el <!--del_lnk--> tute</i> (with many variations), <i>el <!--del_lnk--> gui&ntilde;ote</i>, <i>la <!--del_lnk--> escoba del quince</i> (a <!--del_lnk--> trick-taking game), <i>el <!--del_lnk--> julepe</i>, <i>el <!--del_lnk--> cinquillo</i>, <i>las <!--del_lnk--> siete y media</i>, <i>la <!--del_lnk--> mona</i>, <i>el truc</i> (or <i><!--del_lnk--> truco</i>), <i>el <!--del_lnk--> cuajo</i> (a <!--del_lnk--> matching game from the Philippines), <i>el <!--del_lnk--> jam&oacute;n</i>, el <!--del_lnk--> tonto, el <!--del_lnk--> hijoputa, and las <!--del_lnk--> parejas.<p><a id="Japanese" name="Japanese"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Japanese</span></h3>
