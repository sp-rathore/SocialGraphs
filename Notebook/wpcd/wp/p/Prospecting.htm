      <p><b>Prospecting</b> is the act of physically searching for <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">minerals</a>, <!--del_lnk--> fossils, precious metals or mineral specimens, and is essentially analogous to <!--del_lnk--> fossicking.<p>Prospecting is synonymous in some ways with <!--del_lnk--> mineral exploration which is an organised, large scale and at least semi-scientific effort undertaken by mineral resource companies to find commercially viable <!--del_lnk--> ore deposits, however prospecting is increasingly restricted to describe the activities of the amateur and hobbyist who search for small quantities of ore or mineralisation.<p>Prospecting is increasingly a hobby or vocation undertaken as a form of relaxation and diversionary activity by modern people however in the past prospecting was the only way new mineral deposits were found.<p>Prospecting is quite intensive physical labor, involving a considerable amount of traversing (traditionally on foot or on horseback), panning, sifting and outcrop investigation, looking for tell-tale signs of mineralisation.<p>

      <p>The traditional methods of prospecting involved carefully and intensely combing through the countryside, often through creek beds and along ridgelines and hilltops, often on hands and knees looking for signs of mineralisation in the outcrop. In the case of gold, all streams in an area would be panned at the appropriate trap sites looking for a show of &#39;colour&#39; or gold in the tail.<p>Once a small occurrence or <i>show</i> was found, it was then necessary to intensively work the area with pick and shovel, and often via the addition of some simple machinery such as a sluice box, races and winnows, to work the loose soil and rock looking for the appropriate materials (in this case, gold). For most <!--del_lnk--> base metal shows, the rock would have been mined by hand and crushed on site,the ore separated from the <!--del_lnk--> gangue by hand.<p>Often, these shows were short-lived, exhausted abandoned quite soon, requiring the prospector to move onwards to the next and hopefully bigger and better show. Occasionally, though, the prospector would strike it rich and be joined by other prospectors and larger-scale mining would take place.<p>In most countries in the 19th and early 20th century, it was very unlikely that a prospector would retire rich even if he was the one who found the greatest of lodes. For instance <!--del_lnk--> Patrick (Paddy) Hannan, who discovered the Golden Mile, <!--del_lnk--> Kalgoorlie, died without receiving anywhere near a fraction of the value of the gold contained in the lodes, the same story repeated at Bendigo, Ballarat, Klondike and California.<p><a id="The_Gold_Rushes" name="The_Gold_Rushes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Gold Rushes</span></h2>

      <p>In the United States and Canada prospectors were lured by the promise of <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a>, and other precious metals. They travelled across the mountains of the <!--del_lnk--> American West, carrying picks, shovels, <!--del_lnk--> gold pans, and whatever else they would need. Other prospectors searched <!--del_lnk--> canyons and <!--del_lnk--> mountain peaks, hardly leaving a rock unturned while looking for wealth. The majority of early prospectors had no training and relied mainly on luck to discover deposits.<p>Other gold rushes occurred in Papua New Guinea, Australia at least four times, and in South Africa and South America. In all cases, the gold rush was sparked by idle prospecting for gold and minerals which, when the prospector was rarely but spectacularly successful, generated &#39;gold fever&#39; and saw a wave of prospectors comb the countryside.<p><a id="Modern_prospecting" name="Modern_prospecting"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern prospecting</span></h2>
      <p>Modern prospectors today rely on training, the study of geology, and prospecting technology.<p>Knowledge of previous prospecting in an area helps in determining location of new prospective areas. Prospecting includes geological mapping, rock assay analysis, and sometimes the intuition of the prospector.<p><a id="Metal_detecting" name="Metal_detecting"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Metal detecting</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Metal detectors are invaluable for gold prospectors, as they are quite effective at detecting gold nuggets within the soil down to, depending on the acuity of the operator&#39;s hearing and knack, perhaps 3 feet.<p>Magnetic separators may be useful in separating the magnetic fraction of a <!--del_lnk--> heavy mineral sand from the nonmagnetic fraction, which may assist in the panning or sieving of gold from the soil or stream.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospecting&quot;</div>
