</script><a id="Origin_of_name" name="Origin_of_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of name</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> appellation Patna is <!--del_lnk--> etymologically derived from <i>Patan</i>, the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu goddess <!--del_lnk--> Patan devi. Another theory says the name comes from Pattan, or a port in Sanskrit since the city, located near the confluence of four rivers, has been a thriving river port.<p>The city has been known by various names during its more than two millennia long existence&mdash;Pataligram, Pataliputra, Kusumpur, Pushpapura, Azimabad, and the present day Patna. It got its name of Patna during the reign of Sher Shah Suri, a Bihari ruler who has the distiction of making the only interruption to the long rule of Mughals. His tomb is at Sasaram, a place near to Patna.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Legend ascribes the origin of Patna to a mythological king Putraka who created Patna by magic for his queen Patali, literally Trumpet flower, which gives it its ancient name Pataligram. It is said that in honour of the first born to the queen, the city was named Pataliputra. <i>Gram</i> is the Sanskrit for village and <i>Putra</i> means son.<p>From a scientific history perspective, it would be appropriate to surmise that the history of Patna started around the year <!--del_lnk--> 490 BC when <!--del_lnk--> Ajatashatru, the king of <!--del_lnk--> Magadh, wanted to shift his capital from the hilly Rajgriha to a more strategically located place to combat the <!--del_lnk--> Licchavis of <!--del_lnk--> Vaishali. He chose the site on the bank of Ganges and fortified the area. From that time, the city has had a continuous history, a record claimed by few cities in the world. <!--del_lnk--> Gautam Buddha passed through this place in the last year of his life, and he had prophesized a great future for this place, but at the same time, he predicted its ruin from flood, fire, and feud.<p>With the rise of the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan empire, the place became the seat of power and nerve centre of the sub-continent. From <!--del_lnk--> Pataliputra, the famed emperor <!--del_lnk--> Chandragupta Maurya (a contemporary of <!--del_lnk--> Alexander) ruled a vast empire, stretching from the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> to <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.<p>Early Mauryan Patliputra was mostly built with wooden structures. Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, transformed the wooden capital into a stone construction around <!--del_lnk--> 273 BC. Chinese scholar <!--del_lnk--> Fa Hein, who visited India sometime around A.D. 399-414, has given a vivid description of the stone structures in his travelogue.<p><!--del_lnk--> Megasthenes, Greek historian and ambassador to the court of Chandragupta gives the first written account of Patliputra. Much later, a number of Chinese travellers came to India in pursuit of knowledge and recorded their observation about Pataliputra in their travelogues.<p>In the years that followed, the city saw many dynasties ruling the Indian subcontinent from here. It saw the rules of the <!--del_lnk--> Gupta empire and the <!--del_lnk--> Pala kings. However, it never reached the glory that it had under the Mauryas.<p>With the disintegration of the Gupta empire, Patna passed through uncertain times. <!--del_lnk--> Bakhtiar Khilji captured Bihar in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> AD and destroyed many ancient seats of learning, Patna lost its prestige as the political and cultural centre of India.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mughal period was a period of unremarkable provincial administration from Delhi. The most remarkable period during these times was under <!--del_lnk--> Sher Shah Suri who revived Patna in the middle of the 16th century. He visualised a fort and a town on the banks of Ganga. Sher Shah&#39;s fort in Patna does not survive, but the mosque built in Afghan architectural style survives.<p>Mughal emperor <a href="../../wp/a/Akbar.htm" title="Akbar">Akbar</a> came to Patna in 1574 to crush the Afghan Chief Daud Khan. Akbar&#39;s Secretary of State and author of Ain-i-Akbari refers to Patna as a flourishing centre for paper, stone and glass industries. He also refers to the high quality of numerous strains of <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a> grown in Patna famous as <!--del_lnk--> Patna rice in Europe.<p>Mughal Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Aurangzeb acceded to the request of his favourite grandson Prince Muhamad Azim to rename Patna as Azimabad, in 1704 while Azim was in Patna as the <!--del_lnk--> subedar. However, very little changed during this period other than the name.<p>With the decline of Mughal empire, Patna moved into the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> Nawabs of Bengal, who levied a heavy tax on the populace but allowed it to flourish as a commercial centre.<p>During 17th century, Patna became a centre of international trade. The British started with a factory in Patna in 1620 for trading in calico and silk. Soon it became a trading centre for saltpetre, urging other Europeans&mdash;French, Danes, Dutch and Portuguese&mdash;to compete in the lucrative business. Peter Mundy, writing in 1632, calls this place, &quot;the greatest mart of the eastern region&quot;.<p>After the decisive <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Buxar (1765), Patna fell in the hands of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a> and continued as a trading centre.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1912, Patna became of the capital of <!--del_lnk--> Orissa Province and <!--del_lnk--> Bih&acirc;r when <!--del_lnk--> Bengal Presidency was partitioned. It soon emerged as an important and strategic centre. A number of imposing structures were constructed by the British. Credit for designing the massive and majestic buildings of colonial Patna goes to the architect, I. F. Munnings. Most of these buildings reflect either <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Saracenic influence (like Patna Museum and the state Assembly), or overt <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> influence like the Raj Bhawan and the High Court. Some buildings, like the General Post Office (GPO) and the Old Secretariat bear pseudo-Renaissance influence. Some say, the experience gained in building the new capital area of Patna proved very useful in building the imperial capital of New Delhi.<p>There are several prestigious educational institutions in Patna like <!--del_lnk--> Patna College, Patna Women&#39;s College, <!--del_lnk--> Patna Science College, Bihar National College,Bihar College of Engineering, now <!--del_lnk--> National Institute of Technology, Patna, Patna Medical College (formerly, <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales Medical College), Nalanda Medical College, Patna Dental College and the Patna Veterinary College.<p><!--del_lnk--> Orissa was created as a separate province in <!--del_lnk--> 1935. Patna continued as the capital of Bihar province under the <!--del_lnk--> British Raj.<p>Patna played a major role in the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence struggle</a>. Most notable are the <!--del_lnk--> Champaran movement against the Indigo plantation and the 1942 <!--del_lnk--> Quit India Movement.<p>Patna continued to be the capital of the state of <!--del_lnk--> Bihar after independence in 1947, though Bihar itself was partitioned again in 2000 when <!--del_lnk--> Jharkhand was carved out as a separate state of the Indian union.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>Patna is located on the south bank of the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges River</a>, called Ganga locally. Patna has a very long riverline, and it is surrounded on three sides by rivers&mdash;the Ganga, Sone, and Poonpun (also spelt Punpun). Just to the north of Patna across the river Ganga flows the river <!--del_lnk--> Gandak making it a unique place having four largish rivers in its vicinity. It is the largest riverine city in the world.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> bridge over the river Ganga, named after Mohandas Gandhi, is 5850m long is said to be the longest single river bridge in the world.<ul>
       <li>Altitude: 53 meters<li>Temperature: <i>Summer</i> 43 &deg;C to 21 &deg;C, <i>Winter</i> 20 &deg;C to 6 &deg;C<li>Rainfall (average): 1,200 mm</ul>
      <p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>In Patna, as in most of Bihar, the summer temperatures rise very high as the hot tropical sun beats down with all its intensity coupled with a heat wave which though is not as severe as say in <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. The city, being near four large rivers, experiences a rather high humidity throughout the year.<p>The summer begins in April and peaks in June/July with the temperature soaring up to 46&deg; C till the moisture laiden monsoon wind bring some much-needed relief to the parched fields. The rains last through August &amp; September and continue into early October. The northern Indian winters bring bitter cold nights and sunny days to Patna from November to February till the arrival of the spring that brings the weather to a full cycle.<p>The local almanac divides the year into six seasons of roughly two months each. Apart from the usual four seasons: Summer, Monsoon, Winter and Spring, you may add mild winter between <!--del_lnk--> Monsoon and Winter and Mild summer just before the onslaught of the severe north Indian summer.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>The population of Patna is over 1,285,470 (2001 census), which has grown from 917,243 in the 1991 census. The population density is 1132 persons per <!--del_lnk--> square kilometre. There are 839 females to every 1,000 males. Overall <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">Literacy rate</a> is 62.9%, and female <a href="../../wp/l/Literacy.htm" title="Literacy">Literacy rate</a> is 50.8%. Source &ndash; District Elementary Education Report Card 2004 of National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, New Delhi (www.eduinfoindia.net)<p>Patna has a moderate <a href="../../wp/c/Crime.htm" title="Crime">crime</a> rate. The main <!--del_lnk--> jail is <!--del_lnk--> Beur Jail.<p>Many languages are spoken in Patna. Hindi is the official language of the state of <!--del_lnk--> Bihar. Thanks to the British influence since early days, English is also spoken extensively.<p>The native dialect is <!--del_lnk--> Magahi. Other dialects from other regions of Bihar spoken widely in Patna are <!--del_lnk--> Angika, <!--del_lnk--> Bhojpuri, and <!--del_lnk--> Maithili. Other languages spoken in Patna include <!--del_lnk--> Bengali, and <!--del_lnk--> Oriya.<p><!--del_lnk--> Memons from Patna are called Patni Memons and speak a form of Memoni<p><a id="People_and_culture" name="People_and_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">People and culture</span></h2>
      <p>The Main Culture- Patna&#39;s culture is vastly dominated by Ang and Maithil peoples. They are intellectual, smart, handsome with relatively short height and slender body frame. There are mixed races with Aryan descent and further down. They have unique culture and much influenced by Bengal than their western brethern.<p><a id="Status_of_women" name="Status_of_women"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Status of women</span></h3>
      <p>The women are respected and have a say in the affairs of the family. If one compares the status of women if other parts of the north India, then it is comes as a pleasant surprise. However, recent years have seen a degeneration in education and social awareness, particularly in rural areas. In these areas one can sometimes see women being mistreated.<p><a id="Family_orientation" name="Family_orientation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Family orientation</span></h3>
      <p>People are religious and family oriented, and their lives are deeply rooted in tradition. The interests of the family take prelkl;ok;lkcedence over that of an individual. Families are generally large, though the government is actively encouraging family planning to curb rapid population growth. Extended families often live together home because of economic necessity, and a growing number of urban women are joining the professional workforce.<p><a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h3>
      <p>Most marriages are still arranged by parents; the degree to which the children are consulted depends on the family. Marriage is sacred and is considered to endure beyond death. Weddings are times of great celebration, expense, and feasting. Ceremonies are often elaborate. In many ceremonies, the bride and groom exchange garlands and promises before they circle around a fire seven times to solemnize the marriage. Bright clothing, jewellery, and flowers are part of almost every type of ceremony. The bride&rsquo;s parents may still give a dowry, such as money or land, to the groom, even though the practice is illegal.<p><a id="Cuisine" name="Cuisine"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cuisine</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Staple food of majority of the population is &ldquo;<i>bhat, dal, roti, tarkari and achar</i>&rdquo;, prepared basically from <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lentils, <!--del_lnk--> wheat flour, <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetable.htm" title="Vegetable">vegetables</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> pickle grade raw, unripe fruits. Traditionally, mustard oil has been the popular cooking medium for Patnaites. Plain boiled <a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">milk</a> as well as <!--del_lnk--> curd is widely used by all section of the Patnaites. &quot;<i><b>Kichdi</b></i>&quot;, the broth of rice and lentils, seasoned with <!--del_lnk--> spices, and served with several accompanying items like curd, chutney, pickles, papads, ghee (clarified butter) and chokha (boiled mashed potatoes, seasoned with finely cut onions, green chilies) constitutes the lunch for most Patnaites on Saturdays.<p>Patna is also known for the sweet delicacies of central Bihar including <!--del_lnk--> Khaja, <!--del_lnk--> Motichoor ka Ladoo, <!--del_lnk--> Kala Jamun, <!--del_lnk--> Kesaria Peda, <!--del_lnk--> Parwal ki Mithai, <!--del_lnk--> Khubi ka Lai and <!--del_lnk--> Chena Murki. These owe their origin to towns in the vicinity of Patna: Khaja from <!--del_lnk--> Silao, Ladoo from <!--del_lnk--> Maner, Kala Jamun from <!--del_lnk--> Vikram, Khubi ka Lai from <!--del_lnk--> Bakhtiarpur, Kesaria Peda from <!--del_lnk--> Gaya and Chena Murki from <!--del_lnk--> Koelwar, Poori from <!--del_lnk--> Behea. Descendants of the original family members of the cooks, called halwais in the <!--del_lnk--> local language, have migrated to urban Patna and authentic sweet delicacies are now available in the city itself. Unlike the Bengali sweets which are soaked in syrup of sugar and are therefore wet, sweets of Patna and Bihar are mostly dry. The mangoes of Digha, Patna are very delicious &amp; famous.<p>There are several other traditional <!--del_lnk--> snacks and <!--del_lnk--> savouries:<ul>
       <li><i><b>Pua&#39;</b>, prepared from a mixture of refined wheat flour(maida), milk, ghee (clarified butter), sugar, dry fruits and honey</i><li><i><b>Pittha</b></i>, steam cooked, made by powdered rice with sttufed griended gram(chana)OR khoya etc.<li><i><b>Tilkut</b></i>, referred to as &#39;Palala&#39; in Buddhist literature, is made of pounded &#39;tila&#39; or sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum) and jaggery or sugar<li><i><b>Chiwra</b></i>, beaten rice, served with a coat of creamy curd and sugar or jaggery<li><i><b>Makhana</b></i> (a kind of water fruit) is prepared from lotus seeds and is taken puffed or as kheer, prepared with milk and sugar<li><i><b>Sattu</b></i>, powdered baked gram, is a high energy giving food. It is taken mixed with water or with milk. Sometimes, sattu mixed with spices are used to prepare stuffed &#39;chapattis&#39;, locally called as &#39;makuni roti&#39;.<li><i><b>Litti Chokha</b></i>,A baked round shape, made by wheet floor with stuffed sattu(litti), the combination of smashed boil potato, bringel &amp; tomato(chokha).</ul>
      <p>A variety of non-vegetarian items are also prepared by a section of the population. Fish curries are widely used by a cross section of non-vegetarian population of all social groups. <!--del_lnk--> Mughal cuisine are well known and widely relished in Patna. Of late, <!--del_lnk--> Continental dishes are also catching up fancy. Various types of rolls which are also available in New York owe their origin to Patna. Some muslim families moved from here to Karachi in Pakistan during <!--del_lnk--> partition, and then to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">U.S.</a>, taking with them their culture and cuisine.
