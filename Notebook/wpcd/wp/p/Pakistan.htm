      <p>The modern day Pakistan consists of four major parts called provinces <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, <!--del_lnk--> Sind, <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan and <!--del_lnk--> NWFP.Modern Pakistan is a country that has , <!--del_lnk--> Harappan, <!--del_lnk--> Aryan, <!--del_lnk--> Persian, <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <!--del_lnk--> Saka, <!--del_lnk--> Parthian, <!--del_lnk--> Kushan, <!--del_lnk--> White Hun, <!--del_lnk--> Afghan, <!--del_lnk--> Arab, <!--del_lnk--> Turkic, and <!--del_lnk--> Mughal heritage. Waves of invaders and migrants settled down in Pakistan through out the centuries, influencing the locals and being absorbed among them. Pakistan is home to the oldest Asian civilisation (and one of the oldest in the world after Mesopotamia and Egypt), <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_Valley_Civilization.htm" title="Indus Valley Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> (2500 BC - 1500 BC). The modern state of Pakistan was established on <!--del_lnk--> 14 August <!--del_lnk--> 1947, but the region it encompasses has an extensive history that overlaps with the histories of <!--del_lnk--> Ancient India, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. The region is a crossroad of historic trade routes, including the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road, and was settled over thousands of years by many groups, including <!--del_lnk--> Dravidians, <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryans, <!--del_lnk--> Persians,<!--del_lnk--> Macedonians, <!--del_lnk--> Greeks, <!--del_lnk--> Scythians, <!--del_lnk--> Parthians <!--del_lnk--> Kushans, <!--del_lnk--> White Huns, <!--del_lnk--> Afghans, <!--del_lnk--> Arabs, <!--del_lnk--> Turks, and <!--del_lnk--> Mongols. The earliest evidence of humans in the region are pebble tools from the <!--del_lnk--> Soan Culture in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, dated from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. The <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus region</a> was the site of several ancient cultures including <!--del_lnk--> Mehrgarh, one of the world&#39;s earliest known towns, and the <!--del_lnk--> Indus Valley Civilisation at <!--del_lnk--> Harrappa and <!--del_lnk--> Mohenjo-Daro.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>.<p>The Indus Valley civilisation collapsed in the middle of the second millennium BCE and was followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Vedic Civilisation, which extended over much of northern India and Pakistan. Successive empires and kingdoms ruled the region from the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid Persian empire around 543 BCE, to <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 326 BCE and the <!--del_lnk--> Mauryan empire. The <a href="../../wp/i/Indo-Greek_Kingdom.htm" title="Indo-Greek Kingdom">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a> founded by <!--del_lnk--> Demetrius of Bactria included <!--del_lnk--> Gandhara and <!--del_lnk--> Punjab from 184 BCE, and reached its greatest extent under <!--del_lnk--> Menander, establishing the <a href="../../wp/g/Greco-Buddhism.htm" title="Greco-Buddhism">Greco-Buddhist</a> period with advances in trade and culture. The city of <!--del_lnk--> Taxila (Takshashila) became a major centre of learning in ancient times - the remains of the city, located to the west of <!--del_lnk--> Islamabad, are one of the country&#39;s major archaeological sites.<p>In 712 <!--del_lnk--> CE, the Arab general <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad bin Qasim conquered <!--del_lnk--> Sindh and <!--del_lnk--> Multan in southern <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, setting the stage for several successive Muslim empires including the <!--del_lnk--> Ghaznavid Empire, the <!--del_lnk--> Ghorid Kingdom, the <!--del_lnk--> Delhi Sultanate and the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal Empire. During this period <!--del_lnk--> Sufi missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Hindu population to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>. The gradual decline of the Mughal Empire in the early eighteenth century provided opportunities for the <!--del_lnk--> Afghans, <!--del_lnk--> Balochis and <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs to exercise control over large areas until the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> gained ascendancy over South Asia.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Pakistan was formed on <!--del_lnk--> 14 August <!--del_lnk--> 1947 with two Muslim-majority wings in the eastern and northwestern regions of <!--del_lnk--> South Asia, separated by <!--del_lnk--> Hindu-majority India, and comprising the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan, <!--del_lnk--> East Bengal, the <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province, <!--del_lnk--> West Punjab and <!--del_lnk--> Sindh. The <!--del_lnk--> partition of British India resulted in communal riots across India and Pakistan&mdash;millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan and millions of Hindus and <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs moved to India. Disputes arose over several princely states including <!--del_lnk--> Jammu and Kashmir whose ruler had acceded to India and finally led to the <!--del_lnk--> First Kashmir War (1948) ending with Pakistan and India each occupying large parts of the state. From 1947 to 1956, Pakistan was a <!--del_lnk--> Dominion in the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations. The republic declared in 1958 was stalled by a <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;etat by <!--del_lnk--> Ayub Khan (1958&ndash;69), who was president during a period of internal instability and a <!--del_lnk--> second war with India in 1965. His successor, <!--del_lnk--> Yahya Khan (1969&ndash;71) had to deal with the <!--del_lnk--> cyclone which caused 500,000 deaths in East Pakistan.<p>Economic and political dissent in <!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan led to violent political repression and tensions escalating into <!--del_lnk--> civil war (<!--del_lnk--> Bangladesh Liberation War) and the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and ultimately the secession of East Pakistan as the independent state of <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>.<p>Civilian rule resumed from 1972 to 1977 under <!--del_lnk--> Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, until he was deposed and later sentenced to death in what accounts to a judicial murder in 1979 by General <!--del_lnk--> Zia-ul-Haq, who became the third military president. Pakistan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> secular policies were replaced by Zia&#39;s introduction of the Islamic <!--del_lnk--> Shariah legal code, which increased religious influences on the civil service and the military. With the death of General Zia in a plane crash in 1988, <!--del_lnk--> Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the first female Prime Minister of Pakistan. Over the next decade, she alternated power with <!--del_lnk--> Nawaz Sharif, as the country&#39;s political and economic situation worsened. Pakistan sent 5,000 troops to the 1991 <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War as part of a US led coalition and specifically for the defence of <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. Military tensions in the <a href="../../wp/k/Kargil_War.htm" title="Kargil War">Kargil conflict</a> with India in 1999 was followed by a military <!--del_lnk--> coup in which General <!--del_lnk--> Pervez Musharraf assumed executive powers. In 2001, Musharraf became <!--del_lnk--> President after the resignation of <!--del_lnk--> Rafiq Tarar. After the 2002 parliamentary elections, Musharraf transferred executive powers to newly elected Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Zafarullah Khan Jamali, who was succeeded in the 2004 Prime-Ministerial election by <!--del_lnk--> Shaukat Aziz.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Muslim League formed Pakistan&#39;s first government under the leadership of <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah.htm" title="Muhammad Ali Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Liaquat Ali Khan. The Muslim League&#39;s leadership of Pakistani politics decreased significantly with the rise of other political parties, with the <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan People&#39;s Party in West Pakistan, and the <!--del_lnk--> Awami League in East Pakistan, which would ultimately lead to the creation of Bangladesh. The first <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Pakistan was adopted in 1956, but was suspended in 1958 by <!--del_lnk--> Ayub Khan. The Constitution of 1973, suspended in 1977 by <!--del_lnk--> Zia-ul-Haq, was re-instated in 1991 and is the country&#39;s most important document, laying the foundations of government. Pakistan is a <!--del_lnk--> federal <!--del_lnk--> democratic republic with <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> as the state religion. The <!--del_lnk--> semi-presidential system includes a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral legislature consisting of a 100-member <!--del_lnk--> Senate and a 342-member <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly. The <!--del_lnk--> President is the <!--del_lnk--> Head of State and the <!--del_lnk--> Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and is elected by an <!--del_lnk--> electoral college. The <!--del_lnk--> prime minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly. Each province has a similar system of government with a directly elected Provincial Assembly in which the leader of the largest party or alliance becomes Chief Minister. Provincial Governors are selected by the Provincial Assemblies on the advice of the Chief Minister.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Pakistani military has played an influential role in mainstream politics throughout Pakistan&#39;s history, with military presidents ruling from 1958&ndash;71, 1977&ndash;88 and from 1999 onwards. The leftist Pakistan People&#39;s Party (PPP), led by <!--del_lnk--> Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, emerged as a major political player during the 1970s. Under the military rule of <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan began a marked shift from the British-era secular politics and policies, to the adoption of <!--del_lnk--> Shariat and other laws based on Islam. During the 1980s, the anti-<!--del_lnk--> feudal, pro-<!--del_lnk--> Muhajir <!--del_lnk--> Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) was started by unorthodox and educated urban dwellers of <!--del_lnk--> Sindh and particularly <a href="../../wp/k/Karachi.htm" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>. The 1990s were characterized by coalition politics dominated by the PPP and a rejuvenated Muslim League.<p>In the October 2002 general elections, the <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q) won a <!--del_lnk--> plurality of National Assembly seats with the second-largest group being the <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan People&#39;s Party Parliamentarians (PPPP), a sub-party of the PPP. <!--del_lnk--> Zafarullah Khan Jamali of PML-Q emerged as Prime Minister but resigned on <!--del_lnk--> 26 June <!--del_lnk--> 2004 and was replaced by PML-Q leader <!--del_lnk--> Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as interim Prime Minister. On <!--del_lnk--> 28 August <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the National Assembly voted 191 to 151 to elect the <!--del_lnk--> Finance Minister and former <!--del_lnk--> Citibank Vice President <!--del_lnk--> Shaukat Aziz as Prime Minister. <!--del_lnk--> Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, a coalition of Islamic religious parties, won elections in <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province, and increased their representation in the <!--del_lnk--> National Assembly.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Pakistan is an active member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) and the <!--del_lnk--> Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the latter of which Pakistan has used as a forum for <i>Enlightened Moderation</i>, a plan to promote a <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">renaissance</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">enlightenment</a> in the Muslim world. Pakistan is also a member of the major regional organisations of the <!--del_lnk--> South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the <!--del_lnk--> Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO). In the past, Pakistan has had mixed relations with the United States especially in the early 1950s when Pakistan was the United States&#39; &quot;most allied ally in Asia&quot; and a member of both the <!--del_lnk--> Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). During the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s Pakistan was a crucial US ally, but relations soured in the 1990s, when sanctions were applied by the US over suspicions of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear activities. The <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11 attacks">September 11 attacks</a> and the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> War on Terrorism have seen an improvement in US&ndash;Pakistan ties, especially after Pakistan ended its support of the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban regime in <!--del_lnk--> Kabul. In January 2004, founder of Pakistani nuclear program <!--del_lnk--> A. Q. Khan confessed of nuclear proliferation to <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>. On <!--del_lnk--> 5 February <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the president <!--del_lnk--> Pervez Musharraf, announced that he had pardoned A. Q. Khan.<p>Pakistan has long had troubled relations with <!--del_lnk--> neighbouring India. The long-running dispute over <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> resulted in full fledged wars in <!--del_lnk--> 1947 and <!--del_lnk--> 1965. Civil war in 1971 flared into the simultaneous <!--del_lnk--> Bangladeshi Liberation War and the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Pakistan conducted <!--del_lnk--> nuclear weapon tests in 1998 to counterbalance India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> nuclear tests and became the only Muslim <!--del_lnk--> nuclear weapons state. The relations with India are steadily improving following peace initiatives in 2002. Pakistan maintains close <!--del_lnk--> economic, <!--del_lnk--> military and <!--del_lnk--> political relationships with the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>.<p>Pakistan also faces instability in the <!--del_lnk--> Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where some tribal leaders support the <!--del_lnk--> Taliban. Pakistan has had to deploy the army in these regions to suppress the local unrest, in <!--del_lnk--> Waziristan. The <!--del_lnk--> Waziristan conflict ended with a recently declared <!--del_lnk--> peace agreement between the tribal leaders and the Pakistani government, that is expected to bring back stability to the region. Additionally, the <a href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Country">country</a> has long faced instability in its largest <!--del_lnk--> province, <!--del_lnk--> Balochistan. The army was deployed to fight a serious <!--del_lnk--> insurgency within the province from 1973&ndash;76. Social stability resumed after <!--del_lnk--> Rahimuddin Khan was appointed <!--del_lnk--> martial law administrator beginning in 1977. After relative peace throughout the 1980s and 1990s, some influential Baloch tribal leaders restarted a separatist movement after Pervez Musharraf took over in 1999. In a recent incident Nawab Akbar Bugti, the leader of Balochistan, was killed in August 2006 by Pakistani military forces.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

In 2001 the federal government abolished the third tier of government (<!--del_lnk--> administrative divisions) in favour of the former fourth tier districts. The provinces and the capital territory are subdivided into a total of <!--del_lnk--> 107 districts which contain numerous <!--del_lnk--> tehsils and local governments.

The <!--del_lnk--> Tharparkar desert in the southern province of Sindh, is the only fertile desert in the world. Most areas of Punjab and parts of Sindh are fertile plains where agriculture is of great importance.<p>The climate varies as much as the scenery, with cold winters and hot summers in the north and a mild climate in the south, moderated by the influence of the ocean. The central parts have extremely hot summers with temperatures rising to 45&nbsp;&deg;C (113&nbsp;&deg;F), followed by very cold winters, often falling below freezing. There is very little rainfall ranging from less than 250&nbsp;millimetres to more than 1,250&nbsp;millimetres (9.8&ndash;49.2&nbsp;in), mostly brought by the unreliable south-westerly <!--del_lnk--> monsoon winds during the late summer.

      <p>The wide variety of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows for a wide variety of wild animals and birds. The forests range from <!--del_lnk--> coniferous <!--del_lnk--> alpine and <!--del_lnk--> subalpine trees such as spruce, pine, and <!--del_lnk--> deodar cedar in the northern mountains to <!--del_lnk--> deciduous trees such as the mulberry-type Shisham in the Sulaiman range in the south. The western hills have <!--del_lnk--> juniper and <!--del_lnk--> tamarisk as well as coarse grasses and scrub plants. Along the coast are <!--del_lnk--> mangrove forests which form much of the coastal wetlands.<p>In the south, there are crocodiles in the murky waters at the mouth of the Indus River whilst on the banks of the river, there are boars, deer, <!--del_lnk--> porcupines, and small rodents. In the sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are found jackals, hyenas, wild cats, panthers, and leopards while the clear blue skies abound with hawks, falcons, and eagles. In the southwestern deserts are rare Asiatic cheetahs. In the northern mountains are a variety of endangered animals including <!--del_lnk--> Marco Polo sheep, <a href="../../wp/u/Urial.htm" title="Urial">Urial sheep</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Markhor and <!--del_lnk--> Ibex goats, <!--del_lnk--> black and <!--del_lnk--> brown Himalayan bears, and the rare <!--del_lnk--> Snow Leopard.

Another rare species is the blind <!--del_lnk--> Indus River Dolphin of which there are believed to be about 1,000 remaining, protected in two major sanctuaries. In recent years the number of wild animals being killed for fur and leather trading led to a new law banning the hunting of wild animals and birds and the establishment of several wildlife sanctuaries and game reserves.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>Pakistan is an rapidly <!--del_lnk--> developing country which has faced a number of challenges on both political and economic fronts. Despite being a very poor country in 1947, Pakistan&#39;s economic growth rate was better than the global average during the subsequent four decades, but imprudent policies led to a slowdown in the late 1990&#39;s. Recently, wide-ranging economic reforms have resulted in a stronger economic outlook and accelerated growth especially in the <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a> and <!--del_lnk--> financial services <!--del_lnk--> sectors. There has been great improvement in the <!--del_lnk--> foreign exchange position and rapid growth in <!--del_lnk--> hard currency reserves in recent years. The 2005 estimate of foreign debt was close to US$40 billion. However, this has decreased in recent years with assistance from the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund (IMF) and significant debt-relief from the United States. Pakistan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product, as measured by <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity (PPP), is estimated to be US$439.7 billion while its <!--del_lnk--> per capita income (PCI) stands at $2,803. Despite clear progress, reports by the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the UN Development Program place the <!--del_lnk--> poverty rate in Pakistan between 23-28 percent. Pakistan&#39;s GDP growth rates have seen a steady increase over the last 5 years. However, inflationary pressures and a below par savings rate, among other economic factors, could make it difficult to sustain a high growth rate according to some analysts.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The growth of non-agricultural sectors has changed the structure of the economy, and agriculture now only accounts for roughly 20% of the GDP. The <!--del_lnk--> service sector accounts for 53% of the country&#39;s GDP with <!--del_lnk--> wholesale and <!--del_lnk--> retail trade forming 30% of this sector. In recent times, the <!--del_lnk--> Karachi Stock Exchange has soared, along with most of the world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> emerging markets. Large amounts of foreign investments have been made into several industries. The top industries in Pakistan are <!--del_lnk--> telecom, <!--del_lnk--> software, <!--del_lnk--> automotives, <!--del_lnk--> textiles, <!--del_lnk--> cement, <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ship building, and more recently, <!--del_lnk--> aerospace.<p>Pakistan has accomplished many engineering feats such as construction of the world&rsquo;s largest earth filled dam <!--del_lnk--> Tarbela, the world&#39;s twelfth largest dam <!--del_lnk--> Mangla, as well as the world&rsquo;s highest international road: the <!--del_lnk--> Karakoram Highway. There are also half a dozen additional dams planned such as <!--del_lnk--> Kalabagh Dam, <!--del_lnk--> Diamer-Bhasha Dam, Munda, Akhori and Skardu Katzara.<p>In november 2006 <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="PRC">China</a> and Pakistan signed a <!--del_lnk--> Free Trade Agreement hoping to triple bilateral trade from $4.2 billion (<!--del_lnk--> USD) to $15 billion (<!--del_lnk--> USD) within the next five years.

Pakistan is also home to a thriving <!--del_lnk--> arms industry which exports $200 million (<!--del_lnk--> USD) annually, mostly defence equipment and arms to countries in the Middle East and South Asia, and its defence officials are hopeful that these exports will surpass $500 million (<!--del_lnk--> USD) a year within the next five years.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

Because of Pakistan&#39;s high growth rate, it is expected to surpass <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> in population in the year <!--del_lnk--> 2020. Population projections for Pakistan are relatively difficult because of the apparent differences in the accuracy of each census and the inconsistencies between various surveys related to fertility rate, but it is likely that the rate of growth peaked in 1980s. The population was estimated at 162,400,000 on <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, with a fertility rate of 34 per thousand, a death rate of 10 per thousand, and the rate of natural increase at 2.4%. Pakistan also has a high infant mortality rate of 70 per thousand births.<p><!--del_lnk--> Urdu is the <!--del_lnk--> national language and <i><!--del_lnk--> lingua franca</i> of Pakistan, and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the <!--del_lnk--> official language used in the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution and widely used by corporate businesses, the educated urban elite, and most universities. <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi is spoken by over 60 million people, but has no official recognition in the country. These major ethnic groups are further broken down into several smaller ethnic groups - <!--del_lnk--> Punjabis (44.68)% of the population, <!--del_lnk--> Pashtuns (15.42%), <!--del_lnk--> Sindhis (14.1%), <!--del_lnk--> Seraikis (10.53%), <!--del_lnk--> Muhajirs (7.57%), <!--del_lnk--> Balochis (3.57%) and others (4.66%) such as <!--del_lnk--> Tajiks, <!--del_lnk--> Bengalis and many others.<p>The demographics of religion in Pakistan were significantly influenced in 1947 by the movement of Muslims to Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to India. Census data  indicates that 96% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Muslims, of whom nearly 80% are <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Muslims and 19% are <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a Muslims. The remainder comprises of <!--del_lnk--> Christians, <!--del_lnk--> Hindus, <!--del_lnk--> Jews, <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs, <!--del_lnk--> Parsis, <!--del_lnk--> Ahmadis, and <!--del_lnk--> Animists (mainly the <!--del_lnk--> Kalasha of Chitral). A few <!--del_lnk--> Buddhists are included in Pakistani statistics; however, these live in Indian administered <!--del_lnk--> Ladakh which Pakistan claims along with the rest of <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. As of 2005, over three million refugees (approximately 81.5% being ethnic <!--del_lnk--> Pashtuns) remain in Pakistan as a result of the wars in <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, with 83% of these refugees reporting their intent to permanently settle in Pakistan.<p><a id="Society_and_culture" name="Society_and_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Society and culture</span></h2>

      <p>Pakistan has a rich and unique culture that has preserved established traditions throughout history. Many cultural practices, foods, monuments, and shrines were inherited from the rule of Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Mughal and <!--del_lnk--> Afghan emperors including the national dress of <!--del_lnk--> Shalwar Qameez. Women wear brightly coloured shalwar qameez, while men often wear solid-coloured ones, usually with a <!--del_lnk--> sherwani or <!--del_lnk--> achkan (long coat) that is worn over the garment.<p>The variety of <!--del_lnk--> Pakistani music ranges from diverse provincial <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a> and traditional styles such as <!--del_lnk--> Qawwali and <!--del_lnk--> Ghazal Gayaki to modern forms fusing traditional and western music, such as the synchronisation of Qawwali and western music by the renowned <!--del_lnk--> Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Other major <!--del_lnk--> Ghazal singers include <!--del_lnk--> Mehdi Hassan, <!--del_lnk--> Ghulam Ali, <!--del_lnk--> Farida Khanum, <!--del_lnk--> Tahira Syed, <!--del_lnk--> Abida Parveen and <!--del_lnk--> Iqbal Bano. The arrival of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghan</a> refugees in the western provinces has rekindled <!--del_lnk--> Pashto and <!--del_lnk--> Persian music and established <!--del_lnk--> Peshawar as a hub for Afghan musicians and a distribution centre for Afghan music abroad. Until the 1990s, the state-owned <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) and <!--del_lnk--> Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation were the dominant media outlets, but there are now numerous <!--del_lnk--> private television channels such as <!--del_lnk--> Geo TV, <!--del_lnk--> Indus TV, <!--del_lnk--> Hum,<!--del_lnk--> ARY, <!--del_lnk--> KTN and others. Various American, European, and Asian television channels and movies are available to the majority of the Pakistani population via <!--del_lnk--> cable and <!--del_lnk--> satellite television. There are also small indigenous movie industries based in Lahore and Peshawar (often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Lollywood and <!--del_lnk--> Pollywood). Although <!--del_lnk--> Bollywood movies are banned since 1965, Indian film stars are generally popular in Pakistan.<p>Pakistani society is largely <!--del_lnk--> multilingual and predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Muslim, with high regard for traditional family values, although urban families have grown into a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear family system due to the socio-economic constraints imposed by the traditional <!--del_lnk--> joint family system. Recent decades have seen the emergence of a middle class in cities like <a href="../../wp/k/Karachi.htm" title="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Lahore, <!--del_lnk--> Rawalpindi, <!--del_lnk--> Hyderabad, <!--del_lnk--> Faisalabad, <!--del_lnk--> Sukkur and <!--del_lnk--> Peshawar that wish to move in a more liberal direction, as opposed to the northwestern regions bordering Afghanistan that remain highly conservative and dominated by centuries-old regional <!--del_lnk--> tribal customs. Increasing <a href="../../wp/g/Globalization.htm" title="Globalization">globalization</a> has increased the influence of &quot;Western culture&quot; with Pakistan ranking 46<sup>th</sup> on the Kearney/FP Globalization Index. There are an approximated four million Pakistanis living abroad, with close to a half-million <!--del_lnk--> expatriates living in the United States and around a million living in Saudi Arabia.As well as nearly one million people of Pakistani descent in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, there are burgeoning cultural connections.<p>Tourism is a growing industry in Pakistan, based on its diverse cultures, peoples and landscapes. The variety of attractions range from the ruins of ancient civilizations such as <!--del_lnk--> Mohenjo-daro, <!--del_lnk--> Harappa and <!--del_lnk--> Taxila, to the Himalayan hill stations, which attract those interested in field and winter sports. Pakistan is home to several <!--del_lnk--> mountain peaks over 7000m, which attracts adventurers and mountaineers from around the world, especially <!--del_lnk--> K2. The northern parts of Pakistan have many old fortresses, towers and other architecture as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Hunza and <!--del_lnk--> Chitral valleys, the latter being home to the small pre-Islamic <!--del_lnk--> Animist <!--del_lnk--> Kalasha community who claim descent from the army of <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>. In the <!--del_lnk--> Punjab is the site of Alexander&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> battle on the <!--del_lnk--> Jhelum River and the historic city <!--del_lnk--> Lahore, Pakistan&#39;s cultural capital with many examples of <!--del_lnk--> Mughal architecture such as the <!--del_lnk--> Badshahi Masjid, <!--del_lnk--> Shalimar Gardens, <!--del_lnk--> Tomb of Jahangir and the <!--del_lnk--> Lahore Fort. To promote Pakistan&#39;s unique and various cultural heritage, the prime minister launched &quot;Visit Pakistan 2007&quot;. <p><a id="Holidays" name="Holidays"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Holidays</span></h2>

      <p>There are many holidays and festivals celebrated annually in Pakistan. While Pakistan is an Islamic nation, there are also several secular holidays including Pakistan Day (<!--del_lnk--> 23 March), Independence Day (<!--del_lnk--> 14 August), Defence of Pakistan Day (<!--del_lnk--> 6 September), Pakistan Air Force Day (<!--del_lnk--> 7 September), the anniversaries of the birth (<!--del_lnk--> 25 December) and death (<!--del_lnk--> 11 September) of <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah.htm" title="Muhammad Ali Jinnah">Quaid-e-Azam</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Allama Iqbal (<!--del_lnk--> 9 November) and the birth (<!--del_lnk--> 30 July) and death (<!--del_lnk--> 8 July) of <!--del_lnk--> Madar-e-Millat. <!--del_lnk--> Labour Day (also known as <!--del_lnk--> May Day) is also observed in Pakistan on <!--del_lnk--> 1 May.<p>Several important festivals are celebrated by Pakistani Muslims during the year, dependent on the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic calendar. <!--del_lnk--> Ramadan, the ninth month of the calendar, is characterised by daytime fasting for 29 or 30 days and is followed by the festival of <!--del_lnk--> Eid ul-Fitr. In a second festival, <!--del_lnk--> Eid ul-Adha, an animal is sacrificed in remembrance of the actions of <!--del_lnk--> Abraham and the meat is shared with friends, family, and the less fortunate. Both Eid festivals are public holidays, serving as opportunities for people to visit family and friends, and for children to receive new clothes, presents, and sweets. Some Muslims celebrate <!--del_lnk--> Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi, the birthday of the prophet <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, in the third month of the calendar (<!--del_lnk--> Rabi&#39; al-Awwal). <!--del_lnk--> Shia Muslims mark the <!--del_lnk--> Day of Ashurah on the 9th and 10th days of the first month (<!--del_lnk--> Muharram) to commemorate the martyrdom of <!--del_lnk--> Husayn bin Ali, (the grandson of the Prophet <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>).<p>Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians in Pakistan also celebrate their own festivals and holidays. <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs come from across the world to visit several holy sites in <!--del_lnk--> Punjab, including the shrine of <!--del_lnk--> Guru Nanak, the founder of <a href="../../wp/s/Sikhism.htm" title="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, at Hassan Abdal in the <!--del_lnk--> Attock District, and his birthplace, at <!--del_lnk--> Nankana Sahib. There are also several regional and local festivals, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi festival of <!--del_lnk--> Basant, which marks the start of spring and is celebrated by kite flying.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h2>
