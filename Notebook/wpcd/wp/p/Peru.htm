Some of the oldest notable civilizations appeared ca. <!--del_lnk--> 6000 BC in the coastal provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Chilca and <!--del_lnk--> Paracas and in the highlands province of <!--del_lnk--> Callejon de Huaylas.<p>Over the following 3000 years inhabitants switched to cultivating land, as evidence from sites such as <!--del_lnk--> Kotosh and <!--del_lnk--> Huaca Prieta shows. Cultivation of plants such as <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">corn</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Gossypium.htm" title="Gossypium">cotton</a> <i>(Gossypium Barbadense)</i> began, as well as the domestication of animals. Inhabitants practiced domestic crafts such as <!--del_lnk--> spinning and <!--del_lnk--> knitting of cotton and wool, <!--del_lnk--> basketry and <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a>.<p>Some of the more advanced Andean civilizations that appeared in <!--del_lnk--> 900 BC were:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Caral<li><!--del_lnk--> Chavin &ndash; the Peruvian Mother Culture, according to <!--del_lnk--> Julio C. Tello<li><!--del_lnk--> Paracas<li><!--del_lnk--> Mochica<li><!--del_lnk--> Nazca<li><!--del_lnk--> Tiahuanaco<li><!--del_lnk--> Wari<li><!--del_lnk--> Chimu</ul>
      <p>These cultures developed relatively advanced techniques of <!--del_lnk--> cultivation, gold and silver craft, <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Metallurgy.htm" title="Metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> knitting. Around <!--del_lnk--> 700 BCE, they appear to have developed systems of social organization that were the precursors of the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca</a> civilization.<p>Minor civilizations on the edge of the eastern Andes that were largely assimilated into the Incan empire include:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Malbecs<li><!--del_lnk--> Hu-Tyus<li><!--del_lnk--> Punos<li><!--del_lnk--> Mari-Tiu-Tie<li><!--del_lnk--> Olbraqeus</ul>
      <p>Not all Andean cultures were willing to offer their loyalty to the Incas as they expanded their empire, and many were openly hostile. The people of the <!--del_lnk--> Chachapoyas culture were an example of this, but they were eventually conquered and integrated into the Inca Empire.<p><a id="The_Incas" name="The_Incas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Incas</span></h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Incas</a> created the most vast and powerful empire of <!--del_lnk--> pre-Columbian America. The Tahuantinsuyo&mdash;which is derived from <!--del_lnk--> Quechua for &quot;The Four United Regions&quot;&mdash;reached its greatest extension at the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>. It dominated a territory that included from north to south <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, part of <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, the northern half of <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, and the north-east part of <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>; and from west to east, from <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> to the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_Rainforest.htm" title="Amazon Rainforest">Amazonian forests</a>.<p>The empire originated from a tribe based in <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco, which became the capital. Pachacuti was the first ruler to considerably expand the boundaries of the <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco state. His offspring later ruled an empire by both violent and peaceful conquest.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco, the royal city was created to resemble a <!--del_lnk--> puma; the head, the main royal structure, formed what is now known as Sacsayhuaman. The Empire&#39;s administrative, political, and military centre was located in <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco. The empire was divided into four quarters: Chinchasuyo, Antisuyo, Contisuyo, and Collasuyo.<p><!--del_lnk--> Quechua was the official language, imposed on the citizens. It was the language of a tribe neighbouring the original tribe of the empire. Conquered populations&mdash;tribes, kingdoms, states, and cities&mdash;were allowed to practice their own religions and lifestyles, but had to recognize Inca cultural practices as superior to their own. Inti, the sun god, was to be worshipped as one of the most important gods of the empire. His representation on earth was the &quot;Inca&quot;, the Emperor .<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Tahuantinsuyo was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. In fact, the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a> was conceived like an ambitious and audacious civilizing project, based on a mythical thought, in which the harmony of the relationships between the human being, nature, and <!--del_lnk--> gods was truly essential.<p>Many strange and interesting customs were observed, for example the extravagant feast of Inti Raymi which gave thanks to the God Sun, and the young women who comprised the Virgins of the Sun, sacrificial virgins devoted to the Inti. The empire, being quite large, also had an impressive transportation system of roads to all points of the empire called the <!--del_lnk--> Inca Trail, and <!--del_lnk--> chasquis, message carriers who relayed information from anywhere in the empire to Cuzco.<p>From the European rationalist perspective, the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a> has been seen like the utopia state. Nevertheless, this pragmatic interpretation tends to forget that the collision between two antithetic <!--del_lnk--> Weltanschauungs had a destructive impact on the harmony of the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca</a> <!--del_lnk--> Weltanschauung superiority, who took advantage of the Inca civil war triggered by two pretenders to the throne.<p><a id="Colonial_Peru_.28Spanish_rule.29" name="Colonial_Peru_.28Spanish_rule.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial Peru (Spanish rule)</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro and his brothers were attracted by the news of a rich and fabulous kingdom. In <!--del_lnk--> 1531, they arrived in the country, which they called Peru. (The forms <i>Biru</i>, <i>Pir&uacute;</i>, and <i>Ber&uacute;</i> are also seen in early records.) According to <!--del_lnk--> Raul Porras Barrenechea, Peru is not a <!--del_lnk--> Quechuan nor <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean word, but <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Hispanic or hybrid.<p>At that moment, the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a> was sunk in a five years civil war between two princes, <!--del_lnk--> Hu&aacute;scar and <!--del_lnk--> Atahualpa. Taking advantage of this, <!--del_lnk--> Pizarro carried out a <i><!--del_lnk--> coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>. On <!--del_lnk--> November 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1532, while the natives were in a celebration in <!--del_lnk--> Cajamarca, the Spanish in a surprise move captured the <!--del_lnk--> Inca Atahualpa during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cajamarca, causing a great consternation among the natives and conditioning the future course of the fight. When Huascar was killed, the Spanish tried and convicted Atahualpa of the murder, executing him by strangulation.<p>For a period, <!--del_lnk--> Pizarro maintained the ostensible authority of the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a>, recognizing <!--del_lnk--> Tupac Huallpa as the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> after Atahualpa&#39;s death. But the conqueror&rsquo;s abuses made this fa&ccedil;ade too obvious. Spanish domination consolidated itself as successive indigenous rebellions were bloodily repressed. The situation was complicated by a power struggle between the <!--del_lnk--> Pizarro family and <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Almagro. A long civil war developed, from which the Pizarros emerged victorious at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Las Salinas.<p>Despite this, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Its most significant milestone was the foundation of <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> in January, <!--del_lnk--> 1535, from which the political and administrative institutions were organized. The necessity of consolidating Spanish royal authority over these territories, led to the creation of a <!--del_lnk--> Real Audiencia (Royal Audience). In <!--del_lnk--> 1542, the Spanish created the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of New Castilla, that shortly after would be called <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru. Nevertheless, the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of the Viceroy <!--del_lnk--> Francisco de Toledo in <!--del_lnk--> 1572.<p><!--del_lnk--> Toledo ended the indigenous state of <!--del_lnk--> Vilcabamba, executing the <!--del_lnk--> Inca Tupac Amaru. He also sought economic development through commercial monopoly and mineral extraction, mainly from argentiferous mines of <!--del_lnk--> Potos&iacute;. He exploited the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca">Inca</a> institution called &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> mita&rdquo;, that is mandatory public service, to put the native communities under a cruel economic enslavement.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru became the richest and most powerful Spanish <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of America in the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>. The creation of the Viceroyalties of <!--del_lnk--> New Granada and <!--del_lnk--> Rio de la Plata (at the expense of its territory), the duty exemptions that moved the commercial centre from <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> to <a href="../../wp/c/Caracas.htm" title="Caracas">Caracas</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, and the decrease of the mining and textile production determined the progressive decay of the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroyalty of Peru. These events created a favorable climate so that emancipating ideas developed between the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Criollo people, or <!--del_lnk--> Creoles.<p><a id="Wars_of_independence" name="Wars_of_independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Wars of independence</span></h3>

      <p>The economic crisis favored the indigenous rebellion from <!--del_lnk--> 1780 to <!--del_lnk--> 1781. This rebellion was headed by <!--del_lnk--> T&uacute;pac Amaru II. At this time, the <!--del_lnk--> Napoleonic invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula and the degradation of the Royal power took place. The Creole rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> Hu&aacute;nuco arose in <!--del_lnk--> 1812 and the rebellion of <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco arose between <!--del_lnk--> 1814 and <!--del_lnk--> 1816.

This Viceroyalty succumbed after the decisive continental campaigns of <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bolivar</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Jose de San Martin. <!--del_lnk--> San Martin, who had displaced the royalists of Chile after the magnificent battle of the Andes, and who had disembarked in <!--del_lnk--> Paracas in <!--del_lnk--> 1819, proclaimed the independence of Peru in <!--del_lnk--> Lima on <!--del_lnk--> July 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1821. Three years later, the Spanish dominion was eliminated definitively after the battles of <!--del_lnk--> Jun&iacute;n and <!--del_lnk--> Ayacucho. Its first elected president, however, wasn&#39;t in power until <!--del_lnk--> 1827.<p><a id="War_and_reconstruction" name="War_and_reconstruction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">War and reconstruction</span></h3>
      <p>In 1879, Peru entered the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The <!--del_lnk--> Peruvian Government tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on April 5, 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of Tarapac&aacute; and the provinces of Tacna and Arica, in the Atacama region.<p>After the war, an extraordinary effort of reconstruction began. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s. The <!--del_lnk--> civilist movement headed by <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas de Pi&eacute;rola opposed the <!--del_lnk--> military caudillismo that arose from the warlike defeat and the economic collapse. He arrived to power with the <!--del_lnk--> 1895 revolution. The reformist character of <!--del_lnk--> Pierola&rsquo;s dictatorship had continuity in <!--del_lnk--> Augusto B. Legu&iacute;a&rsquo;s.<p>During <!--del_lnk--> Leguia&rsquo;s government periods (<!--del_lnk--> 1908&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1912 and <!--del_lnk--> 1919&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1930, this last one was well-known as &ldquo;the Oncenio&rdquo;&mdash;The eleventh), the entrance of American capitals became general and the <!--del_lnk--> bourgeoisie was favored. This politics along with the increase of the foreign capital dependency, contributed to generate opposition focuses between the landowner oligarchy as much as the most progressive sectors of the Peruvian society.<p>In 1929, Peru and Chile signed a final peace treaty, the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Ancon by which Tacna returned to Peru and Peru yielded permanently the rich provinces of Arica and Tarapaca, but kept certain rights to the port activities in Arica and decisions of what Chile can do on those territories.<p>After the world-wide crisis of <!--del_lnk--> 1929, numerous brief governments followed one another. The <!--del_lnk--> APRA party had the opportunity to cause system reforms by means of political actions, but it was not successful. Represion was brutal in the early 1930&#39;s and tens of thousands of &quot;APRISTA&quot; followers were executed or imprisoned. By this time, it begins a sudden population growth and an urbanization increase. During World War II, Peru was the first South American nation to align with the United States and its allies against Germany and Japan.<p>Between these two periods of time, it should be underlined the constitution of the <!--del_lnk--> American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA). This is a nationalistic movement, populist and anti-imperialist headed by <!--del_lnk--> Victor Raul Haya de la Torre in <!--del_lnk--> 1924. The <!--del_lnk--> communist party was created four years later and it was led by <!--del_lnk--> Jose C. Mariategui.<p><a id="Modern_politics" name="Modern_politics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Modern politics</span></h3>

      <p>General <!--del_lnk--> Manuel A. Odr&iacute;a led a dictatorial military government that lasted for eight years (<!--del_lnk--> 1948&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1956). Inequitable land tenure (<i>latifundia</i>), wide-spread social marginalization and the Cuban example provided the impetus in the early 1960s for the emergence of Peru&#39;s armed left. But this resurgence was brief and gave the pretext for the armed forces to increase their control of the country and gather the strength and alternative ideology necessary for a <i>coup d&#39;etat</i><p>Meanwhile, the reformist attempt of <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Belaunde Terry&rsquo;s first government failed to address the structural nature of social pathology, which continued to plague Peru. Belaunde&#39;s Government embraced numerous projects, including the <i>Carretera Marginal de la Selva</i>, a highway linking Chiclayo on the Pacific coast with previously &quot;isolated&quot; northern regions of <!--del_lnk--> Amazonas, <!--del_lnk--> San Mart&iacute;n, and <!--del_lnk--> Loreto. However, Belaunde was saddled with the popular perception that he was too close to foreign capital, moreover his economic decisions lead to the <!--del_lnk--> devaluation of the <!--del_lnk--> sol, and generalized unrest&mdash;both in the countryside and in Lima.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1968, General <!--del_lnk--> Juan Velasco Alvarado&rsquo;s lead a <i>coup d&#39;etat</i> replacing the Belaunde government. Under the title of &quot;President of the Revolutionary Government&quot;, the nationalist and left-leaning tone of <!--del_lnk--> Velasco was manifest by his government&#39;s promulgation of Peru&#39;s first substantial agrarian reform, which was aimed at stemming the tide of civil unrest, particularly in the Andes where land ownership patterns were profoundly inequitable. Velasco&#39;s government is credited with promoting peasant&#39;s rights, including the recognition of <!--del_lnk--> Quechua as a national language, communal land ownership, and populist social mobilization (SINAMOS).<p>Invariably, this gave rise to conflict with Peru&#39;s small elite, those with foreign capital interests and local <!--del_lnk--> oligarchs. Velasco&#39;s failing health, changed global conditions and poor planning resulted in a counter-reaction to Velasco&#39;s nationalist program. In 1975, General <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Morales Berm&uacute;dez&rsquo;s lead a <i>coup d&rsquo;etat</i>, replacing Velasco as President. Morales Berm&uacute;dez&#39;s regime was characterized by a return to elite-oriented politics, which did little to stem civil unrest from a populace largely excluded from the social benefits of <i>national</i> citizenship.<p>Frustrated by their inability to &quot;rule&quot; Peru, the Peruvian Armed Forces were forced to call for elections. Meanwhile, as a background to the return to elected government two events that would deeply influence the next two decades of peruvian history took place. The first was a constitutional convention that resulted in a new national constitution in 1979. The second was the start in 1980 of the armed struggle against the government by Shining Path, a breakaway faction of the Communist Party of Peru. It was not by coincidence that this struggle started in one of the poorest regions of the country while the new constitution was hammered out in the capital and away from the focus of disenfranchisement.<p>So, with great hope <!--del_lnk--> Fernando Bela&uacute;nde Terry was re-elected in <!--del_lnk--> 1980 to the Presidency. However, by the end of his term in 1985, Peru yet again faced a crisis that has gripped Peru for the past two decades: mounting <!--del_lnk--> external debt has stymied the actions of successive Peruvian governments. Moreover, Bela&uacute;nde was impotent in halting the progressive impoverishment of the vast majority of population, and incapable of halting the massive increase in <!--del_lnk--> drug trafficking operations, or the <!--del_lnk--> insurgent revolts of the <a href="../../wp/s/Shining_Path.htm" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a> (<i>Sendero Luminoso</i>) and the <!--del_lnk--> Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).<p>With much optimism, the leader of Peru&#39;s APRA Party, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Garcia was elected President in <!--del_lnk--> 1985. After a promising start, the Peruvian economy was crippled by <!--del_lnk--> hyperinflation, isolated from the international financial community, and was in the throes of a bloody civil-war pitting the <a href="../../wp/s/Shining_Path.htm" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement against the State and its allies. In a climate of generalized chaos, terror, and political violence, the electoral victory of <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Fujimori took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1990, when the virtually unknown University Rector narrowly defeated the famous Peruvian novelist and cultural icon <!--del_lnk--> Mario Vargas Llosa. Like his predecessor, Garc&iacute;a relinquished power leaving the country, according to many Peruvians, in a worse state than when he entered office.<p>Two years after he was elected; and in constant deadlocks with the Parliament, President <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Fujimori summarily closed <!--del_lnk--> Congress and convened a <!--del_lnk--> referendum for elaborating a new <!--del_lnk--> Constitution (1992). Credited by some sectors of Peruvian society and the international financial community with restoring <!--del_lnk--> macroeconomic &quot;stability&quot; to Peru after the turbulent Garcia years, Fujimori was widely criticized for what his opponents describe as an <!--del_lnk--> authoritarian regime, aided by the now imprisoned <!--del_lnk--> Vladimiro Montesinos, the former head of Peru&#39;s intelligence service, Servicio de Inteligencia Nacional (SIN).<p>Following a controversial third &quot;re-election&quot;, mounting corruption, wide-spread political violence and gross human rights violations, Fujimori was forced to call for early elections. After his party lost control of the Peruvian Parliament, he was forced to resign from the Presidency of Peru. Returning from the <!--del_lnk--> APEC summit in <a href="../../wp/b/Brunei.htm" title="Brunei">Brunei</a>, Fujimori requested political asylum in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> on the grounds of his <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> citizenship.<p>In the turmoil following Fujimori&#39;s precipitous fall from power, <!--del_lnk--> Valent&iacute;n Paniagua was selected as the <i>transitional</i> President. Following a hotly contested election, <!--del_lnk--> Alejandro Toledo became President (2001-2006), narrowly defeating <!--del_lnk--> Alan Garc&iacute;a (2006).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Garc&iacute;a was once again elected President, defeating nationalist candidate <a href="../../wp/o/Ollanta_Humala.htm" title="Ollanta Humala">Ollanta Humala</a>. After his political defeat, Ollanta Humala has faced several trials for his involvement in the fight against <!--del_lnk--> Sendero Luminoso and his role as opposition leader has faded away. Former President Alberto Fujimori (currently in <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>) is awaiting extradition proceedings against him by the Peruvian government <!--del_lnk--> , while at the same time his political party <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for the Future gathered an important number of parliament members in the last elections.

      <p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 1990, the Peruvian economy has undergone considerable free market reforms, from legalizing parts of the <!--del_lnk--> informal sector to significant privatizations in the mining, electric/power, and telecommunications industries. Aided by foreign investment and cooperation between the former <!--del_lnk--> Fujimori administration, the <!--del_lnk--> IMF, and the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank, <!--del_lnk--> economic growth was rapid in <!--del_lnk--> 1994&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 97 and inflation was kept low.<p>Still, some say that Peru&#39;s reforms have not led to sustained economic progress. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Centre for Economic and Policy Research, a U.S.-based <!--del_lnk--> think tank, &quot;Income per person in Peru &ndash; the most basic economic measure of living standards &ndash; is currently about the same as it was 25 years ago. This is a remarkable long-term economic failure.&quot;<!--del_lnk--> <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1998, <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a>&#39;s impact on agriculture, the financial crisis in <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and instability in Brazilian markets undercut growth. <!--del_lnk--> 1999 was another lean year for Peru, with the aftermath of <a href="../../wp/e/El_Ni%25C3%25B1o-Southern_Oscillation.htm" title="El Ni&ntilde;o">El Ni&ntilde;o</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Asian financial crisis having an avdersely effect on the market economy. Lima did manage to complete negotiations for an Extended Fund Facility with the <!--del_lnk--> IMF in June <!--del_lnk--> 1999, although it subsequently had to renegotiate the targets. Pressure on spending grew in the run-up to the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 elections.<p>Growth up to the year <!--del_lnk--> 2005 has been realized by construction, investment, domestic demand and exports. Peru&#39;s economy has become one of the most liberal market economies in Latin America. The country&#39;s petroleum, natural gas and power industries are expected to increase due to relatively high domestic and foreign influx of capital in the tourism, agriculture, mining and construction sectors since 1995.<p>In April 2006, Peru signed a <!--del_lnk--> trade agreement with the United States (known as the <!--del_lnk--> Peru Trade Promotion Agreement, becoming the first country in the Andean Community of Nations (<!--del_lnk--> Comunidad Andina de Naciones,<!--del_lnk--> CAN) to sign it.<!--del_lnk-->  As of June 2006, Peru&#39;s Congress has already approved the agreement and the pact awaits approval by the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Congress. Peru is currently negotiating <!--del_lnk--> trade agreements with <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>.<p>Peru has free trade agreements with the <!--del_lnk--> Andean Community, which is composed of <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ecuador.htm" title="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bolivia.htm" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. It also has free trade agreements with many of the countries in <!--del_lnk--> Mercosur as well as <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and during the recent <!--del_lnk--> APEC summit, Peru declared intentions to sign free trade agreements with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>.<p>Peru is also seeking a free trade agreement with the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>. These negotiations will greatly expand the markets in which the Peruvian products are traded. Peru has potential to export agricultural products, textiles, clothing, shoes, petroleum derivatives, natural gas, minerals, as well as fish and seafood products, tourism, and manufactured goods.<p>In 2005 Peruvian exports were worth US$ 17.1 billion (an increase of 34.6% compared to 2004) and it is expected to grow 35% for this year reaching US$ 23.5 billion at the end of 2006. The markets of Peru have grown in all sectors (energy, construction, commerce, fishing, manufacturing, tourism, etc) in 2005 growing over 6.67% (one the fastest growth rates of market economies in South America) and it is projected to grow 7% for 2006.<p>For the next five years (until 2010) the Peruvian government has registered more than US$ 10 billion in private investment (both domestic and foreign) in the mining and energy sectors, as well as investments of US$ 15 billion in other sectors such as industry, commerce, tourism, seafood and agriculture, which will keep the economy growing annually at levels of 5% or more.<p><a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">Poverty</a> in Peru is high, with a <!--del_lnk--> poverty threshold level of 48% of the total population. However, the level is reducing slowly and it is expected to diminish to 20% of the population within 10 years.<p><a id="Military" name="Military"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military</span></h2>

      <p>Peru is one of only three <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin American</a> countries which have their largest population segment consisting of indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians, with around 45% of all Peruvians classified as such. Most are found in the southern <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>, though a large portion are also to be found in the southern and central coast due to the massive internal labor migration from remote Andean regions to coastal cities, especially <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>, during the past four decades. While the Andes are the &quot;heart&quot; of indigenous Peru, the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Amazonian region represents nearly 60% of Peruvian national territory and harbors a wide variety of indigenous groups that is rivaled only by its <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. These tropical lowlands, however, are sparsely populated.<p>The two major <!--del_lnk--> indigenous or <!--del_lnk--> ethnic groups are the <!--del_lnk--> Quechuas (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Aymaras, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak <!--del_lnk--> Quechua or <!--del_lnk--> Aymara, and have vibrant cultural traditions, some which were part of the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a>, arguably the most advanced agricultural civilization in the world. Literally dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the <!--del_lnk--> Andes Mountains and in the <!--del_lnk--> Amazon basin.<p>Peru&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Amazonian region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include <!--del_lnk--> Iquitos, <!--del_lnk--> Nauta, <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Maldonado, <!--del_lnk--> Pucallpa and <!--del_lnk--> Yurimaguas. This region is home to numerous <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples, though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the <!--del_lnk--> Shipibo, <!--del_lnk--> Urarina, <!--del_lnk--> Cocama, and <!--del_lnk--> Aguaruna, to name just a few.<p>At the national level, <!--del_lnk--> mestizos constitute the second largest segment of the population, at around 37% of the total population. The term traditionally denotes people of mixed <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian ancestry, and most Peruvian mestizos are of this combination, but other lineages (most notably African) are also present, in varying degrees, in some segements of the mestizo population. Most <!--del_lnk--> mestizos are urban dwellers and can be seen in coastal cities of the north coast, where they show stronger Spanish inheritance, the central coast like <!--del_lnk--> Lima Region, <!--del_lnk--> Cajamarca Region, and also <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa Region.<p>Around 15% of the population is classified as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> White&quot;, and they are for the most part <!--del_lnk--> criollos, the relatively unmixed descendants of the colonial <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonizers. Descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Italian and other small group of <!--del_lnk--> German, <a href="../../wp/y/Yugoslavia.htm" title="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavs</a> and other Europeans represent a relatively smaller proportion of the overall White population. The majority of the White <i>criollos</i> live in the largest cities, concentrated usually the northern coastal citites of <!--del_lnk--> Trujillo, <!--del_lnk--> Chiclayo, <!--del_lnk--> Piura, and of course the capital <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>. The only southern city with a significant White population is <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa. To the north <!--del_lnk--> Cajamarca and <!--del_lnk--> San Martin are also cities with a strong spanish influence.<p>The remaining 3% of the population is of black <!--del_lnk--> African ancestry. The Afro-Peruvians, a legacy of Peru&#39;s history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period. Today also <!--del_lnk--> mulattos (mixed African and European) and <!--del_lnk--> zambos (mixed African and Amerindian) constitude an important part of the population as well, especially in <!--del_lnk--> Piura, <!--del_lnk--> Tumbes, <!--del_lnk--> Lambayeque, <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ica regions.<p>The Afro-Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima, such as that of those found in the <!--del_lnk--> Ica Region, in cities like <!--del_lnk--> Ca&ntilde;ete, <!--del_lnk--> Chincha, <!--del_lnk--> Ica, <!--del_lnk--> Nazca and <!--del_lnk--> Acari in the border with the <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa Region. Other large but poorley promoted segement of Afro-Peruvian presence is in the <i>Yunga</i> regions (west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru) where sugarcane, lemon and mango production is still of importance, that is <!--del_lnk--> Piura and <!--del_lnk--> Lambayeque. Important communities are found all over the <!--del_lnk--> Morropon Province, such as in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Chulucanas, <!--del_lnk--> Yapatera town of the same city, and other even smaller farming towns like <!--del_lnk--> Pabur or <!--del_lnk--> La Matanza and even in the mountainous region near <!--del_lnk--> Canchaque. Further south, the colonial city of <!--del_lnk--> Za&ntilde;a or farming towns like <!--del_lnk--> Capote and <!--del_lnk--> Tuman in <!--del_lnk--> Lambayeque are also important regions with Afro-Peruvian presence.<p>There is also a large presence of Asians, primarily <!--del_lnk--> Japanese and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese, that constitute some 3% of the population, which in proportion to the overall population is the largest of any <!--del_lnk--> Latin American nation.<p>Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a> and the largest population of Cantonese descent in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>. Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian <!--del_lnk--> upper Amazon, including cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Yurimaguas, <!--del_lnk--> Nauta, <!--del_lnk--> Iquitos and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo). In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the <!--del_lnk--> rice fields during the Viceroyalty and to replace the <!--del_lnk--> African slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>
      <p>Peru&#39;s official languages are <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and, according to the Peruvian Constitution of 1993, <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian languages such as <!--del_lnk--> Quechua, <!--del_lnk--> Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate. Today, Spanish is spoken by some 80.3% of the population, and is the language used by government, media, and in education and formal commerce. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.<p>According to official sources, the use of Spanish has increased while the knowledge and use of indigenous languages has decreased considerably during the last four decades (<!--del_lnk--> 1960-<!--del_lnk--> 2000). At the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s some 39% of the total Peruvian population were registered as speakers of indigenous languages, but by the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s the figures show a considerable decline in the use of Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, when only 28% is registered as Quechua-speaking (16% of whom are reported to be bilingual in Spanish) and Spanish-speakers increased to 72%.<p>For 2005, government figures place Spanish as being spoken by 80.3% of the population, but among Amerindian languages another decrease is registered. Of the indigenous languages, Quechua remains the most spoken, and even today is used by some 16.2% of the total Peruvian population, or a third of Peru&#39;s total indigenous population. The number of Aymara-speakers and other indigenous languages is placed at 3%, and foreign languages 0.2%.<p>The drastic decline in use and knowledge of indigenous languages is largely attributed to the recent demographic factors. The urbanization and assimilation of Peru&#39;s Amerindian plurality into the Hispanic-mestizo culture, as well as the new socioeconomic factors associated with class structure have given privilege to the use of Spanish at the expense of the Amerindian languages which were spoken by the majority of the population less than a century ago.<p>The major obstacle to a more widespread use of the Quechua language is the fact that multiple dialects of this language exist. The variations among these Quechua dialects are as pronounced as - for example - the differences between Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. Quechua, along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages, was originally and remains essentially an oral language. Therefore, there is a lack of modern media which use it: for example books, newspapers, software, magazines, technical journals, etc. However, non-governmental organizations as well as state sponsored groups are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the Quechua language; for instance, in late 2005 a superb version of Don Quixote was presented in Quechua.<p>The percentage of native speakers of Quechua who are illiterate has been decreasing lately, as 86.87% of the Peruvian population is literate. More encouraging, nationwide literacy rate of youth aged 15 to 24 years is 96.8%.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Like its rich national history, the popular culture of contemporary Peru is the result of a fusion of cultures, constituted primarily from the cultural legacy of the indigenous groups, and Spanish and African colonists. This cultural mixture has been further enriched by the contributions of other immigrant groups, particularly Asians and non-Iberian Europeans.<p><a id="Peruvian_artistic_creation" name="Peruvian_artistic_creation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Peruvian artistic creation</span></h3>

      <p>Peruvian cultural patrimony has its origin in the magnificent <!--del_lnk--> Andean civilizations, which flourished before the <!--del_lnk--> Spaniards&rsquo; arrival. Peru&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> archaeological treasures are evidence of many significant achievements comparable to those of other great civilizations.<p>Some of the first artistic manifestations reflecting more advanced intellectual and technological evolution are artifacts found in the deposits of <!--del_lnk--> Chav&iacute;n de Hu&aacute;ntar and <!--del_lnk--> Cupisnique. These are examples of symbolic and religious art including <!--del_lnk--> gold and silver work, <!--del_lnk--> ceramics,<a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> and <!--del_lnk--> stone sculpture. These sites date as far back as the <!--del_lnk--> 14th century BC and <!--del_lnk--> 11th century BC, respectively.<p>Between the <!--del_lnk--> 8th century BC and <a href="../../wp/1/1st_century.htm" title="1st century">1st century</a> AD, the <!--del_lnk--> Paracas Cavernas and <!--del_lnk--> Paracas Necr&oacute;polis cultures developed. The <!--del_lnk--> Paracas Cavernas culture produced beautiful polychrome ceramics with religious representations as well as monochrome ceramics. The <!--del_lnk--> Paracas Necr&oacute;polis culture is characterized by its delicate fabrics in complex styles.<p>In the period between the <!--del_lnk--> 3rd century BC and <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a> AD, the urban culture known as <!--del_lnk--> Mochica developed in <!--del_lnk--> Lambayeque. <!--del_lnk--> Nazca culture also developed in this period in the valley of <!--del_lnk--> r&iacute;o Grande, in <!--del_lnk--> Ica. In <!--del_lnk--> Mochica culture, the magnificent <!--del_lnk--> Huaca del Sol and <!--del_lnk--> Huaca de la Luna, <!--del_lnk--> Huaca Cao Viejo and <!--del_lnk--> Huaca El Brujo and the <!--del_lnk--> Huaca Rajada of <!--del_lnk--> Sipan are worth mentioning. They are notable for their <!--del_lnk--> cultivation in terraces and <!--del_lnk--> hydraulic engineering, as well as some of the most original ceramics, textiles, and pictorial and sculptural art in the Andean world.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Wari civilization, which flourished between the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th century</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> AD, was based in <!--del_lnk--> Ayacucho. This civilization may have been the first Andean culture to define a planned urban layout. Such a concept was later expanded to zones like <!--del_lnk--> Pachacamac, <!--del_lnk--> Cajamarquilla, <!--del_lnk--> Wari Willca and others. <!--del_lnk--> Tiahuanaco culture developed by the borders of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Titicaca.htm" title="Lake Titicaca">lake Titicaca</a> between the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a> AD. This culture introduced monumental lithic architecture and sculpture as well as military urbanism. These advances in <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a> were possible thanks to the discovery of <!--del_lnk--> bronze for making tools.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Chim&uacute; town improvement on the principle of urban architecture. This civilization built the city of <!--del_lnk--> Chan Chan in the valley of the <!--del_lnk--> Moche river, in <!--del_lnk--> La Libertad, between the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th</a> centuries AD. The <!--del_lnk--> chim&uacute; were also skillful <!--del_lnk--> goldsmiths and made remarkable works of <!--del_lnk--> hydraulic engineering.<p>The <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Civilization</a> incorporated, and in many cases perfected, many of the cultural techniques of the civilizations that preceded it. There are many examples of original Inca architecture and engineering that have outlasted later Spanish colonial structures. In this regard, the rich Inca heritage can still be observed in cities like <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco, the fortress of <!--del_lnk--> Sacsahuaman, Ollantaytambo, <a href="../../wp/m/Machu_Picchu.htm" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a>, and extensive stone roads that united <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco with the four cardinal points of the <a href="../../wp/i/Inca_Empire.htm" title="Inca Empire">Inca Empire</a>. The Spanish conquest displaced, not without violence, native artistic practices and concepts, although in many cases, it made for enriching hybrids of traditional Spanish and native art.<p><a id="Architecture" name="Architecture"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture</span></h3>
      <p>Peruvian architecture is a conjunction of European styles exposed to the influence of indigenous imagery. Two of the most well-known examples of the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance period</a> are <!--del_lnk--> the Cathedral and the <!--del_lnk--> church of Santa Clara of Cuzco. After this period, the mestization reached its richer expression in the <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque</a>. Some examples of this <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">Baroque period</a> are the <!--del_lnk--> convent of San Francisco de Lima, the <!--del_lnk--> church of the Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a and the facade of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Cuzco and, overall, the churches of <!--del_lnk--> San Agust&iacute;n and <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosa of <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa, its more beautiful exponents.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> independence war left a creative emptiness that <!--del_lnk--> Neoclassicism of French inspiration could just fill. The <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">XX century</a> is characterized by the <!--del_lnk--> eclecticism, to which the <!--del_lnk--> constructive functionalism has been against. The most considerable example is <!--del_lnk--> San Martin Plaza in <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a>.<p><a id="Sculpture_and_painting" name="Sculpture_and_painting"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sculpture and painting</span></h3>

      <p>Peruvian <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Painting.htm" title="Painting">painting</a> began to define themselves from the <!--del_lnk--> ateliers founded by <!--del_lnk--> monks, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian <!--del_lnk--> Baroque School. In this background, the stalls of the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral choir, the fountain of the <!--del_lnk--> Main Square of <!--del_lnk--> Lima and great part of the colonial production were registered.<p>The artistic crossbreeding was more intense in the pictorial creation. This crossbreeding gathered, without ambages, the native heritage and materialized, without incisions, the historical continuity. You are able to see this in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, from <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Mora, or in the linens of the Italians <!--del_lnk--> Mateo P&eacute;rez de Alesio and <!--del_lnk--> Angelino Medoro, the Spanish <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Bejarano and <!--del_lnk--> J. de Illescas and the Creole <!--del_lnk--> J.

      <p>In the history of <!--del_lnk--> Peruvian literature, the oral <!--del_lnk--> indigenous tradition and the technical resources of writing (incorporated by Spaniards) converge in each other. From the beginning, it was possible to gather and to express the different and complex cultural realities that entered in conflict immediately after <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire.htm" title="Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire">the conquest</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Quechua and <!--del_lnk--> Aymara literature was transmitted in an oral way. It was linked to religious, agrarian, affectionate, festive or funeral <!--del_lnk--> rites. These characteristics became into certain forms of <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> or <!--del_lnk--> prose, as it is observed in the first historical <!--del_lnk--> chronicles of the <!--del_lnk--> Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (<!--del_lnk--> Los comentarios reales) or <!--del_lnk--> Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala (<!--del_lnk--> la Nueva cr&oacute;nica y buen gobierno) and in the identification between the <!--del_lnk--> yaravies and the patriotic and romantic poetry. One of the most outstanding exponents here was <!--del_lnk--> Mariano Melgar.<p>Later, the <!--del_lnk--> hegemony of Creole <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> in the Peruvian society favored the abandonment of the indigenous forms in favour of the European ones. Then the <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassicists</a> arose like <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Asencio y Segura and <!--del_lnk--> Felipe Pardo y Aliaga. They held themselves almost until the end of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">XIX century</a>. At this time, the <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">romantic current</a> was imposed thanked to the works of <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Augusto Salaverry and <!--del_lnk--> Jose Arnaldo Marquez, between others. The general crisis derived from the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific gave place to the <!--del_lnk--> Modernism. Its best exponents were <!--del_lnk--> Jose Santos Chocano and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Eguren. After them, the <!--del_lnk--> Avant-gardism current popped up strongly impelled by the magazines: <!--del_lnk--> Col&oacute;nida and <!--del_lnk--> Amauta. <!--del_lnk--> Amauta magazine was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1926 by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Carlos Mari&aacute;tegui. Between its collaborators was <!--del_lnk--> C&eacute;sar Vallejo. Meanwhile the <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous current in <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> was reborn thanked to <!--del_lnk--> Luis Fabio Xammar. The <!--del_lnk--> avant-gardist writers were fragmenting in different <!--del_lnk--> lyric proposals like the ones of <!--del_lnk--> Xavier Abril, <!--del_lnk--> Alberto Hidalgo, <!--del_lnk--> Sebastian Salazar Bondy, <!--del_lnk--> Carlos Germ&aacute;n Belli, and others. They were opening new and diverse expressive fields.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">XIX century</a>, Peruvian prose passed from the <!--del_lnk--> costumbrismo current: <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Ascensio Segura and <!--del_lnk--> Ricardo Palma, to the <!--del_lnk--> Modernism current: <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Gonz&aacute;lez Prada and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Santos Chocano. In the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">XX century</a>, the indigenous prose reached some of its culminating moments with <!--del_lnk--> Ciro Alegr&iacute;a and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Arguedas, <!--del_lnk--> Sebasti&aacute;n Salazar Bondy, <!--del_lnk--> Manuel Scorza and <!--del_lnk--> Julio Ram&oacute;n Ribeyro. Without leaving the <!--del_lnk--> realistic approach, <!--del_lnk--> Mario Vargas Llosa.

      <p>The art of Peru was shaped by the melting between <!--del_lnk--> Spanish and <!--del_lnk--> Amerindian cultures. During pre-Columbian times, Peru was one of the major centers of artistic expression in <!--del_lnk--> The Americas, where <!--del_lnk--> Pre-Inca cultures, such as <!--del_lnk--> Chav&iacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> Moche, <!--del_lnk--> Paracas, <!--del_lnk--> Huari (Wari), <!--del_lnk--> Nazca, <!--del_lnk--> Chimu, and <!--del_lnk--> Tiahuanaco developed high-quality <a href="../../wp/p/Pottery.htm" title="Pottery">pottery</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textiles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> jewelry, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sculpture.htm" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>.<p>Drawing upon earlier cultures, the Incas continued to maintain these crafts but made even more impressive achievements in architecture. The mountain town of <a href="../../wp/m/Machu_Picchu.htm" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> and the buildings at <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco are excellent examples of <!--del_lnk--> Inca architectural design.<p>During the colonial period, Spanish <a href="../../wp/b/Baroque.htm" title="Baroque">baroque</a> fused with the rich Inca tradition to produce <a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">mestizo</a> art. The Cuzco school of largely anonymous Indian artists followed the Spanish baroque tradition with influence from the Italian, Flemish, and French schools.<p>Painter Francisco Fierro made a distinctive contribution to this school with his portrayals of typical events, manners, and customs of mid-19th-century Peru. Francisco Lazo, forerunner of the indigenous school of painters, also achieved fame for his portraits.<p>Peru has passed early 20th century brought &quot;indigenismo,&quot; expressed in a new awareness of Indian culture. Since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Peruvian writers, artists, and intellectuals such as <!--del_lnk--> Cesar Vallejo and <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Arguedas have participated in worldwide intellectual and artistic movements, drawing especially on U.S. and European trends.<p>In the decade after <!--del_lnk--> 1932, the &quot;indigenous school&quot; of painting headed by <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Sabogal dominated the cultural scene in Peru. A subsequent reaction among Peruvian artists led to the beginning of modern Peruvian painting. Sabogal&#39;s resignation as director of the National School of Arts in <!--del_lnk--> 1943 coincided with the return of several Peruvian painters from Europe who revitalised &quot;universal&quot; and international styles of painting in Peru.<p>During the 1960s, Fernando de Szyszlo, an internationally recognised Peruvian artist, became the main advocate for abstract painting and pushed Peruvian art toward modernism. Peru remains an art-producing centre with painters such as Fernando de Szyslo, Gerardo Chavez, Jos&eacute; Tola, Alberto Quintanilla, and Jos&eacute; Carlos Ramos, along with sculptor Victor Delf&iacute;n, gaining international stature.<p>Promising young artists continue to develop now that Peru&#39;s economy allows more promotion of the arts.<p><a id="Crafts" name="Crafts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Crafts</span></h3>
      <p>Between the most spread crafts in Peru, there are the <!--del_lnk--> ceramics (either artistic or utilitarian), the <!--del_lnk--> carving, the <!--del_lnk--> silversmiths&#39; work, the leather <!--del_lnk--> repoussage, the straw <!--del_lnk--> weaving, and of course the <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textile</a> work, emphasizing the colorful <!--del_lnk--> weavings made of <a href="../../wp/a/Alpaca.htm" title="Alpaca">alpaca</a>&#39;s wool.<p><a id="Folkloric_expressions" name="Folkloric_expressions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Folkloric expressions</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Pre-Hispanic Peruvian Andean cultures were especially bound to musical artistic expressions.

      <p>Like its geography (28 of 32 world climates), its cuisine and its various ethnicities, Peruvian music is very diverse. Much of Peru&#39;s music is derived from <!--del_lnk--> Andean, Andalusian <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> African roots. Modern Peruvian music and Amazon influenced music is also common in Peru. As of 2006 in Peru, most young peruvians in the cities listen to <!--del_lnk--> reggeaton. Tropical Latin music such as <!--del_lnk--> Salsa and <!--del_lnk--> Merengue is very popular too in Lima and <!--del_lnk--> Callao. Local singers include <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Cartagena and <!--del_lnk--> Willi Rivera among others. <!--del_lnk--> Rock in Spanish and English, <!--del_lnk--> pop in Spanish and English, and Ballads are also popular among large sectros of the populations with <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Suarez Vertiz being the most popular rocker in Peru. <!--del_lnk--> Cumbias and its peruvian cousin <!--del_lnk--> technocumbias are popular among immigrants from the country side and their descendants to Lima and other cities in the coasts. In cities like <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa music in English is commonly listen and played in Top 40 Radio stations in addition to Reggeaton and Rock in Spanish. During the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s Rock in Spanish and English, and Salsa were the most common music styles in Lima and other major cities.<p>The Pre-Hispanic Andean musicians mostly used <!--del_lnk--> wind instruments such as the <!--del_lnk--> quena, the <!--del_lnk--> pinkillo, the <!--del_lnk--> erke, the <!--del_lnk--> antara or <!--del_lnk--> siku (also called <!--del_lnk--> zampo&ntilde;a), the <!--del_lnk--> pututo or <!--del_lnk--> pototo, etc. They also used diverse <!--del_lnk--> membranophone instruments such as the <!--del_lnk--> tinya (hand drum), the <!--del_lnk--> wankar, instrument of big dimensions, the <!--del_lnk--> pomatinyas - made of <!--del_lnk--> puma&#39;s skin-, and the <!--del_lnk--> runatinyas - made of human&#39;s skin-. The <!--del_lnk--> runatinya was also used in battles.<p>With the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire.htm" title="Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire">Spanish conquest</a>, new <a href="../../wp/m/Musical_instrument.htm" title="Musical instrument">instruments</a> arrived like <!--del_lnk--> harps, <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitars</a>, <!--del_lnk--> vihuelas, <!--del_lnk--> bandurrias, <!--del_lnk--> lutes, etc. Due to these <a href="../../wp/m/Musical_instrument.htm" title="Musical instrument">instruments</a>, new crossbred Andean instruments appeared. These crossbred instruments are still in used nowadays: the <!--del_lnk--> Andean harp and the <!--del_lnk--> charango. The <!--del_lnk--> sounding box of the <!--del_lnk--> charango is made of the <a href="../../wp/a/Armadillo.htm" title="Armadillo">armadillo</a>&#39;s shell.<p>The cultural crossbreeding did not limit itself to the contact of <!--del_lnk--> Indigenous and <!--del_lnk--> European cultures. The <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">African slaves</a>&#39; contribution was demonstrated in <!--del_lnk--> rhythms and <!--del_lnk--> percussion instruments. This influence is visible in musical forms like <!--del_lnk--> festejo, <!--del_lnk--> zamacueca, etc.<p>Coastal music is rooted in the haciendas and the <i>callejones</i> of cities such as Lima, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Tumbes and Ica. It involves a creole version of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish guitar and the famous Peruvian instrument <!--del_lnk--> Cajon drum.<p><a id="Andean_Peruvian_music" name="Andean_Peruvian_music"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Andean Peruvian music</span></h4>
      <p>Andean music is rooted in the traditional <i>native music</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish orquestal and <!--del_lnk--> European Church musicals. The southern Andean region is famous for the <!--del_lnk--> Huayno, a mestizo happy chant that involves <!--del_lnk--> Charango guitar, beautifully-toned lamenting vocals and sometimes the <!--del_lnk--> Andean Harp. The Huayno Ayacuchano is probably the most famous of its styles since it is played on creole and even Spanish guitar, adding to its feel an even a more soulful and romantic expression.<p><!--del_lnk--> Cusco, <!--del_lnk--> Puno and <!--del_lnk--> Apurimac have a more pure native feel to their music whom even incorporate violins. Famous tuens are the <!--del_lnk--> Muliza and <!--del_lnk--> Valicha <i>Cusque&ntilde;a</i>, whom are also very romantic and melancolic. Other Andean rhythms involve a fusion of European Church music and Huaynos such as the known song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> El C&oacute;ndor Pasa&quot;, a traditional Peruvian song popularized in the United States by the folk duo <!--del_lnk--> Simon &amp; Garfunkel and featured in the movie &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Graduate&quot;. The original composition consists of a Yarav&iacute;, followed by an Inca &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Pasacalle&quot; and a Huayno fugue, three traditional Inca rhythms.<p><!--del_lnk--> Jorge Bravo de Rueda&#39;s famous &quot;V&iacute;rgenes del Sol&quot; was popularized in 1951 by <!--del_lnk--> Yma S&uacute;mac.<p><!--del_lnk--> Arequipa is region that probably that resembles best the mixing of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Andean cultures. <!--del_lnk--> Arequipa city is the proud creator of the famous <!--del_lnk--> Yarav&iacute;, a melancholy style that involves Spanish or <i>creole</i> guitar that is sung <!--del_lnk--> A Capella. It has been popularized to the rest of the Andean communities after the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific War in honour of <!--del_lnk--> Mariano Melgar (local hero). The music evokes to the solitude of the mountains, the miners and the Andean farmer. It is a mix of gypsy <!--del_lnk--> Zards and <!--del_lnk--> Huayno.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Huaylas of the central Andes, by contrast, is a cheery, rhythmic style mostly popular around <!--del_lnk--> Cerro de Pasco, <!--del_lnk--> Huanuco <!--del_lnk--> Huaraz.<p><a id="Coastal_Peruvian_music" name="Coastal_Peruvian_music"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Coastal Peruvian music</span></h4>

      <p>The coast has a different feel to its music than its Andean counterpart. It is called <i>musica criolla</i> and its rooted in a fusion that evokes to traditional <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Gypsy (Roma People) and <!--del_lnk--> African influence.<p>It combines traditional European rhythms, strong gypsy emotional flair deriving from <!--del_lnk--> Flamenco and eastern European <!--del_lnk--> Zards, and also <!--del_lnk--> African based chorus and percussion.<p>This mixture is rooted especially in the central and northern coast, and has provided the wide range of dance and musical styles we hear today. <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> for example, is most well known musical style <!--del_lnk--> Peruvian Waltz known elsewhere as <i>valse peruano</i> and <i>valsesito peruano</i>. The rhythm involves a singer, a chorus, creole <!--del_lnk--> Guitarr, Peruvian <!--del_lnk--> Caj&oacute;n and spoon players. It is widely popularised by the great <i>Chabuca Granda</i>, who is considered the most important composer of <i>coastal creole</i> music, with such songs as <i>La Flor de La Canela</i>, <i>Fina Estampa</i>, and <i>Jos&eacute; Antonio</i>. Other commonly known <i>Peruvian valse</i> tunes are <i>Alma Corazon y Vida</i>, <i>Odiame</i>, <i>Propiedad Privada</i>, <i>El Plebeyo</i>, and <i>El Rosario de Mi Madre</i>, some of these songs are twisted to Bolero or Salsa version by <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean artists.<p>Afro Peruvian music is commonly performed by duos of creole guitars, the <!--del_lnk--> Cajon, <!--del_lnk--> Cajita and the peculiar <!--del_lnk--> Quijada de Burro.<p>Examples of these dances are the <i>Festejo</i> and <i>Land&oacute;</i>, which are common to <i>Afro-Peruvian</i> communities of the southern coast. <!--del_lnk--> Susana Baca is a renowned singer and composer of Afro Peruvian music. She won a Grammy award in 2002 for her album <i>Lamento Negro</i>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Marinera or <!--del_lnk--> Zamacueca of the central coast <a href="../../wp/l/Lima.htm" title="Lima">Lima</a> is the current National Dance of Peru, named in honour of the marines who fought against the Chilean military in the <!--del_lnk--> War of the Pacific. Among Peruvians of the coast, it is considered as traditional and representative as the <!--del_lnk--> Tango is to <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>. The dance evokes from a mixture of Eastern European <!--del_lnk--> gypsy, flamenco and the elegance of the <!--del_lnk--> Peruvian Paso Horse. Many people take classes and look forward to the annual Marinera Festival held in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Trujillo every July, with thousands in attendance.<p>In the northern coast especially <!--del_lnk--> Lambayeque and <!--del_lnk--> Piura, the people are most famous for the <!--del_lnk--> Cumananas and the <!--del_lnk--> Tondero dance. These are the oldest and most mestizo expressions of Peruvian music and derive from the encountered mixture of the <!--del_lnk--> Gypsies, <!--del_lnk--> Africans slaves and migrant <!--del_lnk--> Andean cultures.<p>Peruvian coastal music has in its rich structure the participation of a local instrument called the caj&oacute;n. This instrument has been mistaken very frequently with an Spanish origin (the cajon was introduced in Spain around the 1980&#39;s by Paco de Lucia, but the truth is that the cajon has been utilized in Peruvian music since the colonial times. Although it might also have <i>gypsy</i> influence it has been proved that the instrument is strictly of Peruvian origin since it is rooted in the Tondero, the Zamacueca, the Resabalosa and Peruvian coastal creole rhythms before any other expressions.<p><a id="Dances" name="Dances"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dances</span></h3>

Some <!--del_lnk--> choreographies show certain Christian influence. Two of the most representative Andean dances are the <!--del_lnk--> kashua and the <!--del_lnk--> wayno or <!--del_lnk--> huayno. The <!--del_lnk--> kashua has a communal character and it is usually danced in groups in the country or open spaces. The <!--del_lnk--> huayno is a &quot;salon ball&quot;. It is danced in couples and in closed spaces. The <!--del_lnk--> yaravi and the <!--del_lnk--> triste have also an Andean origin. They are usually songs with very emotional lyrics.<p>Dances of Ritual character are the <!--del_lnk--> achocallo, the <!--del_lnk--> pinkillada, the <!--del_lnk--> llamerada (dance that imitates the <!--del_lnk--> llama&#39;s walk), the <!--del_lnk--> kullawada (the <!--del_lnk--> spinners&#39; dance), etc. Between the Hunting dances, it can be mentioned: the <!--del_lnk--> llipi-puli and <!--del_lnk--> choq&#39;elas.

There are also <!--del_lnk--> Carnival Dances. A <!--del_lnk--> Carnival is a western holiday that, in the Peruvian <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a>, is celebrated simultaneously with the <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">crops time</a>.
