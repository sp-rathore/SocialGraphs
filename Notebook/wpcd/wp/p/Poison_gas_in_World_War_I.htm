      <p>The use of <b>poison gas in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a></b> was a major military innovation. The gases used ranged from disabling chemicals such as <!--del_lnk--> tear gas and the more severe, <!--del_lnk--> mustard gas to killing agents like <!--del_lnk--> phosgene. This <!--del_lnk--> chemical warfare was a major component of the first <!--del_lnk--> global war and first <!--del_lnk--> total war of the 20th century. The killing capacity of gas was limited &mdash; only 3% of combat deaths were due to gas &mdash; however, the proportion of non-fatal <!--del_lnk--> casualties was high and gas remained one of the soldiers&#39; greatest fears. In that it was possible to develop effective countermeasures to gas, it was unlike most other weapons of the period. Hence in the later stages of the war as the use of gas increased, in many cases its effectiveness was diminished. This widespread use of these agents of chemical warfare, and wartime advances in the composition of <!--del_lnk--> high explosives, gave rise to an occasionally expressed view of World War I as &quot;the chemists&#39; war&quot;.<p>

      <p><a name="1914.2C_tear_gas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1914, tear gas</span></h3>
      <p>The early uses of chemicals as weapons were as a tear inducing irritant (<!--del_lnk--> lachrymatory), rather than fatal or disabling poisons. Although many believe that gases were first used in World War I, there are accounts that <!--del_lnk--> sulfur gas was used in the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC by the <!--del_lnk--> Spartans. During the first World War, the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> were the first to employ gas, using <!--del_lnk--> grenades filled with tear gas (<!--del_lnk--> xylyl bromide) in August 1914. <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> retaliated in kind in October 1914, firing <!--del_lnk--> fragmentation <!--del_lnk--> shells filled with a chemical irritant against French positions at <!--del_lnk--> Neuve Chapelle though the concentration achieved was so small it was barely noticed.<p><a name="1915.2C_large_scale_use_and_lethal_gases"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1915, large scale use and lethal gases</span></h3>
      <p>Germany was the first to make large scale use of gas as a weapon. On <!--del_lnk--> 31 January <!--del_lnk--> 1915, 18,000 <!--del_lnk--> artillery shells containing liquid xylyl bromide tear gas (known as <i>T-Stoff</i>) were fired on <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> positions on the <!--del_lnk--> Rawka River, west of <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bolimov. Instead of vaporizing, the chemical froze, completely failing to have an impact.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">Chlorine</a> became the first killing agent to be employed. German chemical conglomerate <!--del_lnk--> IG Farben had been producing chlorine as a by-product of their <!--del_lnk--> dye manufacturing. In cooperation with <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Haber of the <!--del_lnk--> Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, they began developing methods of discharging chlorine gas against enemy <!--del_lnk--> trenches. By <!--del_lnk--> 22 April <!--del_lnk--> 1915, the German Army had 160 <!--del_lnk--> tons of chlorine deployed in 5,730 cylinders opposite <!--del_lnk--> Langemarck, north of <!--del_lnk--> Ypres. At 17:00, in a slight easterly breeze, the gas was released, forming a grey-green cloud that drifted across positions held by French Colonial troops who broke, abandoning their trenches and creating an 8,000 yard (7 km) gap in the Allied line. However, the German infantry were also wary of the gas and lacked reinforcements and therefore failed to exploit the break before <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> reinforcements arrived.<p>In what became the <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans used gas on three more occasions; on <!--del_lnk--> 24 April against the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian 1st Division, on <!--del_lnk--> 2 May near Mouse Trap Farm and on <!--del_lnk--> 5 May against the British at <!--del_lnk--> Hill 60. At this stage, defences against gas were non-existent; the British Official History stated that at Hill 60:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;90 men died from gas poisoning in the trenches; of the 207 brought to the nearest dressing stations, 46 died almost immediately and 12 after long suffering.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>Chlorine was inefficient as a weapon. It produced a visible <!--del_lnk--> greenish cloud and strong odour, making it easy to detect. It was water-soluble so the simple expedient of covering the mouth and nose with a damp cloth was effective at reducing the impact of the gas. It was thought to be even more effective to use urine rather than water as the ammonia would neutralize the chlorine, but it is now known that ammonia and chlorine can produce hazardously toxic fumes. Chlorine required a concentration of 1,000 parts per million to be fatal, destroying <!--del_lnk--> tissue in the <!--del_lnk--> lungs. Despite its limitations, chlorine was an effective terror weapon, and the sight of an oncoming cloud of the gas was a continual source of dread for the infantry.<p><a id="British_gas_attacks" name="British_gas_attacks"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British gas attacks</span></h3>
      <p>The British expressed outrage at Germany&#39;s use of poison gas at Ypres but responded by developing their own gas warfare capability. The commander of <!--del_lnk--> British II Corps, Lt.Gen. Ferguson said of gas:<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;It is a cowardly form of warfare which does not commend itself to me or other English soldiers. We cannot win this war unless we kill or incapacitate more of our enemies than they do of us, and if this can only be done by our copying the enemy in his choice of weapons, we must not refuse to do so.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>In the end, the British Army embraced gas with enthusiasm and mounted more gas attacks than any other combatant. This was due partly to the British spending most of the latter years of the war on the offensive. Also the prevailing <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">wind</a> on the <!--del_lnk--> Western Front was from the west which meant the British more frequently had favourable conditions for a gas release than the Germans. The first use of gas by the British was at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Loos, <!--del_lnk--> 25 September <!--del_lnk--> 1915 but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed <i>Red Star</i>, was the agent to be used (150 tons arrayed in 5,500 cylinders), and the attack was dependent on a favourable wind. However, on this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in <!--del_lnk--> no man&#39;s land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches.<p><a name="1915.2C_more_deadly_gases"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1915, more deadly gases</span></h3>
      <p>The deficiencies of chlorine were overcome with the introduction of <!--del_lnk--> phosgene, first used by France under the direction of French chemist <!--del_lnk--> Victor Grignard in 1915. Colourless and having an odour likened to &quot;mouldy hay,&quot; phosgene was difficult to detect, making it a more effective weapon. Later, the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germans</a>, under the direction of German chemist <!--del_lnk--> Fritz Haber added small quantities to <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> to increase the latter&#39;s toxicity. Although phosgene was sometimes used on its own, it was more often used mixed with an equal volume of chlorine, the chlorine helping to spread the denser phosgene. The Allies called this combination <i>White Star</i> after the marking painted on shells containing the mixture).<p>Phosgene was a potent killing agent, deadlier than chlorine. It had a potential drawback in that the symptoms of exposure took 24 hours or more to manifest, meaning that the victims were initially still capable of putting up a fight; although this could also mean that apparently fit troops would be incapacitated by the effects of the gas the following day.<p>In the first combined chlorine/phosgene attack by Germany, against British troops at <!--del_lnk--> Nieltje near <!--del_lnk--> Ypres, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 19 December <!--del_lnk--> 1915, 88 tons of the gas were released from cylinders causing 1069 casualties and 69 deaths. The British P gas helmet, issued at the time, was impregnated with phenate hexamine and partially effective against phosgene. The modified PH Gas Helmet, which was additionally impregnated with <!--del_lnk--> hexamethylenetetramine to improve the protection against phosgene, was issued in January 1916.<p>Around 36,600 tons of the gas were manufactured during the war, out of a total of 190,000 tons for all chemical weapons, making it second only to chlorine (93,800 tons) in the quantity manufactured:<ul>
       <li>Germany 18,100 tons<li>France 15,700 tons<li>Great Britain 1,400 tons (although they also used French stocks)<li>United States 1,400 tons (although they also used French stocks)</ul>
      <p>Although it was never as notorious in public consciousness as <!--del_lnk--> mustard gas, it killed far more people, being responsible for about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by chemical weapons during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>.<table align="right" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="margin-left:1em; clear:right">

      <p>The most widely reported and perhaps, the most effective gas of the First World War was <!--del_lnk--> mustard gas, a <!--del_lnk--> vesicant, which was introduced by Germany in July 1917 prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Third Battle of Ypres. Known to the British as <i>HS</i> (<i>Hun Stuff</i>) and Yellow Cross, mustard gas was not intended as a killing agent (though in high enough doses it was fatal) but instead was used to harass and disable the enemy and pollute the battlefield. Delivered in artillery shells, mustard gas was heavier than air, settled to the ground as an oily <!--del_lnk--> sherry-looking liquid and evaporated slowly without sunlight.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:202px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/242/24206.jpg.htm" title="A soldier with mustard gas burns, ca. 1914-1918."><img alt="A soldier with mustard gas burns, ca. 1914-1918." height="143" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Mustard_gas_burns.jpg" src="../../images/242/24206.jpg" width="200" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The polluting nature of mustard gas meant that it was not always suitable for supporting an attack as the assaulting infantry would be exposed to the gas when they advanced. When Germany launched <!--del_lnk--> Operation <i>Michael</i> on <!--del_lnk--> 21 March <!--del_lnk--> 1918, they saturated the <!--del_lnk--> Flesqui&egrave;res <!--del_lnk--> salient with mustard gas instead of attacking it directly, believing that the harassing effect of the gas, coupled with threats to the salient&#39;s flanks, would make the British position untenable.<p>Gas never reproduced the dramatic success of <!--del_lnk--> 22 April <!--del_lnk--> 1915; however, it became a standard weapon which, combined with conventional artillery, was used to support most attacks in the later stages of the war. The <!--del_lnk--> Western Front was the main theatre in which gas was employed &mdash; the static, confined <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">trench system</a> was ideal for achieving an effective concentration &mdash; however, Germany made use of gas against Russia on the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures would result in deaths of thousands of Russian infantry, while Britain experimented with gas in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine during the <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of Gaza. Mustard Gas (Yperite) was first used by the German Army in September 1917. The most lethal of all the poisonous chemicals used during the war, it was almost odourless and took twelve hours to take effect. Yperite was so powerful that only small amounts had to be added to high explosive shells to be effective. Once in the soil, mustard gas remained active for several weeks.<p>The skin of victims of mustard gas blistered, the eyes became very sore and they began to vomit. Mustard gas caused internal and external bleeding and attacked the bronchial tubes, stripping off the mucous membrane. This was extremely painful and most soldiers had to be strapped to their beds. It usually took a person four or five weeks to die of mustard gas poisoning. One nurse, Vera Brittain, wrote: &quot;I wish those people who talk about going on with this war whatever it costs could see the soldiers suffering from mustard gas poisoning. Great mustard-coloured blisters, blind eyes, all sticky and stuck together, always fighting for breath, with voices a mere whisper, saying that their throats are closing and they know they will choke.&quot;<p><a id="Post-war" name="Post-war"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-war</span></h3>
      <p>By the end of the war, chemical weapons had lost much of their effectiveness against well trained and equipped troops. At that time, one quarter of artillery shells fired contained chemical weapons<!--del_lnk-->  but caused only 3% of the casualties.<p>Nevertheless in the following years chemical weapons were used in several, mainly colonial, wars where one side had an advantage in equipment over the other. The British used <!--del_lnk--> adamsite against <!--del_lnk--> Russian revolutionary troops in 1919 and mustard against <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraqi</a> insurgents in the 1920s; <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> used chemical weapons in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> against <!--del_lnk--> Rif tribesmen throughout the 1920s<!--del_lnk-->  and <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> used <!--del_lnk--> mustard gas in <a href="../../wp/l/Libya.htm" title="Libya">Libya</a> in 1930 and again during its invasion of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1936<!--del_lnk--> . In 1925, a Chinese <!--del_lnk--> warlord, <!--del_lnk--> Zhang Zuolin, contracted a German company to build him a mustard gas plant in <!--del_lnk--> Shengyang<!--del_lnk--> , which was completed in 1927.<p>Public opinion had by then turned against the use of such weapons, which led to the <!--del_lnk--> Geneva Protocol, a treaty banning the use (but not the stockpiling) of lethal gas and bacteriological weapons which was signed by most First World War combatants in 1925. Most countries that signed ratified it within around five years, although a few took much longer <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uruguay.htm" title="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> did not do so until the 1970s and <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> ratified it only in <!--del_lnk--> 1990<!--del_lnk--> .<p>Although all major combatants stockpiled chemical weapons during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War, the only reports of its use in the conflict were the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> use of relatively small amounts of mustard gas and <!--del_lnk--> lewisite in China<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> , and very rare occurrences in Europe (for example some <!--del_lnk--> sulfur mustard bombs were dropped on <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1939, which Germany acknowledged in 1942 but indicated that it had been accidental<!--del_lnk--> ). Mustard gas was the agent of choice, with the British stockpiling 40,719 tons, the Russians 77,400 tons, the Americans over 87,000 tons and the Germans 27,597 tons<!--del_lnk--> .<p>The mustard gas with which the British hoped to repel an invasion of the United Kingdom in 1940 was never needed<!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> , and a fear that the allies also had <!--del_lnk--> nerve agents<!--del_lnk-->  prevented their deployment by Germany. Nevertheless poison gas technology played an <!--del_lnk--> important role in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>.<p>Although chemical weapons have been used in at least a dozen wars since the end of the First World War<!--del_lnk--> , they have never been used again in combat on such a large scale. Nevertheless, the use of mustard gas and the more deadly nerve agents by <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> during the 8-year <!--del_lnk--> Iran-Iraq war killed around 20,000 Iranian troops (and injured another 80,000), around a quarter of the number of deaths caused by chemical weapons during the First World War<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="Casualties" name="Casualties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Casualties</span></h2>

      <p>The contribution of gas weapons to the total casualty figures was relatively minor. British figures, which were accurately maintained from 1916, recorded that only 3% of gas casualties were fatal, 2% were permanently invalid and 70% were fit for duty again within six weeks. All gas casualties were mentally scarred by exposure, and gas remained one of the great fears of the front-line soldier.<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;It was remarked as a joke that if someone yelled &#39;Gas&#39;, everyone in France would put on a mask. ... Gas shock was as frequent as <!--del_lnk--> shell shock.&quot;</i> (H. Allen, <i>Towards the Flame</i>, 1934)</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd><i>Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumbling,</i><dd><i>Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;</i><dd><i>But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,</i><dd><i>And flound&#39;ring like a man in fire or lime...</i><dd><i>Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,</i><dd><i>As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.</i><dd><i>In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,</i><dd><i>He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.</i></dl>

      <p>Death by gas was particularly horrific. According to Denis Winter (<i>Death&#39;s Men</i>, 1978), a fatal dose of phosgene eventually led to &quot;shallow breathing and retching, pulse up to 120, an ashen face and the discharge of four pints (2 litres) of yellow liquid from the lungs each hour for the 48 of the drowning spasms.&quot;<p>A common fate of those exposed to gas was blindness, <!--del_lnk--> tear gas or mustard gas being the main causes. It became a frequent spectacle to see lines of blinded soldiers, hand on the shoulder of the man in front, being guided by a sighted man to a dressing station. One of the most famous First World War paintings, <i>Gassed</i> by <!--del_lnk--> John Singer Sargent, captures such a scene of mustard gas casualties which he witnessed at a dressing station at Le Bac-du-Sud near <!--del_lnk--> Arras in July 1918.<table align="left" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" style="margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em">

      <p>Mustard gas caused the most gas casualties on the Western Front, despite being produced in smaller quantities than irritant gases such as chlorine and phosgene. The proportion of mustard gas fatalities to total casualties was low; only 2% of mustard gas casualties died and many of these succumbed to secondary <!--del_lnk--> infections rather than the gas itself. Once it was introduced at Ypres, mustard gas produced 90% of all British gas casualties and 14% of battle casualties of any type.<p>Mustard gas was a source of extreme dread. In <i>The Anatomy of Courage</i> (1945), <!--del_lnk--> Lord Moran, who had been a medical officer during the war, wrote: &quot;After July 1917 gas partly usurped the role of <!--del_lnk--> high explosive in bringing to head a natural unfitness for war. The gassed men were an expression of trench fatigue, a menace when the manhood of the nation had been picked over.&quot;<p>Mustard gas did not need to be inhaled to be effective &mdash; any contact with skin was sufficient. Exposure to 0.1 <!--del_lnk--> ppm was enough to cause massive <!--del_lnk--> blisters. Higher concentrations could burn flesh to the bone. It was particularly effective against the soft skin of the face and <!--del_lnk--> genitals. Typical exposure would result in swelling of the <!--del_lnk--> conjunctiva and eyelids, forcing them closed and rendering the victim temporarily blind. Where it contacted the skin, moist red patches would immediately appear which after 24 hours would have formed into blisters. Other symptoms included severe <!--del_lnk--> headache, elevated <!--del_lnk--> pulse and temperature, and <a href="../../wp/p/Pneumonia.htm" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a>.<p>Death by mustard gas, when it came, was dreadful. A <!--del_lnk--> post-mortem account from the British official medical history records one of the first British casualties:<dl>
       <dd><i>Case four. Aged 39 years. Gassed 29 July 1917. Admitted to casualty clearing station the same day. Died about ten days later. Brownish pigmentation present over large surfaces of the body. A white ring of skin where the wrist watch was. Marked superficial burning of the face and <!--del_lnk--> scrotum. The <!--del_lnk--> larynx much congested. The whole of the <!--del_lnk--> trachea was covered by a yellow membrane. The <!--del_lnk--> bronchi contained abundant gas. The lungs fairly voluminous. The right lung showing extensive collapse at the base. Liver congested and fatty. Stomach showed numerous submucous haemorrhages. The brain substance was unduly wet and very congested.</i></dl>
      <p>A British nurse treating mustard gas cases recorded:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;They cannot be bandaged or touched. We cover them with a tent of propped-up sheets. Gas burns must be agonizing because usually the other cases do not complain even with the worst wounds but gas cases are invariably beyond endurance and they cannot help crying out.&quot;</i></dl>

      <p>Many of those who survived a gas attack were scarred for life. Respiratory disease and failing eye sight were common post-war afflictions. Of the <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadians</a> who, without any effective protection, had withstood the first chlorine attacks during <!--del_lnk--> 2nd Ypres, 60% of the casualties had to be repatriated and half of these were still unfit by the end of the war, over three years later.<p>In reading the <a href="../../wp/s/Statistics.htm" title="Statistics">statistics</a> of the time, one should bear the longer term in mind. Many of those who were fairly soon recorded as fit for service were left with scar tissue in their lungs. This tissue was susceptible to <a href="../../wp/t/Tuberculosis.htm" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> attack. It was from this that many of the 1918 casualties died, around the time of the Second World War, shortly before the <!--del_lnk--> sulfa drugs became widely available for its treatment.<br clear="both" />

      <p>None of the First World War combatants were prepared for the introduction of poison gas as a weapon. Once gas had appeared, development of gas protection began and the process continued for much of the war producing a series of increasingly effective gas masks.<p>Even at 2nd Ypres Germany, still unsure of the weapon&#39;s effectiveness, only issued breathing masks to the engineers handling the gas. At Ypres a Canadian medical officer, who was also a <!--del_lnk--> chemist, quickly identified the gas as <a href="../../wp/c/Chlorine.htm" title="Chlorine">chlorine</a> and recommended that the troops <!--del_lnk--> urinate on a cloth and hold it over their mouth and nose, the theory being the <!--del_lnk--> uric acid would crystallise the chlorine. The first official equipment issued was similarly crude; a pad of material, usually impregnated with a chemical, tied over the lower face. To protect the eyes from <!--del_lnk--> tear gas, soldiers were issued with gas <!--del_lnk--> goggles.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The next advance was the introduction of the gas helmet &mdash; basically a bag placed over the head. The fabric of the bag was impregnated with a chemical to neutralise the gas &mdash; whenever it rained, the chemical would wash out into the soldier&#39;s eyes. Eye-pieces, which were prone to fog up, were initially made from <a href="../../wp/t/Talc.htm" title="Talc">talc</a>. When going into combat, gas helmets were typically worn rolled up on top of the head, to be pulled down and secured about the neck when the gas alarm was given. The first British version was the Hypo helmet, the fabric of which was soaked in <!--del_lnk--> sodium hyposulfite (commonly known as &quot;hypo&quot;). The British P gas helmet, partially effective against <!--del_lnk--> phosgene and with which all infantry were equipped with at <!--del_lnk--> Loos, was impregnated with <!--del_lnk--> phenate hexamine. A mouthpiece was added through which the wearer would breathe out to prevent <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> build-up. The <!--del_lnk--> adjutant of the 1/23rd Battalion, <!--del_lnk--> The London Regiment, recalled his experience of the P helmet at Loos:<dl>
       <dd><i>&quot;The goggles rapidly dimmed over, and the air came through in such suffocatingly small quantities as to demand a continuous exercise of will-power on the part of the wearers.&quot;</i></dl>
      <p>A modified version of the P Helmet, called the PH Helmet, was issued in January 1916, and was additionally impregnated with <!--del_lnk--> hexamethylenetetramine to improve the protection against phosgene<!--del_lnk--> .<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Self-contained box respirators represented the culmination of gas mask development during the First World War. Box respirators used a two-piece design; a mouthpiece connected via a hose to a box <!--del_lnk--> filter. The box filter contained <!--del_lnk--> granules of chemicals that neutralised the gas, delivering clean air to the wearer. Separating the filter from the mask enabled a bulky but efficient filter to be supplied. Nevertheless, the first version, known as the Large Box Respirator (LBR) or &quot;Harrison&#39;s Tower&quot;, was deemed too bulky &mdash; the &quot;box&quot; canister needed to be carried on the back. The LBR had no mask, just a mouthpiece and nose clip; separate gas goggles had to be worn. It continued to be issued to the <!--del_lnk--> artillery gun crews but the infantry were supplied with the &quot;Small Box Respirator&quot; (SBR).<p>The Small Box Respirator featured a single-piece, close-fitting <!--del_lnk--> rubberised mask with eye-pieces. The box filter was compact and could be worn around the neck. The SBR could be readily upgraded as more effective filter technology was developed. The British-designed SBR was also adopted for use by the <!--del_lnk--> American Expeditionary Force. The SBR was the prized possession of the ordinary infantryman; when the British were forced to retreat during the German <!--del_lnk--> Spring Offensive of 1918, it was found that while some troops had discarded their <!--del_lnk--> rifles, hardly any had left behind their respirators.<p>It was not only humans that needed protection from gas; <a href="../../wp/h/Horse.htm" title="Horse">horses</a> and <!--del_lnk--> mules, which were the main means of transport, were also vulnerable to gas and needed to be provided with protection. As animals were never used near the front-line, protection from gas only became necessary when the practice of firing gas shells into rear areas was adopted.<p>For <!--del_lnk--> mustard gas, which did not need to be inhaled in order to inflict casualties, no effective countermeasure was found during the war. The <!--del_lnk--> kilt-wearing <!--del_lnk--> Highland regiments of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> were especially vulnerable to mustard gas injuries due to their bare legs. At <!--del_lnk--> Nieuport some Scots battalions took to wearing women&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> tights beneath the kilt as a form of protection.<p>The Canadian soldiers are said to have found a way to minimize the effects of the mustard gas. Since the gas was sent by the wind towards them, they understood that it would minimize the exposure to the gas if the Canadians not only did not flee but ran through the gas. The French, conversely, when the gas was used against them, fled, and therefore spent more time in the gas, suffering greater casualties.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Gas alert procedure became a routine for the front-line soldier. To warn of a gas attack, a bell would be rung, often made from a spent artillery shell. At the noisy <!--del_lnk--> batteries of the siege guns, a <!--del_lnk--> compressed air strombus horn was used, which could be heard nine <!--del_lnk--> miles away. Notices would be posted on all approaches to an affected area, warning people to take precautions.<p>Other British attempts at countermeasures were not so effective. An early plan was to use 100,000 <!--del_lnk--> fans to disperse the gas. Burning <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> or <!--del_lnk--> carborundum dust was tried. A proposal was made to equip front-line sentries with <!--del_lnk--> diving helmets, air being pumped to them through a 100 ft (30 m) hose.<p>However, the effectiveness of all countermeasures is apparent. In 1915, when poison gas was relatively new, less than 3% of British gas casualties died. In 1916, the proportion of fatalities jumped to 17%. By 1918, the figure was back below 3%, though the total number of British gas casualties was now nine times the 1915 levels.<p>

      <p>The first system employed for the mass delivery of gas involved releasing the gas from <!--del_lnk--> cylinders in a favourable <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">wind</a> such that it was carried over the enemy&#39;s trenches. The main advantage of this method was that it was relatively simple and, in suitable atmospheric conditions, produced a concentrated cloud capable of overwhelming the gas mask defences. The disadvantages of cylinder releases were numerous. First and foremost, delivery was at the mercy of the wind. If the wind was fickle, as was the case at <!--del_lnk--> Loos, the gas could backfire, causing friendly casualties. Gas clouds gave plenty of warning, allowing the enemy time to protect themselves, though many soldiers found the sight of a creeping gas cloud unnerving. Also gas clouds had limited penetration, only capable of affecting the front-line trenches before dissipating.<p>Finally, the cylinders had to be emplaced at the very front of the trench system so that the gas was released directly over <!--del_lnk--> no man&#39;s land. This meant that the cylinders had to be manhandled through communication trenches, often clogged and sodden, and stored at the front where there was always the risk that cylinders would be prematurely breached during a bombardment. A leaking cylinder could issue a telltale wisp of gas that, if spotted, would be sure to attract shellfire.<div class="thumb tleft">

The Germans, for example, used 5.9 inch artillery shells. Gas shells were independent of the wind and increased the effective range of gas, making anywhere within reach of the guns vulnerable. Gas shells could be delivered without warning, especially the clear, nearly odourless phosgene &mdash; there are numerous accounts of gas shells, landing with a &quot;plop&quot; rather than exploding, being initially dismissed as dud <!--del_lnk--> HE or <!--del_lnk--> shrapnel shells, giving the gas time to work before the soldiers were alerted and took precautions.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The main flaw associated with delivering gas via artillery was the difficulty of achieving a killing concentration. Each shell had a small gas payload and an area would have to be subjected to a saturation bombardment to produce a cloud to match cylinder delivery. <!--del_lnk--> Mustard gas, however, did not need to form a concentrated cloud and hence artillery was the ideal vehicle for delivery of this battlefield pollutant.<p>The solution to achieving a lethal concentration without releasing from cylinders was the &quot;gas projector&quot;, essentially a large-bore <!--del_lnk--> mortar that fired the entire cylinder as a missile. The British <!--del_lnk--> Livens projector (invented by Captain W.H. Livens in 1917) was a simple device; an 8-inch diameter tube sunk into the ground at an angle, a <!--del_lnk--> propellant was ignited by an electrical signal, firing the cylinder containing 30 or 40 lb (14 or 18 kg) of gas up to 1,900 metres. By arranging a <!--del_lnk--> battery of these projectors and firing them simultaneously, a dense concentration of gas could be achieved. The Livens was first used at <!--del_lnk--> Arras on <!--del_lnk--> 4 April <!--del_lnk--> 1917. On <!--del_lnk--> 31 March <!--del_lnk--> 1918 the British conducted their largest ever &quot;gas shoot&quot;, firing 3,728 cylinders at <!--del_lnk--> Lens.<p><a id="Unexploded_weapons" name="Unexploded_weapons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Unexploded weapons</span></h2>
      <p>Unexploded WWI ammunition, including chemical ammunition, was a major problem in former battle areas after the end of the War, and has ever since been present. Shells may be, for instance, uncovered when farmers plough their fields; more importantly, shells are regularly discovered when public works or construction work is done. While classical shells pose a risk of explosion, their disposal is relatively easy. This is not the case with chemical shells.<p>An additional difficulty is the current stringency of <!--del_lnk--> environmental legislation. In the past, a common method of getting rid of unexploded chemical ammunition was to detonate or dump it at sea; this is nowadays prohibited in most countries.<p>The problems are especially acute in some northern regions of France. The French government no longer disposes of chemical weapons at sea. For this reason, piles of untreated chemical weapons accumulated. In 2001, it became evident that the pile stored at a depot in <!--del_lnk--> Vimy was unsafe; the inhabitants of the neighbouring town were evacuated, and the pile moved, using <!--del_lnk--> refrigerated trucks and under heavy guard, to a military camp in Suippes. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  The French government announced the construction of an automated plant for the dismantling of chemical munitions inherited from previous wars; this factory, codenamed SECOIA, is to be operational in 2007.<!--del_lnk-->  The capacity of the plant is meant to be 25 tons per year (extensible to 80 tons at the beginning), for a lifetime of 30 years.<!--del_lnk--> <p>In Belgium, a similar plant was planned in 1993 and brought in service in 1999, two years late, indicating the difficulties in disposal of such wastes. Germany, too, has to deal with unexploded ammunition and polluted lands resulting from the explosion of an ammunition train in 1919.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Gases_used" name="Gases_used"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Gases used</span></h2>

      <p>In the Geneva Gas Protocol of the <!--del_lnk--> Third Geneva Convention, signed in 1925, the signatory nations agreed not to use poison gas in the future, stating &quot;the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilised world.&quot;<p>Nevertheless, precautions were taken in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.
