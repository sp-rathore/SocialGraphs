      <p>The Estates General of the seven United Provinces passed an Oath of Abjuration of the Spanish king, who was also Sovereign of the Netherlands, in <!--del_lnk--> 1581 following the <!--del_lnk--> Union of Utrecht of <!--del_lnk--> 1579. It should be noted that the Netherlands were at this time a personal union under King Philip as he was lord of each separate Dutch Province (e.g. Duke of Guelre and Count of Holland) The rebel leader, <a href="../../wp/w/William_the_Silent.htm" title="William the Silent">William I, Prince of Orange</a> (William the Silent) was outlawed by Philip, and assassinated in 1584 by a <!--del_lnk--> Catholic fanatic after Philip had offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to anyone who killed William the Silent, calling him a &#39;pest on the whole of Christianity and the enemy of the human race&#39;. Nevertheless, the Dutch forces continued to fight on, and increasingly used their substantial naval resources to plunder Spanish ships and blockade the Spanish-controlled southern provinces.<p><a id="Economic_troubles" name="Economic_troubles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Economic troubles</span></h3>
      <p>Aside from draining state revenues for failed overseas adventurism, the domestic policies of Philip II further burdened Spain, that would, in the following century, contribute to its decline. For one, far too much power was concentrated in Philip&#39;s hands. Unlike England, Spain was subject to separate assemblies: the <!--del_lnk--> Cortes in <!--del_lnk--> Castile along with the assembly in <!--del_lnk--> Navarre and three for each of the three regions of <!--del_lnk--> Aragon, each of which jealously guarded their traditional rights and laws inherited from the time they were separate kingdoms. This made Spain and its possessions cumbersome to rule. While France was divided by regional states, it had a single <!--del_lnk--> Estates-General. The lack of a viable supreme assembly would lead to a great deal of power being concentrated in Philip&#39;s hands, but this was made necessary by the constant conflict between different authorities that required his direct intervention as the final arbiter. To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carried out instructions of the crown. Philip, a compulsive micro-manager, presided over specialized councils for state affairs, finance, war, and the Inquisition. A distrustful sovereign, Philip played royal bureaucrats against each other, leading to a system of checks and balances that would manage state affairs in a very inefficient manner, sometimes damaging state business (leading to the Perez affair - see <!--del_lnk--> Antonio Perez). Calls to move capital to <a href="../../wp/l/Lisbon.htm" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> from the Castilian stronghold of <a href="../../wp/m/Madrid.htm" title="Madrid">Madrid</a> &mdash; the new capital Philip established following the move from <!--del_lnk--> Valladolid &mdash; could have perhaps lead to a degree of decentralization, but Philip adamantly opposed such efforts.<p>Philip&#39;s regime severely neglected farming in favour of <!--del_lnk--> sheep ranching, thus forcing Spain to import large amounts of grain and other foods by the mid-1560s. Presiding over a sharply divided conservative class structure, the Church and the upper classes were exempt from taxation (to be expected, considering their lack of parliamentary powers) while the tax burden fell disproportionately on the classes engaged in trade, commerce, and industry.<p>Due to the inefficiencies of the Spanish state structure, industry was also greatly over-burdened by government regulations, though this was the common defect of all governments of the times. The dispersal of the <!--del_lnk--> Moriscos from <!--del_lnk--> Granada (motivated by the fear they might support a Muslim invasion) had serious negative economic effects, particularly in the region it affected.<p><!--del_lnk--> Inflation throughout Europe in the sixteenth century was a broad and complex phenomenon, but the flood of bullion from Americas was the main cause of it in Spain. Under Philip&#39;s reign, Spain saw a fivefold increase in prices. Due to inflation and a high tax burden for Spanish manufacturers and merchants Spanish industry was harmed and Spain&rsquo;s riches were frittered away on imported manufactured goods by an opulent, status-obsessed aristocracy and Philip&#39;s wars. Increasingly the country became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> bankruptcy (<!--del_lnk--> moratorium) in <!--del_lnk--> 1557 due to the rising costs of military efforts. Dependent on sales taxes from Castile and the Netherlands, Spain&#39;s tax base, which excluded the nobility and the wealthy church, had far too narrow a base to support Philip&#39;s grand plans. Philip became increasingly dependent on loans from foreign bankers, particularly in <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Augsburg. By the end of his reign, interest payments on these loans alone would account for 40% of state revenue.<p><a id="Philip_becomes_King_of_Portugal" name="Philip_becomes_King_of_Portugal"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philip becomes King of Portugal</span></h3>
      <p>Philip became <!--del_lnk--> King of Portugal, and the success of colonization in <!--del_lnk--> America improved his financial position, enabling him to show greater aggression towards his enemies. In <!--del_lnk--> 1580, the direct line of the Portuguese royal family ended when <!--del_lnk--> Sebastian of Portugal died following a disastrous campaign in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. His death gave Philip, his uncle, the pretext for claiming the throne through his mother, who was also a Portuguese princess (see <!--del_lnk--> struggle for the throne of Portugal). As a matter of fact, Philip had been brought up by Portuguese courtesans during his early life and spoke Portuguese as his native tongue until the death of his mother. He met little resistance in Lisbon, and his power helped him to seize the throne, which would be kept a <!--del_lnk--> personal union for sixty years. Philip famously remarked upon his acquisition of the Portuguese throne: &quot;I inherited, I bought, I conquered&quot;, a variation on <a href="../../wp/j/Julius_Caesar.htm" title="Julius Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Veni, Vidi, Vici. Thus, Philip added to his possessions a vast colonial empire in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> East Indies, seeing a flood of new revenues coming to the Habsburg crown. In the ruling of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a> however, Philip showed tact, trimming his beard and wearing clothes in the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a> style, and ruling from Lisbon for the next couple of years, leaving Portuguese privileges and <!--del_lnk--> forals alone.<p><a id="Turkish_threat_in_the_Mediterranean" name="Turkish_threat_in_the_Mediterranean"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Turkish threat in the Mediterranean</span></h3>
      <p>In the early part of his reign, Philip was concerned with the rising power of the Ottoman Empire under Suleyman the Magnificent. Fear of Islamic domination in the Mediterranean caused him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1558 Turkish admiral <!--del_lnk--> Piyale Pasha captured the <!--del_lnk--> Balearic Islands, especially inflicting great damage on <!--del_lnk--> Minorca and enslaving many, while raiding the coasts of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish mainland</a>. Philip appealed to the Pope and other powers in Europe to bring an end to the rising <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> threat. Since his father&#39;s losses against the Ottomans and against <!--del_lnk--> Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha in <!--del_lnk--> 1541, the major European sea powers in the Mediterranean, namely <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Venice, became hesitant in confronting the Ottomans. The myth of <i>&quot;Turkish invincibility&quot;</i> was becoming a popular story, causing fear and panic among the people.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1560 Philip II organized a <i>Holy League</i> between <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Venice, the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Genoa, the <!--del_lnk--> Papal States, the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Savoy and the <!--del_lnk--> Knights of Malta. The joint fleet was assembled at <!--del_lnk--> Messina and consisted of 200 ships and 30,000 soldiers under the command of Giovanni Andrea Doria, nephew of the famous Genoese admiral <!--del_lnk--> Andrea Doria who had lost three major battles against the Turks in <!--del_lnk--> 1538, <!--del_lnk--> 1541 and <!--del_lnk--> 1552.<p>On March 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1560, the Holy League captured the island of <!--del_lnk--> Djerba which had a strategic location and could control the sea routes between <a href="../../wp/a/Algiers.htm" title="Algiers">Algiers</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tripoli.htm" title="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>. As a response, <!--del_lnk--> Suleiman the Magnificent sent an Ottoman fleet of 120 ships under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Piyale Pasha, which arrived at Djerba on May 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1560. The battle lasted until May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1560, and the forces of Piyale Pasha and <!--del_lnk--> Turgut Reis (who joined Piyale Pasha on the third day of the battle) had an overwhelming victory at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Djerba. The Holy League lost more than 60 galleys and 20,000 men, and Giovanni Andrea Doria could barely escape with a small vessel. The Ottomans retook the Fortress of Djerba, whose Spanish commander, D. Alvaro de Sande, attempted to escape with a ship but was followed and eventually captured by <!--del_lnk--> Turgut Reis. In 1596 Ottoman forces took control of <a href="../../wp/t/Tunis.htm" title="Tunis">Tunis</a> that had been nominally a Spanish protectorate since its conquest by Charles I in <!--del_lnk--> 1535 at the behest of Mulay Hassan.<p>The grave threat posed by the increasing Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean was reversed in one of history&#39;s most decisive battles, with the destruction of nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Lepanto in <!--del_lnk--> 1571, by the Holy League under the command of Philip&#39;s half brother, <!--del_lnk--> Don John of Austria. A fleet sent by Philip, again commanded by Don John, reconquered Tunis from the Ottomans in <!--del_lnk--> 1573. However, the Turks soon rebuilt their fleet and in 1574 <!--del_lnk--> Ulu&ccedil; Ali Reis managed to recapture <a href="../../wp/t/Tunis.htm" title="Tunis">Tunis</a> with a force of 250 galleys and a siege which lasted 40 days.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1585 a peace treaty was signed with the Ottomans.<p><a id="War_with_England" name="War_with_England"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">War with England</span></h3>
      <p>Spanish hegemony and the <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation achieved a clear boost when Philip married <!--del_lnk--> Mary Tudor &mdash; a Catholic &mdash; in <!--del_lnk--> 1554 (the older daughter of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, and his father&#39;s first cousin). However, they had no children (a child would have been heir to all but France); <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_England.htm" title="Mary I of England">Queen Mary</a>, or &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; as she was known by English Protestants, died in <!--del_lnk--> 1558 before the union could revitalize the Catholic Church in England.<p>The throne went to the formidable <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth</a>, the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and <!--del_lnk--> Anne Boleyn. This union was deemed illegitimate by English Catholics, who did not recognize divorce and who claimed that <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_Scotland.htm" title="Mary I of Scotland">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, the Catholic great-granddaughter of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VII of England">Henry VII</a>, was the legitimate heir to the throne.<p>The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in <!--del_lnk--> 1587 ended Philip&#39;s hopes of placing a Catholic on the English throne. He turned instead to more direct plans to return England to Catholicism by invasion. His opportunity came when England provided support for the Dutch rebels. In <!--del_lnk--> 1588 he sent a fleet of vessels, <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Armada.htm" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a>, to lead an invasion. However, a so-called &quot;Protestant Wind&quot; thwarted Spanish ambitions, enabling the small, deftly maneuverable English ships to defeat the larger and less-maneuverable Spanish ships. Eventually, three more Armadas were deployed; two were sent to England (<!--del_lnk--> 1596 and <!--del_lnk--> 1597), both of which also failed; the third (1599) was diverted to the Azores and Canarie Islands to fend off raids there. This <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Spanish war (1585-1604) would be fought to a grinding end, but not until both Philip II (d. 1598) and Elizabeth I (d. 1603) were dead.<p>The stunning defeat of the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Armada.htm" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> gave great heart to the Protestant cause across Europe. Many Spaniards blamed the admiral of the Armada for its failure, but Philip was not among them. The Spanish navy was rebuilt, and intelligence networks were improved. An example of the character of Philip II can be given by the fact that he personally saw that the wounded of this expedition were treated and received a pension, which was unusual for the time.<p>While the invasion had been averted, England was unable to take advantage of this success. An attempt to use her newfound advantage at sea with a <!--del_lnk--> counter armada the following year failed disastrously. Likewise, English buccaneering and attempts to seize territories in the Caribbean (though Cadiz was destroyed by an Anglo-Dutch force in a failed raid to seize the treasure fleet) were defeated by Spain&#39;s rebuilt navy and her intelligence networks.<p>Even though Philip was bankrupt by <!--del_lnk--> 1596, (for the fourth time, after France had declared war on Spain) in the last decade of his life more silver and gold was shipped safely to Spain than ever before. This allowed Spain to continue military efforts.<p><a id="War_with_France" name="War_with_France"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">War with France</span></h3>
      <p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1590 to <!--del_lnk--> 1598 Philip was also at war against <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV of France, joining with the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> and the Duke of Guise in the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic League during the <!--del_lnk--> French Wars of Religion. Philip&#39;s interventions in the fighting - sending <!--del_lnk--> Alessandro Farnese, Duke of <!--del_lnk--> Parma to relieve the <a href="../../wp/s/Siege.htm" title="Siege">siege</a> of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> in 1590, and again into <!--del_lnk--> Rouen in 1592 - to aid the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic faction, was disastrous in terms of the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Revolt, allowing the Dutch forces opportunities time to regroup and refortify their defenses. <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV of France was also able to use his propagandists to identify the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic faction with a foreign enemy (Philip and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>). In <!--del_lnk--> 1593, Henry agreed to convert to Catholicism; this caused most French Catholics to rally to his side against the Spanish forces. In June 1595 the redoubtable French king defeated the Spanish supported <!--del_lnk--> Holy League in Fontaine-Francaise in Burgundy and reconquered Amiens from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597. The 1598 <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Vervins was largely a restatement of the 1559 <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis; meanwhile, Henry issued the <!--del_lnk--> Edict of Nantes, which offered a high degree of religious toleration for French Protestants. The military intervention in France thus ended in a disappointing fashion for Philip, as it failed to either oust Henry from the throne or suppress Protestantism in France. However, the conversion of Henry also ensured that Catholicism would remain France&#39;s majority faith.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h3>
      <p>Under Philip II Spain reached the peak of its power but also met its limits. Having nearly reconquered the rebellious Netherlands, Philip&#39;s unyielding attitude led to their loss, this time permanently, as his wars expanded in scope and complexity. So in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the <!--del_lnk--> Counter-Reformation he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion. Early in his reign the Dutch may have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism, but his devotion to <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholicism and the principle of <!--del_lnk--> cuius regio, eius religio, as laid down by his father, would not permit him. He was a fervent Roman Catholic, and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy.<p>Philip&#39;s wars against what he perceived to be heresies led not only to the persecution of Protestants, but also to the harsh treatment of the <!--del_lnk--> Moriscos, causing a massive local uprising in 1568. The damage of these endless wars would ultimately undermine the Spanish Habsburg empire after his passing. His endless meddling in details, inability to prioritise and failure to effectively delegate authority hamstrung his government and led to the creation of a cumbersome and overly centralised bureaucracy. Under the weak leadership of his successors it would drift towards disaster. Yet such was the strength of the system he and his father had built this did not start to become clearly apparent until a generation after his death.<p>However Philip II&#39;s reign cannot simply be characterised as a failure. He consolidated <!--del_lnk--> Spain&#39;s overseas empire, succeeded in massively increasing the importation of silver in the face of English, Dutch and French privateering, and ended the major threat posed to Europe by the Ottoman navy (though periphery clashes would be ongoing throughout his reign). He succeeded in uniting Portugal and Spain through <!--del_lnk--> personal union. He dealt successfully with a crisis that could have led to the secession of <!--del_lnk--> Aragon. His efforts also contributed substantially to the success of the Catholic Reformation in checking the religious tide of Protestantism in Northern Europe. Philip was a complex man, and though given to suspicion of members of his court, was not the cruel tyrant that he has been painted by his opponents. Philip was known to intervene personally on behalf of the humblest of his subjects. Above all a man of duty; he was also trapped by it.<p>He died in <!--del_lnk--> 1598 and was succeeded by his son, King <!--del_lnk--> Philip III. Philip II&#39;s enemies (generally Protestant propagandists) were instrumental in the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Black Legend of <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, which painted the king as a merciless, bloodthirsty tyrant and the Spanish empire as being built upon greed, deception, and destruction.<p><a id="Family" name="Family"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Family</span></h2>

      <ul>
       <li>His first marriage (<!--del_lnk--> 1543) was to his cousin <!--del_lnk--> Princess Maria of <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, who provided him with a son, <!--del_lnk--> Don Carlos of Spain (<!--del_lnk--> 1545&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 1568). Maria died in <!--del_lnk--> 1545.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Philip sought an alliance with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England, marrying the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Queen <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_England.htm" title="Mary I of England">Mary I of England</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1554. On occasion of the marriage, he was created <!--del_lnk--> King of Chile by his father and received the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Naples and the title of <!--del_lnk--> King of Jerusalem which came with it, from him. Under the terms of the marriage, Philip became <!--del_lnk--> King Consort during the lifetime of his spouse. The marriage was unpopular with her subjects, and was a purely political alliance as far as Philip was concerned. On <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1556, Philip succeeded to the throne of Spain, as a result of his father&#39;s abdication, but he did not choose to reside in the country until his father&#39;s death two years later. After <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_I_of_England.htm" title="Mary I of England">Mary</a> died childless in <!--del_lnk--> 1558, Philip showed an interest in marrying her <!--del_lnk--> Protestant younger half-sister, Queen <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, but this plan fell through, for a number of reasons.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>In <!--del_lnk--> 1559 the 60-year war with France ended with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis. A key element in the peace negotiations was Philip&#39;s marriage to Princess <!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth of Valois, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Henry II of France, who had originally been promised to Philip&#39;s son, Carlos. Philip and Carlos were never particularly close, and when Philip suspected his son of conspiring against him, he had him imprisoned in his room. When the prince died shortly thereafter, from starving himself to death in protest, Philip&#39;s enemies accused him of having ordered Carlos&#39;s murder. Elisabeth (<!--del_lnk--> 1545-<!--del_lnk--> 1568) did not provide Philip with a son, but did give him two daughters, <!--del_lnk--> Isabella Clara Eugenia and <!--del_lnk--> Catalina Micaela.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Philip&#39;s fourth marriage was to his niece <!--del_lnk--> Anna, daughter of the great emperor <!--del_lnk--> Maximilian II, who provided him with an heir, <!--del_lnk--> Philip III.</ul>
