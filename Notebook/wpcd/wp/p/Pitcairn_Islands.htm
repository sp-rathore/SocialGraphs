      <p>The <b>Pitcairn Islands</b> (<i>Pitkern</i>&nbsp;: <b>Pitkern Ailen</b>), officially named the <b>Pitcairn, <!--del_lnk--> Henderson, <!--del_lnk--> Ducie, and <!--del_lnk--> Oeno Islands</b>, are a group of four islands in the southern <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. The islands are a <!--del_lnk--> British overseas territory (formerly British colony), the last remaining in the Pacific. Only <b>Pitcairn Island</b> &mdash; the second largest &mdash; is inhabited.<p>The islands are best known for being the home of the descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bounty</i> mutineers and the <!--del_lnk--> Tahitians who accompanied them, an event retold in numerous books and films. This story is still apparent in the surnames of many of the islanders. With only about fifty inhabitants (from nine families), Pitcairn is also notable for being the least populated jurisdiction in the world (although it is not a <!--del_lnk--> sovereign nation). The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> Committee on Decolonisation includes the Pitcairn Islands on the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.<p>

      <p>The original settlers of the Pitcairn Islands (Ducie, Henderson, Oeno and Pitcairn) were <!--del_lnk--> Polynesians who appear to have lived on Pitcairn and Henderson for several centuries. However, although archaeologists believe that Polynesians were living on Pitcairn as late as the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, the islands were uninhabited when they were discovered by Europeans.<p>Ducie and Henderson Islands are believed to have been discovered by Europeans on <!--del_lnk--> 26 January <!--del_lnk--> 1606 by Portuguese sailor <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, who named them La Encarnaci&oacute;n and San Juan Bautista respectively. However, some sources express doubt about exactly which of the islands were visited and named by Quiros, suggesting that Quiros&rsquo; La Encarnaci&oacute;n may actually have been Henderson Island, and San Juan Bautista may have been Pitcairn Island. <p>Ducie Island was rediscovered in 1791 by the British Capt. Edwards aboard <i>H.M.S. Pandora</i>, and named after <!--del_lnk--> Baron Francis Ducie, a captain in the Royal Navy. It was annexed by Britain on <!--del_lnk--> 19 December <!--del_lnk--> 1902, and in 1938 it was formally incorporated into Pitcairn to become part of a single administrative district (the &quot;Pitcairn Group of Islands&quot;).<p>Henderson Island was rediscovered on <!--del_lnk--> 17 January <!--del_lnk--> 1819 by British Capt. Henderson of the British East India Company ship <i>Hercules</i>. On the <!--del_lnk--> 2 March <!--del_lnk--> 1819, Captain Henry King, sailing aboard the <i>Elizabeth</i>, landed on the island to find the King&#39;s colours already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree and for some years the island&#39;s name was Elizabeth or Henderson interchangeably. Henderson Island was annexed by Britain and incorporated into Pitcairn in 1938.<p>Oeno Island was discovered on the <!--del_lnk--> 26 January <!--del_lnk--> 1824 by U.S. Captain George Worth aboard the whaler <i>Oeno</i>. On the 10th July 1902 Oeno was annexed by Britain. It was incorporated into Pitcairn in 1938.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Pitcairn Island itself was discovered on <!--del_lnk--> July 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1767 by the crew of the British sloop <i>HMS Swallow</i>, commanded by Captain <!--del_lnk--> Philip Carteret (though according to some it had perhaps been visited by Quiros in 1606). It was named after Midshipman Robert Pitcairn, a fifteen-year-old crewmember who was the first to sight the island. (Pitcairn was the son of British Marine Officer <!--del_lnk--> John Pitcairn, who was second in command of British forces stationed in <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Revolutionary_War.htm" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a> and was fatally wounded in one of the defining battles of that war, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bunker Hill.)<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1790, the mutineers of <!--del_lnk--> HMAV <i>Bounty</i> and their <!--del_lnk--> Tahitian companions, some of whom may have been kidnapped from Tahiti, settled on Pitcairn Island and set fire to the <i>Bounty</i>. The wreck is still visible underwater in Bounty Bay. The ship itself was discovered in 1957 by <!--del_lnk--> National Geographic explorer <!--del_lnk--> Luis Marden. Although the settlers were able to survive by farming and fishing, the initial period of settlement was marked by serious tensions among the settlers. Alcoholism, murder, disease and other ills took the lives of most mutineers and Tahitian men. <!--del_lnk--> John Adams and <!--del_lnk--> Ned Young turned to the <!--del_lnk--> Scriptures using the ship&#39;s <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> as their guide for a new and peaceful society. Young eventually died of an asthmatic infection. The Pitcairners also converted to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>; however they would later convert from their existing form of Christianity to <!--del_lnk--> Adventism after a successful Adventist mission in the 1890s. When the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> sailing ship <i><!--del_lnk--> Topaz</i> found Pitcairn again, John Adams was granted <!--del_lnk--> amnesty for his <!--del_lnk--> mutiny.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The island became a British colony in 1838. By the mid-1850s the Pitcairn community was outgrowing the island and its leaders appealed to the British government for assistance. They were offered <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk_Island.htm" title="Norfolk Island">Norfolk Island</a> and on <!--del_lnk--> 3 May <!--del_lnk--> 1856, the entire community of 193 people set sail for Norfolk on board the <i>Morayshire</i>, arriving on <!--del_lnk--> 8 June after a miserable five-week trip. But after eighteen months on Norfolk, seventeen of the Pitcairners returned to their home island; five years later another twenty-seven did the same.<p>
       <br /> Since a population peak of 233 in <!--del_lnk--> 1937, the island has been suffering from emigration, primarily to <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, leaving some fifty people living on Pitcairn.<p>There are allegations of a long history and tradition of <!--del_lnk--> sexual abuse of girls as young as 7, which culminated in <!--del_lnk--> 2004 in the charging of seven men living on Pitcairn, and another six now living abroad, with sex-related offences, including <!--del_lnk--> rape. On <!--del_lnk--> October 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, six men were convicted, including <!--del_lnk--> Steve Christian, the island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> mayor at the time. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> Pitcairn rape trial of 2004</i>. The British government has decided to set up a prison for only the island, and spend an annual budget of $950,000, after the six men lost their final appeal.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

He maintains a representative officer on the island as a link between himself and the islanders - this is probably the most remote and inaccessible diplomatic posting in the world. But because the high commissioner does not live on the island, its daily affairs were traditionally taken care of by the <!--del_lnk--> magistrate, chairman of the <!--del_lnk--> Island Council. Elections for this position take place every three years. After a constitutional revision in <!--del_lnk--> 1998, these functions were transferred to the <!--del_lnk--> mayor of Pitcairn from <!--del_lnk--> 1999 onwards. Island Magistrate is a governor appointed job. Chairman of the Internal Committee is an elected official. Until <!--del_lnk--> 30 October <!--del_lnk--> 2004, the mayor was <!--del_lnk--> Steve Christian; after his <!--del_lnk--> rape conviction on <!--del_lnk--> October 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Christian was dismissed (after refusing to resign). <!--del_lnk--> Brenda Christian was selected by the Island Council, to be mayor for November and December 2004, until an election was held. <!--del_lnk--> Jay Warren was elected on <!--del_lnk--> December 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The major sources of revenue are the sale of <a href="../../wp/p/Postage_stamp.htm" title="Postage stamp">postage stamps</a> to collectors, <a href="../../wp/h/Honey.htm" title="Honey">honey</a>, and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships, most of which are plying the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> to <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> route via the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>. Trade is restricted by the jagged geography of the island, which lacks a harbour or airstrip, forcing all trade to be made by longboat to visiting ships. Occasionally, passengers from expedition-type cruise ships will come ashore for a day, weather permitting. The island has a labour force of 15 men and women (as of 2004).<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Many of the resident Pitcairn Islanders are descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Bounty</i> mutineers, as their surnames show. Most Pitcairners are members of the <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventist Church. <!--del_lnk--> Pitkern is a <!--del_lnk--> creole language derived from 18th Century <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, with elements of the <!--del_lnk--> Tahitian language. It is spoken as a first language by the population and is taught alongside standard English at the island&#39;s only school. It is closely related to the creole language <!--del_lnk--> Norfuk spoken on <a href="../../wp/n/Norfolk_Island.htm" title="Norfolk Island">Norfolk Island</a>, because Norfolk was repopulated in the mid 19th Century by Pitcairners.<p>In September 2003, the first baby was born on the islands in 17 years.<p>In June 2004, Shirley and <!--del_lnk--> Simon Young became the first married outsider couple in recorded history to gain residency on the island.<p><a id="Culture_and_religion" name="Culture_and_religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture and religion</span></h2>
      <p>Pitcairn culture, like its language, is a mix of English and Tahitian influences. A successful <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventist mission in the <!--del_lnk--> 1890s was important in shaping Pitcairn society.  In recent years, the church has declined, with only about eight islanders worshipping regularly, but most of them still attend church on special occasions. The <!--del_lnk--> Sabbath is observed as a day of rest and as a mark of respect for observant Adventists.<p>The once-strict moral codes, which prohibited dancing, public shows of affection, and consumption of alcohol, have been relaxed in recent years. Islanders may now obtain a six-month license to purchase alcohol; the licence fee is NZ$10.00 for residents and NZ$25.00 for tourists.<p><a id="Communications" name="Communications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Communications</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li><b>Telephones:</b> There are only <!--del_lnk--> satellite phones on the island, replacing a single wired <!--del_lnk--> party line. Islanders call between homes and ships via <!--del_lnk--> VHF radio.<li><b>Radio:</b> There is no broadcast station. Marine band <!--del_lnk--> walkie-talkie radios are used to maintain contact among people in different areas of the island. Foreign stations can be picked up on <!--del_lnk--> Shortwave Radio.<li><b>Television:</b> There is no broadcast TV; most houses have a VCR/DVD to watch videos. <!--del_lnk--> Free-To-Air satellite dishes can be used to watch foreign TV.<li><b>Internet:</b> There is one Government-sponsored satellite internet connection, networked to all houses on the island. Pitcairn&#39;s country code (top level domain) is <i><!--del_lnk--> .pn</i>.</ul>
      <p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p>The settlers of the Pitcairns all arrived by some form of <a href="../../wp/b/Boat.htm" title="Boat">boat</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ship</a>; the most famous was the <i><!--del_lnk--> HMAV Bounty</i>, on which the mutiny occurred and which was burned in Bounty Bay.<p><!--del_lnk--> Pitcairn Island does not have an <!--del_lnk--> airport or <!--del_lnk--> seaport; the islanders rely on <!--del_lnk--> longboats to <!--del_lnk--> ferry people and goods between <a href="../../wp/s/Ship.htm" title="Ship">ship</a> and shore through Bounty Bay. To get to Pitcairn it is necessary to fly to <!--del_lnk--> Tahiti, then <!--del_lnk--> Mangareva, then embark on a further 30-hour boat ride. There is one boat every several months. Alternately, passage can be obtained aboard a few freighters out of New Zealand &ndash; it is a seven-day trip via freighter. Leaving the island is hit-and-miss; one leaves when transportation happens by, not necessarily when one wishes to go.<p>There is one 6.4km paved <!--del_lnk--> road and no <!--del_lnk--> railways. On land, <!--del_lnk--> walking has historically been the way of getting around; <!--del_lnk--> all-terrain vehicles have become common in more recent years.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcairn_Islands&quot;</div>
