      <p><i><b>Piano</b></i> is the general name given to a <a href="../../wp/m/Musical_instrument.htm" title="Musical instrument">musical instrument</a> classified as a <!--del_lnk--> keyboard, <!--del_lnk--> percussion, or <!--del_lnk--> string instrument, depending on the system of <!--del_lnk--> classification used. The piano produces sound by striking steel strings with <!--del_lnk--> felt hammers that immediately rebound allowing the string to continue vibrating at its resonant frequency. These vibrations are transmitted through the <!--del_lnk--> bridges to the <!--del_lnk--> soundboard, which amplifies them.<p>The piano is widely used in <!--del_lnk--> western music for solo performance, <!--del_lnk--> chamber music, and <!--del_lnk--> accompaniment. It is also very popular as an aid to <!--del_lnk--> composing and <!--del_lnk--> rehearsal. Although not portable and often expensive, the piano&#39;s versatility and ubiquity has made it among the most familiar of musical instruments.<p>The word <i>piano</i> is a shortened form of the word <i>pianoforte</i>, which is seldom used except in formal language and derived from the original <!--del_lnk--> Italian name for the instrument, <i>gravic&egrave;mbalo col piano e forte</i> (literally <i><!--del_lnk--> harpsichord with soft and loud</i>). This refers to the ability of the piano to produce notes at different dynamic levels depending on the speed and force with which a key is pressed.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h2>
      <p>Although there were various crude earlier attempts to make stringed keyboard instruments with struck strings, it is widely considered that the piano was invented by a single individual: <!--del_lnk--> Bartolomeo Cristofori of <!--del_lnk--> Padua, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>. It is not known exactly when Cristofori first built a piano, but an inventory made by his employers, the <!--del_lnk--> Medici family, indicates the existence of a piano by the year 1700. The three Cristofori pianos that survive today date from the 1720s.<p>Like many other inventions, the piano was founded on earlier technological innovations. The mechanisms of keyboard instruments such as the <!--del_lnk--> clavichord and the <!--del_lnk--> harpsichord were well known. In a clavichord the strings are struck by <!--del_lnk--> tangents, while in a harpsichord they are plucked by quills. Centuries of work on the mechanism of the harpsichord in particular had shown the most effective ways to construct the case, soundboard, bridge, and keyboard. Cristofori, himself an expert harpsichord maker, was well acquainted with this body of knowledge.<div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>Cristofori&#39;s great success was in solving, without any prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammers must strike the string, but not remain in contact with the string (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would <!--del_lnk--> damp the sound. Moreover, the hammers must return to their rest position without bouncing violently, and it must be possible to repeat a note rapidly. Cristofori&#39;s piano <!--del_lnk--> action served as a model for the many different approaches to piano actions that followed. While Cristofori&#39;s early instruments were made with thin strings and were much quieter than the modern piano, compared to the clavichord (the only previous keyboard instrument capable of minutely controlled dynamic nuance through the keyboard) they were considerably louder and had more sustaining power.<p>Cristofori&#39;s new instrument remained relatively unknown until an Italian writer, <!--del_lnk--> Scipione Maffei, wrote an enthusiastic article about it (1711), including a diagram of the mechanism. This article was widely distributed, and most of the next generation of piano builders started their work because of reading it. One of these builders was <!--del_lnk--> Gottfried Silbermann, better known as an <!--del_lnk--> organ builder. Silbermann&#39;s pianos were virtually direct copies of Cristofori&#39;s, with one important addition: Silbermann invented the forerunner of the modern <!--del_lnk--> damper pedal, which lifts all the dampers from the strings at once.<p>Silbermann showed <a href="../../wp/j/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.htm" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Bach</a> one of his early instruments in the <!--del_lnk--> 1730s, but Bach did not like it at that time, claiming that the higher notes were too soft to allow a full dynamic range. Although this earned him some animosity from Silbermann, the criticism was apparently heeded. Bach did approve of a later instrument he saw in 1747, and even served as an agent in selling Silbermann&#39;s pianos.<p>Piano-making flourished during the late <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a> in the Viennese school, which included <!--del_lnk--> Johann Andreas Stein (who worked in <!--del_lnk--> Augsburg, Germany) and the Viennese makers <!--del_lnk--> Nannette Stein (daughter of Johann Andreas) and <!--del_lnk--> Anton Walter. Viennese-style pianos were built with wood frames, two strings per note, and had leather-covered hammers. It was for such instruments that <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a> composed his <!--del_lnk--> concertos and <!--del_lnk--> sonatas, and replicas of them are built today for use in <!--del_lnk--> authentic-instrument performance of his music. The pianos of Mozart&#39;s day had a softer, clearer tone than today&#39;s pianos, with less sustaining power. The term <i>fortepiano</i> is nowadays often used to distinguish the 18th-century instrument from later pianos.<p><a id="Development_of_the_modern_piano" name="Development_of_the_modern_piano"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Development of the modern piano</span></h2>

      <p>In the period lasting from about 1790 to 1860, the <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a>-era piano underwent tremendous changes, which led to the modern form of the instrument. This revolution was in response to a consistent preference by composers and pianists for a more powerful, sustained piano sound. It was also a response to the ongoing <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, which made available technological resources like high-quality steel for strings (see <!--del_lnk--> piano wire) and precision casting for the production of iron frames.<p>Over time, <!--del_lnk--> piano playing became a more strenuous and muscle-taxing activity, as the force needed to depress the keys, as well as the length of key travel, was increased. The tonal range of the piano was also increased, from the five <!--del_lnk--> octaves of Mozart&#39;s day to the 7&#x2153; (or even more) octaves found on modern pianos.<p>In the first part of this era, technological progress owed much to the English firm of <!--del_lnk--> Broadwood, which already had a strong reputation for the splendour and powerful tone of its harpsichords. Over time, the Broadwood instruments grew progressively larger, louder, and more robustly constructed. The Broadwood firm, which sent pianos to both <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Haydn.htm" title="Joseph Haydn">Haydn</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, was the first to build pianos with a range of more than five octaves: five octaves and a fifth during the 1790s, six octaves by 1810 (in time for Beethoven to use the extra notes in his later works), and seven octaves by 1820. The Viennese makers followed these trends. The two schools, however, used different piano actions: the Broadwood one more robust, the Viennese more sensitive.<p>By the 1820s, the centre of innovation had shifted to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, where the &Eacute;rard firm manufactured pianos used by <a href="../../wp/f/Fr%25C3%25A9d%25C3%25A9ric_Chopin.htm" title="Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin">Chopin</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Liszt. In 1821, <!--del_lnk--> S&eacute;bastien &Eacute;rard invented the double escapement action, which permitted a note to be repeated even if the key had not yet risen to its maximum vertical position, a great benefit for rapid playing. When the invention became public, and as revised by <!--del_lnk--> Henri Herz, the double escapement action gradually became the standard action for grand pianos, and is used in all grand pianos currently produced.<p>Some other important technical innovations of this era include the following:<ul>
       <li>Use of three strings rather than two for all but the lower notes<li>The iron frame, also called the &quot;plate&quot;, sits atop the soundboard, and serves as the primary bulwark against the force of string tension. The iron frame was the ultimate solution to the problem of structural integrity as the strings were gradually made thicker, tenser, and more numerous (in a modern grand the total string tension can approach 20 tons). The single piece cast iron frame was patented in 1825 in <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Alpheus Babcock, combining the metal hitch pin plate (1821, claimed by Broadwood on behalf of Samuel Herv&eacute;) and resisting bars (Thom and Allen, 1820, but also claimed by Broadwood and &Eacute;rard). Babcock later worked for the <!--del_lnk--> Chickering &amp; Mackays firm which patented the first full iron frame for grand pianos (1843). Composite forged metal frames were preferred by many European makers until the American system was fully adopted by the early 20th century.<li>Felt hammer coverings, first introduced by Henri Pape in 1826, gradually replaced skillfully layered leather hammers; the more consistent material permitted wider dynamic ranges as hammer weights and string tensions increased.<li>The sostenuto pedal (see below), invented in 1844 by <!--del_lnk--> Jean Louis Boisselot and improved by the <!--del_lnk--> Steinway firm in 1874.<li>The over strung scale, also called &quot;cross-stringing&quot;; the strings are placed in a vertically overlapping slanted arrangement, with two heights of bridges on the soundboard, rather than just one. This permits larger, but not necessarily longer, strings to fit within the case of the piano. Over stringing was invented by <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Henri Pape during the 1820s, and first patented for use in grand pianos in the United States by Henry <!--del_lnk--> Steinway Jr. in <!--del_lnk--> 1859.</ul>

       <li>Duplexes or <!--del_lnk--> aliquot scales; In 1872 Theodore Steinway patented a system to control different components of string vibrations by tuning their secondary parts in octave relationships with the sounding lengths. Similar systems developed by <!--del_lnk--> Bl&uuml;thner (1872), as well as <!--del_lnk--> Taskin (1788), and <!--del_lnk--> Collard (1821) used more distinctly ringing undamped vibrations to modify tone.</ul>
      <p>Today&#39;s upright, grand, and concert grand pianos attained their present forms by the end of the 19th century. Improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, and many individual details of the instrument continue to receive attention (see <!--del_lnk--> Innovations in the Piano).<p>Some early pianos had shapes and designs that are no longer in use.<p>The square piano had horizontal strings arranged diagonally across the rectangular case above the hammers and with the keyboard set in the long side, it is variously attributed to Silbermann and Frederici and was improved by <!--del_lnk--> Petzold and <!--del_lnk--> Babcock. Built in quantity through the 1890s (in the United States), Steinway&#39;s celebrated iron framed over strung squares were more than two and a half times the size of Zumpe&#39;s wood framed instruments that were successful a century before, their overwhelming popularity was due to inexpensive construction and price, with performance and sonority frequently restricted by simple actions and closely spaced strings.<dl>

      <p>The tall vertically strung upright grand was arranged with the soundboard and bridges perpendicular to keys, and above them so that the strings did not extend to the floor. Diagonally strung Giraffe, pyramid and lyre pianos employed this principle in more evocatively shaped cases. The term was later revived by many manufacturers for advertising purposes.<p>The very tall cabinet piano introduced by Southwell in 1806 and built through the 1840s had strings arranged vertically on a continuous frame with bridges extended nearly to the floor, behind the keyboard and very large <i>sticker action</i>.<p>The short cottage upright or pianino with vertical stringing, credited to Robert Wornum about 1810 was built into the 20th century. They are informally called <i>birdcage pianos</i> because of their prominent damper mechanism. Pianinos were distinguished from the oblique, or diagonally strung upright made popular in France by Roller &amp; Blanchet during the late 1820s.<p>The tiny spinet upright was manufactured from the mid 1930s until recent times. It saved space by using a &quot;drop action&quot; arranged below the level of the keys.<dl>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Grand pianos have the frame and strings placed horizontally, with the strings extending away from the keyboard. This makes the grand piano a large instrument, for which the ideal setting is a spacious room with high ceilings for proper resonance. There are several sizes of grand piano. Manufacturers and models vary, but a rough generalisation distinguishes the &quot;concert grand&quot;, (between about 2.2&nbsp;m to 3&nbsp;m long) from the &quot;boudoir grand&quot; (about 1.7&nbsp;m to 2.2&nbsp;m) and the smaller &quot;baby grand&quot; (which may be shorter than it is wide). All else being equal, longer pianos have better sound and lower <!--del_lnk--> inharmonicity of the strings. This is partly because the strings will be tuned closer to <!--del_lnk--> equal temperament in relation to the standard pitch with less stretching (<i>See: <!--del_lnk--> Piano tuning</i>). Full-size grands are usually used for public concerts, whereas baby grands, invented by <!--del_lnk--> Sohmer &amp; Co. in 1884, are often chosen for domestic use where space and cost are considerations.<p><a id="Upright" name="Upright"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Upright</span></h4>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Upright pianos, also called vertical pianos, are more compact because the frame and strings are placed vertically, extending in both directions from the keyboard and hammers. It is considered harder to produce a sensitive piano action when the hammers move horizontally, rather than upward against gravity as in a grand piano; however, the very best upright pianos now approach the level of grand pianos of the same size in tone quality and responsiveness. However, one feature of the grand piano action always makes it superior to the vertical piano. All grand pianos have a special repetition lever in the playing action that is absent in all verticals. This repetition lever, a separate one for every key, catches the hammer close to the strings as long as the key remains depressed. In this position, with the hammer resting on the lever, a pianist can play repeated notes, staccato, and trills with much more speed and control than they could on a vertical piano. The action design of a vertical prevents it from having a repetition lever. Because of this, piano manufacturers claim that a skilled piano player can play as many as 14 <!--del_lnk--> trill notes per second on grands but only seven on uprights. For recent advances, see <!--del_lnk--> Innovations in the piano.<p><a id="Other_Types" name="Other_Types"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Other Types</span></h4>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1863, <!--del_lnk--> Henri Fourneaux invented the <!--del_lnk--> player piano, which &quot;plays itself&quot; from a <!--del_lnk--> piano roll without the need for a pianist.<p>Also in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> toy pianos began to be manufactured.<p>A relatively recent development is the <!--del_lnk--> prepared piano, which is simply a standard grand piano which has had objects placed inside it before a performance in order to alter its sound, or which has had its mechanism changed in some way.<p>Since the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, <!--del_lnk--> digital pianos have been available, which use <!--del_lnk--> digital sampling technology to reproduce the sound of each piano note. The best digital pianos are sophisticated, with features including working pedals, weighted keys, multiple voices, and <!--del_lnk--> MIDI interfaces. However, with current technology, it remains difficult to duplicate a crucial aspect of acoustic pianos, namely that when the damper pedal (see below) is depressed, the strings not struck <!--del_lnk--> vibrate sympathetically when other strings are struck as well as the unique instrument-specific mathematical non-linearity of partials on any given unison. Since this <!--del_lnk--> sympathetic vibration is considered central to a beautiful piano tone, in many experts&#39; estimation digital pianos still do not compete with the best acoustic pianos in tone quality. Progress is being made in this area by including <!--del_lnk--> physical models of sympathetic vibration in the synthesis software.<p>The modern equivalent to the player piano is the Yamaha <!--del_lnk--> Disklavier system, which uses solenoids and midi instead of pneumatics and rolls. <!--del_lnk--> Silent pianos, which silence the piano and convert it to a digital instrument are a recent innovation and are becoming more popular.<p><a id="Keyboard" name="Keyboard"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Keyboard</span></h3>
      <p>Almost every modern piano has 88 keys (seven <!--del_lnk--> octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8). Many older pianos only have 85 keys (seven octaves from A0 to A7), while some manufacturers extend the range further in one or both directions. The most notable example of an extended range can be found on <!--del_lnk--> B&ouml;sendorfer pianos, one model which extends the normal range downwards to F0, with one other model going as far as a bottom C0, making a full eight octave range. Sometimes, these extra keys are hidden under a small hinged lid, which can be flipped down to cover the keys and avoid visual disorientation in a pianist unfamiliar with the extended keyboard; on others, the colours of the extra white keys are reversed (black instead of white). The extra keys are added primarily for increased resonance from the associated strings; that is, they vibrate sympathetically with other strings whenever the damper pedal is depressed and thus give a fuller tone. Only a very small number of works composed for piano actually use these notes. More recently, the <!--del_lnk--> Stuart and Sons company has also manufactured extended-range pianos. On their instruments, the range is extended both down the bass to F0 and up the treble to F8 for a full eight octaves. The extra keys are the same as the other keys in appearance.<p><a id="Pedals" name="Pedals"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Pedals</span></h3>
      <p>Pianos have had <i>pedals</i>, or some close equivalent, since the earliest days. (In the 18th century, some pianos used levers pressed upward by the player&#39;s knee instead of pedals.) The three pedals that have become more or less standard on the modern piano are the following.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> damper pedal (also called the sustaining pedal or loud pedal) is often simply called &quot;the pedal&quot;, since it is the most frequently used. It is placed as the rightmost pedal in the group. Every string on the piano, except the top two octaves, is equipped with a damper, which is a padded device that prevents the string from vibrating. The damper is raised off the string whenever the key for that note is pressed. When the damper pedal is pressed, all the dampers on the piano are lifted at once, so that every string can vibrate. This serves two purposes. First, it assists the pianist in producing a <i><!--del_lnk--> legato</i> (playing smoothly connected notes) in passages where no fingering is available to make this otherwise possible. Second, raising the damper pedal causes all the strings to vibrate <!--del_lnk--> sympathetically with whichever notes are being played, which greatly enriches the piano&#39;s tone.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Sensitive pedaling is one of the techniques a pianist must master, since piano music from <a href="../../wp/f/Fr%25C3%25A9d%25C3%25A9ric_Chopin.htm" title="Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin">Chopin</a> onwards tends to benefit from extensive use of the sustaining pedal, both as a means of achieving a singing tone and as an aid to <i>legato</i>. In contrast, the sustaining pedal was used only sparingly by the composers of the 18th century, including <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Haydn.htm" title="Joseph Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart.htm" title="Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart">Mozart</a> and in early works by <a href="../../wp/l/Ludwig_van_Beethoven.htm" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>; in that era, pedalling was considered primarily as a special coloristic effect.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> soft pedal or &quot;una corda&quot; pedal is placed leftmost in the row of pedals. On a grand piano, this pedal shifts the whole action including the keyboard slightly to the right, so that hammers that normally strike all three of the strings for a note strike only two of them. This softens the note and modifies its tone quality. For notation of the soft pedal in printed music, see <!--del_lnk--> Italian musical terms.<p>The soft pedal was invented by Cristofori and thus appeared on the very earliest pianos. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the soft pedal was more effective than today, since pianos were manufactured with only two strings per note, just one string per note would be therefore struck &mdash; this is the origin of the name &quot;una corda&quot;, Italian for &quot;one string&quot;. In modern pianos, there are three strings per hammer and are spaced too closely to permit a true &quot;una corda&quot; effect&nbsp;&mdash; if shifted far enough to strike just one string on one note, the hammers would hit the string of the next note.<p>On many upright pianos, the soft pedal operates a mechanism which moves the hammers&#39; resting position closer to the strings. Since the hammers have less distance to travel this reduces the speed at which they hit the strings, and hence the volume is reduced, but this does not change tone quality in the way the &quot;una corda&quot; pedal does on a grand piano.<p>Digital pianos often use this pedal to alter the sound to that of another instrument such as the organ, guitar, or harmonica. Pitch bends, leslie speaker on/off, vibrato modulation, etc. increase the already-great versatility of such instruments.<p>The sostenuto pedal or &quot;middle pedal&quot; keeps raised any damper that was raised at the moment the pedal is depressed. This makes it possible to sustain some notes (by depressing the sostenuto pedal before notes to be sustained are released) while the player&#39;s hands are free to play other notes. This can be useful for musical passages with <!--del_lnk--> pedal points and other otherwise tricky or impossible situations. The sostenuto pedal was the last of the three pedals to be added to the standard piano, and to this day, many pianos are not equipped with a sostenuto pedal. (Almost all modern grand pianos have a sostenuto pedal, while most upright pianos do not.) A number of twentieth-century works specifically call for the use of this pedal, for example <!--del_lnk--> Olivier Messiaen&#39;s <i>Catalogue d&#39;oiseaux</i>. This pedal is often unused in modern music.<p>Many uprights and baby grands have a bass sustain in place of the sostenuto pedal, which lifts all the dampers in the bass. It works like the damper pedal, but only affects the lowest notes.<p>Some upright pianos have a practice pedal or celeste pedal in place of the sostenuto. This pedal, which can usually be locked in place by depressing it and pushing it to one side, drops a strip of felt between the hammers and the strings so that all the notes are greatly muted&nbsp;&mdash; a handy feature for those who wish to practice in domestic surroundings without disturbing the neighbours. The practice pedal is rarely used in performance.<p>The rare <!--del_lnk--> transposing piano, of which <!--del_lnk--> Irving Berlin possessed an example, uses the middle pedal as a <!--del_lnk--> clutch which disengages the keyboard from the mechanism, enabling the keyboard to be moved to left or right with a lever. The entire action of the piano is thus shifted to allow the pianist to play music written in one key so that it sounds in a different key.<p><a id="Materials" name="Materials"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Materials</span></h3>
      <p>Many parts of a piano are made of materials selected for extreme sturdiness. In quality pianos, the outer rim of the piano is made of a hardwood, normally maple or beech. According to <!--del_lnk--> Harold A. Conklin, the purpose of a sturdy rim is so that &quot;the vibrational energy will stay as much as possible in the soundboard instead of dissipating uselessly in the case parts, which are inefficient radiators of sound.&quot; The rim is normally made by laminating flexible strips of hardwood to the desired shape, a system that was developed by Theodore Steinway in 1880.<p>The thick wooden braces at the bottom (grands) or back (uprights) of the piano are not as acoustically important as the rim, and are often made of a softwood, even in top-quality pianos, in order to save weight.<p>The pinblock, which holds the tuning pins in place, is another area of the piano where toughness is important. It is made of hardwood, (often <!--del_lnk--> maple) and generally is laminated (built of multiple layers) for additional strength and gripping power.<p>Piano strings (also called <!--del_lnk--> piano wire), which must endure years of extreme tension and hard blows, are made of high quality steel. They are manufactured to vary as little as possible in diameter, since all deviations from uniformity introduce tonal distortion. The bass strings of a piano are made of a steel core wrapped with copper wire, to increase their flexibility. For the acoustic reasons behind this, see <!--del_lnk--> Piano acoustics.<p>The plate, or metal frame, of a piano is usually made of <!--del_lnk--> cast iron. It is advantageous for the plate to be quite massive. Since the strings are attached to the plate at one end, any vibrations transmitted to the plate will result in loss of energy to the desired (efficient) channel of sound transmission, namely the bridge and the soundboard. Some manufacturers now use cast steel in their plates, for greater strength. The casting of the plate is a delicate art, since the dimensions are crucial and the iron shrinks by about one percent during cooling. The inclusion in a piano of an extremely large piece of metal is potentially an aesthetic handicap. Piano makers overcome this handicap by polishing, painting, and decorating the plate; often plates include the manufacturer&#39;s ornamental medallion and can be strikingly attractive. In an effort to make pianos lighter, <!--del_lnk--> Alcoa worked with Winter and Company piano manufacturers to make pianos using an <!--del_lnk--> aluminium plate during the 1940s. The use of aluminium for piano plates, however, did not become widely accepted and was discontinued.<p>The numerous grand parts and upright parts of a piano action are generally <!--del_lnk--> hardwood (e.g. maple, beech. hornbeam). However, since <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <!--del_lnk--> plastics have become available. Early plastics were incorporated into some pianos in the late 1940s and 1950s, but proved disastrous because they crystallized and lost their strength after only a few decades of use. The <!--del_lnk--> Steinway firm once incorporated <!--del_lnk--> Teflon, a synthetic material developed by <!--del_lnk--> DuPont, for some grand action parts in place of cloth, but ultimately abandoned the experiment due to an inherent &quot;clicking&quot; which invariably developed over time. (Also Teflon is &quot;humidity stable&quot; whereas the wood adjacent to the Teflon will swell and shrink with humidity changes, causing problems.) More recently, the <!--del_lnk--> Kawai firm has built pianos with action parts made of more modern and effective plastics such as <!--del_lnk--> carbon fibre; these parts have held up better and have generally received the respect of piano technicians.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The part of the piano where materials probably matter more than anywhere else is the <!--del_lnk--> soundboard. In quality pianos, this is made of solid <!--del_lnk--> spruce (that is, spruce boards glued together at their edges). Spruce is chosen for its high ratio of strength to weight. The best piano makers use close-grained, quarter-sawn, defect-free spruce, and make sure that it has been carefully dried over a long period of time before making it into soundboards. In cheap pianos, the soundboard is often made of <!--del_lnk--> plywood.<p>Piano keys are generally made of spruce or <!--del_lnk--> basswood, for lightness. Spruce is normally used in high-quality pianos. Traditionally, the black keys were made from <a href="../../wp/e/Ebony.htm" title="Ebony">ebony</a> and the white keys were covered with strips of <a href="../../wp/i/Ivory.htm" title="Ivory">ivory</a>, but since ivory-yielding species are now endangered and protected by treaty, plastics are now almost exclusively used.<p>Legal ivory can still be obtained in limited quantities. At one time, the <!--del_lnk--> Yamaha firm innovated a plastic called &quot;Ivorine&quot; or &quot;Ivorite&quot;, since imitated by other makers, that mimics the look and feel of ivory.<p>The requirement of structural strength, fulfilled with stout hardwood and thick metal, makes a piano heavy; even a small upright can weigh 136&nbsp;kg (300&nbsp;lb), and the Steinway concert grand (Model D) weighs 480&nbsp;kg (990&nbsp;lb). The largest piano built, the <!--del_lnk--> Fazioli F308, weighs 691&nbsp;kg (1520&nbsp;lb).<p><a id="Care_and_maintenance" name="Care_and_maintenance"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Care and maintenance</span></h3>
      <p>Pianos need regular tuning to keep them up to pitch and produce a pleasing sound; by convention they are tuned to the internationally recognized standard concert pitch of A&nbsp;=&nbsp;440&nbsp;Hz.<p>The hammers of pianos are voiced to compensate for gradual hardening, and other parts also need periodic regulation. Aged and worn pianos can be rebuilt or reconditioned. Often, by replacing a great number of their parts, they can be made to perform as well as new pianos. It is often felt, however, that older pianos are more settled and produce a warmer tone.<p><a id="The_role_of_the_piano" name="The_role_of_the_piano"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">The role of the piano</span></h2>
      <p>The piano is a crucial instrument in Western <!--del_lnk--> classical music, <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <!--del_lnk--> film, <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a>, and most other complex western musical genres. Since a large number of <!--del_lnk--> composers are proficient pianists--and because the piano keyboard offers an easy means of complex melodic and harmonic interplay--the piano is often used as a tool for composition.<p>Pianos were, and still are, popular instruments for private household ownership, especially among the middle and upper classes. Hence, pianos have gained a place in the popular consciousness, and are sometimes referred to by nicknames including: &quot;the ivories&quot;, &quot;the joanna&quot;, &quot;the eighty-eight&quot;, and &quot;the black(s) and white(s)&quot;, &quot;the little joe(s)&quot;. Playing the piano is sometimes referred to as &quot;tickling the ivories&quot;.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano&quot;</div>
