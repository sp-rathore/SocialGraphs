Situated on the banks of the river <!--del_lnk--> Seine in north-central France, it is also the capital of the <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le-de-France <i><!--del_lnk--> r&eacute;gion</i> (also known as &quot;Paris Region&quot;), which encompasses Paris and its <!--del_lnk--> suburbs. Paris had an estimated mid-2004 population of 2,144,700. The Paris <!--del_lnk--> urban area, extending well beyond the city boundaries, has today an estimated population of 9.93 million. The <!--del_lnk--> Paris metropolitan area (including satellite towns) stood at 11.5 million in 1999 and is one of the most populated metropolitan areas in Europe.<p>The Paris region is France&#39;s most dynamic centre of economic activity. It produces more than a quarter of France&#39;s wealth, with a <!--del_lnk--> GDP of &euro;478.7 billion (US$595.3 billion) in 2005. With <!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense, the largest purpose-built business district in Europe, the Paris <!--del_lnk--> urban area (<!--del_lnk--> unit&eacute; urbaine) also hosts the head offices of almost half of the major French companies, as well as the offices of major international firms. Paris is a leading cultural, business and political centre and has an influence in fashion, gastronomy and the arts. It is regarded as one of the major <a href="../../wp/g/Global_city.htm" title="Global city">global cities</a>, with the headquarters of international organisations such as <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO, the <!--del_lnk--> OECD, the <!--del_lnk--> ICC, or the informal <!--del_lnk--> Paris Club.<p>The city, which is renowned for its defining <!--del_lnk--> neo-classical architecture, hosts many museums and galleries and has an active nightlife. The most recognisable symbol of Paris is the 324&nbsp;metre (1,063&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel Tower on the banks of the Seine. Dubbed &quot;the City of Light&quot; (<i>la Ville Lumi&egrave;re</i>) since the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, Paris is regarded by many as one of the most beautiful and romantic cities in the world..

      <p>Paris is <!--del_lnk--> pronounced as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x2C8;p&#x2B0;&aelig;&#x279;&#x26A;s]</span> in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and as <span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> [pa&#x280;i]</span>  in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>. The city derives its name from the <!--del_lnk--> Gallic <i><!--del_lnk--> Parisii</i> tribe. The city, known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Lutetia</i> (<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/lutetja/</span>) during the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, began to adopt its present-day name towards the end of the Roman era. Since the early 20th century, Paris has been known in French <!--del_lnk--> slang as <i>Paname</i> (<span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[panam]</span>; <span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> <i>Moi j&#39;suis d&#39;Paname</i></span>&nbsp;, i.e. &quot;I&#39;m from Paname&quot;), a slang name that has been regaining favour with young people in recent years. Another sobriquet for Paris is &#39;The City of Light&#39; (<i>La Ville-lumi&egrave;re</i>), owing to its early adoption of street-lighting.<p>The inhabitants of Paris are known as Parisians <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[p&#x2B0;&#x259;&#x2C8;&#x279;&#x26A;z&#x26A;&#x259;nz]</span> or <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[p&#x2B0;&#x259;&#x2C8;&#x279;i&#x2D0;&#x292;n&#x329;z]</span> in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and as <i>Parisiens</i> (<span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> [pa&#x280;izj&#x25B;&#x303;]</span> ) in <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>. Parisians are sometimes called <i>Parigots</i> (<span class="IPA audiolink nounderlines" style="white-space: nowrap;"><!--del_lnk--> [pa&#x280;igo]</span> ) in French slang, a term often used pejoratively by people outside the Paris Region, but sometimes considered endearing by Parisians themselves.<p><a id="Early_beginnings" name="Early_beginnings"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early beginnings</span></h3>
      <p>The earliest signs of permanent habitation in the Paris area date from around 4200 <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">BC</a>. Celtic migrants began to settle the area from 250 <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">BC</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Parisii tribe of these, known as boatmen and traders, established a settlement near the river <!--del_lnk--> Seine from around then.<p>Westward Roman conquest and the ensuing Gallic War overtook the Paris basin from 52 <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">BC</a>, and by the end of the century Paris&#39; <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; island and <!--del_lnk--> Left Bank <!--del_lnk--> Sainte Genevi&egrave;ve Hill had become the Roman town of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lutetia</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Gallo-Roman <i>Lut&egrave;ce</i> would expand over the following centuries, becoming a prosperous city with palaces, a forum, baths, temples, theatres and an amphitheatre.<p>As other Roman cities, early Lutetia was structured as a regular grid (300 feet squares), with the <i><!--del_lnk--> cardo maximus</i> (main North-South axis) being the current <i>Rue Saint-Jacques</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> decumani</i> (East-West axis) were parallel to current <i>Bd Saint-Germain</i> and <i>Rue des Ecoles</i>. The &quot;point zero&quot;, or <i><!--del_lnk--> groma</i> of this grid was probably located at the southwest corner of the forum, which corresponds to nos. 172 and 174 of <i>Rue Saint-Jacques</i>: the highest point on the Saint-Genevi&egrave;ve hill.<p>The collapse of the Roman empire and third-century Germanic invasions sent the city into a period of decline: by <!--del_lnk--> 400 AD <i>Lut&egrave;ce</i>, largely abandoned by its inhabitants, was little more than a garrison town entrenched into its hastily fortified central island. The city would reclaim its original &quot;Paris&quot; appellation towards the end of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> occupation.<p><a id="Middle_ages" name="Middle_ages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Middle ages</span></h3>
      <p>Around <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> 500, Paris was the capital of the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Frankish</a> <!--del_lnk--> king <!--del_lnk--> Clovis I, who commissioned the first <!--del_lnk--> cathedral and <!--del_lnk--> abbey. On the death of Clovis, the Frankish kingdom was divided, and Paris became the capital of a much smaller sovereign state. By the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Carolingian dynasty (9th century), Paris was little more than a feudal county stronghold. The Counts of Paris gradually rose to prominence and eventually wielded greater power than the Kings of <!--del_lnk--> Francia occidentalis. <!--del_lnk--> Odo, Count of Paris was elected king in place of the incumbent <!--del_lnk--> Charles the Fat, namely for the fame he gained in his defence of Paris during the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> <!--del_lnk--> siege of 885-886. Although the <!--del_lnk--> Cit&eacute; island had survived the Viking attacks, most of the unprotected <!--del_lnk--> Left Bank city was destroyed; rather than rebuild there, after drying marshlands to the north of the island, Paris began to expand onto the <!--del_lnk--> Right Bank. In 987 AD, <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Capet, Count of Paris, was elected King of France, founding the <!--del_lnk--> Capetian dynasty which would raise Paris to become France&#39;s capital.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>From 1190, King <!--del_lnk--> Philip Augustus enclosed Paris on both banks with a wall that had the <!--del_lnk--> Louvre as its western fortress and in 1200 chartered the <!--del_lnk--> University of Paris which brought visitors from across <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. It was during this period that the city developed a spatial distribution of activities that exists even today: the central island housed government and ecclesiastical institutions, the left bank became a scholastic centre with the University and <!--del_lnk--> colleges, while the right bank developed as the centre of commerce and trade around the central <!--del_lnk--> Les Halles marketplace.<p>Paris lost its position as seat of the French realm while occupied by the English-ally <!--del_lnk--> Burgundians during the <a href="../../wp/h/Hundred_Years%2527_War.htm" title="Hundred Years&#39; War">Hundred Years&#39; War</a>, but regained its title when <!--del_lnk--> Charles VII reclaimed the city in <!--del_lnk--> 1437; although Paris was capital once again, the Crown preferred to remain in its <!--del_lnk--> Loire Valley castles. During the <!--del_lnk--> French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic party, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> St. Bartholomew&#39;s Day massacre (<!--del_lnk--> 1572). King <!--del_lnk--> Henry IV re-established the royal court in Paris in <!--del_lnk--> 1594 after he captured the city from the Catholic party. During the <!--del_lnk--> Fronde, Parisians rose in rebellion and the royal family fled the city (<!--del_lnk--> 1648). King <a href="../../wp/l/Louis_XIV_of_France.htm" title="Louis XIV of France">Louis XIV</a> then moved the royal court permanently to <!--del_lnk--> Versailles in <!--del_lnk--> 1682. A century later, Paris was the centre stage for the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, with the <!--del_lnk--> Storming of the Bastille in <!--del_lnk--> 1789 and the <!--del_lnk--> overthrow of the monarchy in <!--del_lnk--> 1792.<p><a id="Nineteenth_century" name="Nineteenth_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nineteenth century</span></h3>

The city underwent a massive renovation under <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon III and his <i><!--del_lnk--> pr&eacute;fet</i> <!--del_lnk--> Haussmann, who <!--del_lnk--> leveled entire districts of narrow-winding medieval streets to create the network of wide avenues and neo-classical fa&ccedil;ades of modern Paris.<p><a href="../../wp/c/Cholera.htm" title="Cholera">Cholera</a> epidemics in 1832 and 1849 affected the population of Paris&nbsp;&mdash; the 1832 epidemic alone claimed 20,000 of the then population of 650,000. Paris also suffered greatly from the <!--del_lnk--> siege ending the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871), and the ensuing civil war <!--del_lnk--> Commune of Paris (1871) killed thousands and sent many of Paris&#39;s administrative centres (and city archives) up in flames.<p>Paris recovered rapidly from these events to host the famous <!--del_lnk--> Universal Expositions of the late <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century. The <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel Tower was built for the French Revolution centennial <!--del_lnk--> 1889 Universal Exposition, as a &quot;temporary&quot; display of architectural engineering prowess but remained the world&#39;s tallest building until 1930, and today is the city&#39;s best-known landmark. The first line of the <!--del_lnk--> Paris M&eacute;tro opened for the <!--del_lnk--> 1900 Universal Exposition and was an attraction in itself for visitors from the world over. Paris&#39;s World&#39;s Fair years also consolidated its position in the tourist industry and as an attractive setting for international technology and trade shows.<p><a id="Twentieth_century_and_Today" name="Twentieth_century_and_Today"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Twentieth century and Today</span></h3>

      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Paris was at the forefront of the war effort, having been spared a German invasion by the French and British victory at the <!--del_lnk--> First Battle of the Marne in 1914. In 1918-1919, it was the scene of <!--del_lnk--> Allied victory parades and peace negotiations. In the <!--del_lnk--> inter-war period Paris was famed for its cultural and artistic communities and its nightlife. The city became a melting pot of artists from around the world, from exiled Russian composer <a href="../../wp/i/Igor_Stravinsky.htm" title="Igor Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and Spanish painters <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Picasso</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Salvador_Dal%25C3%25AD.htm" title="Salvador Dal&iacute;">Dal&iacute;</a> to American writer <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Hemingway.htm" title="Ernest Hemingway">Hemingway</a>. In June 1940, five weeks after the start of the <!--del_lnk--> German attack on France, a partially evacuated Paris fell to German occupation forces who remained until the city was liberated by the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd Armored Division of <!--del_lnk--> General Leclerc in late August 1944. Central Paris endured <!--del_lnk--> WW II practically unscathed, as there were no strategic targets for bombers (train stations in central Paris are <!--del_lnk--> terminal stations; major factories were located in the suburbs), and also because German <!--del_lnk--> General von Choltitz refused to carry out <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>&#39;s order that all Parisian monuments be destroyed before any German retreat.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the post-war era, Paris experienced its largest development since the end of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Belle &Eacute;poque</i> in 1914. The suburbs began to expand considerably, with the construction of large social estates known as <i>cit&eacute;s</i> and the beginning of the business district <!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense. A comprehensive express subway network, the <a href="../../wp/r/RER.htm" title="RER">RER</a>, was built to complement the M&eacute;tro and serve the distant suburbs, while a network of freeways was developed in the suburbs, centered on the <i><!--del_lnk--> P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique</i> expressway circling around the city.<p>Since the 1970s, many inner suburbs of Paris (especially the eastern ones) have experienced <!--del_lnk--> deindustrialization, and the once-thriving <i>cit&eacute;s</i> have gradually become ghettos for immigrants and oases of unemployment. At the same time, the City of Paris (within its <i>P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique</i> ring) and the western and southern suburbs have successfully shifted their economic base from traditional manufacturing to high value-added services and high-tech manufacturing, generating great wealth for their residents whose per capita income is among the highest in Europe. The resulting widening social gap between these two areas has led to periodic unrest since the mid-1980s, such as the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 riots which largely concentrated in the northeastern suburbs.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Paris is located on a north-bending arc of the river <!--del_lnk--> Seine and includes two inhabited islands, the <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le Saint-Louis and the larger <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le de la Cit&eacute; which is the heart and origin of the city. Paris has several prominent hills, of which the highest is <!--del_lnk--> Montmartre at 130 metres (426&frac12; ft) above sea level.<p>The City of Paris, excluding the outlying parks of <!--del_lnk--> Bois de Boulogne and <!--del_lnk--> Bois de Vincennes, covers an oval measuring 86.928 square kilometres (33.56 mi&sup2;) in area. The city&#39;s last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form, but created the twenty clockwise-spiralling <!--del_lnk--> arrondissements it still has today. From its <!--del_lnk--> 1860 78 km&sup2; (30.1 mi&sup2;), these limits changed marginally to 86.9 km&sup2; in the 1920&#39;s, and in <!--del_lnk--> 1929 the <!--del_lnk--> Bois de Boulogne and <!--del_lnk--> Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to its present 105.397 <!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (40.69 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2;).<p>The Paris agglomeration (<!--del_lnk--> urban area) extends from the city limits to an area much greater than Paris itself (app. 26 times larger) in an irregular oval with tentacles of urban growth extending along the <!--del_lnk--> Seine and <!--del_lnk--> Marne river from the city&#39;s south-east and east, and along the <!--del_lnk--> Seine and <!--del_lnk--> Oise rivers to the city&#39;s north-west and north. Urban density drops sharply in the land surrounding; a mix of forest and agriculture dotted with a network of relatively evenly dispersed satellite towns, this <i>couronne p&eacute;ri-urbaine</i> (commuter belt), when combined with the Paris agglomeration, completes a Paris <i><!--del_lnk--> aire urbaine</i> (<!--del_lnk--> metropolitan area) that covers an oval 14,518 km&sup2; (5,605.5 mi&sup2;) in area, or an area about 138 times that of Paris itself.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Paris has an <!--del_lnk--> Oceanic climate and is affected by the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Drift, so the city enjoys a temperate climate that rarely sees extremely high or low temperatures. The average yearly high temperature is about 15 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (59 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F), and yearly lows tend to remain around an average of 7 &deg;C (45 &deg;F). The highest temperature ever, recorded on <!--del_lnk--> 28 July <!--del_lnk--> 1948, was 40.4 &deg;C (104.7 &deg;F), and the lowest was a &minus;23.9 &deg;C (&minus;11.0 &deg;F) temperature reached on <!--del_lnk--> 10 December <!--del_lnk--> 1879. The Paris region has recently seen temperatures reaching both extremes, with the <!--del_lnk--> heat wave of 2003 and <!--del_lnk--> the cold wave of 2006.<p>Rainfall can occur at any time of the year, and Paris is known for its sudden showers. The city sees an average yearly precipitation of around 641.6 mm (25.2 inches). Snowfall is a rare occurrence, usually appearing in the coldest months of January or February (but has been recorded as late as April), and almost never accumulates enough to make a covering that will last more than a day.<br clear="all" />

      <p>&quot;Modern&quot; Paris is the result of a vast <!--del_lnk--> mid-19th-century urban remodelling. For centuries it had been a labyrinth of narrow streets and half-timber houses, but beginning in 1852, the <!--del_lnk--> Baron Haussmann&#39;s vast urbanisation levelled entire quarters to make way for wide avenues lined with neo-classical stone buildings of <i>bourgeoise</i> standing; most of this &#39;new&#39; Paris is the Paris we see today. These <!--del_lnk--> Second Empire plans are in many cases still actual, as the city of Paris imposes the then-defined &quot;<i>alignement</i>&quot; law (imposed position defining a predetermined street width) on many new constructions. A building&#39;s height was also defined according to the width of the street it lines, and Paris&#39; building code has seen few changes since the mid-19th century to allow for higher constructions. It is for this reason, save for a few &#39;pointed&#39; examples, that Paris seems an essentially flat city when compared to some of the world&#39;s other metropoles.<p>Paris&#39; unchanging borders, strict building codes and lack of developable land have together contributed in creating a phenomenon called <i>mus&eacute;ification</i> (or &quot;museumification&quot;) as, at the same time as they strive to preserve Paris&#39; historical past, existing laws make it difficult to create within city limits the larger buildings and utilities needed for a growing population. Many of Paris&#39; institutions and economic infrastructure are already located in, or are planning on moving to, the suburbs. The financial (<!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense) business district, the main food wholesale market (<!--del_lnk--> Rungis), major renowned schools (<i><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Polytechnique</i>, <!--del_lnk--> HEC, <!--del_lnk--> ESSEC, <!--del_lnk--> INSEAD, etc.), world famous research laboratories (in <!--del_lnk--> Saclay or <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;vry), the largest sport stadium (<i><!--del_lnk--> Stade de France</i>), and some ministries (namely the Ministry of Transportation) are located outside of the city of Paris. The National Archives of France are due to relocate to the northern suburbs before 2010.<p>Paris has over 2,400 km of underground passageways  dedicated to the evacuation of Paris&#39; liquid wastes. Most of these even today date from the late 19th century, a result of the combined plans of the <!--del_lnk--> Pr&eacute;fet <!--del_lnk--> Haussmann and the civil engineer <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Belgrand to improve the then very unsanitary conditions in the Capital. Maintained by a round-the-clock service since their construction, only a small percentage of Paris&#39; sewer <i>r&eacute;seau</i> has needed complete renovation. The entire Paris network of sewers and collectors has been managed since the late 20th century by a computerised network system, known under the acronym &quot;G.A.AS.PAR&quot;, that controls all of Paris&#39; water distribution, even the flow of the river Seine through the capital.<p><a id="Districts_and_historical_centres" name="Districts_and_historical_centres"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Districts and historical centres</span></h3>

      <p>These are a few of Paris&#39; major districts.<ul>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es</b> (8<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, right bank) is a <!--del_lnk--> seventeenth century garden-promenade turned avenue connecting the Concorde and Arc de Triomphe. It is one of the many tourist attractions and a major shopping street of Paris. This avenue has been called &quot;la plus belle avenue du monde&quot; (&quot;the most beautiful avenue in the world&quot;).<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Avenue Montaigne</b> (8<sup>th</sup> arrondissement), next to the Champs-Elys&eacute;es, is home to luxury brand labels such as <!--del_lnk--> Chanel, <!--del_lnk--> Louis Vuitton (<!--del_lnk--> LVMH), <!--del_lnk--> Dior and <!--del_lnk--> Givenchy.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Place de la Concorde</b> (8<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, right bank) is at the foot of the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, built as the &quot;Place Louis XV&quot;, site of the infamous <!--del_lnk--> guillotine. The Egyptian obelisk it holds today can be considered Paris&#39;s &quot;oldest monument&quot;. On this place, on the two side of the <i>Rue Royale</i> live two identical stone buildings: the eastern houses the French Naval Ministry, the western the luxurious <!--del_lnk--> H&ocirc;tel de Crillon. Nearby <b><!--del_lnk--> Place Vendome</b> is famous for its fashionable and deluxe hotels (<!--del_lnk--> Hotel Ritz and <!--del_lnk--> H&ocirc;tel de Vend&ocirc;me) and its jewellers. Many famous fashion designers have had their salons in the square.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute;</b> (8<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, right bank) is one of Paris&#39; high-fashion districts, home to labels such as <!--del_lnk--> Herm&egrave;s and <!--del_lnk--> Christian Lacroix.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Op&eacute;ra</b> (9<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, right bank) is the area around the <!--del_lnk--> Op&eacute;ra Garnier is a home to the capital&#39;s densest concentration of both department stores and offices. A few examples are the <!--del_lnk--> Printemps and <!--del_lnk--> Galeries Lafayette <i>grands magasins</i> (department stores), and the Paris headquarters of financial giants such as <!--del_lnk--> Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais and <!--del_lnk--> American Express.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Montmartre</b> (18<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, right bank) is a historic area on the Butte, home to the <!--del_lnk--> Basilica of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur. Montmartre has always had a history with artists and has many studios and caf&eacute;s of many great artists in that area.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Les Halles</b> (1<sup>st</sup> arrondissement, right bank) was formerly Paris&#39; central meat and produce market, since the late 1970s a major shopping centre around an important <!--del_lnk--> metro connection station (the biggest in Europe). The past Les Halles was destroyed in 1971 and replaced by the current day <!--del_lnk--> Forum des Halles.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Le Marais</b> (3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> arrondissements) is a trendy Right Bank district. With large <!--del_lnk--> gay and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> populations it is a very culturally open place.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Place de la Bastille</b> (4<sup>th</sup>, 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> arrondissements, right bank) being one of the most historic districts, being a location of an essential event of not only Paris, but the whole country of France. Because of its historical value the square is often used for political demonstrations, including the massive <!--del_lnk--> anti-CPE demonstration of March 28, 2006.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Quartier Latin</b> (5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> arrondissements, left bank) is a <!--del_lnk--> twelfth century scholastic centre formerly stretching between the Left Bank&#39;s Place Maubert and the <!--del_lnk--> Sorbonne campus.

      <p>Paris&#39; existing inner-city cemeteries were to its outskirts upon their 1804 creation. Many of Paris&#39; churches had their own parish cemeteries, but these by the late 18th century contributed to making living conditions quite unsanitary in an ever-growing Capital. Abolished from 1786, all parish cemeteries were excavated their contents taken to abandoned limestone mines outside the southern gates of then Paris, today the <!--del_lnk--> 14e arrondissement&#39;s place <!--del_lnk--> Denfert-Rochereau. The latter are known today as the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Catacombes.<p>Although Paris today has once again grown to surround all its former extra-muros cemeteries, these have become all-too-rare and much-appreciated oases of quiet, greenery and sculpture in a thriving city.

      <p>Paris in its early history had only the Seine and Bi&egrave;vre rivers for water. Later forms of irrigation were: a first-century Roman aqueduct from southerly Wissous (later left to ruin); sources from the Right bank hills from the late 11th century; from the 15th-century an aqueduct built roughly along the path of the first; finally, from 1809, the <!--del_lnk--> canal de l&#39;Ourcq began providing Paris with water from less polluted rivers away from the Capital. Paris would only have its first constant and plentiful source of drinkable water from the late 19th-century: from 1857, under <!--del_lnk--> Napoleon III&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Pr&eacute;fet <!--del_lnk--> Haussmann, the civil engineer <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Belgrand oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that would bring sources from distant locations to reservoirs built in the highest points of the Capital. The new sources became Paris&#39; principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then dedicated to the cleaning of Paris&#39; streets. This system is still a major part of Paris&#39; modern water supply network.<p>Paris has over 2,400 km of underground passageways  dedicated to the evacuation of Paris&#39; liquid wastes. Most of these even today date from the late 19th century, a result of the combined plans of the <!--del_lnk--> Pr&eacute;fet <!--del_lnk--> Haussmann and the civil engineer <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Belgrand to improve the then very unsanitary conditions in the Capital. Maintained by a round-the-clock service since their construction, only a small percentage of Paris&#39; sewer <i>r&eacute;seau</i> has needed complete renovation. The entire Paris network of sewers and collectors is been managed since the late 20th century by a computerised network system, known under the acronym &quot;G.A.AS.PAR&quot;, that controls all of Paris&#39; water distribution, even the flow of the river Seine through the capital.<p><a id="Demography" name="Demography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demography</span></h2>

      <p>The population of the City of Paris was 2,125,246 at the 1999 <!--del_lnk--> census, lower than the historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921. This decline was because of the relocation of people to the suburbs caused by de-industrialisation, high rent, the <!--del_lnk--> gentrification of many inner quarters and the transformation of living space into offices, although not on the scale seen in some Western cities. These tendencies are generally seen as negative for the city; the current city administration is trying to reverse them with some success, as the population estimate of July 2004 shows a population increase for the first time since 1954 reaching a total of 2,144,700 inhabitants.<p><a id="Density" name="Density"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Density</span></h3>

      <p>French censuses, by law, ask no questions regarding ethnicity or religion, but do gather information concerning country of birth.

At the same census, 4.2% of the Paris metropolitan area&#39;s population were recent immigrants (i.e people who migrated to France between the 1990 and 1999 censuses), in their majority from <!--del_lnk--> mainland China and <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<p>The first wave of international migration to Paris started as early as in 1820 with the arrivals of German peasants fleeing the agricultural crisis in Germany.

      <p>Paris has been a <i><!--del_lnk--> commune</i> (municipality) since <!--del_lnk--> 1834 (and also briefly between <!--del_lnk--> 1790 and <!--del_lnk--> 1795). At the 1790 division of France into communes in the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, and again in 1834, Paris was a city only half its modern size, but in <!--del_lnk--> 1860 it annexed bordering communes, some entirely, to create the new administrative map of twenty <i><!--del_lnk--> municipal arrondissements</i> the city still has today. These municipal subdivisions describe a clockwise spiral outward from its most central <i><!--del_lnk--> Ier arrondissement</i>.<p>Paris as a commune from 1790 became the <i><!--del_lnk--> pr&eacute;fecture</i> (capital) of the <!--del_lnk--> Seine <i><!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;partement</i> that encompassed Paris and a number of neighbouring communes, but this <i>d&eacute;partement</i> was split in <!--del_lnk--> 1968 into four smaller ones: the city of Paris became a <i>d&eacute;partement</i> distinct from suburban communes in retaining the Seine <i>d&eacute;partement</i> &#39;s &quot;75&quot; number (originating from the Seine <i>d&eacute;partement&#39;</i>s position in France&#39;s alphabetical list of <i>d&eacute;partements</i>), while the three new <!--del_lnk--> Hauts-de-Seine, <!--del_lnk--> Seine-Saint-Denis and <!--del_lnk--> Val-de-Marne d&eacute;partements were attributed the numbers 92, 93 and 94 respectively. The result of this division is that today Paris&#39;s limits as a <i>d&eacute;partement</i> are exactly those of its limits as a <i>commune</i>, a situation unique in France.<p><a id="Municipal_offices" name="Municipal_offices"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Municipal offices</span></h3>
      <p>Each of Paris&#39;s 20 arrondissements has a directly-elected council (<i>conseil d&#39;arrondissement</i>), which in turn elects an arrondissement mayor. A selection of members from each arrondissement council form the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Paris (<i>conseil de Paris</i>), which in turn elects the <!--del_lnk--> mayor of Paris.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Mediaeval">mediaeval</a> times Paris was governed by a merchant-elected municipality whose head was the <!--del_lnk--> provost of the merchants: in addition to regulating city commerce, the provost of the merchants was responsible for some civic duties such as the guarding of city walls and the cleanliness of city streets. This role was seconded from the 13th century by the <!--del_lnk--> provost of Paris, a direct representative of the king responsible for law and order in the city and its surrounding <i>pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t&eacute;</i> (county). Many functions from both offices were transferred to the office of the crown-appointed <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant general of police upon its creation in <!--del_lnk--> 1667.<p>Paris&#39; last <i><!--del_lnk--> Pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t des marchands</i> was assassinated the afternoon of the <!--del_lnk--> 14th of July <!--del_lnk--> 1789 uprising that was the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> <!--del_lnk--> Storming of the Bastille. Paris became an official &quot;commune&quot; from the creation of the administrative division on December 14th the same year, and its provisional &quot;Paris commune&quot; revolutionary municipality was replaced with the city&#39;s first municipal constitution and government from October 9, 1790. Through the turmoil of the <!--del_lnk--> 1794 <!--del_lnk--> Thermidorian Reaction, however, it became apparent that revolutionary Paris&#39;s political independence was a threat to any governing power: the office of mayor was abolished the same year, and its municipal council one year later.<p>Although the municipal council was recreated in <!--del_lnk--> 1834, Paris spent most of the 19th and 20th centuries, along with the larger <!--del_lnk--> Seine <i><!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;partement</i> of which it was a centre, under the direct control of the State-appointed <i><!--del_lnk--> pr&eacute;fet</i> of the Seine, in charge of general affairs there; the State-appointed <!--del_lnk--> Prefect of Police was in charge of police in the same jurisdiction. Paris, save for a few brief occasions, would have no mayor until <!--del_lnk--> 1977, and the Paris Prefecture of Police is still under State control today.<p>Despite its double existence as <i>commune</i> and <i>d&eacute;partement</i>, Paris has a unique council to governing both; the Council of Paris, presided by the mayor of Paris, meets either as a municipal council (<i>conseil municipal</i>) or as a departmental council (<i>conseil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>) depending on the issue to be debated.<p>Paris&#39; modern administrative organisation still retains some traces of the former Seine <i>d&eacute;partement</i> jurisdiction. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Prefecture of Police</i> (also directing Paris&#39; fire brigades), for example, has still a jurisdiction extending to Paris&#39; <i>petite couronne</i> of bordering three <i>d&eacute;partements</i> for some operations such as fire protection or rescue operations, and is still directed by France&#39;s national government. Paris has no municipal police force, although it does have its own brigade of traffic wardens.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>As part of a 1961 nation-wide administrative effort to consolidate regional economies, Paris as a <i><!--del_lnk--> d&eacute;partement</i> became the capital of the new District of the Paris Region, transformed into the <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le-de-France <i><!--del_lnk--> r&eacute;gion</i> in 1976, encompassing the Paris <i>d&eacute;partement</i> and its seven closest <i>d&eacute;partements</i>. The regional council members are chosen by direct elections (since 1986). The prefect of the Paris <i>d&eacute;partement</i> (known as the prefect of the Seine <i>d&eacute;partement</i> before 1968) is also prefect of the &Icirc;le-de-France <i>r&eacute;gion</i>, although the office lost a lot of its powers with the creation of the office of mayor of Paris in 1977.<p><a id="Intercommunality" name="Intercommunality"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Intercommunality</span></h3>
      <p>Few of the above changes have taken into account Paris&#39;s existence as an <!--del_lnk--> agglomeration.

A direct result of these unfortunate events were propositions for a more efficient metropolitan structure to cover the city of Paris and some of the suburbs, ranging from a socialist idea of a loose &quot;metropolitan conference&quot; (<i>conf&eacute;rence m&eacute;tropolitaine</i>) to the right-wing idea of a more integrated <i>Grand Paris</i> (&quot;Greater Paris&quot;).<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>

      <p>Paris&#39;s role as a centre of international trade and tourism has brought its transportation system many embellishments over the past centuries, and its development is still progressing at a rapid pace today. Only in the past few decades Paris has become the centre of an autoroute system, high-speed train network and, through its two major airports, a hub of international air travel.<p><a id="Air_travel" name="Air_travel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Air travel</span></h3>
      <p>Paris is served by two principal airports: <!--del_lnk--> Orly Airport, which is south of Paris, and the <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle International Airport in nearby <!--del_lnk--> Roissy-en-France, one of the busiest in Europe. A third and much smaller airport, at the town of <!--del_lnk--> Beauvais, 70 km (45 mi) to the north of the city, is used by charter and low-cost airlines. <!--del_lnk--> Le Bourget airport nowadays only hosts business jets, air trade shows and the aerospace museum.<p><a id="Railway" name="Railway"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Railway</span></h3>
      <p>Paris is a central hub of the national rail network of high-speed (<a href="../../wp/t/TGV.htm" title="TGV">TGV</a>) and normal (<!--del_lnk--> Corail) trains. Six major railway stations, <!--del_lnk--> Gare du Nord, <!--del_lnk--> Gare Montparnasse, <!--del_lnk--> Gare de l&#39;Est, <!--del_lnk--> Gare de Lyon, <!--del_lnk--> Gare d&#39;Austerlitz, and <!--del_lnk--> Gare Saint-Lazare connect this train network to the world famous and highly efficient <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;tro network, with 380 stations connected by 221.6km of rails. Because of the short distance between stations on the M&eacute;tro network, lines were too slow to be extended further in the suburbs as is the case in most other cities. As such, an additional express network, known as the <a href="../../wp/r/RER.htm" title="RER">RER</a>, has been created since the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s to connect more distant parts of the conurbation.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The public transport networks of the Paris region are coordinated by the <!--del_lnk--> Syndicat des transports d&#39;&Icirc;le-de-France  (STIF), formerly <i>Syndicat des transports parisiens</i> (STP). Members of the syndicate include the <!--del_lnk--> RATP, which operates the Parisian and some suburban buses, the M&eacute;tro, and sections of the RER; the <!--del_lnk--> SNCF, which operates the suburban rail lines and the other sections of the RER&nbsp;; and other private operators managing some suburban bus lines.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> M&eacute;tro is one of Paris&#39; most important methods of transportation. The system comprises 16 lines, identified by numbers from 1 to 14, with two minor lines, 3bis and 7bis, numbered thus because they used to be branches of their respective original lines and only later became independent. In October 1998, the new <!--del_lnk--> line 14 was inaugurated after a 70-year hiatus in inagurating fully new m&eacute;tro lines.<p>There are two tangential <!--del_lnk--> tramway lines in the suburbs: Line T1 runs from <!--del_lnk--> Saint-Denis to <!--del_lnk--> Noisy-le-Sec, line T2 runs from <!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense to <!--del_lnk--> Issy. A third line along the southern inner orbital road is currently under construction.<p><a id="Autoroutes" name="Autoroutes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Autoroutes</span></h3>
      <p>The city is also the hub of France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways&nbsp;: the <!--del_lnk--> P&eacute;riph&eacute;rique which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the <!--del_lnk--> A86 autoroute motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the <i><!--del_lnk--> Francilienne</i> motorway, also known as the <!--del_lnk--> A104(north) and N104(south) (and N184), in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2000 kilometres of major roads and highways.

      <p><i>Historical article: <!--del_lnk--> University of Paris</i> Paris <!--del_lnk--> Notre-Dame Cathedral was the first centre of higher education before the creation of the University of Paris. The <i>universitas</i>, a corporation status granting teachers (and their students) the right to rule themselves independently from crown law and taxes, was chartered by King <!--del_lnk--> Philip Augustus in 1200. Many classes then were held in open air. Non-Parisian students and teachers would stay in hostels, or &quot;colleges&quot;, created for the <i>boursiers</i> coming from afar. Already famous by the 13th century, the Universty of Partis had students from all of Europe. Paris&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Rive Gauche <!--del_lnk--> scholastic centre, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Latin Quarter&quot; as classes were taught in Latin then, would eventually regroup around the college created by <!--del_lnk--> Robert de Sorbon from <!--del_lnk--> 1257. The University of Paris in the 19th century had six faculties: law, science, medicine, pharmaceutical studies, literature and theology.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1968 student riots in Paris, in an effort to disperse the centralised student body, resulted in a near total reform of the University of Paris. The following year, the formerly unique University of Paris was split between thirteen autonomous universities (&quot;Paris I&quot; to &quot;Paris XIII&quot;) located throughout the City of Paris and its suburbs. Each of these universities inherited only some of the departments of the old University of Paris, and are not generalist universities. Paris I, II, V and X, inherited the Law School; Paris V inherited the School of Medicine as well; Paris VI and VII inherited the scientific departments; etc.<p>In 1991, four more universities were created in the suburbs of Paris, reaching a total of seventeen public universities for the Paris (<!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le-de-France) <i><!--del_lnk--> r&eacute;gion</i>. These new universities were given names (based on the name of the suburb in which they are located) and not numbers like the previous thirteen: <!--del_lnk--> University of Cergy-Pontoise, <!--del_lnk--> University of &Eacute;vry-Val d&#39;Essonne, <!--del_lnk--> University of Marne-la-Vall&eacute;e and <!--del_lnk--> University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.<p>In Paris there is also the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Centre for International Studies, department of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> University of Westminster, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> The American University of Paris, a private higher-education Institution.<p><a id="Grandes_.C3.A9coles" name="Grandes_.C3.A9coles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Grandes &eacute;coles</span></h3>
      <p>The Paris region hosts France&#39;s highest concentration of <i><!--del_lnk--> grandes &eacute;coles</i>, or prestigious centres of higher specialised education outside the public university structure. Most of the <i>grandes &eacute;coles</i> were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure has remained on rue d&#39;Ulm in the <!--del_lnk--> Ve arrondissement. The Paris area has a high number of engineering schools, led by the prestigious <i><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Polytechnique</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole des Mines</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole des Ponts et Chauss&eacute;es</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;cole Centrale</i>, forming future actors of France&#39;s engineering and industry. Business schools are also many, including world-famous <!--del_lnk--> HEC, <!--del_lnk--> ESSEC, <!--del_lnk--> INSEAD, and <!--del_lnk--> ESCP-EAP European School of Management. Although Paris&#39; former elite administrative school <!--del_lnk--> ENA was relocated to <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg, the famous political science school <!--del_lnk--> Sciences-Po is still located in Paris&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Left bank <!--del_lnk--> VIIe arrondissement.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

It is visible from many parts of the city as are the <!--del_lnk--> Tour Montparnasse skyscraper and the <!--del_lnk--> Basilica of the Sacr&eacute; C&oelig;ur on the <!--del_lnk--> Montmartre hill.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Historical axis is a line of monuments, buildings and thoroughfares that run in a roughly straight line from the city centre westwards: the line of monuments begins with the <!--del_lnk--> Louvre and continues through the <!--del_lnk--> Tuileries Gardens, the <!--del_lnk--> Champs-Elys&eacute;es and the <!--del_lnk--> Arc de Triomphe centred in the <!--del_lnk--> Place de l&#39;&Eacute;toile circus. From the 1960s the line was prolonged even further west to the <!--del_lnk--> La D&eacute;fense business district dominated by square-shaped triumphal <!--del_lnk--> Grande Arche of its own; this district hosts most of the <!--del_lnk--> tallest skyscrapers in the Paris <!--del_lnk--> urban area.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Invalides museum is the burial place for many great French soldiers, including <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Panth&eacute;on church is where many of France&#39;s illustrious men and women are buried.

Another symbol of the Revolution are the two <!--del_lnk--> Statues of Liberty located on the <!--del_lnk--> &Icirc;le des Cygnes on the Seine and in the <!--del_lnk--> Luxembourg Garden. A larger version of the statues was sent as a gift from France to the United States in 1886 and now stands in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> harbour.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Palais Garnier built in the later <!--del_lnk--> Second Empire period, houses the Paris Opera and the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Opera Ballet, while the former palace of the <!--del_lnk--> Louvre now houses one of the most famous museums in the world. The <!--del_lnk--> Sorbonne is the most famous part of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Paris and is based in the centre of the <!--del_lnk--> Latin Quarter. Apart from Notre Dame de Paris, there are several other ecclesiastical masterpieces including the Gothic <!--del_lnk--> thirteenth century <!--del_lnk--> Sainte-Chapelle palace chapel and the <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;glise de la Madeleine.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Louvre is one of the largest and most famous museums, housing many works of art, including the <i><a href="../../wp/m/Mona_Lisa.htm" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a></i> (<i>La Joconde</i>) and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Venus de Milo</i> statue. Works by <a href="../../wp/p/Pablo_Picasso.htm" title="Pablo Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Auguste_Rodin.htm" title="Rodin">Rodin</a> are found in <!--del_lnk--> Mus&eacute;e Picasso and <!--del_lnk--> Mus&eacute;e Rodin respectively, while the <!--del_lnk--> artistic community of Montparnasse is chronicled at the <!--del_lnk--> Mus&eacute;e du Montparnasse.

      <p><b>Opera</b><br /> Paris&#39; largest Opera houses are the 19th-century <!--del_lnk--> Op&eacute;ra Garnier and modern <!--del_lnk--> Opera Bastille; the former tends towards the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.<p><b>Theatre/Concert halls</b><br /> Theatre traditionally has had a large place in Parisian culture. This still holds true today, although, perhaps strangely, many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. A few of Paris&#39; major theatres are <!--del_lnk--> Bobino, <!--del_lnk--> Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Mogador and the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Ga&icirc;t&eacute;-Montparnasse</i>. Some Parisian theatres also doubled as concert halls.<p>Many of France&#39;s greatest musical legends such as <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;dith Piaf, <!--del_lnk--> Maurice Chevalier, <!--del_lnk--> Georges Brassens and <!--del_lnk--> Charles Aznavour found their fame in Paris concert halls: legendary yet still-showing examples of these are <!--del_lnk--> Bobino, <!--del_lnk--> l&#39;Olympia, <!--del_lnk--> la Cigale and <!--del_lnk--> le Splendid.<p>The below-mentioned <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;lys&eacute;es-Montmartre, much reduced from its original size, is a concert hall today. The <!--del_lnk--> New Morning is one of few Parisian clubs still holding jazz concerts, but the same also specialises in &#39;Indy&#39; music. More recently, the <!--del_lnk--> Zenith hall in Paris&#39; <!--del_lnk--> La Villette quarter and a &quot;<i>parc-omnisports</i>&quot; stadium in <!--del_lnk--> Bercy serve as large-scale rock concert halls.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><b>Dancehalls/Discotheques</b><br /><i>Guinguettes</i> and <i>Bals-concerts</i> were the backbone of Parisian entertainment before the mid-20th century. Early to mid-19th century examples were the <i>Moulin de la Galette</i> guinguette and the <i>&Eacute;lys&eacute;es-Montmartre</i> and <i>Chateau-Rouge</i> dancehalls-gardens. Popular orchestral fare gave way to the Parisian accordionists of lore whose music moved the <i>Apollo</i> and <i>le Java</i> faubourg du Temple and <!--del_lnk--> Belleville dance-hall crowds. Out of the clubs remaining from this era grew the modern <i>discoth&egrave;que</i>: <!--del_lnk--> Le Palace, although closed today, is Paris&#39; most legendary example. Today, much of the clubbing in Paris happens in clubs like Le Queen, L&#39;Etoile, Le Cab which are highly selective. Electronic music oriented clubs such as Le Rex, the Batofar (a boat converted into a club) or The Pulp are quite popular and the world&#39;s best DJs play there.<p><b>Cinema</b><br /> Parisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world&#39;s global cities, that is to say with a dominance of Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (<i>r&eacute;alisateurs</i>) such as <!--del_lnk--> Claude Lelouch, <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Luc Godard, <!--del_lnk--> Claude Chabrol and <!--del_lnk--> Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director <!--del_lnk--> Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated. A specialty of Paris is its very large network of small movie theaters: on a given week the movie fan has the choice between around 300 old or new movies from all over the world.<p>Many of Paris&#39; concert/dance halls were transformed into movie theatres when the media became popular from the 1930s. Later most of the largest cinemas were divided into multiple, smaller rooms: Paris&#39; largest cinema today is by far <i><!--del_lnk--> le Grand Rex</i> theatre with 2800 seats, while other cinemas all have less than 1000 seats. There is now a trend toward modern <i>complexes</i> with more than 10 or 20 screens in the same building.<p><a id="Caf.C3.A9s.2C_restaurants_and_hotels" name="Caf.C3.A9s.2C_restaurants_and_hotels"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caf&eacute;s, restaurants and hotels</span></h3>

      <p>Caf&eacute;s quickly became an integral part of French culture from their appearance, namely from the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> left bank <!--del_lnk--> Caf&eacute; Procope in 1689 and the <i>caf&eacute; R&eacute;gence</i> at the <!--del_lnk--> Palais-Royale one year earlier. The caf&eacute;s in the gardens of the latter locale became a quite popular through the 18th-century, and can be considered Paris&#39; first &quot;terrace caf&eacute;s&quot;; these would not become widespread until sidewalks and boulevards began to appear from the mid-19th century. Caf&eacute;s are an almost obligatory stop on the way to or from work for many Parisians, and especially during lunchtime.<p>Paris&#39; culinary reputation has its base in the many origins of its inhabitants. With the early-19th-century railways and ensuing industrial revolution came a flood of migration that brought with it all the gastronomical diversity of France&#39;s many different regions, and maintained through &#39;local speciality&#39; restaurants catering to the tastes of people from all. &quot;Chez Jenny&quot; is a typical example of a restaurant specialising in the <i>cuisine</i> of the <!--del_lnk--> Alsace region, and &quot;Aux Lyonnais&quot; is another with a traditional fare originating from its city name&#39;s region. Of course migration from even more distant climes meant an even greater culinary diversity, and today, in addition to a great number of North African and Asian establishments, in Paris one can find top-quality cuisine from virtually the world over.<p>Hotels were another result of widespread travel and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, especially Paris&#39; late-19th century <!--del_lnk--> Expositions Universelles (World&#39;s Fairs). Of the most luxurious of these, the <!--del_lnk--> H&ocirc;tel Ritz appeared in the <!--del_lnk--> Place Vend&ocirc;me from 1898, and the <!--del_lnk--> H&ocirc;tel de Crillon opened its doors to the north of the <!--del_lnk--> place de la Concorde from 1909.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h3>

      <p>Paris had always been a destination for traders, students and those on religious pilgrimages, but its &#39;tourism&#39; in the proper sense of the term began on a large scale only with the appearance of rail travel, namely from state organisation of France&#39;s rail network from 1848. One of Paris&#39; first &#39;mass&#39; attractions drawing international interest were, from 1855, the above-mentioned <!--del_lnk--> Expositions Universelles that would bring Paris many new monuments, namely the <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel tower from 1889. These, in addition to the Capital&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 2nd Empire embellishments, did much to make the city itself the attraction it is today.<p>Paris&#39; museums and monuments are by far its highest-esteemed attractions, and tourist interest has been nothing but a benefit to these; tourism has even motivated both city and State to create new ones. The city&#39;s most prized museum, the <!--del_lnk--> Louvre, sees over 6 million visitors a year. Paris&#39; cathedrals are another main attraction: its <!--del_lnk--> Notre-Dame cathedral and <!--del_lnk--> Sacr&eacute;-Coeur basilica receive 12 million and 8 million visitors respectively. The <!--del_lnk--> Eiffel tower, by far Paris&#39; most famous monument, averages over 6 million visitors per year. <!--del_lnk--> Disneyland Resort Paris is a major tourist attraction not only for visitors to Paris, but to Europe as well, with 12.4 million visitors in <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p>Many of Paris&#39; once-popular local establishments have metamorphised into a parody of French culture, in a form catering to the tastes and expectations of tourist capital. The <!--del_lnk--> Moulin Rouge cabaret-dancehall, for example, is a staged dinner theatre spectacle, a dance display that was once but one aspect of the cabaret&#39;s former atmosphere. All of the establishment&#39;s former social or cultural elements, such as its ballrooms and gardens, are gone today. Much of Paris&#39; hotel, restaurant and night entertainment trades have become heavily dependent on tourism, with results not always positive for Parisian culture.<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h3>
