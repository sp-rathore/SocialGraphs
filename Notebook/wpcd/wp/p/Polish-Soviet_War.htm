      <p>The <b>Polish-Soviet War</b> (February 1919 &ndash; March 1921) was an armed conflict between <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Russia and the <!--del_lnk--> Second Polish Republic, two nascent states in post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The war was a result of conflicting expansionist attempts. Poland, whose statehood had just been re-established following the <!--del_lnk--> Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, sought to secure territories which she had lost at the time of partitions and earlier; the Soviets aimed to control the same territories, which had been part of <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia until the turbulent events of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">Great War</a>. Both states claimed victory in the war: the Poles claimed a successful defense of their state, while the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish <!--del_lnk--> eastward invasion of Ukraine and Belarus, which they viewed as a part of <!--del_lnk--> foreign intervention in the Russian Civil War.<p>The frontiers between Poland and Soviet Russia had not been defined in the <a href="../../wp/t/Treaty_of_Versailles.htm" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> and post-war events created turmoil: the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>; the crumbling of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian, <!--del_lnk--> German and <!--del_lnk--> Austrian empires; the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Civil War; the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers&#39; withdrawal from the <!--del_lnk--> eastern front; and the attempts of <!--del_lnk--> Ukraine and <!--del_lnk--> Belarus to establish their independence. Poland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Chief of State, <a href="../../wp/j/J%25C3%25B3zef_Pi%25C5%2582sudski.htm" title="J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski">J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski</a>, felt the time expedient to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by the creation of a Polish-led federation (<!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze) of several states in the rest of East-Central Europe as a bulwark against the potential re-emergence of both German and Russian <!--del_lnk--> imperialism. <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Lenin</a>, meanwhile, saw Poland as the bridge that the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army would have to cross in order to assist <!--del_lnk--> other communist movements and help conduct other European revolutions.<p>By 1919, the Polish forces had taken control of much of Western Ukraine, with victory in the <!--del_lnk--> Polish-Ukrainian War; the <!--del_lnk--> West Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic had tried unsuccessfully to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and the Ukrainians laid claim. At the same time, the Bolsheviks began to gain the upper hand in the Russian Civil War and advance westward towards the disputed territories. By the end of 1919 a clear front had formed. Border skirmishes escalated into open warfare following Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> major incursion further east into Ukraine in April 1920. He was met by a nearly simultaneous and initially very successful Red Army <!--del_lnk--> counterattack. The Soviet operation threw the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. Meanwhile, western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers <!--del_lnk--> increased the interest of Western powers in the war. In midsummer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August the tide had turned again as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a>. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a <!--del_lnk--> ceasefire in October 1920. A formal <!--del_lnk--> peace treaty, the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Riga, was signed on <!--del_lnk--> 18 March <!--del_lnk--> 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet-Polish border for the <!--del_lnk--> period between the World Wars.<p>

      <p>The war is referred to by several names. &quot;Polish-Soviet War&quot; may be the most common, but is potentially confusing since &quot;Soviet&quot; is usually thought of as relating to the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>, which (by contrast with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Soviet Russia&quot;) did not officially come into being until December 1922. Alternative names include &quot;Russo-Polish War [or Polish-Russian War] of 1919&ndash;20/21&quot; (to distinguish it from earlier Polish-Russian wars) and &quot;Polish-Bolshevik War&quot;. This second term (or just &quot;Bolshevik War&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> Polish: <i>Wojna bolszewicka</i>)) is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred as the &quot;War of 1920&quot; (Polish: <i>Wojna 1920 roku</i>).<p>Other points of contention are the starting and ending dates of the war. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Encyclopedia Britannica begins its article with the date (1919-1920), but then says &quot;Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J&oacute;zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (April 21, 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on May 7.&quot; while the Polish <!--del_lnk--> Internetowa encyklopedia PWN as well as some historians&mdash;like <!--del_lnk--> Norman Davies&mdash;consider 1919 as the starting year of the war. The ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the <!--del_lnk--> ceasefire was put in force in fall 1920, the <!--del_lnk--> official treaty ending the war was signed months later, in 1921.<p>While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict and only in early 1920 did both sides realize that they were in fact engaged in an all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1919 are closely related to the war that began in earnest a year later. In the end, the events of 1920 were only a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<p><a id="Prelude" name="Prelude"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Prelude</span></h2>

       <br /> In the <!--del_lnk--> aftermath of World War I, the map of <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe had drastically changed. Germany&#39;s defeat rendered its plans for the creation of Eastern European <!--del_lnk--> puppet states (<!--del_lnk--> Mitteleuropa) obsolete, and Russia saw its Empire collapse followed by a descent into <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Revolution</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Civil War. Many nations of the region saw a chance for real independence and were not prepared to relinquish the opportunity; Russia viewed these territories as rebellious Russian provinces, vital for Russian security, but was unable to react swiftly.<p>With the success of the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Poland Uprising in 1918, Poland had re-established its <!--del_lnk--> statehood for the first time since the <!--del_lnk--> 1795 partition and seen the end of a 123 years of rule by three imperial neighbors: <!--del_lnk--> Russia, <!--del_lnk--> Germany, and <!--del_lnk--> Austria-Hungary. The country, reborn as a <!--del_lnk--> Second Polish Republic, proceeded to carve out its borders from the territories of its former partitioners.<p>Poland was not alone in its newfound opportunities and troubles. Virtually all of the newly independent neighbours began fighting over borders: <!--del_lnk--> Romania fought with <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> over <!--del_lnk--> Transylvania, <!--del_lnk--> Yugoslavia with <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> over <!--del_lnk--> Rijeka, Poland with <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovakia over <!--del_lnk--> Cieszyn/T&#x11B;&scaron;&iacute;n, with Germany over <!--del_lnk--> Pozna&#x144; and <!--del_lnk--> with Ukrainians over <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Galicia. <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainians, Belarusians, <!--del_lnk--> Lithuanians, <!--del_lnk--> Estonians and <!--del_lnk--> Latvians fought against themselves and against the Russians, who were just as divided. Spreading communist influences resulted in communist revolutions in <a href="../../wp/m/Munich.htm" title="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Budapest.htm" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Pre&scaron;ov. <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> commented: &quot;The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin.&quot; All of those engagements &ndash; with the sole exception of the Polish-Soviet war &ndash; would be shortlived border conflicts.<p>The Polish-Soviet war likely happened more by accident than design, as it is unlikely that anyone in Soviet Russia or in the new Second Republic of Poland would have deliberately planned a major foreign war. Poland, its territory a major frontline of the First World War, was unstable politically; it had just won the difficult conflict with the West Ukrainian National Republic and was already engaged in new conflicts with Germany (the <!--del_lnk--> Silesian Uprisings) and <!--del_lnk--> with Czechoslovakia. The attention of revolutionary Russia, meanwhile, was predominantly directed at thwarting counter-revolution and <!--del_lnk--> intervention by the western powers. While the first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in February 1919, it would be almost a year before both sides realised that they were engaged in a full war.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In late 1919 the leader of Russia&#39;s new <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">communist</a> government, <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, was inspired by the Red Army&#39;s civil-war victories over <!--del_lnk--> White Russian anti-communist forces and their western allies, and began to see the future of the revolution with greater optimism. The Bolsheviks proclaimed the need for the <!--del_lnk--> dictatorship of the proletariat, and agitated for a worldwide communist community. Their avowed intent was to link the revolution in Russia with an expected <!--del_lnk--> revolution in Germany and to assist other communist movements in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe; Poland was the geographical bridge that the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army would have to cross in order to do so. The Bolshevik government claimed to support the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> self-determination&quot; of all the non-Russian peoples of the former Russian Empire, but this meant self-determination by workers and peasants led by native communists sent in from Moscow. Lenin&rsquo;s goal was to infiltrate the borderlands, set up communist governments there as well as in Poland, and reach Germany where he expected a socialist revolution to break out. He believed that Soviet Russia could not survive without the support of a socialist Germany. By the end of summer 1919 the Soviets managed to take over most of Ukraine, driving the Ukrainian government from Kiev. In early 1919, they also set up a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Lithuanian-Belorussian Republic&quot; (Litbel), with its government in <!--del_lnk--> Vilnius, run by native communists sent by Moscow and supported by Red Army units. This government was very unpopular due to terror and the confiscation of food and goods for the army. It was not until the Soviet victories in the first half of 1920, however, that some of the Soviet leaders would see the war as the real opportunity to spread the revolution westwards.<p>Before the start of the Polish-Soviet War Polish politics were strongly influenced by Chief of State (<i><!--del_lnk--> naczelnik pa&#x144;stwa</i>) J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski. Pi&#x142;sudski wanted <!--del_lnk--> to break the Russian Empire and create a Polish-led &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze Federation&quot; of independent states comprised of Poland, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and other <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> East European countries emerging out of crumbling empires after the First World War. This new union was to become a counterweight to any potential <!--del_lnk--> imperialist intentions on the part of Russia or Germany. Pi&#x142;sudski argued that &quot;There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine&quot;, but he may have been more interested in Ukraine being split from Russia than in Ukrainians&#39; welfare. He did not hesitate to use military force to <!--del_lnk--> expand the Polish borders to <!--del_lnk--> Galicia and <!--del_lnk--> Volhynia, crushing a <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in the disputed territories east of the <!--del_lnk--> Western Bug river, which contained a significant Polish minority, mainly in cities like <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w (Lviv), but a Ukrainian majority in the countryside. Speaking of Poland&#39;s future frontiers, Pi&#x142;sudski said: &quot;All that we can gain in the west depends on the <!--del_lnk--> Entente&mdash;on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany,&quot; while in the east &quot;there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far.&quot; In the chaos to the east the Polish forces set out to expand there as much as it was feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no intention of joining the western intervention in the Russian Civil War or of conquering Russia itself.<br clear="all" />

      <p>In 1918 the German Army in the east, under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Max Hoffmann, began to retreat westwards. The territories abandoned by the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and <!--del_lnk--> Bulgaria) became a field of conflict among local governments created by Germany, other local governments that independently sprang up after the German retreat, and the Bolsheviks, who hoped to incorporate those areas into Soviet Russia. As a result, almost all of Eastern Europe was in chaos.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1918, the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Supreme Command issued orders to the <!--del_lnk--> Western Army of the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army to begin a <!--del_lnk--> westward movement that would follow the withdrawing German troops of Oberkommando Ostfront (<!--del_lnk--> Ober-Ost). The basic aim was to secure as much territory as possible with the few resources locally available.<p>At the start of 1919, Polish-Soviet fighting broke out almost by accident and without any orders from the respective governments when self-organized Polish military units in <!--del_lnk--> Vilnius (Wilno) clashed with Bolshevik forces of <!--del_lnk--> Litbel, each trying to secure the territories for its own incipient government. Eventually the more organized Soviet forces quelled most of the resistance and drove the remaining Polish forces west. On <!--del_lnk--> January 5, 1919, the Red Army entered <!--del_lnk--> Minsk almost unopposed, thus putting an end to the short-lived <!--del_lnk--> Belarusian People&#39;s Republic. At the same time, more and more Polish self-defense units sprang up across western Belarus and Lithuania (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence). and engaged in a series of local skirmishes with pro-Bolshevik groups operating in the area. The newly organized <!--del_lnk--> Polish Army began sending the first of their units east to assist the self-defense forces, while the Russians sent their own units west.<p>In the spring of 1919, Soviet conscription produced a Red Army of 2,300,000. Few of these were sent west that year, as the majority of Red Army forces were engaged against the Russian <!--del_lnk--> White movement; the Western Army in February 1919 had just 46,000 men. In February 1919, the entire Polish army numbered 110,000 men, while by September 1919, it had 540,000 men; 230,000 of these were on the Soviet <!--del_lnk--> front.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> 14 February, the Poles, who had been advancing eastwards, secured positions along the line of <!--del_lnk--> Kobryn, <!--del_lnk--> Pruzhany, and the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Zalewianka and <!--del_lnk--> Neman. Around <!--del_lnk--> 14 February, at <!--del_lnk--> Mosty, the first organised Polish units made contact with the advance units of the Red Army. Bolshevik units withdrew without a shot. A frontline slowly began to form from Lithuania, through Belarus to Ukraine.<p><a id="First_Polish-Soviet_conflicts" name="First_Polish-Soviet_conflicts"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">First Polish-Soviet conflicts</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> first serious armed conflict of the war took place around <!--del_lnk--> February 14 - <!--del_lnk--> February 16, near the towns of Maniewicze and Biaroza in Belarus. By late February <!--del_lnk--> the Soviet advance had come to a halt. Both Polish and Soviet forces had also been <!--del_lnk--> engaging the Ukrainian forces, and unrest was growing in the territories of the Baltic countries (cf. <!--del_lnk--> Estonian Liberation War, <!--del_lnk--> Latvian War of Liberation, <!--del_lnk--> Freedom wars of Lithuania).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In early March 1919, Polish units started an offensive, crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Neman River, taking <!--del_lnk--> Pinsk, and reaching the outskirts of <!--del_lnk--> Lida. Both the Russian and Polish advances began around the same time in April (Polish forces started a major offensive on April 16), resulting in increasing numbers of troops arriving in the area. That month the Bolsheviks captured <!--del_lnk--> Grodno, but soon were pushed out by a Polish counteroffensive. Unable to accomplish their objectives and facing strengthening offensives from the White forces, the Red Army withdrew from their positions and reorganized. Soon the Polish-Soviet War would begin in earnest.<p>Polish forces continued a steady eastern advance. They took <!--del_lnk--> Lida on April 17 and <!--del_lnk--> Nowogr&oacute;dek on April 18, and recaptured Vilnius on April 19, driving the <!--del_lnk--> Litbel government from their proclaimed capital. On August 8, Polish forces took <!--del_lnk--> Minsk and on the 28th of that month they deployed <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tanks</a> for the first time. After heavy fighting, the town of <!--del_lnk--> Babruysk near the <!--del_lnk--> Berezina River was captured. By October 2, Polish forces reached the <!--del_lnk--> Daugava river and secured the region from <!--del_lnk--> Desna to <!--del_lnk--> Daugavpils (Dyneburg).<p>Polish success continued until early 1920. Sporadic battles erupted between Polish forces and the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army, but the latter was preoccupied with the White counter-revolutionary forces and was steadily retreating on the entire western frontline, from <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> in the north to Ukraine in the south. In early summer 1919, the White movement had gained the initiative, and its forces under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Anton Denikin were marching on <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. Pi&#x142;sudski viewed the Bolsheviks as a lesser threat to Poland than their contenders, as the White Russians were not willing to accept Poland&#39;s independence, while the Bolsheviks did proclaim the <!--del_lnk--> Partitions of Poland null and void. By his refusal to join the attack on Lenin&#39;s struggling government, ignoring the strong pressure from the <!--del_lnk--> Entente, Pi&#x142;sudski had likely saved the Bolshevik government in Summer&ndash;Fall 1919. He later wrote that in case of a White victory, in the east Poland could only gain the &quot;ethnic border&quot; at best (the <!--del_lnk--> Curzon line). At the same time Lenin offered Poles the territories of <!--del_lnk--> Minsk, <!--del_lnk--> Zhytomyr, <!--del_lnk--> Khmelnytskyi, in what was described as mini &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Brest&quot;; Polish military leader <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Sosnkowski wrote that the territorial proposals of the Bolsheviks were much better than what the Poles had wanted to achieve.<p><a id="Diplomatic_Front.2C_Part_1:_The_alliances" name="Diplomatic_Front.2C_Part_1:_The_alliances"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Diplomatic Front, Part 1: The alliances</span></h4>

      <p>In 1919, several unsuccessful attempts at peace negotiations were made by various Polish and Russian factions. In the meantime, Polish-Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it hard to accept the Lithuanians&#39; demands for independence and territories, especially on ceding the city of <!--del_lnk--> Vilnius (Wilno), Lithuania&#39;s historical capital which had a Polish ethnic majority. Polish negotiators made better progress with the <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvian</a> Provisional Government, and in late 1919 and early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting <!--del_lnk--> joint operations against Russia.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Warsaw Treaty, an agreement with the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader <!--del_lnk--> Symon Petlura signed on <!--del_lnk--> April 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1920, was the main Polish diplomatic success. Petlura, who formally represented the government of the <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic (by then <i>de facto</i> defeated by Bolsheviks), along with some Ukrainian forces, fled to Poland, where he found <!--del_lnk--> asylum. His control extended only to a sliver of land near the Polish border. In such conditions, there was little difficulty convincing Petlura to join an alliance with Poland, despite recent conflict between the two nations that had been settled in favour of Poland. By concluding an agreement with Pi&#x142;sudski, Petlura accepted the Polish territorial gains in Western Ukraine and the future Polish-Ukrainian border along the <!--del_lnk--> Zbruch River. In exchange, he was promised Polish military assistance in reinstalling his government in Kiev. Following the formal restoration of Ukrainian independence, the Ukrainian republic was supposed to subordinate its military and economy to Warsaw through joining the Polish-led &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze&quot; federation of East-Central European states, as Pi&#x142;sudski wanted Ukraine to be a buffer between Poland and Russia rather than allowing Russian domination up to the Polish border. A separate provision in the treaty prohibited both sides from concluding any international agreements against each other. Ethnic Poles within the Ukrainian border, and ethnic Ukrainians within the Polish border, were guaranteed the same rights within their states. Unlike their Russian counterparts, whose lands were to be distributed among the peasants, Polish landlords in Ukraine were accorded special treatment.<p>For Pi&#x142;sudski, this alliance gave his campaign for the Mi&#x119;dzymorze federation the legitimacy of joint international effort, secured part of the Polish eastward border, and laid a foundation for a Polish dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland. For Petlura, this was another chance to preserve the statehood and, at least, the theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, even while accepting the loss of Western Ukrainian lands to Poland.<p>Yet both of them were opposed at home. Pi&#x142;sudski faced stiff opposition from Dmowski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> National Democrats who opposed Ukrainian independence. <!--del_lnk--> Mykhailo Hrushevsky, the highly respected first president of the <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic, also condemned the alliance with Poland and Petlura&#39;s claim to have acted on the behalf of the UPR. In general, many Ukrainians viewed a union with Poles with great suspicion, especially in the view of <!--del_lnk--> historically difficult relationships between the nations, and the alliance received an especially dire reception from Galicia Ukrainians who viewed it as their betrayal; their attempted state, the <!--del_lnk--> West Ukrainian People&#39;s Republic, had been defeated by July 1919 and was now to be incorporated into Poland. The Western Ukrainian political leader, <!--del_lnk--> Yevhen Petrushevych, who expressed fierce opposition to the alliance, left for exile in Vienna. The remainder of the <!--del_lnk--> Ukrainian Galician Army, the Western Ukrainian state&#39;s defence force, still counted 5,000 able fighters though devastated by a <!--del_lnk--> typhoid epidemic, and joined the Reds on <!--del_lnk--> 2 February, 1920 as the transformed <i>Red Ukrainian Galician Army</i>. Later, the Galician forces would turn against the Reds and join Petliura&#39;s forces when sent against them, resulting in mass arrests and disbandment of the Red Galician Army. The alliance with Petliura resulted in 15,000 allied Ukrainian troops at the beginning of the campaign, increasing to 35,000 through recruitment and desertion from the Soviet side.<p><a name="1920"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1920</span></h3>

      <p>By early 1920, the Soviet forces had been very successful against the <!--del_lnk--> White armies. They defeated <!--del_lnk--> Denikin and signed peace treaties with Latvia and Estonia. The Polish front became their most important war theatre and the majority of Soviet resources and forces were diverted to it. In January 1920, the Red Army began concentrating a 700,000-strong force near the <!--del_lnk--> Berezina River and on Belarus. In the course of 1920, almost 800,000 Red Army personnel were sent to fight in the Polish war, of whom 402,000 went to the Western front and 355,000 to the armies of the South-West front in <!--del_lnk--> Galicia. The Soviets had many military depots at their disposal, left by withdrawing German armies in 1918-19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War. Still, they suffered a shortage of arms; both the Red Army and the Polish forces were grossly underequipped by the Western standards.<p>Bolshevik commanders in the Red Army&#39;s coming offensive would include <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Tukhachevsky (new commander of the Western Front), <a href="../../wp/l/Leon_Trotsky.htm" title="Leon Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, the future Soviet ruler <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, and the future founder of the <!--del_lnk--> Cheka secret police, <!--del_lnk--> Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky.<p>The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had formerly served in the various partitioning empires, supported by some international volunteers, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ko&#x15B;ciuszko Squadron. <!--del_lnk--> Boris Savinkov was at the head of an army of 20,000 to 30,000 largely Russian POWs, and was accompanied by <!--del_lnk--> Dmitry Merezhkovsky and <!--del_lnk--> Zinaida Gippius. The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 in 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920.<p><a href="../../wp/l/Logistics.htm" title="Logistics">Logistics</a> were very bad, supported by whatever equipment was left over from World War I or could be captured. The Polish Army employed guns made in five countries, and <!--del_lnk--> rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition.<p>The Soviet High Command planned a new offensive in late April/May. Since March 1919, Polish intelligence was aware that the Soviets had prepared for a new offensive and the Polish High Command decided to launch their own offensive before their opponents. The plan for <!--del_lnk--> Operation Kiev was to beat the Red Army on Poland&#39;s southern flank and install a Polish-friendly Petlura government in Ukraine.<p><a id="The_tide_turns:_Operation_Kiev" name="The_tide_turns:_Operation_Kiev"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The tide turns: Operation Kiev</span></h4>

       <br /> Until April, the Polish forces had been slowly but steadily advancing eastward. The new <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvian</a> government requested and obtained Polish help in capturing <!--del_lnk--> Daugavpils. The city <!--del_lnk--> fell after heavy fighting in January and was handed over to the Latvians, who viewed the Poles as liberators. By March, Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Byelorussia) and south (Ukraine).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 24, Poland began its main offensive, <!--del_lnk--> Operation Kiev. Its goal was the creation of independent Ukraine that would become part of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s project of a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze&quot; Federation.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 26, in his &quot;Call to the People of Ukraine&quot;, Pi&#x142;sudski assured that &quot;the Polish army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory&quot;. Despite this, many Ukrainians were just as anti-Polish as anti-Bolshevik, and resented the Polish advance, which many viewed as just a new variety of occupation considering previous defeat in the <!--del_lnk--> Polish-Ukrainian War. Thus, Ukrainians also actively fought the Polish invasion in Ukrainian formations of the <!--del_lnk--> Red Army. Some scholars stress the effects of <!--del_lnk--> Soviet propaganda in encouraging negative Ukrainian sentiment towards the Polish operation and Polish-Ukrainian history in general.<p>The Polish 3rd Army easily won border clashes with the Red Army in Ukraine but the Reds withdrew with minimal losses. The combined Polish-Ukrainian forces entered an abandoned <a href="../../wp/k/Kiev.htm" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 7, encountering only token resistance.<p>The Polish military thrust was met with <!--del_lnk--> Red Army <!--del_lnk--> counterattacks on <!--del_lnk--> 29 May. Polish forces in the area, preparing for an offensive towards <!--del_lnk--> &#x17D;lobin, managed to push the Soviets back, but were unable to start their own planned offensive. In the north, Polish forces had fared much worse. The Polish 1st Army was defeated and forced to retreat, pursued by the Russian 15th Army which recaptured territories between the <!--del_lnk--> Western Dvina and <!--del_lnk--> Berezina rivers. Polish forces attempted to take advantage of the exposed flanks of the attackers but the enveloping forces failed to stop the Soviet advance. At the end of May, the front had stabilised near the small river <!--del_lnk--> Auta, and Soviet forces began preparing for the next push.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 24 1920, the Polish forces in the south were engaged for the first time by <!--del_lnk--> Semyon Budionny&#39;s famous <!--del_lnk--> 1st Cavalry Army (<i>Konarmia</i>). Repeated attacks by Budionny&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Cossack cavalry broke the Polish-Ukrainian front on <!--del_lnk--> June 5. The Soviets then deployed mobile cavalry units to disrupt the Polish rearguard, targeting communications and logistics. By <!--del_lnk--> June 10, Polish armies were in retreat along the entire front. On <!--del_lnk--> June 13, the Polish army, along with the Petlura&#39;s Ukrainian troops, abandoned Kiev to the Red Army.<p><a id="String_of_Soviet_victories" name="String_of_Soviet_victories"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">String of Soviet victories</span></h4>

      <p>The commander of the Polish 3rd Army in Ukraine, General <!--del_lnk--> Edward Rydz-&#x15A;mig&#x142;y, decided to break through the Soviet line toward the northwest. Polish forces in Ukraine managed to withdraw relatively unscathed, but were unable to support the northern front and reinforce the defenses at the <!--del_lnk--> Auta River for the decisive battle that was soon to take place there.<p>Due to insufficient forces, Poland&#39;s 200-mile-long front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops backed by some 460 artillery pieces with no strategic reserves. This approach to holding ground harked back to <!--del_lnk--> Great War practice of &quot;establishing a fortified line of defense&quot;. It had shown some merit on a Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland&#39;s eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.<p>Against the Polish line the Red Army gathered their Northwest Front led by the young General <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Tukhachevski. Their numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns. The Russians at some crucial places outnumbered the Poles four-to-one.<p>Tukhachevski launched his offensive on <!--del_lnk--> July 4, along the <!--del_lnk--> Smolensk-<!--del_lnk--> Brest-Litovsk axis, crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Auta and <!--del_lnk--> Berezina rivers. The northern 3rd Cavalry Corps, led by <!--del_lnk--> Gayk Bzhishkyan (Gay Dmitrievich Gay, Gaj-Chan), were to envelope Polish forces from the north, moving near the Lithuanian and Prussian border (both of these belonging to nations hostile to Poland). The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push decisively west, supported from the south by the 16th Army and Grupa Mozyrska. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but the Russians&#39; numerical superiority proved decisive and by <!--del_lnk--> July 7 Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defense by Polish units, Tukhachevsky&#39;s plan to break through the front and push the defenders southwest into the <!--del_lnk--> Pinsk Marshes failed.<p>Polish resistance was offered again on a line of &quot;German trenches&quot;, a heavily fortified line of World War I field fortifications that presented a unique opportunity to stem the Russian offensive. However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces selected a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gej-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Wilno on <!--del_lnk--> 14 July, forcing the Poles to retreat again. In <!--del_lnk--> Galicia to the south, General <!--del_lnk--> Semyon Budyonny&#39;s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing <!--del_lnk--> Brodno and approaching <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w and <!--del_lnk--> Zamo&#x15B;&#x107;. In early July, it became clear to the Poles that the Russians&#39; objectives were not limited to pushing their borders westwards. Poland&#39;s very independence was at stake.<p>Russian forces moved forward at the remarkable rate of 20 miles a day. <!--del_lnk--> Grodno in Belarus fell on <!--del_lnk--> 19 July; Brest-Litovsk fell on <!--del_lnk--> 1 August. The Polish attempted to defend the <!--del_lnk--> Bug River line with 4th Army and Grupa Poleska units, but were able to stop the Red Army advance for only one week. After crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Narew River on <!--del_lnk--> 2 August, the Russian Northwest Front was only 60 miles from Warsaw. The <!--del_lnk--> Brest-Litovsk fortress which was to be the headquarters of the planned Polish counteroffensive fell to the 16th Army in the first attack. The Russian Southwest Front had pushed Polish forces out of Ukraine and was closing on Zamo&#x15B;&#x107; and <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w, the largest city in southeastern Poland and an important industrial centre, defended by the Polish 6th Army. The way to the Polish capital lay open. Polish Galicia&#39;s Lviv (Lw&oacute;w) was soon <!--del_lnk--> besieged, and five Russian armies approached Warsaw. Polish politicians tried to secure peace with Moscow on any conditions but the Bolsheviks refused.<p>Polish forces in Galicia near Lviv launched a successful counteroffensive to slow the Soviets down which stopped the retreat of Polish forces on the southern front. However, the worsening situation near the Polish capital of Warsaw prevented the Poles from continuing that southern counteroffensive and pushing east. After the Soviets captured <!--del_lnk--> Brest, the Polish offensive in the south was halted and all available forces moved north to take part in the coming battle for Warsaw.<p><a id="Diplomatic_Front.2C_Part_2:_The_political_games" name="Diplomatic_Front.2C_Part_2:_The_political_games"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Diplomatic Front, Part 2: The political games</span></h4>
      <p>With the tide turning against Poland, Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s political power weakened, while his opponents&#39;, including <!--del_lnk--> Roman Dmowski&#39;s, rose. Pi&#x142;sudski did manage to regain his influence, especially over the military, almost at the last possible moment&mdash;as the Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw. The Polish political scene had begun to unravel in panic, with the government of <!--del_lnk--> Leopold Skulski resigning in early June.<p>Meawhile, the Soviet leadership&#39;s confidence soared. It would be the Soviet Union&#39;s first penetration into Europe proper&mdash;the first attempt to export the Bolshevik Revolution by force. In a telegram, Lenin exclaimed: &quot;We must direct all our attention to preparing and strengthening the Western Front. A new slogan must be announced: &#39;Prepare for war against Poland&#39;.&quot; Soviet communist theorist <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Bukharin, writer for the newspaper <!--del_lnk--> Pravda, wished for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw &quot;right up to London and Paris&quot;. General&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Tukhachevsky order of the day, <!--del_lnk--> 2 July, 1920 read: &quot;To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to world-wide conflagration. March on <!--del_lnk--> Vilno, <!--del_lnk--> Minsk, <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>!&quot; and &quot;onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!&quot;<p>By order of the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet Communist Party, a Polish <!--del_lnk--> puppet government, the <!--del_lnk--> Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee (Polish: <i>Tymczasowy Komitet Rewolucyjny Polski</i>, TKRP), had been formed on <!--del_lnk--> 28 July in Bia&#x142;ystok to organise administration of the Polish territories captured by the Red Army. The TKRP had very little support from the Polish population and recruited its supporters mostly from the ranks of <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>.

      <p>Western public opinion was strongly pro-Soviet. Britain&#39;s Prime Minister, <!--del_lnk--> David Lloyd George, who wanted to negotiate a favourable trade agreement with the Bolsheviks pressed Poland to make peace on Soviet terms and refused any assistance to Poland which would alienate the Whites in the Russian Civil War. In July 1920, Britain announced it would send huge quantities of World War I surplus military supplies to Poland, but a threatened general strike by the <!--del_lnk--> Trades Union Congress, who objected to British support of &quot;White Poland&quot;, ensured that none of the weapons destined for Poland left British ports. David Lloyd George had never been enthusiastic about supporting the Poles, and had been pressured by his more right-wing Cabinet members such as <!--del_lnk--> Lord Curzon and <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> into offering the supplies. On the 11 July, 1920, the government of Great Britain issued a <i>de facto</i> <!--del_lnk--> ultimatum to the Soviets. The Soviets were ordered to stop hostilities against Poland and the Russian Army (the White Army in Southern Russia lead by Baron Wrangel), and to accept what later was called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Curzon line&quot; as a temporary border with Poland, until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. In case of Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with all the means available, which, in reality, were limited by the internal political situation in the United Kingdom. On the 17 July, the Bolsheviks refused and made a counter-offer to negotiate a peace treaty directly with Poland. The British responded by threatening to cut off the on-going trade negotiations if the Soviets conducted further offensives against Poland. These threats were ignored.<p>The threatened general strike was a convenient excuse for Lloyd George to back out of his commitments. On <!--del_lnk--> August 6, 1920, the British <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party published a pamphlet stating that British workers would never take part in the war as Poland&#39;s allies, and labour unions blocked supplies to the British expeditionary force assisting Russian Whites in <!--del_lnk--> Arkhangelsk. French Socialists, in their newspaper <i><!--del_lnk--> L&#39;Humanit&eacute;</i>, declared: &quot;Not a man, not a <!--del_lnk--> sou, not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workmen&#39;s International!&quot; Poland also suffered setbacks due to sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies, when workers in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Germany refused to transit such materials to Poland.<p><a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>&#39;s stance was mostly anti-Polish and the country had joined the Soviet side in July 1919. The decision was dictated by a desire to incorporate the city of <!--del_lnk--> Wilno (in Lithuanian, Vilnius) and nearby areas into Lithuania and, to a lesser extent, Soviet diplomatic pressure, backed by the threat of the Red Army stationed on Lithuania&#39;s borders.<p>Polish allies were few. <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, continuing her policy of countering Bolshevism now that the Whites in Russia proper had been almost completely defeated, sent a 400-strong <!--del_lnk--> advisory group to Poland&#39;s aid in 1919. It was mostly comprised of French officers, although it also included <!--del_lnk--> a few British advisers led by Lieutenant General Sir <!--del_lnk--> Adrian Carton De Wiart. The French effort was vital to improving the organization and logistics of the Polish Army, which, until 1919, had used diverse manuals, organizational structures, and equipment mostly drawn from the armies of Poland&#39;s former partitioners. The French officers included a future President of France, <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle; during the war he won Poland&#39;s highest military decoration, the <a href="../../wp/v/Virtuti_Militari.htm" title="Virtuti Militari">Virtuti Militari</a>. In addition to the Allied advisors, France also facilitated the transit to Poland from France of the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Blue Army&quot; in 1919: troops mostly of Polish origin, plus some international volunteers, formerly under French command in World War I. The army was commanded by the Polish general, <!--del_lnk--> J&oacute;zef Haller. <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland&#39;s aid, but the Czechoslovakian government refused to allow them through; some trains with weapon supplies from Hungary did, however, arrive in Poland.<p>In mid-1920, the Allied Mission was expanded by some advisers (becoming the <!--del_lnk--> Interallied Mission to Poland). They included: French diplomat, <!--del_lnk--> Jean Jules Jusserand; <!--del_lnk--> Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente; and British diplomat, Lord <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Vincent D&#39;Abernon. The newest members of the mission achieved little; indeed, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won by the Poles before the mission could return and make its report. Nonetheless for many years, a <a href="../../wp/m/Mythology.htm" title="Mythology">myth</a> persisted that it was the timely arrival of Allied forces that had saved Poland, a myth in which Weygand occupied the central role. Nonetheless Polish-French cooperation would continue. Eventually, on the 21 February, 1921, France and Poland entered into <!--del_lnk--> a formal military alliance, which became an important factor during the subsequent Soviet-Polish negotiations.<p><a id="The_tide_turns:_Miracle_at_the_Vistula" name="The_tide_turns:_Miracle_at_the_Vistula"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The tide turns: Miracle at the Vistula</span></h4>

       <br /> On <!--del_lnk--> August 10, 1920, Russian <!--del_lnk--> Cossack units under the command of <!--del_lnk--> Gay Dimitrievich Gay crossed the <!--del_lnk--> Vistula river, planning to take Warsaw from the west while the main attack came from the east. On <!--del_lnk--> August 13, an initial Russian attack was repulsed. The Polish 1st Army resisted a direct <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">assault on Warsaw</a> as well as stopping the <!--del_lnk--> assault at Radzymin.<p>The Soviet <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief, <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail Tukhachevsky, felt certain that all was going according to his plan. However, Polish <!--del_lnk--> military intelligence had decrypted the Red Army&#39;s radio messages, and Tukhachevsky was actually falling into a trap set by Pi&#x142;sudski and his Chief of Staff, <!--del_lnk--> Tadeusz Rozwadowski. The Russian advance across the Vistula River in the north was moving into an operational vacuum, as there were no sizable Polish forces in the area. On the other hand, south of Warsaw, where the fate of the war was about to be decided, Tukhachevski had left only token forces to guard the vital link between the Russian northwest and southwest fronts. Another factor that influenced the outcome of the war was the effective neutralization of Budionny&#39;s 1st Cavalry Army, much feared by Pi&#x142;sudski and other Polish commanders, in the <!--del_lnk--> battles around Lw&oacute;w. The Soviet High Command, at Tukhachevski&#39;s insistence, had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and <!--del_lnk--> Lublin, but Budionny disobeyed the order due to a grudge between Tukhachevski and <!--del_lnk--> Yegorov, commander of the southwest front. Additionally, the political games of <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, chief political <!--del_lnk--> commissar of the Southwest Front, decisively influenced the disobedience of Yegorov and Budionny. Stalin, seeking a personal triumph, was focused on capturing <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w&mdash;far to the southeast of Warsaw&mdash;which was besieged by Bolshevik forces but still resisted their assaults.<p>The Polish 5th Army under General <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Sikorski counterattacked on <!--del_lnk--> August 14 from the area of the <!--del_lnk--> Modlin fortress, crossing the <!--del_lnk--> Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and <!--del_lnk--> Modlin had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski&#39;s 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By <!--del_lnk--> August 16, the Polish counteroffensive had been fully joined by Marshal Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s &quot;Reserve Army.&quot; Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, advancing from the south, found a huge gap between the Russian fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet &quot;Mozyr Group&quot; that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevski&#39;s forces, the majority of which were encircled by <!--del_lnk--> August 18. Only that same day did Tukhachevski, at his <!--del_lnk--> Minsk headquarters 300 miles east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<p>The Soviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevski ordered a general retreat toward the <!--del_lnk--> Bug River, but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.<p>The Bolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army&#39;s defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s detractors, the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Warsaw_%25281920%2529.htm" title="Battle of Warsaw (1920)">Battle of Warsaw</a> is often referred to in Poland as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Miracle at the Vistula&quot;. Current investigation in Poland concluded that the &quot;Miracle at the Vistula&quot; was caused by a big net of Polish spies within the Red Army. Pi&#x142;sudski knew about all the moves by the Red Army while the Soviets were left in the dark.<div style="float:left;border:none;width:200px;margin:1em 1em 0 0;padding:0">

      <p>The advance of <!--del_lnk--> Budyonny&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1st Cavalry Army toward <!--del_lnk--> Lw&oacute;w was halted, first at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Brody (<!--del_lnk--> July 29-<!--del_lnk--> August 2), and then on <!--del_lnk--> August 17 at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Zadw&oacute;rze, where a small Polish force sacrificed itself to prevent Soviet cavalry from seizing Lw&oacute;w and stopping vital Polish reinforcements from moving toward Warsaw. Moving through weakly defended areas, Budyonny&#39;s cavalry reached the city of <!--del_lnk--> Zamo&#x15B;&#x107; on <!--del_lnk--> 29 August and attempted to take it in the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Zamo&#x15B;&#x107;; however, he soon faced an increasing number of Polish units diverted from the successful Warsaw counteroffensive. On <!--del_lnk--> August 31, Budyonny&#39;s cavalry finally broke off its siege of Lw&oacute;w and attempted to come to the aid of Russian forces retreating from Warsaw. The Russian forces were intercepted and defeated by <!--del_lnk--> Polish cavalry at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Komar&oacute;w near Zamo&#x15B;&#x107;, the greatest cavalry battle since 1813 and one of the last cavalry battles in history. Although Budionny&#39;s Army managed to avoid encirclement, it suffered heavy losses and it&#39;s morale plummeted. The remains of Budionny&#39;s 1st Cavalry Army retreated towards <!--del_lnk--> Volodymyr-Volynskyi on <!--del_lnk--> 6 September and was defeated shortly thereafter at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Hrubiesz&oacute;w.<p>Tukhachevski managed to reorganize the eastward-retreating forces and in September established a new defensive line running from the Polish-Lithuanian border to the north to the area of <!--del_lnk--> Polesie, with the central point in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Grodno in Belarus. In order to break this line, the Polish Army had to fight the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Niemen River. Polish forces crossed the Niemen River and outflanked the Bolshevik forces, which were forced to retreat again. Polish forces continued to advance east on all fronts, repeating their successes from the previous year. After the early October <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Szczara River, the Polish Army had reached the <!--del_lnk--> Ternopil-<!--del_lnk--> Dubno-<!--del_lnk--> Minsk-<!--del_lnk--> Drisa line.<p>In the south, Petliura&#39;s Ukrainian forces defeated the Bolshevik 14th Army and on September 18th took control of the left bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Zbruch river. During the next month they moved east to the line Yaruha on the <!--del_lnk--> Dniester-Sharharod-<!--del_lnk--> Bar-Lityn.<p><a id="Conclusion" name="Conclusion"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Conclusion</span></h4>
      <p>Soon after the Battle of Warsaw the Bolsheviks sued for peace. The Poles, exhausted, constantly pressured by the Western governments and the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and with its army controlling the majority of the disputed territories, were willing to negotiate. The Soviets made two offers: one on 21 September and the other on 28 September. The Polish delegation made a counteroffer on 2 October. On the 5th, the Soviets offered amendments to the Polish offer which Poland accepted. The <!--del_lnk--> armistice between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia on the other was signed on 12 October and went into effect on 18 October. Long negotiations of the peace treaty ensued.<p>Meanwhile, Petliura&#39;s Ukrainian forces of about 23,000 soldiers, planned an offensive into Ukraine for November 11 but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on November 10. By November 21, after several battles, they were driven into Polish-controlled territory.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>

      <p>According to the British historian <!--del_lnk--> A.J.P. Taylor, the Polish-Soviet War &quot;largely determined the course of European history for the next twenty years or more. [&hellip;] Unavowedly and almost unconsciously, Soviet leaders abandoned the cause of international revolution.&quot; It would be twenty years before the Bolsheviks would send their armies abroad to &#39;make revolution&#39;. According to American sociologist <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Gella &quot;the Polish victory had gained twenty years of independence not only for Poland, but at least for an entire central part of Europe.<p>After the peace negotiations Poland did not maintain all the territories it had controlled at the end of hostilities. Due to their losses in and after the Battle of Warsaw, the Soviets offered the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions in the contested borderland areas, closely resembling the border between the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire and the <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> before the first <!--del_lnk--> partition of 1772. Polish resources were exhausted, however, and Polish public opinion was opposed to a prolongation of the war. The Polish government was also pressured by the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, and the negotiations were controlled by Dmowski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> National Democrats: Pi&#x142;sudski might have controlled the military, but parliament (<!--del_lnk--> Sejm) was controlled by Dmowski, and the peace negotiations were of a political nature. National Democrats, like <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Grabski, who earlier had resigned his post to protest the Polish&ndash;Ukrainian alliance and now wielded much influence over the Polish negotiators, cared little for Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mi&#x119;dzymorze; this post-war situation proved a death blow to Pi&#x142;sudski&#39;s dream of reviving the multicultural <a href="../../wp/p/Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth.htm" title="Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth">Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in the form of the Mi&#x119;dzymorze.<p>The National Democrats in charge of the state also had few concerns about the fate of Ukrainians, and cared little that their political opponent, Pi&#x142;sudski, felt honour-bound by his treaty obligations; his opponents did not hesitate to scrap the treaty. National Democrats wanted only the territory that they viewed as &#39;ethnically or historically Polish&#39; or possible to <!--del_lnk--> polonize. Despite the Red Army&#39;s crushing defeat at Warsaw and the willingness of Russian chief negotiator <!--del_lnk--> Adolf Joffe to concede almost all disputed territory, National Democrats ideology allowed the Soviets to regain certain territories. The <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Riga was signed on <!--del_lnk--> March 18, 1921, splitting the disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and Russia. The treaty, which Pi&#x142;sudski called an <i>act of cowardice</i>, and for which he apologized to the Ukrainians, actually violated the terms of Poland&#39;s military alliance with Ukraine, which had explicitly prohibited a separate peace; Ukrainian allies of Poland suddenly found themselves <!--del_lnk--> interned by the Polish authorities. The internment worsened relations between Poland and its Ukrainian minority: those who supported Petliura felt that Ukraine had been betrayed by its Polish ally, a feeling that grew stronger due to the assimilationist policies of nationalist inter-war Poland towards its minorities. To a large degree, this inspired the growing tensions and <!--del_lnk--> eventual violence against Poles in the 1930s and 1940s.<p>The war and its aftermath also resulted in <!--del_lnk--> other controversies, such as the <!--del_lnk--> situation of prisoners of war, treatment of the civilian population and behaviour of some commanders like <!--del_lnk--> Stanis&#x142;aw Bu&#x142;ak-Ba&#x142;achowicz or <!--del_lnk--> Vadim Yakovlev. The <!--del_lnk--> Polish military successes in the autumn of 1920 allowed Poland to capture the <!--del_lnk--> Wilno (Vilnius) region, where a Polish-dominated Governance Committee of <!--del_lnk--> Central Lithuania (<i>Komisja Rz&#x105;dz&#x105;ca Litwy &#x15A;rodkowej</i>) was formed. A <!--del_lnk--> plebiscite was conducted, and the Wilno <!--del_lnk--> Sejm voted on <!--del_lnk--> February 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1922, for incorporation into Poland. This worsened Polish-Lithuanian relations for decades to come.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Military strategy in the Polish-Soviet War influenced <!--del_lnk--> Charles de Gaulle, then an instructor with the Polish Army who fought in several of the battles. He and <!--del_lnk--> W&#x142;adys&#x142;aw Sikorski were the only military officers who, based on their experiences of this war, correctly predicted how the next one would be fought. Although they failed in the <!--del_lnk--> interbellum to convince their respective militaries to heed those lessons, early in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> they rose to command of their armed forces in exile. The Polish-Soviet War also influenced Polish military doctrine, which for the next 20 years would place emphasis on the mobility of elite cavalry units.<p>Until 1989, while communists held power in a <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Republic of Poland, the Polish-Soviet War was omitted or minimized in Polish and other <!--del_lnk--> Soviet bloc countries&#39; history books, or was presented so as to fit in with communist ideology.<p><a id="List_of_battles" name="List_of_battles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">List of battles</span></h2>
