      <p><b>Plants</b> are a major group of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">living things</a> including familiar <a href="../../wp/o/Organism.htm" title="Organism">organisms</a> such as <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a>, <!--del_lnk--> herbs, <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">ferns</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a>. About 350,000 <!--del_lnk--> species of plants, defined as <!--del_lnk--> seed plants, <!--del_lnk--> bryophytes, <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">ferns</a> and <!--del_lnk--> fern allies, have been estimated to exist. As of 2004, some 287,655 species had been identified, of which 258,650 are flowering and 15,000 bryophytes. Plants are mostly <!--del_lnk--> autotrophs, organisms that obtain energy from sunlight or organisms that make their own food. Most plants carry out a process called <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, which occurs in the <!--del_lnk--> chloroplasts of plants.<p>

      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move, and animals. In <a href="../../wp/c/Carolus_Linnaeus.htm" title="Carolus Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>&#39; system, these became the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">Animalia</a>. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> and several groups of <!--del_lnk--> algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Indeed, any attempt to match &quot;plant&quot; with a single <!--del_lnk--> taxon is doomed to fail, because plant is a vaguely defined concept unrelated to the presumed <!--del_lnk--> phylogenic concepts on which modern <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy is based.<p>When the name Plantae is applied to a specific taxon, it is usually one of three groups, each more inclusive than the last. From smallest to largest these are<ul>
       <li>Land plants (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Embryophyta) - see below<li>Green plants (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Viridiplantae or <!--del_lnk--> Chlorobionta) comprising Embryophytes and and green algae. Essentially the subject of this article.<li><!--del_lnk--> Primoplantae (also known as Plantae <i>sensu lato</i>, Plastida, or Archaeplastida) comprises green plants, <!--del_lnk--> red algae and <!--del_lnk--> glaucophyte algae. The broadest plant <!--del_lnk--> clade, this comprises the eukaryotes that acquired their chloroplasts directly by engulfing bacteria.</ul>
      <p>Informally, other creatures that carry out photosynthesis are called plants as well, but they do not constitute a formal taxon.<p><a id="Embryophytes" name="Embryophytes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Embryophytes</span></h2>
      <p>Most familiar are the <!--del_lnk--> multicellular land plants, called <!--del_lnk--> embryophytes. They include the <!--del_lnk--> vascular plants, plants with full systems of <!--del_lnk--> leaves, <!--del_lnk--> stems, and <!--del_lnk--> roots. They also include a few of their close relatives, often called <i><!--del_lnk--> bryophytes</i>, of which <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a> and <!--del_lnk--> liverworts are the most common.<p>All of these plants have <a href="../../wp/e/Eukaryote.htm" title="Eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> cells with <!--del_lnk--> cell walls composed of <!--del_lnk--> cellulose, and most obtain their energy through <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, using <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> to synthesize food. About three hundred plant species do not photosynthesize but are <!--del_lnk--> parasites on other species of photosynthetic plants. Plants are distinguished from <!--del_lnk--> green algae, which represent a mode of photosynthetic life similar to the kind modern plants are believed to have evolved from, by having specialized reproductive organs protected by non-reproductive tissues.<p>Bryophytes first appeared during the early <!--del_lnk--> Palaeozoic. They can only survive where moisture is available for significant periods, although some species are desiccation tolerant. Most species of bryophyte remain small throughout their life-cycle. This involves an alternation between two generations: a <!--del_lnk--> haploid stage, called the <!--del_lnk--> gametophyte, and a <!--del_lnk--> diploid stage, called the <!--del_lnk--> sporophyte. The sporophyte is short-lived and remains dependent on its parent gametophyte.<p>Vascular plants first appeared during the <a href="../../wp/s/Silurian.htm" title="Silurian">Silurian</a> period, and by the <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> had diversified and spread into many different land environments. They have a number of adaptations that allowed them to overcome the limitations of the bryophytes. These include a cuticle resistant to desiccation, and vascular tissues which transport water throughout the organism. In most the sporophyte acts as a separate individual, while the gametophyte remains small.<p>The first primitive seed plants, Pteridosperms (seed ferns) and Cordaites, both groups now extinct, appeared in the late Devonian and diversified through the Carboniferous, with further evolution through the <a href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Permian">Permian</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> periods. In these the gametophyte stage is completely reduced, and the sporophyte begins life inside an enclosure called a <a href="../../wp/s/Seed.htm" title="Seed">seed</a>, which develops while on the parent plant, and with fertilisation by means of <!--del_lnk--> pollen grains. Whereas other vascular plants, such as ferns, reproduce by means of spores and so need moisture to develop, some seed plants can survive and reproduce in extremely arid conditions.<p>Early seed plants are referred to as gymnosperms (naked seeds), as the seed embryo is not enclosed in a protective structure at pollination, with the pollen landing directly on the embryo. Four surviving groups remain widespread now, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> conifers, which are dominant <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a> in several <!--del_lnk--> biomes. The angiosperms, comprising the <!--del_lnk--> flowering plants, were the last major group of plants to appear, emerging from within the gymnosperms during the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and diversifying rapidly during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>. These differ in that the seed embryo(angiosperm) is enclosed, so the pollen has to grow a tube to penetrate the protective seed coat; they are the predominant group of flora in most biomes today.<p><a id="Algae_and_fungi" name="Algae_and_fungi"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Algae and fungi</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> algae comprise several different groups of organisms that produce energy through photosynthesis. However, they are not classified within the Kingdom Plantae but mostly in the Kingdom Protista. Most conspicuous are the <!--del_lnk--> seaweeds, multicellular algae that may roughly resemble terrestrial plants, but are classified among the <!--del_lnk--> green, <!--del_lnk--> red, and <!--del_lnk--> brown algae. These and other algal groups also include various single-celled organisms.<p>The embryophytes developed from green algae; the two groups are collectively referred to as the green plants or Viridiplantae. The Kingdom Plantae is often taken to mean this <!--del_lnk--> monophyletic grouping. With a few exceptions among the green algae, all such forms have cell walls containing <!--del_lnk--> cellulose and <!--del_lnk--> chloroplasts containing <!--del_lnk--> chlorophylls <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and store food in the form of <!--del_lnk--> starch. They undergo closed <!--del_lnk--> mitosis without <!--del_lnk--> centrioles, and typically have <a href="../../wp/m/Mitochondrion.htm" title="Mitochondrion">mitochondria</a> with flat cristae.<p>The chloroplasts of green plants are surrounded by two membranes, suggesting they originated directly from endosymbiotic <!--del_lnk--> cyanobacteria. The same is true of the <!--del_lnk--> red algae, and the two groups are generally believed to have a common origin (see <!--del_lnk--> Archaeplastida). In contrast, most other algae have chloroplasts with three or four membranes. They are not close relatives of the green plants, presumably in origin acquiring chloroplasts separately from ingested or symbiotic green and red algae.<p>Unlike embryophytes and algae, <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> are not photosynthetic, but are <!--del_lnk--> saprotrophs: obtaining food by breaking down and absorbing surrounding materials. Most fungi are formed by microscopic structures called hyphae, which may or may not be divided into cells but contain eukaryotic <!--del_lnk--> nuclei. Fruiting bodies, of which <!--del_lnk--> mushrooms are most familiar, are the reproductive structures of fungi. They are not related to any of the photosynthetic groups, but are close relatives of <a href="../../wp/a/Animal.htm" title="Animal">animals</a>. Therefore, the <!--del_lnk--> fungi are in a kingdom of their own.<p><a id="Importance" name="Importance"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Importance</span></h2>
      <p>The study of plant uses by people is termed economic botany or <!--del_lnk--> ethnobotany. They are often used as synonyms but some consider economic botany to focus mainly on uses of modern cultivated plants, while ethnobotany studies uses of indigenous plants by native peoples. Human cultivation of plants is part of <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, which is the basis of human civilization. Plant agriculture is subdivided into <!--del_lnk--> agronomy, <!--del_lnk--> horticulture and <!--del_lnk--> forestry.<p><a id="Food" name="Food"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Food</span></h3>

Plants are the source of many natural products such as fibers, essential oils, dyes, pigments, waxes, tannins, latex, gums, resins, alkaloids, amber and cork. Products derived from plants include soaps, paints, shampoos, perfumes, cosmetics, turpentine, rubber, varnish, lubricants, linoleum, plastics, inks, chewing gum and hemp rope. Plants are also a primary source of basic chemicals for the industrial synthesis of a vast array of organic chemicals.<p><a id="Aesthetic_uses" name="Aesthetic_uses"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aesthetic uses</span></h3>
      <p>Thousands of plant species are cultivated to beautify the human environment as well as to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce windspeed, abate noise, provide privacy and prevent soil erosion. People use cut flowers, dried flowers and house plants indoors. Outdoors, they use lawngrasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants. Images of plants are often used in art, architecture, humor, <!--del_lnk--> language and photography and on textiles, money, stamps, flags and coats of arms. Living plant art forms include <!--del_lnk--> topiary, <!--del_lnk--> bonsai, <!--del_lnk--> ikebana and <!--del_lnk--> espalier. <!--del_lnk--> Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in <!--del_lnk--> tulipomania.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tree rings are an important method of dating in archeology and serve as a record of past climates. Basic biological research has often been done with plants, such as the pea plants used to derive <a href="../../wp/g/Gregor_Mendel.htm" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>&#39;s laws of genetics. Space stations or space colonies may one day rely on plants for <!--del_lnk--> life support.

      <p><a href="../../wp/w/Weed.htm" title="Weed">Weeds</a> are plants that grow where people do not want them to grow. They cause billions of dollars in crop losses annually. People have spread plants far beyond their native ranges. Many introduced plants are <a href="../../wp/i/Invasive_species.htm" title="Invasive species">invasive</a> in areas where they are not native. Invasive plants are often major weeds. They also crowd out native species and damage or destroy existing ecosystems. Many people suffer from <!--del_lnk--> hay fever caused by pollen allergies. A wide variety of plants are <!--del_lnk--> poisonous. Several plants cause skin irritations when touched, especially <!--del_lnk--> poison ivy. Use of <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> products are a major cause of several diseases such as <a href="../../wp/l/Lung_cancer.htm" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> and <!--del_lnk--> heart disease.<p><a id="Growth" name="Growth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Growth</span></h2>
      <p>It is a common misconception that most of the solid material in a plant is taken from the soil, when in fact almost all of it is actually taken from the atmosphere. Through a process known as <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, plants use the energy in <a href="../../wp/s/Sunlight.htm" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple <!--del_lnk--> sugars. These sugars are then used as building blocks and form the main structural component of the plant. Plants rely on soil primarily for water (in quantitative terms), but also obtain <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Phosphorus.htm" title="Phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and other crucial elemental nutrients. For the majority of plants to grow successfully they also require oxygen in the atmosphere (for respiration in the dark) and oxygen around their roots. A few specialised vascular plants, such as <!--del_lnk--> Mangroves, can however grow with their roots in anoxic conditions.<div class="thumb tright">

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Annual: live and reproduce within one growing season.<li><!--del_lnk--> Biennial: live for two growing seasons; usually reproduce in second year.<li><!--del_lnk--> Perennial: live for many growing seasons; continue to reproduce once mature.</ul>
      <p>Among the vascular plants, perennials include both <!--del_lnk--> evergreens that keep their leaves the entire year, and <!--del_lnk--> deciduous plants which lose their leaves for some part. In <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> and <!--del_lnk--> boreal climates, they generally lose their leaves during the winter; many <!--del_lnk--> tropical plants lose their leaves during the dry season.<p>The growth rate of plants is extremely variable. Some mosses grow less than 0.001 mm/h, while most trees grow 0.025-0.250 mm/h. Some climbing species, such as <!--del_lnk--> kudzu, which do not need to produce thick supportive tissue, may grow up to 12.5 mm/h.<p>Plants protect themselves from <!--del_lnk--> frost and <!--del_lnk--> dehydration stress with <!--del_lnk--> antifreeze proteins, <!--del_lnk--> heat-shock proteins and sugars (<!--del_lnk--> sucrose is common). LEA (Late <!--del_lnk--> Embryogenesis Abundant) protein expression is induced by stresses and protects other proteins from aggregation as a result of <!--del_lnk--> desiccation and <!--del_lnk--> freezing.<p><a id="Ecological_relationships" name="Ecological_relationships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ecological relationships</span></h2>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> conducted by land plants and algae is the ultimate source of energy and organic material in nearly all ecosystems. Photosynthesis radically changed the composition of the early Earth&#39;s atmosphere, which as a result is now 21% oxygen. Animals and most other organisms are aerobic, relying on oxygen; those that do not are confined to relatively rare anaerobic environments. Plants are the <!--del_lnk--> primary producers in most terrestrial ecosystems and form the basis of the <!--del_lnk--> food web in those ecosystems. Many animals rely on plants for shelter as well as oxygen and food.<p>Land plants are key components of the <!--del_lnk--> water cycle and several other <!--del_lnk--> biogeochemical cycles. Some plants have <!--del_lnk--> coevolved with <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_fixation.htm" title="Nitrogen fixation">nitrogen fixing</a> bacteria, making plants an important part of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen_cycle.htm" title="Nitrogen cycle">nitrogen cycle</a>. Plant roots play an essential role in <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> development and prevention of <!--del_lnk--> soil erosion. The Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> biomes are named for the type of vegetation because plants are the dominant organisms in biomes.<p>Numerous animals have coevolved with plants. Many animals <!--del_lnk--> pollinate <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a> in exchange for food in the form of pollen or <!--del_lnk--> nectar. Many animals <!--del_lnk--> disperse seeds, often by eating <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a> and passing the seeds in their feces. <!--del_lnk--> Myrmecophytes are plants that have coevolved with <a href="../../wp/a/Ant.htm" title="Ant">ants</a>. The plant provides a home, and sometimes food, for the ants. In exchange, the ants defend the plant from <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a> and sometimes competing plants. Ant wastes provide organic <a href="../../wp/f/Fertilizer.htm" title="Fertilizer">fertilizer</a>.<p>The majority of plant species have various kinds of fungi associated with their root systems in a kind of <!--del_lnk--> mutualistic <!--del_lnk--> symbiosis known as <!--del_lnk--> mycorrhiza. The fungi help the plants gain water and mineral nutrients from the soil, while the plant gives the fungi carbohydrates manufactured in photosynthesis. Some plants serve as homes for <!--del_lnk--> endophytic fungi that protect the plant from herbivores by producing toxins. The fungal endophyte, <i>Neotyphodium coenophialum</i>, in tall fescue (<i>Festuca arundinacea</i>) does tremendous economic damage to the cattle industry in the U.S.<p>Various forms of parasitism are also fairly common among plants, from the semi-parasitic <!--del_lnk--> mistletoe that merely takes some nutrients from its host, but still has photosynthetic leaves, to the fully parasitic <!--del_lnk--> broomrape and <!--del_lnk--> toothwort that acquire all their nutrients through connections to the roots of other plants, so have no chlorophyll. Some plants, known as <!--del_lnk--> myco-heterotrophs, parasitize mycorrhizal fungi, and hence act as <!--del_lnk--> epiparasites on other plants.<p>Many plants are <!--del_lnk--> epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants, usually trees, without parasitizing them. Epiphytes may indirectly harm their host plant by intercepting mineral nutrients and light that the host would otherwise receive. The weight of large numbers of epiphytes may break tree limbs. Many <!--del_lnk--> orchids, <!--del_lnk--> bromeliads, <a href="../../wp/f/Fern.htm" title="Fern">ferns</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Moss.htm" title="Moss">mosses</a> often grow as epiphytes. Bromeliad epiphytes accumulate water in leaf axils to form phytotelmata, complex aquatic food webs.<p>A few plants are <!--del_lnk--> carnivorous, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Venus Flytrap and <a href="../../wp/s/Sundew.htm" title="Sundew">sundew</a>. They trap small animals and digest them to obtain mineral nutrients, especially nitrogen.<p><a id="Fossils" name="Fossils"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fossils</span></h2>
      <p>Plant <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> include roots, wood, leaves, seeds, fruit, <!--del_lnk--> pollen, <!--del_lnk--> spores, <!--del_lnk--> phytoliths, and <a href="../../wp/a/Amber.htm" title="Amber">amber</a> (the fossilized resin produced by some plants). Fossil land plants are recorded in terrestrial, lacustrine, fluvial and nearshore marine sediments. <!--del_lnk--> Pollen, <!--del_lnk--> spores and algae (<!--del_lnk--> dinoflagellates and <!--del_lnk--> acritarchs) are used for dating sedimentary rock sequences. The remains of fossil plants are not as common as fossil animals, although plant fossils are locally abundant in many regions worldwide.<p>Early fossils of these ancient plants show the individual cells within the plant tissue. The <!--del_lnk--> Devonian period also saw the evolution of what many believe to be the first modern tree, <i><!--del_lnk--> Archaeopteris</i>. This fern-like tree combined a woody trunk with the fronds of a fern, but produced no seeds.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Coal Measures are a major source of <!--del_lnk--> Palaeozoic plant fossils, with many groups of plants in existence at this time. The spoil heaps of coal mines are the best places to collect; <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> itself is the remains of fossilised plants, though structural detail of the plant fossils is rarely visible in coal. In the Fossil Forest at Victoria Park in <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the stumps of <i><!--del_lnk--> Lepidodendron</i> trees are found in their original growth positions.<p>The fossilized remains of conifer and angiosperm roots, stems and branches may be locally abundant in lake and inshore sedimentary rocks from the <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic and <!--del_lnk--> Caenozoic eras. <!--del_lnk--> Sequoia and its allies, <!--del_lnk--> magnolia, <!--del_lnk--> oak, and <a href="../../wp/a/Arecaceae.htm" title="Arecaceae">palms</a> are often found.<p><!--del_lnk--> Petrified wood is common in some parts of the world, and is most frequently found in arid or desert areas where it is more readily exposed by <!--del_lnk--> erosion. Petrified wood is often heavily silicified (the organic material replaced by <!--del_lnk--> silicon dioxide), and the impregnated tissue is often preserved in fine detail. Such specimens may be cut and polished using <!--del_lnk--> lapidary equipment. Fossil forests of petrified wood have been found in all continents.<p>Fossils of seed ferns such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Glossopteris</i> are widely distributed throughout several continents of the <!--del_lnk--> southern hemisphere, a fact that gave support to <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Wegener&#39;s early ideas regarding <!--del_lnk--> Continental drift theory.<p><a id="Internal_Distribution" name="Internal_Distribution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Internal Distribution</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Nutrients from the soil are distributed to specific areas in the plant through vessels, for example to the leaves to conduct <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Also the <!--del_lnk--> glucose produced during <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> is distributed around the plant to give the plant energy to keep growing and <!--del_lnk--> seeding. <a id="External_Distribution" name="External_Distribution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">External Distribution</span></h2>
