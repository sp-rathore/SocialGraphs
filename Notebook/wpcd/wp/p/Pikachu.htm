Pikachu is also the name of an individual character that belongs to this species and is the Pok&eacute;mon companion of <!--del_lnk--> Ash Ketchum. The purpose of Pikachu in the games, anime, and manga, as with all other Pok&eacute;mon, is to battle both wild Pok&eacute;mon&mdash;untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments&mdash;and tamed Pok&eacute;mon owned by <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon trainers. Pikachu is among the most recognizable of Pok&eacute;mon, considering a Pikachu is one of the main characters in the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> anime series.<p>In the Pok&eacute;mon universe Pikachu are <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammal</a>-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown stripes on their backs, black-tipped ears, and an unusually shaped tail, resembling a <!--del_lnk--> lightning bolt. They are often found in <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a>, <!--del_lnk--> plains, and occasionally near <!--del_lnk--> electrical sources (such as power plants), on most <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> throughout the world. Pikachu often travel in packs, and are rarely territorial; however, when threatened, a group can generate an intense electrical offensive, and the electro-magnetic forces exerted by the resulting field can even produce a short lived, localized thunderstorm.<p>

      <p>Pikachu are often found foraging for <!--del_lnk--> berries. Instead of climbing <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>, they use small electrical jolts to release the berries from the tree, roasting them at the same time. It can also roast marshmallows on the tongue with electricity to make them dance. Pikachu have the ability to release electric discharges of varying intensity, at will, through glandular pouches residing in its cheeks. These <!--del_lnk--> glands allow it to store and release <!--del_lnk--> bolts or <!--del_lnk--> balls of lightning to defend itself from attackers, to be used in battle, at the command from its <!--del_lnk--> trainer, or in self-defense in the wild. An inability to discharge electricity in this last way, as in the presence of strong magnetic field, causes an illness with <!--del_lnk--> flu-like symptoms. Pikachu gather in areas with high amounts of thunderstorm activity.<p>For defense against predators, Pikachu uses both its speed and electricity to stay alive, however, some predators are immune to Pikachu&#39;s electric shocks, in this case Pikachu retreats if possible, unfortunatly since Pikachus are rather fat, they make easy targets, some Pokemon, Like Ariados, make webs to catch wild Pikachu, in this case, the Pikachu is virtually helpless and easily wrapped up and eaten. Pikachu is a rather common pokemon and has several predators however.<p>Pikachu is yellow with brown stripes on its back, black-tipped ears, red electrical pouches on its cheeks, and has a lightning-bolt-shaped tail. It evolves into Raichu via use of a Thunder Stone. Pikachu is so popular, however, that in the television <!--del_lnk--> anime series and various Pok&eacute;mon-related <!--del_lnk--> manga publications, most trainers choose to keep it from evolving. For example, in <i>Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i>, Pikachu refuses to evolve as attempting to use a Thunderstone on it makes it cry and refuse. It is numbered as #25 in the National Pok&eacute;dex. Also, from the second generation of the Pok&eacute;mon games onward, Pikachu has an evolutionary predecessor, <!--del_lnk--> Pichu. Pichu, which is a baby Pikachu, evolves into Pikachu after establishing a friendship with its trainer.<p><a id="Importance_and_role" name="Importance_and_role"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Importance and role</span></h2>
      <p><a id="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_video_games" name="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_video_games"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In the <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> video games</span></h3>
      <p>In the video games, Pikachu is a typical low-level Pok&eacute;mon, usually found around levels 3-6 in <!--del_lnk--> Viridian Forest, and around 25 in the Power Plant or in the <i>Ruby</i>,<i>Sapphire</i> and <i>Emerald</i> <!--del_lnk--> Safari Zone. Players playing <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i> will have Pikachu as their first Pok&eacute;mon, and in the other games those who find one (typically it&#39;s a rather rare find) often use it as an early-to-mid-level Electric Pok&eacute;mon.<p>Few players use Pikachu in competitive head-to-head play, however, because of its relatively low defense stats. It does see occasional play after <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon Gold</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Silver</i>, which added an item called the Light Ball. This item, when given to Pikachu to hold, doubles the special attack stat that determines the power of its Electric attacks, making it useful in competitive play.<p>Pikachu is featured in <i><!--del_lnk--> Hey You, Pikachu!</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Channel</i>, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Pikachu</i> <!--del_lnk--> digital pet. It also makes several appearances in <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Snap</i>, famously portraying the <i>Surfing Pikachu</i> sidequest in <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i>.<p>Pikachu has also appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> Super Smash Bros.</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Super Smash Bros. Melee</i> as a very agile and mobile playable character, equipped with Quick Attack, Thundershock, and Thunder. In <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>, Pikachu&#39;s Skull Bash move was introduced, and its Quick Attack ability was upgraded so that it did a small amount of damage to opponents. Pikachu is also set to appear in the upcoming <i><!--del_lnk--> Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>.<p>There has also been a special edition <!--del_lnk--> Game Boy Colour handheld specifically created for <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i>, sporting a yellow colour with Pikachu featured on the handheld. In addition, a special-edition <!--del_lnk--> Nintendo 64 <!--del_lnk--> game console was released, featuring Pikachu as well as saying &quot;Pikachu!&quot; when <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> video games were started. This was released along with the game <i><!--del_lnk--> Hey You, Pikachu!</i>, in which you use a <!--del_lnk--> microphone to converse with the Pok&eacute;mon.<p>Pikachu has also made cameo appearances in <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Pinball</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Trozei</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Colosseum</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon XD: Gale of Darkness</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Dash</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Ranger</i>. It has also played a role in various games for the <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon mini handheld games console. Pikachu is also one of the sixteen starters in the <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon games. Pikachu has also appeared in a video of <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Diamond and <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Pearl. It has also been shown in a pre-release image that Pikachu will appear in <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Battle Revolution for Nintendo&#39;s upcoming <!--del_lnk--> Wii console.<p><a id="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_anime" name="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_anime"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In the <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> anime</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> anime <!--del_lnk--> series and <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">films</a> are a meta-series of adventures separate from the <!--del_lnk--> canon that most of the <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> video games follow (with the exception of <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Yellow</i>, a game based on the anime storyline). The anime follows the quest of the main character, <!--del_lnk--> Ash Ketchum&mdash;an in-training Pok&eacute;mon Master&mdash;as he, <!--del_lnk--> May and <!--del_lnk--> Hikari (as well as several other companions) travel around the fictitious world of Pok&eacute;mon along with their Pok&eacute;mon partners, Pikachu, <!--del_lnk--> Blaziken, and <!--del_lnk--> Pochama.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> anime, beginning trainers from the <!--del_lnk--> Kanto region traditionally choose from <!--del_lnk--> Charmander, <!--del_lnk--> Bulbasaur or <!--del_lnk--> Squirtle as a &#39;starter&#39; Pok&eacute;mon. However, the series protagonist <!--del_lnk--> Ash Ketchum, an inhabitant of Pallet Town, arrived late at <!--del_lnk--> Professor Oak&#39;s lab (having slept in from a late night of Pok&eacute;mon trainer fantasizing). The traditional three starting Pok&eacute;mon had already been taken by other new trainers, and Ash was given a Pikachu instead. At first, Pikachu largely ignored Ash&#39;s requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pok&eacute;mon transportation, a <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute; Ball. However, in the first episode, Ash put himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild <!--del_lnk--> Spearow, then rushed the electric mouse to a Pok&eacute;mon Centre (notably stealing <!--del_lnk--> Misty&#39;s bike to do so). Through this demonstration of a deeply-rooted, unconditional commitment to Pok&eacute;mon, Pikachu warmed up to Ash, and their friendship was formed.<p>The bond between Ash and Pikachu is a prominent motif in the series and inviolable in terms of the series ethos. Pikachu is the only Pok&eacute;mon in Ash&#39;s party that has been with him in every episode, movie, and TV special. It is implied that Ash&#39;s Pikachu is male, but it is rarely addressed with a gendered pronoun. Also, many times Ash and Pikachu have been separated by cave-ins and explosions. Most of these times, <!--del_lnk--> Meowth is also separated from Team Rocket, and they usually end up working together to find their trainers.<p>It is explicitly shown that there is something &#39;unique&#39; about Ash&#39;s Pikachu, setting it apart from others of its kind; <!--del_lnk--> Team Rocket&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Meowth quips early on in the first series that Ash&#39;s Pikachu&#39;s powers greatly exceed that of even its evolution (which was shown in the battle with Lt. Surge&#39;s Raichu). For this reason, Team Rocket&#39;s attempts to capture Pikachu become a significant theme throughout much of the first series. It is shown in some episodes that they intend to present it to their boss, Giovanni, in order to win favour.<p>Early in the series, Pikachu was given an operation to increase the strength of the electric sacs in his cheeks in order to beat the first gym leader, <!--del_lnk--> Brock. In another first season episode (in <!--del_lnk--> Vermilion City), Pikachu, who is often rather independently minded, believed that it was strong enough without evolving and refused to evolve into a <!--del_lnk--> Raichu. In fact, in Ash&#39;s third gym battle in Vermillion City, Pikachu was successful in defeating a Raichu, and to this day, Ash&#39;s Pikachu has participated in more gym battles than any of his other Pok&eacute;mon.<p>When Pikachu cannot release its electricity, it develops <!--del_lnk--> flu-like symptoms and can sometimes lose control of itself. Most notably, exposure to a <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field will cause Pikachu to get this illness. This has happened to Pikachu twice in the series, both times by <!--del_lnk--> Team Rocket: the first time, Pikachu was cured when the extra electricity was used in attacks against a group of <!--del_lnk--> Grimer and <!--del_lnk--> Muk, and in the second time, Pikachu was inadvertently cured by one of Team Rocket&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> battery robots (that uses Pikachu&#39;s power to charge itself), which subsequently overloaded and exploded. During the <!--del_lnk--> Hoenn arc, Ash trained Pikachu to use Iron Tail, which greatly improved its ability to fight Pok&eacute;mon with resistance to Electric attacks.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon: The First Movie</i>, Pikachu is the only &quot;original&quot; Pok&eacute;mon, besides Meowth, that refused to fight its clone. Pikachu also attempts to revive a downed Ash (who had been turned to stone, and thus, killed) with repeated thundershocks, to no avail; a grief-stricken Pikachu bursts into tears, which (along with the tears of all other Pok&eacute;mon present) return Ash to life.<p>Many of the <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> animated shorts with all-Pok&eacute;mon dialogue have featured Pikachu as the main character. As such, Pikachu is often a leader, helping to break up conflicts among other Pok&eacute;mon.<p>Pikachu typically eats a specially formulated pellet made by Brock. It also likes fresh fruit, especially apples. Sometimes it is shown eating the same meal that his human companions are eating, in smaller portions. As seen in the episode, <i>Showdown in Dark City</i>, Pikachu&#39;s favorite &quot;food&quot; is ketchup. In this case Ash&#39;s Pikachu kept the bottle and became slightly obsessed with it. This caused problems because a <!--del_lnk--> Scyther and an <!--del_lnk--> Electabuzz that were enraged at the colour red were nearby. Scyther accidentally cut the bottle, spilling the ketchup, causing Pikachu to cry.<p>Like most other Pok&eacute;mon, Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables that are in its own name. Its most common sentence is &quot;Pika-pika&quot;. When it wants to talk to Ash it says &quot;Pika-pi,&quot; which sounds similar to &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Satoshi&quot; (the name of his trainer in the Japanese version). It also calls <!--del_lnk--> Misty &quot;Pi-ka-chu-pi&quot; similar to her Japanese name of &quot;Kasumi&quot;,and calls Takeshi Pika pi pi. Pikachu is voiced by <!--del_lnk--> Ikue Otani in all versions of the anime, except in the English language episode <i>Pok&eacute;mon, I Choose You</i>, in which <!--del_lnk--> Rachael Lillis, the regular voice of <!--del_lnk--> Misty and <!--del_lnk--> Jessie of <!--del_lnk--> Team Rocket, provided the voice in cases when another character&#39;s voice overlapped Pikachu&#39;s. In one episode, it is stated that Pikachu feels that Ash makes rash choices sometimes. This statement is made by Anabel, after talking to Pikachu.<p>Throughout the series, there&#39;s a running gag involving Pikachu zapping the bike of the female protagonist. It first destroyed Misty&#39;s bike, which she used as an excuse to travel with Ash, then when Ash went to Hoenn, Pikachu destroyed May&#39;s bike. Most recently Pikachu destroyed Hikari&#39;s bike while defending itself from her Pochama. While the first actually had worked as part of the plot in order to add Misty to the main group, the laters were more of a reference to the original and served exclusively for comedy purposes, having no real influence in the story, other than forcing the female protagonist to walk instead of ride her bike.<p>Many other Pikachu have appeared in the <!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon anime. The most notable among these is <!--del_lnk--> Richie&#39;s Pikachu, with mussed hair on its forehead. This one is nicknamed Sparky (Leon in the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese original). Sparky, unlike Ash&#39;s Pikachu, is indifferent to being inside its Pok&eacute; Ball, but save for the first season, it is always shown outside, similar to Ash&#39;s Pikachu. In fact, every captured Pikachu in the anime has been shown spending most or all of its time outside of a Pok&eacute; Ball, even though this is not noted by any characters to be typical of the species.<p>Another notable Pikachu is Puka (Michael in the Japanese version), a <!--del_lnk--> surfing Pikachu owned by a surfer named Victor. Puka has blue eyes instead of the usual black and also seems to have a harmony with the sea - it glows a bright blue when it feels a powerful wave. It is claimed that Puka is over 20 years old (it is unknown whether such longevity is unusual for a Pikachu), and is noticeably larger than Ash&#39;s Pikachu (though still smaller than a <!--del_lnk--> Raichu). It also has somewhat frazzled hair on around the tips of its ears.<p>Many episodes of the anime have also featured other unnamed Pikachu. Among them is &quot;Pikachu&#39;s Goodbye&quot;, in which a large group of wild Pikachu appeared, and in &quot;Pok&eacute;mon Emergency&quot;, a group of Pikachu are always hidden in the <!--del_lnk--> Viridian City Pok&eacute;mon Centre as their backup <!--del_lnk--> electrical generator, which was used when <!--del_lnk--> Team Rocket cut the power to the centre. The footage of these Pikachu is later reused for a group of Pikachu aboard the SS Anne.<p>At the end of the episode &quot;Hocus Pok&eacute;mon!&quot;, a witch-in-training accidentally transforms Ash into a Pikachu. (he keeps his hair and his hat) He then plays with Pikachu. At the beginning of the next episode, &quot;As Clear as Crystal!&quot; he is still a Pikachu, but the spell wears off and Ash goes back to being a human.<p>There is a special episode of <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out Of The Gate!</i> in which one Pikachu (not Ash&#39;s Pikachu) got captured by Skarmory leaving his little brother Pichu alone. After Skarmory captures Pichu, Pikachu apologized to Pichu for getting Pichu in the middle of getting captured. When the Go-Getters arrived, Pikachu told Pichu to open the treasure bag and the seed fell out. Pikachu kicked the seed to Squirtle. When Squirtle swallowed the seed, he got super speed. After defeating Skarmory, the Go-Getters saved Pikachu and Pichu.<p><a id="In_Pok.C3.A9mon_manga" name="In_Pok.C3.A9mon_manga"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In Pok&eacute;mon manga</span></h3>
      <p>A Pikachu has appeared in every Pok&eacute;mon <!--del_lnk--> manga series as of 2005. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Red, the &quot;first protagonist&quot; of the <i>Pok&eacute;mon Adventures</i> series, captures a mischievous Pikachu causing trouble for the people of Pewter City which became one of his main Pok&eacute;mon from there on. After Red goes missing two years later, his Pikachu teams up with <!--del_lnk--> Yellow, the &quot;fourth protagonist&quot; of the series, to find him. Yellow is accompanied by Pikachu throughout the <!--del_lnk--> Johto saga, as well as her own Pikachu, Chu Chu.<p>In the <i><!--del_lnk--> Magical Pok&eacute;mon Journey</i> manga, Hazel, the main character of the series, obtained a Pikachu as her first Pok&eacute;mon. Although Hazel&#39;s task is to capture Pok&eacute;mon for a scientist, her and Pikachu often fall into trouble because of their joint scatterbrained personalities. This Pikachu, along with Hazel&#39;s other main Pok&eacute;mon, <!--del_lnk--> Clefairy, re-appears in the spin-off series, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pok&eacute;mon Chamo-Chamo Pretty</i>.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Electric Tale of Pikachu</i> series, often referred to as the series (known in Japan as &quot;Dengeki! Pikachu&quot;), Ash&#39;s Pikachu was originally a feral Pok&eacute;mon he caught chewing on wires in his walls. This manga follows the storyline of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> anime, featuring Ash, Misty and Brock alongside Pikachu battling <!--del_lnk--> Team Rocket. This series was released in four volumes called The Electric Tale of Pikachu<i>,</i> Pikachu Shocks Back<i>,</i> Electric Pikachu Boogaloo <i>and</i> Surf&#39;s Up Pikachu<i>.</i><p>In the <i>Getto Da Ze</i> manga, the main character Shuu owns a Pikachu, whom he communicates with because of a device called an In-Com. This Pikachu is very feisty and a little sarcastic.<p>Pikachu also stars in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ash &amp; Pikachu</i> manga series, another to closely follow the Pok&eacute;mon anime. Unlike in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Electric Tale of Pikachu</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Professor Oak gave Pikachu to Ash as his first Pok&eacute;mon, rather than Ash finding him in the former. Another difference between the two is that <i>Ash and Pikachu</i> continued to follow the anime storyline, leading Ash and Pikachu to <!--del_lnk--> Hoenn, being accompanied by Haruka and Masato, <!--del_lnk--> May and <!--del_lnk--> Max in the English version.<p><a id="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_Trading_Card_Game" name="In_the_Pok.C3.A9mon_Trading_Card_Game"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In the <i>Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game</i></span></h3>
      <p>The <i><a href="../../wp/p/Pok%25C3%25A9mon_Trading_Card_Game.htm" title="Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game">Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game</a></i> is a <!--del_lnk--> collectable card game first published by <!--del_lnk--> Wizards of the Coast in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>, in 1999. The concept is similar to that of a Pok&eacute;mon battle in the video games in that each player takes turns to hit the opponent&rsquo;s Pok&eacute;mon. Most Pikachu cards are typical, Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, primarily used to play stronger cards, such as Stage-1 Pok&eacute;mon, <!--del_lnk--> Poliwhirl, and Stage-2 Pok&eacute;mon, <!--del_lnk--> Charizard. Some Pikachu cards are similar in attack and defense (see picture) to other Basic <!--del_lnk--> Electric-types, such as <!--del_lnk--> Mareep, and <!--del_lnk--> Electrike, but often have stronger promo cards, giving them an advantage, because of their popularity.<p>Pikachu has been seen in at least thirteen incarnations in <i>Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game</i> sets released in North America, and that number increases to twenty when limited edition promotional cards are included, these limited edition cards were won in prizes, and copied, fake cards were made by places such as cinemas to encourage people to buy their tickets. The expansion sets Pikachu cards are found in are the Base Set (as well as Base Set 2 and Legendary Collections reprints), Jungle, Gym Heroes (As <!--del_lnk--> Lt.Surge&#39;s Pikachu), Gym Challenge (As Lt. Surge&#39;s Pikachu), Neo Genesis, Expedition, Skyridge, EX Sandstorm, EX Team Magma VS. Team Aqua, EX Firered &amp; LeafGreen, EX Emerald, EX Legend Maker (as a secret card), and EX Holon Phantoms (appears twice).<p>Pikachu cards are often sought after because of their wide appeal and often unavailability. Although most Pikachu cards are Common variety (see picture), meaning that they can be found very often in booster packs of cards, promo cards were only available by purchasing tickets for the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> movies. An often overlooked error in the original Base Set Pikachu design (see picture) was known as the &quot;Red-Cheeked Pikachu.&quot; The name came from the mouse&#39;s mis-coloured cheeks that were supposed to glow yellow from the protruding electric sparks. This error was later fixed in the Base Set 2 <!--del_lnk--> version.<p><a id="Cultural_impact" name="Cultural_impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural impact</span></h2>

      <p>Pikachu, as one of the most popular Pok&eacute;mon, is often parodied.

Also, in The Cheat&#39;s Theme Song video, when the singer says &quot;who&#39;s the guy that looks like The Cheat&quot;, a Pikachu flys by onscreen. In the anime universe, &quot;Stinko Man K: 20x6&quot;, The Cheat is turned into &quot;Cheatball&quot;, a Pikachu parody, and only says his own name like a Pok&eacute;mon.
