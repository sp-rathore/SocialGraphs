<h2>SOS Children in Kenya</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_kenya_en.gif" width="303" height="405" alt="SOS Children Sponsorship Sites in Kenya" class="left" /><p>The East African country of Kenya, despite setbacks in recent years, is one of the most stable in Africa in political terms, but rapid population growth and the disproportionate distribution of income have worsened social problems. For most people living in rural locations, subsistence farming is the main source of income. Increasing migration to the industrial centres has led to the creation of large slum areas. Kenya has made real efforts to improve health care and the educational system - education is compulsory between the ages of six and fourteen - but diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness are still prevalent and like many countries in southern and eastern Africa, Kenya has been hit hard by HIV/AIDS. </p><p>The charity began its work in Kenya in 1975 when the first village was built in the Eastlands district on the outskirts of Nairobi, the capital city. Today, the village has sixteen family houses and fourteen youth houses, as well as a kindergarten, primary school and a vocational training centre which is recognised as one of the best in the country. All are open to children and young people from the local community as well as SOS children.  There is also an SOS social centre in Nairobi which includes a community outreach programme for families and street children affected by HIV/AIDS, providing clothes, food, basic medical supplies, housing improvements and basic school fees. </p><p>Kenya's other three SOS Children's sites are in Mombasa, Eldoret, Kenya's fifth largest town about 380 kms west of Nairobi near the Ugandan border and Meru. SOS Children Mombasa, on the shores of Mombasa Bay, has twelve family houses and six youth houses, as well as a kindergarten and a primary school with capacity for 480 pupils. Each family house has a small garden where fruit and vegetables are grown, and goats, cows and geese are raised to increase the village's self-sufficiency. </p><p>SOS Children Eldoret has twelve family houses and five youth houses, which together are home to 220 children and young people. The SOS primary school, which opened in 1989, has 22 classrooms for 700 pupils and there is a kindergarten for local and SOS children.</p><p>The fourth SOS Children&rsquo;s Village was opened in 2006 at Meru about 175 miles north of Nairobi.  The land was donated by the Methodist University of Meru.  The village has 12 family houses which are home for 120 children.  There is also a nursery school for 100 children from the local community as well as for children from the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village.</p><h3>Local contacts</h3>
