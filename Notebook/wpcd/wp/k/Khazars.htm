      <p>The origins of the Khazars are unclear. Following their conversion to Judaism, the Khazars themselves traced their origins to <!--del_lnk--> Kozar, a son of <!--del_lnk--> Togarmeh. Togarmeh is mentioned in <!--del_lnk--> Genesis in the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew scriptures as a grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Japheth. It is unlikely, however, that he was regarded as an ancestor before the introduction of Biblical traditions to Khazaria.<p>Some historians have looked for possible connections between the Khazars and the <!--del_lnk--> lost tribes of Israel, but modern scholars generally consider them to be Turks who migrated from the East. Scholars in the former <!--del_lnk--> USSR considered the Khazars to be an <!--del_lnk--> indigenous people of the <!--del_lnk--> North Caucasus. Some scholars, such as <!--del_lnk--> D.M. Dunlop, considered the Khazars to be connected with a <!--del_lnk--> Uyghur or <!--del_lnk--> Tiele confederation tribe called <!--del_lnk--> He&#39;san in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> sources from the <!--del_lnk--> 7th-century (Suishu, 84). However, the <!--del_lnk--> Khazar language appears to have been an <!--del_lnk--> Oghuric tongue, similar to that spoken by the early <!--del_lnk--> Bulgars. Therefore, a <!--del_lnk--> Hunnish origin has also been postulated. Since the Turkic peoples were never ethnically homogenous, these ideas need not be deemed mutually exclusive. It is likely that the Khazar nation was made up of tribes from various ethnic backgrounds, as steppe nations traditionally absorbed those they conquered.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenian</a> chronicles contain references to the Khazars as early as the late <!--del_lnk--> second century. These are generally regarded as <!--del_lnk--> anachronisms, and most scholars believe that they actually refer to <!--del_lnk--> Sarmatians or <!--del_lnk--> Scythians. <!--del_lnk--> Priscus relates that one of the nations in the <!--del_lnk--> Hunnish confederacy was called <!--del_lnk--> Akatziroi. Their king was named <!--del_lnk--> Karadach or Karidachus. Some, going on the similarity between Akatziroi and &quot;Ak-Khazar&quot; (see below), have speculated that the Akatziroi were early proto-Khazars.<p>Dmitri Vasil&#39;ev of <!--del_lnk--> Astrakhan State University recently hypothesized that the Khazars moved in to the Pontic steppe region only in the late <!--del_lnk--> 500s, and originally lived in <!--del_lnk--> Transoxiana. According to Vasil&#39;ev, Khazar populations remained behind in Transoxiana under <!--del_lnk--> Pecheneg and <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz <!--del_lnk--> suzerainty, possibly remaining in contact with the main body of their people.<p><a id="Tribes" name="Tribes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tribes</span></h2>
      <p>The Khazars&#39; tribal structure is not well understood. They were divided between Ak-Khazars (&quot;White Khazars&quot;) and Kara-Khazars (&quot;Black Khazars&quot;). The Arab writer <!--del_lnk--> Istakhri claimed that the White Khazars were strikingly handsome with reddish hair, white skin and blue eyes while the Black Khazars were swarthy verging on deep black as if they were some kind of Indian. Most scholars, however, dispute this. Many Turkic nations had similar division between a &quot;white&quot; ruling warrior caste and a &quot;black&quot; class of commoners; the distinction is not believed by most scholars to have had anything to do with race. It is likely that Istakhri was himself confused by the name given to the two groups. Peter Golden speculated that the Khazar ethnos was a conglomerate of <!--del_lnk--> Oghuric and common Turkic nations, including the <!--del_lnk--> Sabirs and <!--del_lnk--> North Caucasian Huns as well as elements of the <!--del_lnk--> Gokturks.<p><a id="Rise" name="Rise"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise</span></h2>

      <p>Early Khazar history is intimately tied with that of the <!--del_lnk--> Gokturk empire, founded when the <!--del_lnk--> Ashina clan overthrew the <!--del_lnk--> Juan Juan in <!--del_lnk--> 552 CE. With the collapse of the Gokturk empire due to internal conflict in the <!--del_lnk--> seventh century, the western half of the Turk empire split into a number of tribal confederations, among whom were the <!--del_lnk--> Bulgars, led by the <!--del_lnk--> Dulo clan, and the Khazars, led by the <!--del_lnk--> Ashina clan, the traditional rulers of the Gok Turk empire. By <!--del_lnk--> 670, the Khazars had broken the Bulgar confederation, causing various tribal groups to migrate and leaving two remnants of Bulgar rule - <!--del_lnk--> Volga Bulgaria, and the <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> khanate on the <a href="../../wp/d/Danube.htm" title="Danube">Danube</a> River.<p>The first significant appearance of the Khazars in history is their aid to the campaign of the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine</a> emperor <a href="../../wp/h/Heraclius.htm" title="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> against the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanid <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persians</a>. The Khazar ruler Ziebel (sometimes identified as <!--del_lnk--> Tong Yabghu Khagan of the West Turks) aided the Byzantines in overrunning <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_%2528country%2529.htm" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>. A marriage was even contemplated between Ziebel&#39;s son and Heraclius&#39; daughter, but never took place.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th</a> and <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th centuries</a> the Khazar fought a series of wars against the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad <!--del_lnk--> Caliphate, which was attempting simultaneously to expand its influence into <!--del_lnk--> Transoxiana and the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus. The first war was fought in the early <!--del_lnk--> 650 and ended with the defeat of an Arab force led by <!--del_lnk--> Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah outside the Khazar town of <!--del_lnk--> Balanjar, after a battle in which both sides used <!--del_lnk--> siege engines on the others&#39; troops.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan, <!--del_lnk--> Irbis, from this period, and describe him as a scion of the Gokturk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is the issue of whether he can be identified with one of the many <!--del_lnk--> Gokturk rulers of the same name.<p>Several further conflicts erupted in the decades that followed, with Arab attacks and Khazar raids into <!--del_lnk--> Kurdistan and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the Gok Turks in Transoxiana.<p><a id="Khazars_and_Byzantium" name="Khazars_and_Byzantium"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Khazars and Byzantium</span></h3>
      <p>Khazar overlordship over most of the <!--del_lnk--> Crimea dates back to the late <!--del_lnk--> 600s. In the mid <!--del_lnk--> 700s the rebellious <!--del_lnk--> Crimean Goths were put down and their city, <!--del_lnk--> Doros (modern Mangup) occupied. A Khazar tudun was resident at <!--del_lnk--> Cherson in the <!--del_lnk--> 690s, despite the fact that this town was nominally subject to the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>.<p>They are also known to have been allied with the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> during at least part of the 700s. In <!--del_lnk--> 704/<!--del_lnk--> 705 <!--del_lnk--> Justinian II, exiled in <!--del_lnk--> Cherson, escaped into Khazar territory and married the sister of the Khagan, <!--del_lnk--> Busir. With the aid of his wife, he escaped from Busir, who was intriguing against him with the usurper <!--del_lnk--> Tiberius III, murdering two Khazar officials in the process. He fled to <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, whose Khan <!--del_lnk--> Tervel helped him regain the throne. The Khazars later provided aid to the rebel general <!--del_lnk--> Bardanes, who seized the throne in <!--del_lnk--> 711 as Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Philippicus.<p>The Byzantine emperor <!--del_lnk--> Leo III married his son Constantine (later <!--del_lnk--> Constantine V Kopronymous) to the Khazar princess <!--del_lnk--> Tzitzak (daughter of the Khagan <!--del_lnk--> Bihar) as part of the alliance between the two empires. Tzitzak, who was baptized as <!--del_lnk--> Irene, became famous for her wedding gown, which started a fashion craze in Constantinople for a type of robe (for men) called <i>tzitzakion</i>. Their son Leo (<!--del_lnk--> Leo IV) would be better known as &quot;Leo the Khazar&quot;.<p><a id="Second_Khazar-Arab_war" name="Second_Khazar-Arab_war"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Second Khazar-Arab war</span></h3>

      <p>Hostilities broke out again with the Caliphate in the <!--del_lnk--> 710s, with raids back and forth across the Caucasus but few decisive battles. The Khazars, led by a prince named <!--del_lnk--> Barjik, invaded northwestern <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad forces at <!--del_lnk--> Ardebil in <!--del_lnk--> 730, killing the Arab warlord <!--del_lnk--> al-Djarrah al-Hakami and briefly occupying the town. They were defeated the next year at <!--del_lnk--> Mosul, where Barjik directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah&#39;s severed head, and Barjik was killed. Arab armies led first by the Arab prince <!--del_lnk--> Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik and then by Marwan ibn Muhammad (later Caliph <!--del_lnk--> Marwan II) poured across the Caucasus and eventually (in <!--del_lnk--> 737) defeated a Khazar army led by <!--del_lnk--> Hazer Tarkhan, briefly occupying <!--del_lnk--> Atil itself and possibly forcing the Khagan to convert to Islam. The instability of the Umayyad regime made a permanent occupation impossible; the Arab armies withdrew and Khazar independence was re-asserted. It has been speculated that the adoption of <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> (which in this theory would have taken place around <!--del_lnk--> 740) was part of this re-assertion of <!--del_lnk--> independence.<p>It is worth noting that around <!--del_lnk--> 739, Arab sources give the name of the ruler of the Khazars as <!--del_lnk--> Parsbit or Barsbek, a woman who appears to have directed military operations against them. This suggests that women could have very high positions within the Khazar state, possibly even as a stand-in for the khagan.<p>Although they stopped the <!--del_lnk--> Arab expansion into <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe for some time after these wars, the Khazars were forced to withdraw behind the Caucasus. In the ensuing decades they extended their territories from the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a> in the east (Many cultures still call the Caspian Sea &quot;Khazar Sea&quot;; e.g. &quot;X&#x259;z&#x259;r d&#x259;nizi&quot; in <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijani_people.htm" title="Azeri">Azeri</a>, &quot;Hazar Denizi&quot; in Turkish, &quot;Bahr ul-Khazar&quot; in Arabic, &quot;Darya-ye Khazar&quot; in Persian) to the steppe region north of <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> in the west, as far west at least as the <!--del_lnk--> Dnieper River.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 758, the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> <!--del_lnk--> Caliph Abdullah <!--del_lnk--> al-Mansur ordered <!--del_lnk--> Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami, one of his nobles and military governor of <a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, to take a royal Khazar bride and make peace. Yazid took home a daughter of Khagan <!--del_lnk--> Baghatur, the Khazar leader. Unfortunately, the girl died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. A Khazar general named <!--del_lnk--> Ras Tarkhan invaded what is now northwestern Iran, plundering and raiding for several months. Thereafter relations between the Khazars and the <!--del_lnk--> Abbasid Caliphate (whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than its Umayyad predecessor) became increasingly cordial.<p><a id="Khazar_religion" name="Khazar_religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Khazar religion</span></h2>

      <p>Originally, the Khazars practiced traditional Turkic <!--del_lnk--> shamanism, focused on the sky <a href="../../wp/d/Deity.htm" title="Deity">god</a> <!--del_lnk--> Tengri, but were heavily influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Confucian ideas imported from <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, notably that of the <!--del_lnk--> Mandate of Heaven. The <!--del_lnk--> Ashina clan were considered to be the chosen of Tengri and the kaghan was the incarnation of the favor the sky-god bestowed on the Turks. A kaghan who failed had clearly lost the god&#39;s favour and was typically <!--del_lnk--> ritually executed. Historians have sometimes wondered, only half in jest, if the Khazar tendency to occasionally execute their rulers on religious grounds led those rulers to seek out other religions.<p>The Khazars worshipped a number of deities subordinate to Tengri, including the fertility <!--del_lnk--> goddess <!--del_lnk--> Umay, <!--del_lnk--> Kuara, a thunder god, and <!--del_lnk--> Erlik, the god of death.<p><a id="Conversion_to_Judaism_and_relations_with_world_Jewry" name="Conversion_to_Judaism_and_relations_with_world_Jewry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Conversion to Judaism and relations with world Jewry</span></h3>

Jewish merchants such as the <!--del_lnk--> Radhanites regularly traded in Khazar territory, and may have wielded significant economic and political influence. Though their origins and history are somewhat unclear, the <!--del_lnk--> Mountain Jews also lived in or near Khazar territory and may have been allied with or subject to Khazar overlordship; it is conceivable that they too played a role in the conversion.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>At some point in the last decades of the <a href="../../wp/8/8th_century.htm" title="8th century">8th century</a> or the early <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">9th century</a>, the Khazar <!--del_lnk--> royalty and <!--del_lnk--> nobility converted to <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and part of the general population followed. The extent of the conversion is debated. <!--del_lnk--> Ibn al-Faqih reported in the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a> that &quot;all the Khazars are Jews.&quot; Notwithstanding this statement, most scholars believed that only the upper classes converted to Judaism; there is some support for this in contemporary Muslim texts. However, recent archeological excavations have uncovered widespread shifts in burial practices. Around the mid 800s burials in Khazaria began to take on a decidedly Jewish flavor. Grave goods disappeared almost altogether. Judging by interment evidence, by <!--del_lnk--> 950 Judaism had become widespread among all classes of Khazar society.<p>Essays in the <!--del_lnk--> Kuzari, written by <!--del_lnk--> Yehuda Halevi, details a moral liturgical reason for the conversion which some consider a moral tale. Some researchers have suggested part of the reason for this mass conversion was political expediency to maintain a degree of <!--del_lnk--> neutrality: the Khazar empire was between growing populations, <!--del_lnk--> Muslims to the east and <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christians</a> to the west. Both religions recognized Judaism as a forebear and worthy of some respect. The exact date of the conversion is hotly contested. It may have occurred as early as 740 or as late as the mid <!--del_lnk--> 800s. Recently-discovered <!--del_lnk--> numismatic evidence suggests that Judaism was the established state religion by c. <!--del_lnk--> 830, and though <!--del_lnk--> St. Cyril (who visited Khazaria in <!--del_lnk--> 861) did not identify the Khazars as Jews, the khagan of that period, Zachariah, had a biblical Hebrew name. Some medieval sources give the name of the <!--del_lnk--> rabbi who oversaw the conversion of the Khazars as <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Sangari or <!--del_lnk--> Yitzhak ha-Sangari.<p>The first Jewish Khazar king was named <!--del_lnk--> Bulan which means &quot;<!--del_lnk--> elk&quot;, though some sources give him the Hebrew name <!--del_lnk--> Sabriel. A later king, <!--del_lnk--> Obadiah, strengthened Judaism, inviting <!--del_lnk--> rabbis into the kingdom and building <!--del_lnk--> synagogues. Jewish figures such as <!--del_lnk--> Saadia Gaon made positive references to the Khazars, and they are excoriated in contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Karaite writings as &quot;bastards&quot;; it is therefore unlikely that they adopted Karaism as some (such as <!--del_lnk--> Avraham Firkovich) have proposed.<p>The Khazars enjoyed close relations with the Jews of the <!--del_lnk--> Levant and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Persia</a>. The Persian Jews, for example, hoped that the Khazars might succeed in conquering the Caliphate. The high esteem in which the Khazars were held among the Jews of the Orient may be seen in the application to them, in an <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> commentary on <!--del_lnk--> Isaiah ascribed by some to <!--del_lnk--> Saadia Gaon, and by others to <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Nahawandi, of <!--del_lnk--> Isaiah 48:14: &quot;The Lord hath loved him.&quot; &quot;This,&quot; says the commentary, &quot;refers to the Khazars, who will go and destroy <!--del_lnk--> Babel&quot; (i.e., <!--del_lnk--> Babylonia), a name used to designate the country of the Arabs. From the <!--del_lnk--> Khazar Correspondence it is apparent that two Spanish Jews, Judah ben Meir ben Nathan and Joseph Gagris, had succeeded in settling in the land of the Khazars. Saadia, who had a fair knowledge of the kingdom of the Khazars, mentions a certain Isaac ben Abraham who had removed from <!--del_lnk--> Sura to Khazaria.<p>Likewise, the Khazar rulers viewed themselves as the protectors of international <!--del_lnk--> Jewry, and corresponded with foreign Jewish leaders (the <!--del_lnk--> letters exchanged between the Khazar ruler <!--del_lnk--> Joseph and the Spanish rabbi <!--del_lnk--> Hasdai ibn Shaprut have been preserved). They were known to retaliate against Muslim or Christian interests in Khazaria for persecution of Jews abroad. <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Fadlan relates that around <!--del_lnk--> 920 the Khazar ruler received information that Muslims had destroyed a synagogue in the land of <!--del_lnk--> Babung, in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>; he gave orders that the <!--del_lnk--> minaret of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> in his capital should be broken off, and the <!--del_lnk--> muezzin executed. He further declared that he would have destroyed all the mosques in the country had he not been afraid that the Muslims would in turn destroy all the synagogues in their lands.<p><a id="Other_religions" name="Other_religions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other religions</span></h3>
      <p>Besides <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a>, other religions probably practiced in areas ruled by the Khazars include <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Nestorian, and <!--del_lnk--> Monophysite Christianity, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism as well as <!--del_lnk--> Norse, <!--del_lnk--> Finnic, and <a href="../../wp/s/Slavic_mythology.htm" title="Slavic mythology">Slavic</a> cults. Religious toleration was maintained for the kingdom&#39;s three hundred plus years. The &quot;apostle of the Slavs&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Cyril, is said to have attempted the conversion of Khazars without enduring results. Many Khazars reportedly were converts to Christianity and Islam. (See &quot;Judiciary&quot;, below.)<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Khazar_Kingship" name="Khazar_Kingship"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Khazar Kingship</span></h3>
      <p>Khazar kingship was divided between the <!--del_lnk--> khagan and the <!--del_lnk--> Bek or <!--del_lnk--> Khagan Bek. Contemporary Arab historians related that the Khagan was purely a spiritual ruler or figurehead with limited powers, while the Bek was responsible for administration and military affairs.<p>Both the Khagan and the Khagan Bek lived in Itil. The Khagan&#39;s palace, according to Arab sources, was on an island in the Volga River. He was reported to have 25 wives, each the daughter of a client ruler; this may, however, have been an exaggeration.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Khazar Correspondence, <!--del_lnk--> King Joseph identifies himself as the ruler of the Khazars and makes no reference to a colleague. It has been disputed whether Joseph was a Khagan or a Bek; his description of his military campaigns make the latter probable. A third option is that by the time of the Correspondence (c. 950-<!--del_lnk--> 960) the Khazars had merged the two positions into a single ruler, or that the Beks had somehow supplanted the Khagans or vice versa.<p><a id="Army" name="Army"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Army</span></h3>

      <p>Khazar armies were led by the <!--del_lnk--> Khagan Bek and commanded by subordinate <!--del_lnk--> officers known as <!--del_lnk--> tarkhans. A famous tarkhan referred to in <!--del_lnk--> Arab sources as <!--del_lnk--> Ras or As Tarkhan led an invasion of <a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenia</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 758. The army included regiments of <!--del_lnk--> Muslim auxiliaries known as <!--del_lnk--> Arsiyah, of <!--del_lnk--> Khwarezmian or <!--del_lnk--> Alan extraction, who were quite influential. These regiments were exempt from campaigning against their fellow Muslims. Early <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> sources sometimes referred to the city of <!--del_lnk--> Khazaran (across the <a href="../../wp/v/Volga_River.htm" title="Volga River">Volga River</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Atil) as <!--del_lnk--> Khvalisy and the Khazar (<a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian</a>) sea as <!--del_lnk--> Khvaliskoye. According to some scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Omeljan Pritsak, these terms were <!--del_lnk--> East Slavic versions of &quot;Khwarezmian&quot; and referred to these <!--del_lnk--> mercenaries.<p>In addition to the Bek&#39;s standing army, the Khazars could call upon tribal levies in times of danger and were often joined by <!--del_lnk--> auxiliaries from subject nations.<p><a id="Other_officials" name="Other_officials"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other officials</span></h3>
      <p>Settlements were governed by administrative officials known as <!--del_lnk--> tuduns. In some cases (such as the Byzantine settlements in southern <!--del_lnk--> Crimea), a tudun would be appointed for a town nominally within another polity&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sphere of influence.<p>Other officials in the Khazar government included dignitaries referred to by <!--del_lnk--> ibn Fadlan as <i><!--del_lnk--> Jawyshyghr</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Kundur</i>, but their responsibilities are unknown.<p><a id="Judiciary" name="Judiciary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Judiciary</span></h3>
      <p>Muslim sources report that the Khazar supreme court consisted of two <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a>, two <!--del_lnk--> Christians, two <!--del_lnk--> Muslims, and a &quot;heathen&quot; (whether this is a Turkic shaman or a priest of Slavic or Norse religion is unclear), and a citizen had the right to be judged according to the laws of his religion. Some have argued that this configuration is unlikely, as a Beit Din, or rabbinical court, requires three members. It is therefore possible that as practitioners of the state religion, the Jews had three judges on the Supreme Court rather than two, and that the Muslim sources were attempting to downplay their influence. A <!--del_lnk--> Muslim or <!--del_lnk--> Christian court can function with only one or two judges.<p><a id="Economic_position" name="Economic_position"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economic position</span></h2>

      <p>The Khazars occupied a prime <!--del_lnk--> trade nexus. Goods from western Europe travelled east to Central Asia and China and vice versa, and the Muslim world could only interact with northern Europe via Khazar intermediaries. The <!--del_lnk--> Radhanites, a guild of medieval Jewish merchants, had a trade route that ran through Khazaria, and may have been instrumental in the Khazars&#39; conversion to Judaism.<p>No Khazar paid taxes to the central government. Revenue came from a 10% levy on goods transiting through the region, and from tribute paid by subject nations. The Khazars exported <a href="../../wp/h/Honey.htm" title="Honey">honey</a>, <!--del_lnk--> furs, <!--del_lnk--> wool, <!--del_lnk--> millet and other <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereals</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> slaves. D.M. Dunlop and Artamanov asserted that the Khazars produced no material goods themselves, living solely off of trade. This theory has been refuted by discoveries over the last half-century, which include pottery and glass factories.<p><a id="Khazar_coinage" name="Khazar_coinage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Khazar coinage</span></h3>
      <p>The Khazars are known to have minted silver coins, called <i><!--del_lnk--> Yarmaqs</i>. Many of these were copies of Arab <!--del_lnk--> dirhems. Coins of the Caliphate were in widespread use due to their reliable silver content. Merchants from as far away as <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia accepted them regardless of their inability to read the Arab writing. Thus issuing imitation dirhems was a way to ensure acceptance of Khazar coinage in foreign lands.<p>Some surviving examples bear the legend &quot;Ard al-Khazar&quot; (Arabic for &quot;land of the Khazars&quot;). In 1999 a hoard of <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> coins was discovered on the property of the Spillings farm in the <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> island of <!--del_lnk--> Gotland. Among the coins were several dated 837/8 CE and bearing the legend, in <!--del_lnk--> Arabic script, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Moses is the Prophet of God&quot; (a modification of the Muslim coin inscription &quot;<a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> is the Prophet of God&quot;). In &quot;Creating Khazar Identity through Coins&quot;, Roman Kovavlev postulated that these dirhems were a special <!--del_lnk--> commemorative issue celebrating the adoption of Judaism by the Khazar ruler Bulan.<p><a id="Extent_of_influence" name="Extent_of_influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Extent of influence</span></h2>
      <p>The Khazar Khaganate was, at its height, an immensely powerful state. The Khazar heartland was on the lower Volga and the Caspian coast as far south as <!--del_lnk--> Derbent. In addition, from the late 600s the Khazars controlled most of the <!--del_lnk--> Crimea and the northeast littoral of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. By 800 Khazar holdings included most of the Pontic steppe as far west as the Dneiper and as far east as the Aral Sea (some Turkic history atlases show the Khazar sphere of influence extending well east of the Aral). During the Khazar-Arab war of the early 700s, some Khazars evacuated to the <!--del_lnk--> Ural foothills, and some settlements may have remained.<p><a id="Khazar_towns" name="Khazar_towns"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Khazar towns</span></h3>

      <p>At some point in the ninth century (as reported by <!--del_lnk--> Constantine Porphyrogenitus) a group of three Khazar clans called the <!--del_lnk--> Kabars revolted against the Khazar government. <!--del_lnk--> Omeljan Pritsak and others have speculated that the revolt had something to do with a rejection of rabbinic Judaism; this is unlikely as it is believed that both the Kabars and mainstream Khazars had pagan, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim members. Pritsak maintained that the Kabars were led by the Khagan Khan-Tuvan Dyggvi in a war against the Bek. In any event Pritsak cited no primary source for his propositions in this matter. The Kabars were defeated and joined a confederacy led by the Magyars. It has been speculated that &quot;Hungarian&quot; derives from the Turkic word &quot;Onogur&quot;, or &quot;Ten Arrows&quot;, referring to seven <!--del_lnk--> Finno-Ugric tribes and the three tribes of the Kabars.<p>In the closing years of the ninth century the Khazars and Oghuz allied to attack the Pechenegs, who had been attacking both nations.

      <p>The alliance with the Byzantines began to collapse in the early <!--del_lnk--> 900s, possibly as a result of the conversion to Judaism. Byzantine and Khazar forces may have clashed in the Crimea, and by the <!--del_lnk--> 940s <!--del_lnk--> Constantine VII Porphyrogentius was speculating in <i><!--del_lnk--> De Administrando Imperio</i> about ways in which the Khazars could be isolated and attacked. The Byzantines during the same period began to attempt alliances with the Pechenegs and the Rus, with varying degrees of success.<p>From the beginning of the tenth century, the Khazars found themselves fighting on multiple fronts as nomadic incursions were exacerbated by uprisings by former clients and invasions from former allies, often at Byzantine instigation. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Schechter Text, the Khazar ruler <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin ben Menahem fought a war against a coalition of &quot;&#39;SY, TWRQY, &#39;BM, and PYYNYL,&quot; who were instigated and aided by &quot;MQDWN&quot;. MQDWN or <a href="../../wp/m/Macedon.htm" title="Macedon">Macedon</a> refers to the Byzantine Empire in many medieval Jewish writings; the other entities named have been tenuously identified by scholars including Omeljan Pritsak with the <!--del_lnk--> Burtas, <!--del_lnk--> Oghuz Turks, <!--del_lnk--> Volga Bulgars and <!--del_lnk--> Pechenegs, respectively. Though Benjamin was victorious, his son <!--del_lnk--> Aaron II had to face another Byzantine-inspired invasion, this time led by the <!--del_lnk--> Alans. Aaron defeated the Alans with Oghuz help, yet within a few years the Oghuz and Khazars were enemies.<p><!--del_lnk--> Ibn Fadlan reported Oghuz hostility to the Khazars during his journey c. 921. Some sources, discussed by Tamara Rice, claim that <!--del_lnk--> Seljuk, the eponymous progenitor of the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuk Turks, began his career as an Oghuz soldier in Khazar service in the early and mid tenth century, rising to high rank before he fell out with the Khazar rulers and departed for <!--del_lnk--> Khwarazm.<p><a id="Rise_of_Rus" name="Rise_of_Rus"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rise of Rus</span></h3>
      <p>Originally the Khazars were probably allied with various <!--del_lnk--> Norse factions who controlled the region around <!--del_lnk--> Novgorod. The <!--del_lnk--> Rus&#39; Khaganate, an early Rus polity in northwestern Russia, was probably heavily influenced by the Khazars. The Rus&#39; regularly travelled through Khazar-held territory to attack territories around the Black and Caspian Seas; in one such raid, the Khagan is said to have given his assent on the condition that the Rus&#39; give him half of the booty. In addition, the Khazars allowed the Rus to use the <!--del_lnk--> trade route along the Volga River. This alliance was apparently fostered by the hostility between the Khazars and Arabs. At a certain point, however, the Khazar connivance to the sacking of the Muslim lands by the <!--del_lnk--> Varangians led to a backlash against the Norsemen from the Muslim population of the Khaganate. The Khazar rulers closed the passage down the Volga for the Rus&#39;, sparking a war. In the early 960s, Khazar ruler <!--del_lnk--> Joseph wrote to <!--del_lnk--> Hasdai ibn Shaprut about the deterioration of Khazar relations with the Rus: &quot;I have to wage war with them, for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>.&quot;<p>The Rus warlords <a href="../../wp/o/Oleg_of_Novgorod.htm" title="Oleg of Novgorod">Oleg of Novgorod</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sviatoslav I of Kiev launched several wars against the Khazar khaganate, often with Byzantine connivance. The Schechter Letter relates the story of a campaign against Khazaria by HLGW (Oleg) around <!--del_lnk--> 941 (in which Oleg was defeated by the Khazar general <!--del_lnk--> Pesakh; this calls into question the timeline of the <!--del_lnk--> Primary Chronicle and other related works on the history of the Eastern Slavs.<p>Sviatoslav finally succeeded in destroying Khazar imperial power in the <!--del_lnk--> 960s. The Khazar fortresses of <!--del_lnk--> Sarkel and <!--del_lnk--> Tamatarkha fell to the Rus in <!--del_lnk--> 965, with the capital city of <!--del_lnk--> Atil following circa <!--del_lnk--> 967 or <!--del_lnk--> 969. A visitor to Atil wrote soon after the sacking of the city: &quot;The Rus attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch.&quot;<p><a id="Khazars_outside_Khazaria" name="Khazars_outside_Khazaria"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Khazars outside Khazaria</span></h2>
      <p>Khazar communities existed outside those areas under Khazar overlordship. Many Khazar <!--del_lnk--> mercenaries served in the armies of the <!--del_lnk--> Caliphate and other <!--del_lnk--> Islamic states. Documents from medieval <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople attest to a Khazar community mingled with the Jews of the suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Pera. Christian Khazars also lived in Constantinople, and some served in its armies. The <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch <!--del_lnk--> Photius I of Constantinople was once angrily referred to by the Emperor as &quot;Khazar-face&quot;, though whether this refers to his actual lineage or is a generic insult is unclear. <!--del_lnk--> Abraham ibn Daud reported Khazar <!--del_lnk--> rabbinical students, or rabbinical students who were the descendents of Khazars, in 12th century <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Jews from Kiev and elsewhere in Russia, who may or may not have been Khazars, were reported in France, Germany and England. The <!--del_lnk--> Kabars who settled in <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a> in the late ninth and early tenth centuries may have included Jews among their number. Many Khazar Jews probably fled foreign conquest into Hungary and elsewhere in <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe. There they likely merged with local Jews and ensuing waves of Jewish immigration from Germany and Western Europe. They most likely did not constitute the dominant group within Eastern European Jewry, as <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Koestler maintained (see below). <!--del_lnk--> Polish legends speak of Jews being present in <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> before the establishment of the Polish monarchy. Polish coins from the 12th and 13th centuries sometimes bore Slavic inscriptions written in the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew alphabet <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  though connecting these coins to Khazar influence is purely a matter of speculation.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Debate</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Date_and_extent_of_the_conversion" name="Date_and_extent_of_the_conversion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Date and extent of the conversion</span></h3>
      <p>The date of the conversion, and whether it occurred as one event or as a sequence of events over time, is widely disputed. The issues surrounding this controversy are discussed above.<p>The number of Khazars who converted to Judaism is also hotly contested. <!--del_lnk--> D.M. Dunlop was of the opinion that only the upper class converted; this was the majority view until relatively recently. The relatively sudden shift in burial customs during the mid 800s suggests a more widespread conversion, which hypothesis has been recently championed by <!--del_lnk--> Kevin A. Brook.<p><a id="Alleged_Khazar_ancestry_of_Ashkenazim" name="Alleged_Khazar_ancestry_of_Ashkenazim"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alleged Khazar ancestry of Ashkenazim</span></h3>
      <p>The novelist <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Koestler alleged in a book (in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Thirteenth Tribe</i>), that modern <!--del_lnk--> Ashkenazi Jews are of Khazarian ancestry rather than Jewish. According to <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Lewis:<blockquote>
       <p>This theory... is supported by no evidence whatsoever. It has long since been abandoned by all serious scholars in the field, including those in Arab countries, where the Khazar theory is little used except in occasional political polemics.</blockquote>
      <p>DNA studies demonstrate that Ashkenazi <!--del_lnk--> Y-Chromosome Jews originated in Middle Eastern populations,  as has the <!--del_lnk--> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of at least 40% of the current Ashkenazi population. So although Khazars might have been absorbed into the Jewish population it is unlikely that they formed a large percentage of the ancestors of modern Ashkenazim. <p>Another criticism that has been leveled against Koestler&#39;s work is that he largely appropriated his history from such sources as <!--del_lnk--> D.M. Dunlop, sometimes without proper attribution. Moreover, it has been pointed out that his more speculative second half (discussing his theories about Ashkenazi descent) is largely unsupported; to the extent that Koestler referred to place-names and documentary evidence his analysis has been described as a mixture of flawed etymologies and misinterpreted primary sources.<p>Other critics of the Khazar-Ashkenazi theory have stated that the prime motive for even the small degree of acceptance of these ideas is because they have become political and <!--del_lnk--> anti-Zionist in nature. The Khazar theory has been adopted by many anti-Zionists, especially in the Arab world; such proponents of the theory argue that if Ashkenazi Jews are primarily Khazar in origin, then they would be outside the scope of <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a>&#39;s promise of <!--del_lnk--> Canaan to <!--del_lnk--> Israelites as recorded in the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a>. This ignores, of course, the fact that the Biblical promise explicitly includes converts, and the fact that over half of Israeli Jews are not Ashkenazi. (see <!--del_lnk--> Demographics of Israel, <!--del_lnk--> Jewish exodus from Arab lands) Some have countered that such charges of a political motive are not relevant to the core of the argument; in any event, Koestler himself was emphatically pro-<!--del_lnk--> Zionist based upon <!--del_lnk--> secular considerations.<p>The Khazar claim has also served as a catalyst for state anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and a justification for conquest by Russian nationalists. <!--del_lnk--> <p>Others have claimed Khazar origins for such groups as the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_Karaites.htm" title="Crimean Karaites">Karaim</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Krymchaks, <!--del_lnk--> Mountain Jews, and <!--del_lnk--> Georgian Jews. There is little evidence to support any of these theories, although it is possible that some Khazar descendants found their way into these communities. Non-Jewish groups who claim at least partial descent from the Khazars include the <!--del_lnk--> Kumyks and <!--del_lnk--> Crimean Tatars; as with the above-mentioned Jewish groups, these claims are subject to a great deal of controversy and debate.<p>Anti-Semites and anti-Zionists use the alleged Khazarian ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews as a means of dismissing Jewish claims to <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>.<p><a id="In_fiction" name="In_fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In fiction</span></h2>
      <p>The question of mass religious conversion is a central theme in <!--del_lnk--> Milorad Pavi&#x107;&#39;s international bestselling novel <!--del_lnk--> Dictionary of the Khazars. The novel, however, contained many invented elements and had little to do with actual Khazar history. More recently, several novels, including <!--del_lnk--> H.N. Turteltaub&#39;s <i>Justinian</i> (about the life of Justinian II) and <!--del_lnk--> Marek Halter&#39;s <i>Book of Abraham</i> and <i>Wind of the Khazars</i> have dealt either directly or indirectly with the topic of the Khazars and their role in history.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars&quot;</div>
