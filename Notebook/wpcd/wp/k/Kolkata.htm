      <p>The names <i>Kolkata</i> and <i>Calcutta</i> were <!--del_lnk--> probably based on <i>Kalikata</i>, the name of one of the three villages (<!--del_lnk--> Kalikata, <!--del_lnk--> Sutanuti, <!--del_lnk--> Gobindapur) in the area before the arrival of the British. &quot;Kalikata&quot;, in turn, is an <!--del_lnk--> anglicised version of <i>Kalikshetra</i> (&quot;Land of the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Kali&quot;). However, other theories exist regarding the origin of the name. The original settlement of the city was claimed to be located beside a <i>khal</i>, meaning a canal in <!--del_lnk--> Bengali. <i>Khal</i> might have given rise to the name. Again, the place was known for the manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> shell-lime and the name could have been derived from lime (<i>kali</i>) and burnt <!--del_lnk--> shell (<i>kata</i>). Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term <i>kilkila</i> (&quot;flat area&quot;). The government of West Bengal changed the official name of the city from <i>Calcutta</i> to <i>Kolkata</i>; the new name was legalised in 2001. A number of other Indian cities have enacted <!--del_lnk--> similar name changes.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The discovery of the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Chandraketugarh, an archaeological site, provides evidence that the area has been inhabited for over two millennia. The city&#39;s documented history, however, begins with the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">British East India Company</a> in 1690, when the Company was consolidating its trade business in <!--del_lnk--> Bengal. <!--del_lnk--> Job Charnock, an administrator with the Company who eventually settled in Sutanuti after invading through <!--del_lnk--> Hijli Kingdom, is traditionally credited as the founder of this city.<p>In 1699,the British completed the construction of old <!--del_lnk--> Fort William, which was used to station its troops and as a regional base. Kolkata (then Calcutta) was declared a <!--del_lnk--> Presidency City, and later became the headquarters of the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal Presidency. Faced with frequent skirmishes with <!--del_lnk--> French forces, in 1756 the British began to upgrade their fortifications. When protests against the militarisation by the <!--del_lnk--> Nawab of Bengal <!--del_lnk--> Siraj-Ud-Daulah went unheeded, he attacked and captured Fort William leading to the infamous <!--del_lnk--> Black Hole incident. A force of Company <!--del_lnk--> sepoys and British troops led by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year. Clive himself described it as <i>one of the most wicked places in the Universe</i>.<p>Kolkata was named the capital of <!--del_lnk--> British India in 1772. A contemporary description refers to <i>the splendid sloth and languid debauchery of European society</i>, when <i>great men rode about in State coaches, with a dozen servants running before and behind them to bawl out their titles</i>. It was during this period that the marshes surrounding the city were drained and the government area was laid out along the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Hooghly River. <!--del_lnk--> Richard Wellesley, the <!--del_lnk--> Governor General between 1797-1805, was largely responsible for the growth of the city and its public architecture which led to the description of Kolkata as &#39;the City of Palaces&#39;. Miss Emily Eden (the sister of the Governor General, who gave her name to Eden Gardens), in 1836 wrote of Calcutta: &quot;Depend upon it, Calcutta is the finest place in the world. I know there are towns with far larger and grander buildings; but then they are not half so clean, and new, and beautiful, as this bride-like city. I have been standing on the roof of the house the last half-hour for air, and, as it was midnight, had an opportunity of seeing all the gay company - returning from an entertainment at the government-house; and I assure you I never witnessed any thing that could compare with the splendour exhibited.&quot; <div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>By the early 19th century, Kolkata was split into two distinct areas &mdash; one British, one Indian, known as &#39;Black Town&#39;. Even at the time, the poverty of the &#39;Black Town&#39; shanties was considered shocking. The city underwent rapid industrial growth from the 1850s, especially in the textile and <!--del_lnk--> jute sectors; this caused a massive investment in infrastructure projects like rail roads and telegraph by British government. The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the emergence of a new class of urbane Indians &mdash; <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> middle class &mdash; whose members were often professionals, read newspapers, were <!--del_lnk--> Anglophiles, and usually belonged to upper-<!--del_lnk--> caste <!--del_lnk--> Hindu communities. Throughout the nineteenth century, a socio-cultural reform, often referred to as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bengal Renaissance</i> resulted in the general uplifting of the people. In 1883, <!--del_lnk--> Surendranath Banerjea organised a <!--del_lnk--> national conference &mdash; the first of its kind in nineteenth century India. Gradually Kolkata became a centre of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">Indian independence movement</a>, especially <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary organisations. The <!--del_lnk--> 1905 Partition of Bengal on communal grounds resulted in widespread public agitation and the boycott of British goods (swadeshi movement). These activities, along with the administratively disadvantageous location of Kolkata in the eastern fringes of India, prompted the British to move the capital to <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a> in 1911. The city&#39;s port was bombed twice by the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As food stocks were being diverted to feed Allied troops, millions starved to death during the <!--del_lnk--> Bengal famine of 1943. In 1946, demands for the creation of a Muslim state led to large-scale communal violence resulting in the deaths of over 2,000 people. The <!--del_lnk--> partition of India also created intense violence and a shift in demographics - large numbers of Muslims left for <!--del_lnk--> East Pakistan, while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.<p>Over the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent <!--del_lnk--> Marxist-Maoist movement &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Naxalites &mdash; damaged much of the city&#39;s infrastructure, leading to an economic stagnation. In 1971, war between India and Pakistan led to the mass influx of thousands of refugees into Kolkata resulting in a massive strain on its infrastructure. In the mid-1980s, <a href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> overtook Kolkata as India&#39;s most populous city. Kolkata has been a strong base of Indian communism as West Bengal has been ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> CPI(M) dominated <!--del_lnk--> Left Front for three decades now &mdash; the world&#39;s longest-running democratically-elected <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a> government. The city&#39;s economic recovery gathered momentum after <!--del_lnk--> economic reforms in India introduced by the central government in the mid-1990s. Since 2000, <!--del_lnk--> Information Technology (IT) services revitalized the city&rsquo;s stagnant economy. The city has also experienced a growth in the manufacturing sector. Following similar moves elsewhere in the country, the state government changed the city&rsquo;s official name from <i>Calcutta</i> to <i>Kolkata</i> in 2001; this act was seen largely as a political ploy.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Kolkata is located in eastern India at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 22&deg;33&prime;N 88&deg;20&prime;E</span> in the <!--del_lnk--> Ganges Delta at an elevation ranging between 1.5 to 9&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres. It is spread linearly along the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> River Hooghly in a north-south direction. Much of the city was originally a vast wetland, reclaimed over the decades to accommodate the city&#39;s burgeoning population. The <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans National Park separates the city from the <a href="../../wp/b/Bay_of_Bengal.htm" title="Bay of Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>, which is located about 154&nbsp;km to the south.<p>Like the most of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Gangetic plains, the predominant soil type is <!--del_lnk--> alluvial. Quaternary sediments consisting of clay, silt, various grades of sand and gravel underlie the city. These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds, the lower one at depths between 250 and 650&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m and the upper one ranging between 10 and 40&nbsp;m in thickness. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under <!--del_lnk--> seismic zone-III, in a scale of I to V (in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) while the wind and <!--del_lnk--> cyclone zoning is &quot;very high damage risk&quot;, according to <!--del_lnk--> UNDP report.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>Kolkata has a <!--del_lnk--> tropical climate. The annual mean temperature is 26.8&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;C (80&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F); monthly mean temperatures range from 19&nbsp;&deg;C to 30&nbsp;&deg;C (67&nbsp;&deg;F to 86&nbsp;&deg;F). Summers are hot and humid and maximum temperatures often exceed 40&nbsp;&deg;C (104&nbsp;&deg;F) during May and June. Winter tends to last for only about two and a half months, with seasonal lows dipping to the 12&nbsp;&deg;C &ndash; 14&nbsp;&deg;C between December and January. The highest recorded temperature is 43&nbsp;&deg;C (111&nbsp;&deg;F) and the lowest is 5&nbsp;&deg;C (41&nbsp;&deg;F). Often during early summer, dusty squalls followed by spells of thunderstorm and heavy rains lash the city, bringing relief from the humid heat. These thunderstorms are locally known as <i>Kal baisakhi</i> (Nor&#39;westers).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> southeast monsoon rains lash the city between June and September and supplies the city with most of its annual rainfall of 1,582&nbsp;mm. The highest rainfall occurs during the monsoon in August (306&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm). The city receives 2,528 hours of sunshine per annum, with the maximum sunlight occurring in March. Pollution is a major concern in Kolkata, and the <!--del_lnk--> Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) level is high when compared to other major cities of India, leading to regular <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smog</a> and <!--del_lnk--> haze.<p><a id="Urban_structure" name="Urban_structure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Urban structure</span></h2>
      <p>Kolkata city, under the jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), is not very large and has an area of 185&nbsp;km&sup2;. The Kolkata urban agglomeration, however, has continuously expanded and <!--del_lnk--> as of 2006, the urban agglomeration (<!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Metropolitan Area) is spread over 1750 km&sup2; and comprises of 157 postal areas. The urban agglomeration is formally administered by several local governments including 38 <!--del_lnk--> local municipalities. The urban agglomeration comprises of 72 cities and 527 towns and villages. The suburban areas of Kolkata metropolitan district incorporates parts of the districts <!--del_lnk--> North 24 Parganas, <!--del_lnk--> South 24 Parganas, <!--del_lnk--> Howrah, <!--del_lnk--> Hooghly and <!--del_lnk--> Nadia.<p>The east-to-west dimension of the proper city is narrow, stretching from the Hooghly River in the west to roughly the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east, a span of roughly 5&ndash;6&nbsp;km. The north-south expansion is roughly divided into North, Central and South Kolkata. North Kolkata locality is the oldest part of the city, with 19th century architecture and narrow alleyways. The ambience in this area is reminiscent of the old Kolkata. South Kolkata grew mostly after independence and consists of elite localities. The <!--del_lnk--> Salt lake City (Bidhan Nagar) area to the northeast of the city is a planned section of Kolkata. <!--del_lnk--> Rajarhat, also called New Town, is the newest township being developed on the north-eastern fringes of Kolkata city.<p>Central Kolkata houses the <!--del_lnk--> central business district around the <!--del_lnk--> B. B. D. Bagh area.

      <p>Kolkata is the main business, commercial and financial hub of <!--del_lnk--> eastern India and the <!--del_lnk--> northeastern states. It is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta Stock Exchange &mdash; India&#39;s second-largest <!--del_lnk--> bourse. It is also a major commercial and military port, and the only city in the region to have an international airport. Once India&#39;s leading city and Capital, Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the years following India&#39;s independence due to the prevalent unstabilised political condition and rise in trade-unionism supported by left-wing parties. Between the 1960s to the mid 1990s, flight of capital was enormous as many large factories were closed or downsized and businesses relocated. The lack of capital and resources coupled with a worldwide glut in demand in the city&#39;s traditional industries(e.g. jute) added to the depressed state of the city&#39;s economy. The liberalisation of the <a href="../../wp/e/Economy_of_India.htm" title="Economy of India">Indian economy</a> in the 1990s along with the election of a new reformist <!--del_lnk--> Chief Minister, <!--del_lnk--> Buddhadeb Bhattacharya have resulted in the improvement of the city&#39;s fortunes.<p>Until recently, flexible production had always been the norm in Kolkata, and the <!--del_lnk--> informal sector has comprised more than 40% of the labour force. State and federal government employees make up a large percentage of the city&#39;s workforce. The city has a large unskilled and semi-skilled labour population, alongwith other blue-collar and knowledge workers. Kolkata&#39;s economic revival was led largely by <!--del_lnk--> IT services, with the IT sector growing at 70% yearly &mdash; twice that of the national average. In recent years there has been a surge of investments in the housing infrastructure sector with several new projects coming up in the city. Kolkata is home to many industrial units operated by large Indian corporations with products ranging from electronics to jute. Some notable companies headquartered in Kolkata include <!--del_lnk--> ITC Limited, <!--del_lnk--> Bata India, <!--del_lnk--> Birla Corporation, <!--del_lnk--> Coal India Limited, <!--del_lnk--> Damodar Valley Corporation,<!--del_lnk--> United Bank of India, <!--del_lnk--> UCO Bank and <!--del_lnk--> Allahabad Bank <!--del_lnk--> Vijaya Bank. Recently, various events like adoption of &quot;Look East&quot; policy by the government of India, opening of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nathu_La.htm" title="Nathu La">Nathu La</a> Pass in Sikkim as a border trade-route with <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a> and immense interest in the <!--del_lnk--> South East Asian countries to enter the Indian market and invest have put Kolkata in an advantageous position.<p><a id="Civic_Administration" name="Civic_Administration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Civic Administration</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), (formerly the Calcutta Municipal Corporation), established in 1876, is responsible for the civic maintenance and infrastructure of Kolkata. The city is divided into 141 administrative <!--del_lnk--> wards that are grouped into 15 <!--del_lnk--> boroughs. Each of these wards elects a <!--del_lnk--> councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee consisting of the councillors elected from the respective wards of the borough. The Corporation, through the borough committees, maintains government-aided schools, hospitals and municipal markets and partakes in urban planning and road maintenance. The corporation as the apex body discharges its function through the <!--del_lnk--> Mayor-in-Council, consisting of a mayor, assisted by a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The mayor is responsible for the overall functioning of the KMC and has a tenure of five-years. At present, the <!--del_lnk--> CPI(M) led <!--del_lnk--> Left Front holds the power in KMC.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The city also has an apolitical <!--del_lnk--> titular post, that of the <!--del_lnk--> Sheriff of Kolkata. The Sheriff presides over various city-related functions and conferences. Another ancillary civic body is the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) responsible for the statutory planning and development of the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA). The KMA includes a large suburban <!--del_lnk--> hinterland around the urban centers of Kolkata.<p>As the capital of the state and the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of West Bengal, Kolkata houses the state <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Assembly, the Secretariat (<!--del_lnk--> Writers&#39; Building) and the <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta High Court. Kolkata also has <!--del_lnk--> lower courts; the <!--del_lnk--> Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the <!--del_lnk--> Sessions Court for criminal cases. The <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Police, headed by the Police Commissioner, comes under the West Bengal Home Ministry. The city is administratively divided into five <!--del_lnk--> police-zones subdivided into 48 <!--del_lnk--> local police stations.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Public transport is provided by the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata suburban railway and the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Metro as well as by <!--del_lnk--> trams and buses. The suburban network is extensive and extends into the distant suburbs. The Kolkata Metro, run by the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Railways.htm" title="Indian Railways">Indian Railways</a>, is the oldest underground system in India. It runs parallel to the Hooghly and spans the north-south length of the city covering a distance of 16.45&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km. Buses are the preferred mode of transport and are run by both government agencies and private operators. Kolkata is India&#39;s only remaining city to have a tram network, operated by <!--del_lnk--> Calcutta Tramways Company. The slow-moving tram services are restricted to certain areas of the city.<p>Hired forms of mechanised transport include the all-yellow metered taxis, while <!--del_lnk--> auto rickshaws ply in specific routes. Almost all the taxis in Kolkata are <!--del_lnk--> Ambassadors. This is unlike most other cities where Tata Indica or <!--del_lnk--> Fiats are more common. In some areas of the city, <!--del_lnk--> cycle rickshaws and hand-pulled <!--del_lnk--> rickshaws are also patronised by the public for short distances. Private owned vehicles are less in number and usage compared to other major cities. However, the city witnessed a steady increase in the number of registered vehicles; 2002 data showed an increase of 44% over a period of seven years. The road space (matched with population density) in the city is only 6%, compared to 23% in Delhi and 17% in Mumbai, creating major traffic problems. Kolkata Metro Railway and a number of new roads and flyovers have decongested the traffic to some extent.<p>Kolkata has two major long distance <!--del_lnk--> railway stations at <!--del_lnk--> Howrah Station and <!--del_lnk--> Sealdah. A third station named Kolkata has been launched in early 2006. The city is the headquarters of two divisions of the Indian Railways &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Railway and <!--del_lnk--> South Eastern Railway.<p>The city&#39;s sole airport, the <!--del_lnk--> Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport at <!--del_lnk--> Dum Dum to the north of the city, operates both domestic and international flights. Kolkata is also a major riverport in eastern India. The <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata Port Trust manages both the Kolkata docks and the <!--del_lnk--> Haldia docks. There are passenger service to <!--del_lnk--> Port Blair in the <!--del_lnk--> Andaman and Nicobar Islands and <!--del_lnk--> cargo ship service to various <!--del_lnk--> ports in India and abroad, operated by the <!--del_lnk--> Shipping Corporation of India. Also there are ferry services connecting Kolkata with its twin city of <!--del_lnk--> Howrah.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
