      <p>At the turn of the last century Pashtun society was colonized, stagnant, violent, worn down by feuds, inequalities, factionalism, poor social cooperation, and plain ignorance. Education opportunities were strictly limited. Pashtuns are Muslims; and religious leaders and <!--del_lnk--> Mullahs were known to have told parents that if their children went to school, they would go to hell. Khan stated that &ldquo;the real purpose of this propaganda&rdquo; was to keep Pashtuns &ldquo;illiterate and uneducated&rdquo;, and hence his people &ldquo;were the most backward in India&rdquo; with regard to education. He also stated that by the time Islam reached his people centuries earlier, it had lost much of its original spiritual message.<p><a id="Origins_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Origins_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origins of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h2>
      <p>Formed out of the society for reformation of Pashtuns (Anjuman-e-Islah-e-Afghan), it initially targeted social reformation and launched campaigns against prostitution. Bacha Khan as its founder seemed to be influenced by the realisation that whenever British troops were faced with an armed uprising they eventually always overcame the rebellion. The same could not be said when using non violence against the troops.<p>The movement started prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre, when a demonstration of hundreds of non violent supporters were fired upon by British soldiers in <!--del_lnk--> Peshawar. Its low point and eventual disappaition was after Pakistan&#39;s independence in 1947 when the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim League Chief Minister <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Qayyum Khan banned the movement and launched a brutal crackdown on its members which culminated in the massacre at <!--del_lnk--> Babra Sharif massacre. At its peak the KK movement consisted of almost 100,000 members.<p>&quot;The Khidmatgar movement was one of self-reform and introspection,&quot; says Mukulika Banerjee, author of The Pathan Unarmed: Opposition and Memory in the North West Frontier (School of American Research Press, 2000). &quot;It involved two crucial elements: Islam and <!--del_lnk--> Pashtunwali (the Pashtun tribal code). Here nonviolence becomes an ideological system very compatible with Islam and Pakhtunwali, since these are reinterpreted.&quot;<p><a id="Genesis_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Genesis_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Genesis of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h2>
      <p>Initially the movement focussed on social reform as a means of imrpoving the status of pashtuns against the British. Ghaffar Khan founded several reform movements prior to the formation of the Khudai Khidmatgar, the Anjumen-e Islah ul-Afghan in 1921, the farmers&#39; organisation Anjuman-e Zamidaran in 1927 and the youth movement Pashtun Jirga in 1927. Trying to further spread awareness on Pashtun issues Abdul Ghaffar Khan founded the magazine Pakhtun in May 1928. Finally in November 1929, almost on the eve of the Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre the Khudai Khidmatgar were formed.<p><a name=".22The_Red_Shirts.22"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">&quot;The Red Shirts&quot;</span></h2>
      <p>Khan drew his first recruits from the young men who had graduated from his schools. Trained and uniformed, they served behind their officers and filed out into various villages to seek recruits. They began by wearing a simple white overshirt, but the white was soon dirtied. A couple of men had their shirts dyed at the local tannery, and the brick-red colour proved a breakthrough, it was this distinctive colour that earned the Khudai khidmatgar movement activists the name &quot;<i>the Red shirts</i>&quot; or <i>surkh posh</i>.<p><a id="Structure_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Structure_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Structure of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h3>
      <p>Volunteers who took the oath formed platoons with commanding officers and learned basic army discipline. The volunteers had their own flags: red in the beginning, later tri-colour and bands: bagpipe and drums. The men wore red uniforms and the women black. They had drills, badges, a flag, the entire military hierarchy of rank and even a bagpipe corps.<p>Khan set up a network of committees called jirgas, named and modeled after the traditional tribal councils. Villages were grouped into larger groups, responsible to district-wide committees. The Provincial Jirgah was the ultimate authority.<p>Officers in the ranks were not elected, since Khan wanted to avoid infighting. He appointed a salar-e-azam or commander-in-chief, who in turn appointed officers to serve under him. Other ranks included Jarnails (Generals). The army was completely voluntary; even the officers gave their services free. Women were recruited too, and played an important role in the struggles to come.<p>Volunteers went to the villages and opened schools, helped on work projects, and maintained order at public gatherings. From time to time they drilled in work camps and took long military-style marches into the hills.<p><a id="Ideology_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Ideology_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ideology of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h3>
      <p>Under the influence of Abdul Ghaffar Khan the movement advocated non-violent protests and justified their actions through an <!--del_lnk--> Islamic context. Khan did not find Islam and non-violence as incompatible. Despite that the movement was intrinsically non-sectarian. In more then one occasion when Hindus and Sikhs were attacked in Peshawar, Khidmatgar members helped protect their lives and property.<p><i>&ldquo;The Holy Prophet Mohammed came into this world and taught us &lsquo;That man is a Muslim who never hurts anyone by word or deed, but who works for the benefit and happiness of God&#39;s creatures.&rsquo; Belief in God is to love one&#39;s fellow men.&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan<p><i>&ldquo;There is nothing surprising in a Muslim or a Pathan like me subscribing to the creed of nonviolence. It is not a new creed. It was followed fourteen hundred years ago by the Prophet all the time he was in Mecca.&rdquo;</i> &ndash; Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan<p>Khan always considered trials and tribulations, which he underwent ceaselessly, as the means by which Almighty Allah meant to fashion his life for better things. Being a great humanist, he ardently believed that human nature was not so depraved as to hinder it from respecting goodness in others. It is easy to look down on others but to make an estimate of our failing is difficult. Allah&#39;s blessings according to Bacha khan are marked for those, who submit to Allah&#39;s will and serve Almighty Allah through selfless activities for the overall good of humanity at large irrespective of caste, colour, race or religions.<p><a id="British_tactics_against_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="British_tactics_against_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British tactics against the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h3>
      <p>British troops employed a wide variety of tactics against KK activists.<p>&quot;The British used to torture us, throw us into ponds in wintertime, shave our beards, but even then Badshah Khan told his followers not to lose patience. He said &#39;there is an answer to violence, which is more violence. But nothing can conquer nonviolence. You cannot kill it. It keeps standing up. The British sent their horses and cars to run over us, but I took my shawl in my mouth to keep from screaming. We were human beings, but we should not cry or express in any way that we were injured or weak.&quot; Musharraf Din (Baldauf).<p>Another tactic employed against non-violent protesters who were blocking roads was to charge them with cars and horses.<p>In 1931, 5,000 members of the Khudai Khidmatgar and 2,000 members of the Congress Party are arrested in the spring of 1932.<p>By 1932, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement changed its tactics and involved women in the movement. This unnerved many Indian officers working in the region as in those days of conservative India it was considered a grave insult to attack women, more so in a conservative Pashtun society. However the brutality increased and in one case five police officers in Benares had to be suspended due to &#39;horrific reports about violence used against young female volunteers&#39;.<p>The British bombed a village in the Bajadur Valley in March 1932 and arrested Abdul Ghaffar Khan as well as more than 4,000 Red Shirts. The British bombardments in the border area continued up till 1936-1937 because, &ldquo;India is a training field for active military training which can be found nowhere else in the Empire&quot;, a British court concluded in 1933.<p>Other tactics ranged from poisoning to the barbaric as castrations were used against some Khudai Khidmatgar actvists.<p>After the anti-war resignation of Dr. Khans Ministry in 1939 because of the events of World War 2, British tactics towards the movement changed and added a sectarian and communcal element over brute force. Governor at the time George Cunnigham oversaw this policy. Cunningham policy note of 23 September 1942 reads: &lsquo;Continuously preach the danger to Muslims of connivance with the revolutionary Hindu body. Most tribesmen seem to respond to this&rsquo;, while in another paper he says about the period 1939&ndash;43: &lsquo;Our propaganda since the beginning of the war had been most successful. It had played throughout on the Islamic theme.&rsquo; <p><a id="The_Khudai_Khidmatgar_.26_Indian_National_Congress" name="The_Khudai_Khidmatgar_.26_Indian_National_Congress"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Khudai Khidmatgar &amp; Indian National Congress</span></h3>

      <p>The movement was facing intense pressure by 1930 and the leadership under Ghaffar Khan was actively seeking political allies in India to help reduce the pressure on it by the British authorities. Previously in December 1928, Abdul Ghaffar Khan with some of his colleagues went to Calcutta to attend a <!--del_lnk--> khilafat conference. The session ended badly with Maulana Shaukat Ali nearly being attacked by one member from the Punjab.<p>The British authorities, had by this point sealed off the whole province. Two Khidmatgars Mian Jafar Shah and Mian Abdullah Shah escaped and managed to meet Ghaffar Khan in the prison to inform him of the horror that his followers were going through. It was decided that the two should continue to Lahore, Delhi and Simla to get help from friends in Muslim League. A few months later, the two returned with no success. The British, they said, was protecting them in order that they could fight the Hindus. Desperate for help, they decided to ask Congress.<p>Despite the initial closeness between Ghaffar Khan and the Ali brothers, the harshness of their critique of Gandhi contrasted poorly with the patience shown by Gandhi in Ghaffar Khan&#39;s eyes. The Congress subsequently offered all possible help to the Pathans in exchange on their part to joining the Congress party for the freedom struggle for India. This offer was put forth in the Frontier province, and was accepted by the Khudai Kidmatgars on August 1931. The move shocked the British authorities who were forced to ease pressure on the KK.<p><a id="The_Khudai_Khidmatgar:_Mass_Movement_to_Political_party" name="The_Khudai_Khidmatgar:_Mass_Movement_to_Political_party"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Khudai Khidmatgar: Mass Movement to Political party</span></h2>
      <p>More, with the introduction of provincial autonomy under the <!--del_lnk--> Government of India Act 1935, The first limited election were held in NWFP in 1936. Ghaffar Khan was banned from the province. His brother, Dr. Khan Sahib, led the party to a narrow victory and became Chief Minister. Ghaffar Khan returned to Peshawar in triumph on August 29, 1937 on what the Peshawar daily Khyber Mail called the happiest day of his life. During the two year stint of the Congress party under Dr Khan Sahib as Chief minister, major reforms were introduced including land reforms, promotion of the teaching of Pashto and the release of political prisoners.<p>On Congress directive the ministries in eight out of eleven provinces resigned in protest against Britain&#39;s not promising India independence after the War. The decision to resign proved a pivotal moment in Indian history, in the Frontier it was instrumental in giving those groups that opposed the Khudai Khidmatgar movement the opporunity to broaden their constituency.<p><a id="Subhash_Chandra_Bose" name="Subhash_Chandra_Bose"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Subhash Chandra Bose</span></h3>
      <p>The KK&#39;s activists role in helping Subhash Chandra Bose&#39;s escape in 1943 has largely been ignored till recently. In 1943, Amir Khan Khattak along with four other people received Subhash Chandra Bose at Nowshera Railway Station. He had come to make his escape to Germany via Afghanistan. Disguised as a Muslim, Subhash was taken to Khattak&#39;s village Dak Ismailkhel on the request of Mian Akbar Shah from Faqir Chand&#39;s house in Peshawar. He stayed with him for two days before leaving in a Pashtun attire for the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> Embassy in Kabul leading to his journey to Germany and finally Japan.<p><a id="Fall_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Fall_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fall of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h2>
      <p>The Khudai Khidmatgar movement decline can be traced back to two decisions the first was the Congress decision in 1939 to resign from power in protest against British World War II policy. This move gave an opportunity to the Muslim League to develop and for the British authorities to alter their strategy.<p>In 1940, a split occurred within the Pakhtun Zalmey, the youth organisation affiliated with Bacha Khan&#39;s Khudai Khidmatgar movement. It occurred after Bacha Khan refused to accept the results of the internal party 1940 elections in which Salar Aslam of Kohat won the contest as president of Pakhtun Zalmey with overwhelming majority. The refusal by Bacha Khan to accept Salaar Aslam caused a great damage to the party in southern districts of the province where Khudai Khidmatgars won all the seats of the provincial as well as national assemblies in the previous elections. Salar Aslam was also a member of the Forward Block and Bacha Khan&#39;s argument was that he could not trust anyone but his elder son, Ghani Khan, whom he wanted to lead Pakhtun Zalmey. &quot;It was a mistake of Bacha Khan. He was not happy about his decision later, but had to argue that at that sensitive stage of the political struggle, he could only trust Ghani Khan.&quot;<p>An exception to the rule of non-violence occurred when Badshah Khan&#39;s son Ghani Khan on 26/27 April, 1947 founded the breakaway group Zalmai Pukhtoon (Pashtun Youth), a militant, organisation of Pukhtoon youth, carrying fire-arms, the aim of which was to protect the Khudai Khidmatgars (Servants of God) and members of the Congress Party from violence feared at the hands of <!--del_lnk--> Muslim League activists. It had no connection as such with the Khudai Khidmatgars. Nehru&rsquo;s fateful visit to the Frontier in October, 1946, and its tragic aftermath in a gradual erosion of the popular base of the incumbent Khan Sahib Ministry. Despite this, the movement stayed true to its non-communal leanings, when the red shirts came out to protect thousands of sikhs and hindus worried they would be attacked in the increasing pre-partition violence between Hindus and Muslims.<p><a id="Post_Partition" name="Post_Partition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post Partition</span></h3>
      <p>Pakistan&#39;s Independence in August 1947 marked the beginning of the end of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement. While the Congress government remained in power briefly it was eventually dismissed by the Governor under the orders of Pakistan&#39;s founder <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah.htm" title="Muhammad Ali Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Khan Sahib was replaced by former Congressite <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Qayyum Khan. He successfully stopped an attempted reapprochment between Ghaffar Khan and Muhammad Ali Jinnah by stopping a planned meeting beteween the two citing security threats (Korejo 1997). With that, Jinnah gave Qayyum Khan a free hand in dealing with the Congress and the Khudai Khidmatgars. The crackdown that followed culminated with the Babra Sharif massacre. As part of the crackdown the houses of Khudai Khidmatgar activists were ransacked and plundered. In some cases men were stripped naked in presence of their mothers and sisters and their beards shaven (all of which was seen as a great insult by Pashtuns). Despite the provocation and its obvious ambivalence over Pakistan&#39;s creation, the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders reconvened at Sardaryab on 3 and 4 September 1947 and passed a resolution that accepted Pakistan&#39;s creation and they would leave in Pakistan as its bona fide citizens and would refrain from making any sort of disturbance and difficulty for the new state.<p>However Qayyum Khan and the central government had already decided that there would be no accord with the movement. The Khudai Khidmatgar organisation was declared unlawful in mid-September 1948, mass arrests followeed and the centre at Sardaryab (Markaz-e-Khudai Khidmatgaran), built in 1942, was destroyed by the Provincial Government. This crackdown ultimately led to the <!--del_lnk--> Babra Sharif massacre.<p>The movement was also hit by defections as party members switched sides out of fear or for benefit. Those members that wished to surivive politically rallied behind a former ally, turned opponent of Qayyum Khan, the <!--del_lnk--> Pir of Manki Sharif. The Pir created a breakaway Muslim League, however, it proved no match for Qayyum who engineered his re-election in 1951.<p>The movement lingered on till 1955 when it was again banned by the central government because of Ghaffar Khan&#39;s opposition to the One Unit. An aborted attempt was made to bring Ghaffar Khan into the government as a Minister as well as turning the KK movement into a national organization, however Ghaffar Khan turned down the offer.<p>Although the ban on the movement was lifted in 1972, the Khudai Khidmatgar movement had been broken.<p><a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>

      <p>&lrm; The Khudai Khidmatgar movement was a success in the terms of its opposition to British rule. However, the social effects of the movement have not survived. While the Ghaffar Khan family maintains a hold over the political philosophy of the movement, its history has largely been wiped out from official memory in Pakistan. The movement has also been criticized for its opposition to partition, and by that virtue the creation of Pakistan. As a result it has been seen as a sectionist movement in Pakistan, and in the 1950s and 1960s it was also perceived as pro communist. An argument that was used by conservative elements to discredit it as anti-Islam. The movement&#39;s claim to total non-violence seems flawed as well; some critics argue that while the movement proved a success against the British, it like other non-violent movements would not have proved a success against another Imperial power. This is supposedly proved by its failure to pose a challenge to the Pakistani government amidst a crackdown that was perceived as far more brutal than any done by the British. Others have also suggested that the Khudai Khidmatgar movement was not in fact as non-violent as its supporters would argue. Writers like Schofiled and Bannerjee have documented cases of attacks on British personnel and soldiers. <a id="Pledge_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar" name="Pledge_of_the_Khudai_Khidmatgar"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pledge of the Khudai Khidmatgar</span></h2>
