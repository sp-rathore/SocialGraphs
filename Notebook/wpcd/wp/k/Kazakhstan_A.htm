<h2>SOS Children in Kazakhstan</h2>
<img src="../../wp/j/Jwp_map_kazakhstan_en.gif" width="405" height="262" alt="Sponsorship sites in Kazakhstan" class="left" /><p>Kazakhstan is the second largest of the former Soviet Union republics. It is a huge country covering a territory equivalent to the whole of Western Europe, with vast mineral resources and considerable economic potential. </p><p>However, more than a decade after independence, and despite generous foreign investments, its people continue to suffer serious hardship, with many, particularly children, living in extreme poverty. Among the many daunting challenges it faces are a dilapidated infrastructure, high unemployment, inflation, poverty, prostitution, drug addiction and AIDS. </p><p>The charity began working in Kazakhstan in 1997 when the first community was established in Almaty, the former capital. The village is in a residential area on the edge of the city, with hospitals, schools and shops nearby. Over 95 children between eighteen months and 15 years old live in the eleven family houses with their SOS mothers. Like most SOS Children's Villages, there is a kindergarten that also takes in children from the neighbourhood. Medical care and treatment for the children and mothers is provided by a small SOS clinic. </p><p>SOS Children Astana opened in 2000 in the new capital, Astana. In a residential area convenient for schools, hospitals and shops, it has twelve family houses and a kindergarten. Like the village in Almaty, the children are a mix of different nationalities and religions. </p><p>In Capchagay, near Almaty, an SOS social centre has been established to provide holiday accommodation for the children and the mothers during the summer months.</p><p>A third SOS Children's Village opened in 2004 in Temirtau , a poor industrial city near Karaganda.  It has 12 family houses. In addition there is an SOS Playbus and an SOS Family Strengthening Programme to support vulnerable children and their families in the local community.</p><h3>Local contacts</h3>
