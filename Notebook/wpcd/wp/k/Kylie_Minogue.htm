      <p><b>Kylie Ann Minogue</b> (born <!--del_lnk--> May 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1968) is a <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award winning <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> <!--del_lnk--> singer-songwriter and occasional <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">actress</a>. Minogue rose to prominence in the late 1980s, as a result of her role in the Australian television <!--del_lnk--> soap opera <i><a href="../../wp/n/Neighbours.htm" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i>, before she commenced her career as a <!--del_lnk--> pop recording artist.<p>Signed to a contract by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> songwriters and <!--del_lnk--> producers <!--del_lnk--> Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman, she achieved a string of hit records throughout the world, but her popularity began to decline by the early 1990s, leading her to part company from Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman in 1992. For several years she attempted to establish herself as an independent performer and songwriter, distancing herself from her earlier work. Her projects were widely publicised, but her <!--del_lnk--> albums failed to attract a substantial audience and resulted in the lowest sales of her career.<p>In 2000, Minogue returned to popularity as a <!--del_lnk--> dance&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> pop artist and became well-known for her provocative <!--del_lnk--> music videos and expensively mounted stage shows. She has established one of the longest and most successful careers as a performer in contemporary pop music, and in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and Australia, she has become one of her generation&#39;s most recognisable <!--del_lnk--> celebrities and <!--del_lnk--> sex symbols. In Australia, after being dismissed early in her career by some critics, she has been acclaimed for her achievements; she holds the record for the highest ticket sales for an Australian tour by a female performer, and has attained nine number-ones on the <!--del_lnk--> ARIA <!--del_lnk--> singles chart. She has been acknowledged as the highest selling female recording artist in Australia and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> of the period from her debut in 1987 to the present.<p>

      <p>Kylie Minogue was born in <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, to an <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> father, Ron Minogue, and a <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a>-born mother, Carol Jones who had emigrated as a child from <!--del_lnk--> Maesteg, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> in 1955 to <!--del_lnk--> Townsville, <!--del_lnk--> Queensland. Kylie is the eldest of three children; her sister <!--del_lnk--> Dannii Minogue (born Danielle Jane Minogue) is also a <!--del_lnk--> pop singer, and her brother, Brendan, works as a news cameraman in Australia. The Minogue sisters began their careers as children on <!--del_lnk--> Australian television, and from the age of 11, Kylie Minogue appeared in <!--del_lnk--> soap operas such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Skyways</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sullivans</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Henderson Kids</i>. Dannii Minogue became successful as a regular performer on the weekly music programme <i><!--del_lnk--> Young Talent Time</i>, in which Kylie gave her first singing performance in 1983. Kylie was overshadowed by her younger sister until achieving success in 1986 with her role in the soap opera <i><a href="../../wp/n/Neighbours.htm" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i>.<p>Minogue played the character of Charlene Mitchell; a <!--del_lnk--> story arc that created a romance between <!--del_lnk--> her character and that played by her then real-life boyfriend <!--del_lnk--> Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted a large audience. Her popularity in Australia was demonstrated when she became the first person to win four <!--del_lnk--> Logie Awards in one event, including the &quot;Gold Logie&quot; as the country&#39;s &quot;Most Popular Television Performer&quot;, with the result determined by public vote. <i>Neighbours</i> began screening in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1986, and it achieved high <!--del_lnk--> ratings.<p><a id="Recording_and_performing_career" name="Recording_and_performing_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recording and performing career</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Stock.2C_Aitken_and_Waterman:_1987_.E2.80.93_1992" name="Stock.2C_Aitken_and_Waterman:_1987_.E2.80.93_1992"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Stock, Aitken and Waterman: 1987 &ndash; 1992</span></h3>
      <p>During a <!--del_lnk--> Fitzroy Football Club <!--del_lnk--> benefit concert with other <i>Neighbours</i> cast members, Minogue performed <!--del_lnk--> Little Eva&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Loco-Motion&quot; and was signed to a recording contract with <!--del_lnk--> Mushroom Records in 1987. Released as a single, and retitled &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Locomotion&quot;, the Australian recording spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian music charts, and was the year&#39;s highest selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue traveling to London with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with <!--del_lnk--> Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Should Be So Lucky&quot; while she waited outside the studio. Her <!--del_lnk--> debut album <i><!--del_lnk--> Kylie</i>, a collection of dance songs, reached number one on the British albums chart and became the year&#39;s highest-selling album. It sold over seven million copies worldwide, with most sales occurring in Europe and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, and it contained six successful singles, which includes the largest success &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;. It was only in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> where the album did not sell strongly; however, the re-recorded version of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; reached number three on the U.S. <i><!--del_lnk--> Billboard</i> <!--del_lnk--> Hot 100 chart and number one on the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Singles Chart. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> It&#39;s No Secret&quot;, released only in the U.S., performed poorly and peaked at number thirty-seven in early 1989. In late 1988 Minogue departed from <i>Neighbours</i> in order to concentrate fully on her music career.<p>A duet with Jason Donovan, titled &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Especially for You&quot; was a major success in the United Kingdom in early 1989. The critic Kevin Killian wrote that it was &quot;majestically awful... makes the <!--del_lnk--> Diana Ross, <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Richie &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Endless Love&quot; sound like <!--del_lnk--> Mahler&quot;. She was sometimes referred to as &quot;The Singing <!--del_lnk--> Budgie&quot; by her detractors over the coming years. Chris True&#39;s comment about the album <i>Kylie</i> for <i><!--del_lnk--> All Music Guide</i> suggests that Minogue&#39;s appeal transcended the limitations of her music, by noting that &quot;her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable&quot;.<p>Her follow up album <i><!--del_lnk--> Enjoy Yourself</i> (1989) was a success in the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia, and contained several successful singles, but it failed throughout North America, and Minogue was dropped by her American <!--del_lnk--> record label <!--del_lnk--> Geffen Records. She embarked on her first concert run, the <!--del_lnk--> Enjoy Yourself Tour, in the United Kingdom, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and Australia, where Melbourne&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Herald Sun</i> wrote that it was &quot;time to ditch the snobbery and face facts&mdash;the kid&#39;s a star&quot;. Minogue had become Stock, Aitken and Waterman&#39;s highest selling act, so in the face of widespread comment that the second album was a poor imitation of the first, it was decided to adjust the overall style of her music.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Rhythm of Love</i> (1990) presented a more sophisticated and adult style of dance music and also marked the first signs of rebellion against her production team and the &quot;girl-next-door&quot; image. Determined to be accepted by a more mature audience, Minogue took control of her music videos, starting with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Better the Devil You Know&quot;, and presented herself as a sexually aware adult. A relationship with <!--del_lnk--> INXS lead singer <!--del_lnk--> Michael Hutchence furthered her attempts to gain acceptance as a mature performer, with Hutchence saying his favourite hobby was &quot;corrupting Kylie&quot;, and writing the INXS hit song &quot;Suicide Blonde&quot; in reference to her.<p>The singles from <i>Rhythm of Love</i> sold well in Europe and Australia and were popular in British nightclubs where Minogue started to be regarded as fashionable by the older audience she had targeted. When &quot;Shocked&quot; reached the British Top 10 in 1991, she became the first recording artist to place their first 13 single releases in the Top 10. Dispite the album seeing no Stateside release, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Shocked&quot; became popular enough with club DJ&#39;s that it still is on some dance music radio station music databases. In May 1990, Minogue performed her band&#39;s arrangement of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Help!&quot; before a crowd of 25,000 at the <i><!--del_lnk--> John Lennon: The Tribute Concert</i> on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> River Mersey in <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Yoko Ono and <!--del_lnk--> Sean Lennon offered Minogue their thanks for her support of &quot;The John Lennon Fund&quot;, while the media commented positively on her performance. <i>The Sun</i> wrote &quot;The soap star wows the <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Scousers</a> - Kylie Minogue deserved her applause&quot;. Minogue&#39;s contract had been for three albums, but she was persuaded to record a fourth. <i><!--del_lnk--> Let&#39;s Get to It</i> (1991) was designed to broaden her appeal by presenting a diverse range of ballads and slower dance songs, but despite generally positive reviews it failed to make the British Top 10, although the <!--del_lnk--> Let&#39;s Get to It Tour in late 1991 sold out in Britain.<p>By this time Minogue had fulfilled the requirements of her contract and elected not to renew it. She had often expressed the viewpoint that she was stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, and later compared the experience to her time with <i>Neighbours</i>, saying all they wanted her to do was &quot;learn your lines... perform your lines, no time for questions, promote the product&quot;. Realising that her fans were growing apathetic towards the Stock, Aitken and Waterman formula, and that she could only develop as an artist if she broke away from them, she decided to leave. She agreed to record three new songs to be included on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Greatest Hits</i> album, which was released to coincide with her departure from them in 1992. The album reached number one in the United Kingdom. The new singles (&quot;What Kind Of Fool&quot; and &quot;Celebration&quot;) were top 20 hits.<p><a id="Deconstruction:_1993_.E2.80.93_1998" name="Deconstruction:_1993_.E2.80.93_1998"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Deconstruction: 1993 &ndash; 1998</span></h3>
      <p>Minogue&#39;s subsequent signing with <!--del_lnk--> Deconstruction Records was highly touted in the music media as the beginning of a new phase in her career, but the self-titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Kylie Minogue</i> (1994) received mixed reviews. It sold 500,000 units worldwide, and the single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Confide in Me&quot; spent five weeks at number one in Australia. Subsequent singles, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Put Yourself in My Place&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Where Is the Feeling?&quot; were top twenty hits in the UK.<p>Australian artist <!--del_lnk--> Nick Cave had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, saying it contained &quot;one of pop music&#39;s most violent and distressing lyrics&quot; and &quot;when Kylie Minogue sings these words, there is an innocence to her that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling&quot;. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; (1995), was a brooding ballad whose lyrics narrated a murder from the points of view of both the murderer (Cave), and his victim (Minogue), and its success demonstrated that Minogue could be accepted outside of her established genre as a dance artist. It received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and acclaim in Australia where it reached number two, and won <!--del_lnk--> ARIA Awards for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot;. She performed it with Cave at the Australian summer rock festival, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Big Day Out&quot; before a crowd of <!--del_lnk--> alternative music fans, and was well received. She also appeared with Cave during several of his concerts in small venues throughout Europe, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> T in the Park festival in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> which gave her more experience performing outside of the dance/pop genre and before audiences that were not necessarily her fans. She recited the lyrics to &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; as poetry in London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Royal Albert Hall &quot;Poetry Jam&quot;, at the suggestion of Cave, and later credited him with giving her the confidence to express herself artistically, saying: &quot;He taught me to never veer too far from who I am, but to go further, try different things, and never lose sight of myself at the core. For me, the hard part was unleashing the core of myself and being totally truthful in my music&quot;.<p>By 1997 Minogue was in a relationship with the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> photographer <!--del_lnk--> Stephane Sednaoui, who described her as a combination &quot;<!--del_lnk--> geisha and <!--del_lnk--> manga superheroine&quot;. He began taking photographs of her that downplayed her glamour, with the aim of attracting a more &#39;rocky&#39; and discerning audience, and she drew inspiration from artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Shirley Manson and <!--del_lnk--> Garbage, <!--del_lnk--> Bj&ouml;rk, <!--del_lnk--> Tricky and <a href="../../wp/u/U2.htm" title="U2">U2</a>, and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> pop musicians such as <!--del_lnk--> Pizzicato Five and <!--del_lnk--> Towa Tei (with whom she would later collaborate on the singles &quot;GBI: German Bold Italic&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sometime Samurai&quot;).<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Impossible Princess</i> (named after a poetry collection by artist <!--del_lnk--> Billy Childish) featured collaborations with musicians such as <!--del_lnk--> James Dean Bradfield and <!--del_lnk--> Sean Moore of the <!--del_lnk--> Manic Street Preachers, and Minogue contributed the majority of the lyrics. Largely a dance album, its style was not represented by its first single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Some Kind of Bliss&quot;, and Minogue countered questions that she was trying to become an <!--del_lnk--> indie artist. She told <i>Music Week</i>, &quot;I have to keep telling people that this isn&#39;t an indie-guitar album. I&#39;m not about to pick up a guitar and rock.&quot; <i><!--del_lnk--> Billboard magazine</i> described the album as &quot;stunning&quot; and concluded that &quot;it&#39;s a golden commercial opportunity for a major [record company] with vision and energy [to release it in the United States]. A sharp ear will detect a kinship between <i>Impossible Princess</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Madonna&#39;s hugely successful album, <i><a href="../../wp/r/Ray_of_Light.htm" title="Ray of Light">Ray of Light</a></i>&quot;. In the UK, <i>Music Week</i> gave a negative assessment, &quot;Kylie&#39;s vocals take on a stroppy edge ... but not strong enough to do much&quot;.<p>It became the lowest-selling album of her career in the UK, but was her highest-selling album in Australia since her debut album, with sales boosted by a highly successful live tour. In reviewing her show, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> wrote of her ability to &quot;mask her thin, often nondescript voice with musical diversity and brittle charisma and genuinely great pop songs by any standard&quot;, and a live album recorded during her tour, titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Intimate and Live</i>, was successful in Australia. Kylie later confessed that she was a bit disappointed with her mediocre reception of this album in the UK and elsewhere. After all, Kylie herself claimed &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; is her favorite of her own works.<p>She maintained her high profile in Australia with live performances, including the 1998 <!--del_lnk--> Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the opening of <!--del_lnk--> Fox Studios in Sydney in 1999, where she performed <!--del_lnk--> Marilyn Monroe&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Diamonds Are a Girl&#39;s Best Friend&quot;, and a Christmas concert in <!--del_lnk--> Dili, <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a> in association with the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces.<p><a id="Parlophone:_1999_.E2.80.93_present" name="Parlophone:_1999_.E2.80.93_present"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Parlophone: 1999 &ndash; present</span></h3>
      <p>Minogue and Deconstruction Records parted company and following a duet with the <!--del_lnk--> Pet Shop Boys&#39; on their <i><!--del_lnk--> Nightlife</i> album, she signed with <!--del_lnk--> Parlophone in April 1999. Her album <i><!--del_lnk--> Light Years</i> (2000) was strongly influenced by 1970s <!--del_lnk--> disco artists, such as <!--del_lnk--> Donna Summer and <!--del_lnk--> Village People (see <!--del_lnk--> 1970s in music), and included several songs written by <!--del_lnk--> Guy Chambers and <!--del_lnk--> Robbie Williams who imbued their lyrics with humour. <i><!--del_lnk--> New Musical Express</i> wrote: &quot;Kylie&#39;s capacity for reinvention is staggering&quot; and summarised the album as &quot;sheer joy&quot; and &quot;what she does best&quot;. It generated career-best reviews for Minogue and quickly became a success throughout <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and sold over two million copies worldwide. The single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Spinning Around&quot; became her first UK number-one in ten years, and its accompanying video, which featured Minogue in revealing gold hot pants, received widespread television airplay. The subsequent single releases, which includes the duet &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Kids&quot; with <!--del_lnk--> Robbie Williams, sold strongly too. She joined Madonna as the second artist to achieve UK number-one singles in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s.<p>In 2000 Minogue performed a cover version of <!--del_lnk--> ABBA&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Dancing Queen&quot; and her single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> On a Night like This&quot; at the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 Sydney Olympics closing ceremony, an event watched by an estimated 3.7 billion people in 220 countries. Afterwards, she embarked upon a concert tour, <i><!--del_lnk--> On A Night like This Tour</i>, which played to sell-out crowds in Australia and the United Kingdom, where she sold over 200,000 tickets and set an <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australian</a> record for a female artist. Her six planned <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> shows were increased to twenty-two due to public demand. Minogue was inspired by the style of <!--del_lnk--> Broadway shows such as <i><!--del_lnk--> 42nd Street</i> and films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Anchors Aweigh</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> South Pacific</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> Fred Astaire and <!--del_lnk--> Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s. Describing <!--del_lnk--> Bette Midler as a &quot;heroine&quot;, she also incorporated some of the &quot;camp and burlesque&quot; elements of Midler&#39;s live performances. The show directed and choreographed by Luca Tommassini featured elaborate sets such as the deck of an ocean liner, an <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> skyline, and the interior of a space ship, and Minogue was praised for her new material and her reinterpretations of some of her greatest successes, turning &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Should Be So Lucky&quot; into a <!--del_lnk--> torch song and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Better the Devil You Know&quot; into a 1940s <!--del_lnk--> big band number. She won a &quot;Mo Award&quot; for Australian live entertainment as &quot;Performer of the Year&quot;. Following the tour she was asked by a <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> journalist what she thought was her greatest strength, and replied, &quot;That I am an all-rounder. If I was to choose any one element of what I do, I don&#39;t know if I would excel at any one of them. But put all of them together, and I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;<p>In 2001 Parlophone released <i><!--del_lnk--> Fever</i>, which retained some disco elements and combined them with 1980s <!--del_lnk--> electropop. Its lead single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Can&#39;t Get You out of My Head&quot; became the biggest success of her career and reached number one in over forty countries, and sold more than six million copies worldwide. The album&#39;s success was equally widespread, and following extensive airplay by North American radio, <!--del_lnk--> Capitol Records released it in the United States in 2002. It attracted favourable comment, with <i>Rolling Stone</i> calling it &quot;campy as a tent full of <a href="../../wp/s/Scouting.htm" title="Scouting">Boy Scouts</a> and yet easy on the cheese&quot;, while <i>Popmatters</i> described it as &quot;a perfect album of gorgeous dance music&quot;. Minogue attracted some negative commentary, such as from <!--del_lnk--> <i>Launch</i>&#39;s Bob Gulla, who wrote: &quot;she&#39;ll do virtually anything to get our attention. Not since <!--del_lnk--> Pia Zadora have we seen a more vacant talent grab... an astoundingly bland helping of hollow dance pop grooves and nauseating pleas for sex... it&#39;s so desperately lightweight it&#39;s in imminent danger of disintegrating altogether&quot;. The album debuted on the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart at number three, and the single reached number seven on the Hot 100. <i>Fever</i> peaked at number ten on the Canadian albums chart and the single reached the <!--del_lnk--> BDS airplay top three. Following singles &quot;<!--del_lnk--> In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Come into My World&quot; were substantial successes throughout the world, and Minogue established a presence in the mainstream North American market, achieving particular success on the <!--del_lnk--> club scene. In 2003 she received a <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot; for &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, and the following year won the same award for &quot;Come into My World&quot;.<p>Minogue&#39;s former stylist and creative director <!--del_lnk--> William Baker explained that the music videos for the <i>Fever</i> album were inspired by <!--del_lnk--> science fiction films&mdash;specifically those by <!--del_lnk--> Stanley Kubrick&mdash;and accentuated the electropop elements of the music by using dancers in the style of <!--del_lnk--> Kraftwerk. Alan MacDonald, the designer of the 2002 <i>Fever</i> tour, brought those elements into the stage show which was based around a framework of seven iconic female images, drawing from Minogue&#39;s past incarnations. The show opened with Minogue as a space age <!--del_lnk--> vamp, which she described as &quot;Queen of <!--del_lnk--> Metropolis with her drones&quot;, through to scenes inspired by Kubrick&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> A Clockwork Orange</i>, followed by the various <!--del_lnk--> personas of Minogue&#39;s career. Minogue said that she was finally able to express herself the way she wanted, and that she had always been &quot;a showgirl at heart&quot;.<p>Her next album, <i><!--del_lnk--> Body Language</i> (2003), was released following an invitation-only concert, titled <i><!--del_lnk--> Money Can&#39;t Buy</i>, at the <!--del_lnk--> Hammersmith Apollo in London. The event marked the presentation of a new visual style, designed by Minogue and Baker, inspired in part by 1960s icon <!--del_lnk--> Brigitte Bardot, about whom Minogue commented: &quot;I just tended to think of BB as, well, she&#39;s a sexpot, isn&#39;t she? She&#39;s one of the greatest pinups. But she was fairly radical in her own way at that time. And we chose to reference the period, which was... a perfect blend of coquette and rock and roll.&quot;<p>The show attracted mixed reviews, with the main criticisms being that nothing substantially new was presented, and that the new songs did not match the appeal of her previous hits. Despite this, the concert was made into a successful television special that drew high ratings.<p>The album downplayed the disco style and Minogue said she was inspired by 1980s artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Scritti Politti, <!--del_lnk--> Human League, <!--del_lnk--> Adam and the Ants and <!--del_lnk--> Prince, blending their styles with elements of <a href="../../wp/h/Hip_hop_music.htm" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a>. It received some of the most positive reviews of her career with <i>Billboard Magazine</i> writing of &quot;Minogue&#39;s knack for picking great songs and producers&quot;. <i>All Music</i> described it as &quot;a near perfect pop record... <i>Body Language</i> is what happens when a dance-pop diva takes the high road and focuses on what&#39;s important instead of trying to shock herself into continued relevance&quot; Sales in the United Kingdom and Australia were good but paled in comparison to &quot;Fever&quot;, despite the large success of its first single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Slow&quot; and in the United States the album made little impression, although the singles became major club hits. In November 2004, &quot;Slow&quot; was nominated for a <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award in the category of &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;.<p>Minogue released her second official greatest hits album in November 2004, entitled <i><!--del_lnk--> Ultimate Kylie</i>, along with her music videos on a <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> compilation of the same title. The album introduced her singles &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Believe in You&quot;, co-written with <!--del_lnk--> Jake Shears and <!--del_lnk--> Babydaddy from the <!--del_lnk--> Scissor Sisters, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Giving You Up&quot;. Both songs reached the British top ten, and with a tally of twenty-nine top ten singles, Minogue became the second most successful woman on the British singles charts, behind <!--del_lnk--> Madonna. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Believe In You&quot; reached the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Hot Dance Club Play top three and attained dance and rhythmic radio airplay nationwide. Minogue was nominated for a Grammy Award for the fourth consecutive year when &quot;I Believe in You&quot; was nominated in the category of &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot;.<p>In April 2005, Minogue and her creative director William Baker ended their professional relationship, with Minogue commenting that it had been timed to coincide with the release of the <i>Ultimate Kylie</i> album and the launch of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Showgirl - The Greatest Hits Tour</i>. The tour was intended to be the most extensive of her career, and anticipated a total audience of more than 700,000. Minogue completed the European stage of the tour, and was in Melbourne <!--del_lnk--> when she was diagnosed with <!--del_lnk--> breast cancer, leading to the postponement of the remainder of the tour.<p>In December 2005, following successful treatment for her illness, Minogue released a digital-only single, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Over the Rainbow&quot;, a live recording from her <i>Showgirl</i> tour. During the early months of 2006, media began reporting Minogue&#39;s upcoming projects and the general improvement in her health. In June 2006, she was reported to be recording material for a new album, collaborating with <!--del_lnk--> The Scissor Sisters, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Anderson, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Stannard, <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Douglas, Ash Thomas and <!--del_lnk--> Teddy Riley while also making preparations to continue her newly renamed <i><!--del_lnk--> Showgirl Homecoming</i> tour. She gave her first public interview since her diagnosis with breast cancer on the British satellite channel <!--del_lnk--> Sky One, <!--del_lnk--> July 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>Her children&#39;s book, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Showgirl Princess</i> was <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">published</a> in October 2006, and <!--del_lnk--> perfume &quot;Darling&quot; was launched in November 2006. On her return to Australia for her concert tour, she likened her cancer battle and chemotherapy to experiencing a nuclear bomb,  and said that she is determined to resume her career.<p><a id="Film_career" name="Film_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film career</span></h2>
      <p>In 1989, Minogue starred in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Delinquents</i>, which told the story of a young girl growing up in Australia during the late 1950s. Its release coincided with her popularity in <i>Neighbours</i>, and while both the film and Minogue&#39;s performance received poor reviews, it was a commercial success. She appeared as <!--del_lnk--> Cammy in the action film <i><!--del_lnk--> Street Fighter</i> (1994), based on the <!--del_lnk--> fighting game series of the same name. The film received poor reviews by critics, with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Washington Post&#39;</i>s Richard Harrington calling her &quot;the worst actress in the English-speaking world.&quot; Subsequent films such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Bio-Dome</i> (1996), <i>Sample People</i> and <i>Cut</i> (both 2000) failed to attract an audience.<p>Australian <!--del_lnk--> film director <!--del_lnk--> Baz Luhrmann, cast Minogue in <i><!--del_lnk--> Moulin Rouge!</i> (2001) where she played the part of <a href="../../wp/a/Absinthe.htm" title="Absinthe">Absinthe</a>, <!--del_lnk--> the Green Fairy, singing a line from <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sound of Music</i>. In 2002, Minogue provided the voice of a young girl named Florence in the animated film <i><!--del_lnk--> The Magic Roundabout</i>, released in 2006. Minogue also sang the title song in the movie and was one of the two starring actors not replaced when the film was released in the US.<p><a id="Filmography" name="Filmography"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Filmography</span></h3>

      <p>Throughout her professional life, Minogue has been the subject of intense media interest in both the United Kingdom and Australia, which remained constant even while her success as a recording artist had temporarily fluctuated. Her efforts to be taken seriously as a musician have sometimes been hindered by her high profile as noted by <i><!--del_lnk--> The Australian</i>, who wrote in 1997, &quot;When you have to lug around an image the size of Kylie&#39;s, it&#39;s difficult for any music you produce to match the hype&mdash;especially in a country that gives scant credibility to pop&quot;. Her relationships, including her current relationship with <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> actor <!--del_lnk--> Olivier Martinez, have been extensively reported as well.<p>Minogue is regarded as a <!--del_lnk--> gay icon, which she encourages with comments such as &quot;I am not a traditional gay icon. There&#39;s been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits.&quot; While part of her appeal lies in her flamboyant costumes and her confident sexual posturing, she acknowledges the <!--del_lnk--> gay community throughout the world by performing at gay venues and events, and by openly supporting <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> and <!--del_lnk--> gay rights causes. She has said that she believes gay fans responded to her apparent distress when the news media began heavily criticising her in 1989, and that those fans have remained loyal, explaining, &quot;My gay audience has been with me from the beginning... they kind of adopted me&quot;.<p>After playing the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> girl next door&quot; in her early videos, Minogue began to touch on adult themes: a mature relationship in &quot;Better the Devil You Know&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> lesbian posturing and <!--del_lnk--> drag queens in &quot;What Do I Have To Do&quot;, <!--del_lnk--> telephone sex in &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, and <!--del_lnk--> prostitution in &quot;On a Night like This&quot;. She performed a slow strip tease in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Barbarella</i>-inspired &quot;Put Yourself in My Place&quot; and wore revealing costumes in many of her videos, most notably &quot;Spinning Around&quot; and &quot;Can&#39;t Get You out of My Head&quot;. She satirised her image in the video for &quot;Did It Again&quot;, in which the four major incarnations of her career, &quot;Indie Kylie&quot;, &quot;Dance Kylie&quot;, &quot;Sex Kylie&quot;, and &quot;Cute Kylie&quot; battled for supremacy. Her evolving image and often overt sexuality led some critical comparisons to <!--del_lnk--> Madonna. Minogue has admitted her admiration for Madonna and has cited her as a significant influence. Minogue&#39;s status has led to her being referenced in several pop songs including <!--del_lnk--> The KLF&#39;s &quot;Kylie Said to Jason&quot; (1989), <!--del_lnk--> BMX Bandits&#39; &quot;Kylie&#39;s Got A Crush On Us&quot; (1993), <!--del_lnk--> The Pretenders&#39; &quot;Popstar&quot; (1999), and <!--del_lnk--> The Androids&#39; &quot;Do It With Madonna&quot; (2003).<p>In 1993 <!--del_lnk--> Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to the photographer <!--del_lnk--> Bert Stern, notable for his work with <!--del_lnk--> Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that she had a &quot;similar vulnerability and awareness of the camera&quot;. She has gained credibility by her association with people such as <!--del_lnk--> fashion designer <!--del_lnk--> Jean Paul Gaultier, photographer <!--del_lnk--> Stephane Sednaoui, and designer <!--del_lnk--> John Galliano, who described her as a &quot;blend of <!--del_lnk--> Lolita and <!--del_lnk--> Barbarella&quot;.<p>During her career she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new &quot;look&quot; for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge <i><!--del_lnk--> The Face</i> to the more traditionally sophisticated <i><!--del_lnk--> Vogue</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Vanity Fair</i>, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream <!--del_lnk--> pop culture of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate simply on selling records. She has appeared in guest roles in television series such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Vicar of Dibley</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Men Behaving Badly</i> in the UK, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Kath &amp; Kim</i> in Australia, which capitalised on her celebrity status and image for comedic effect. In the latter she played a Melbourne teenager on her wedding day, referencing her role as <!--del_lnk--> Charlene in <i><a href="../../wp/n/Neighbours.htm" title="Neighbours">Neighbours</a></i>.<p>Despite her commercial success, and her acceptance by a large audience as a contemporary <!--del_lnk--> sex symbol, her critics describe her willingness to display her body as an attempt to disguise a lack of talent. Her detractors, such as those discussed in the book <i>La La La</i>, have described her as a &quot;one dimensional performer&quot; and &quot;pretty, but mindless and talentless&quot;. Miki Berenyi of the group <!--del_lnk--> Lush said &quot;I have a massive problem with her because she epitomises the acceptable role ... it&#39;s a shame she gets so much credibility when there are so many women worth a hundred times that. It&#39;s war&mdash;you shouldn&#39;t stick up for Kylie, she should be fought at every turn&quot;. Minogue continues to attract discussion, and in <!--del_lnk--> Paul Morley&#39;s study of the evolution of pop music, <i>Words And Music: A History Of Pop In The Shape Of A City</i>, Minogue is the vehicle by which pop is explored.<p>Minogue has often spoken of the stability of the team she works with. Her parents, Ron and Carol Minogue, are actively involved in her career; her father, an accountant, is her financial advisor and her mother has joined her on each of her tours. She has been managed by Terry Blamey since 1987 and the close network, along with her Stock, Aitken and Waterman origins, have led to comments that she is &quot;manufactured&quot;, an assessment which Minogue has admitted is partly accurate, saying, &quot;if you&#39;re part of a record company, I think to a degree it&#39;s fair to say that you&#39;re a manufactured product. You&#39;re a product and you&#39;re selling a product. It doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re not talented and that you don&#39;t make creative and business decisions about what you will and won&#39;t do and where you want to go... Ultimately, yes, it&#39;s my name and I have to deliver the goods. But it doesn&#39;t happen without a team. So I try and work with the best people I can and take from them what I can. Hopefully I enhance what they do as well&quot; William Baker has described her status as a sex symbol as a &quot;double edged sword&quot; observing that &quot;we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record. But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer&quot;.<p>Minogue has suggested that although her career will inevitably change direction, she expects to continue as a singer, and move away from the &quot;sex-pot&quot; persona she has created. In 2003 she received positive reviews for some low key performances in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> nightclubs where she performed <!--del_lnk--> jazz standards, and she indicated she may take her career in this direction. Rather than identify herself as a particular type of singer, she has assessed herself with the comment, &quot;now more than ever, I consider myself a performer... on stage is where I have given and received so much energy and enthusiasm&quot;.<p><a id="Breast_cancer" name="Breast_cancer"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Breast cancer</span></h2>

      <p>On 17 May 2005, it was reported that Minogue had been diagnosed with early-stage <!--del_lnk--> breast cancer and would receive medical treatment in Melbourne. The remainder of her <i>Showgirl, The Greatest Hits</i> world tour was postponed and she withdrew from participating at the <a href="../../wp/g/Glastonbury_Festival.htm" title="Glastonbury Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a>.<p>The announcement of Minogue&#39;s cancer diagnosis resulted in a brief but intense period of media coverage, particularly in Australia, where the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/j/John_Howard.htm" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> issued a statement supporting Minogue. As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in <a href="../../wp/m/Melbourne.htm" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Victorian Premier <!--del_lnk--> Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family&#39;s rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media&#39;s overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards <!--del_lnk--> paparazzi.<p>Minogue underwent surgery on 21 May 2005 at the private Catholic Cabrini Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Malvern.<!--del_lnk--> . Friends such as <!--del_lnk--> Olivia Newton-John, herself a survivor of breast cancer, urged the media and fans to respect Minogue&#39;s privacy. Soon after surgery, she commenced <!--del_lnk--> chemotherapy as part of her treatment regimen.<p>Minogue issued a public statement, thanking her fans for their support and urging them not to worry. On July 8, 2005, she made her first public appearance after her surgery, when she visited a children&#39;s cancer ward at Melbourne&#39;s Royal Children&#39;s Hospital. She returned to France where she completed her <!--del_lnk--> chemotherapy treatment at the Institut Gustave-Roussy in <!--del_lnk--> Villejuif, near Paris.<p>In November 2005 Minogue&#39;s tour management in Australia announced that she will continue her <i>Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour</i> in late 2006. It was announced on Kylie.com in June 2006 that the first of these performances would be at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on November 11, 2006. Minogue explained there would have to be some changes made to the format of the show and that getting back onstage would be a very emotional moment for her.<p>It was reported in <i>The Times Online</i> in January 2006 that Minogue had completed her chemotherapy treatment. Her publicists were unwilling to speculate on its apparent success, as Minogue required a further six weeks of radiotherapy to try and help prevent a recurrence of tumours.<p>During the course of her treatment, Kylie wrote a children&#39;s book entitled <!--del_lnk--> The Showgirl Princess, about a girl&#39;s rise to stage fame.<p><a id="Return_to_stage" name="Return_to_stage"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Return to stage</span></h2>
      <p>On Saturday November 11th, Kylie resumed the sellout Showgirl Tour; her opening words, as she rose from below the stage on a platform dressed in a pink feathered head-dress and flowing gown by <!--del_lnk--> John Galliano, were &quot;Good evening Sydney!&quot;. For 30 seconds in between her ascension and the beginning of the first song, <i>Better The Devil You Know</i>, Kylie absorbed an explosive standing ovation from a tearful audience. The emotional comeback performance was watched by her parents and boyfriend <i>Olivier Martinez</i> at the side of the stage, and 10,000 fans. Despite being in recovery from her breast cancer ordeal, it was Kylie who asked the all important question of the night, &quot;How&#39;re you feeling tonight?&quot;<p>Throughout the weekend of November 11th and 12th, newspapers worldwide carried photographs from &quot;Kylie&#39;s Comeback&quot;. The second evening&#39;s performance saw Kylie duet with <a href="../../wp/u/U2.htm" title="U2">U2</a> frontman <!--del_lnk--> Bono, singing &quot;Kids&quot;, the song she made famous with Robbie Williams. However, Kylie had to cancel an apparently scheduled performance at a U2 concert on 13th November because of exhaustion. According to a source in British tabloid newspaper The Sun, &quot;Kylie called Bono to explain that she had worn herself out. She is really feeling the physical effects of her return to the stage. He told her to spend Monday resting, get her energy levels fully restored and relax.&quot;<p>After Australia, Kylie will return to Britain to play dates in <!--del_lnk--> Wembley Arena (January 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9, 2007) which sold out in six minutes according to organisers and British press, and then further UK dates in <!--del_lnk--> MEN Arena in Manchester (on January 12, 13, 15, 18, and 19), which also sold out in record time.<p><a id="Discography" name="Discography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Discography</span></h2>
