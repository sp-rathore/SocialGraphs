      <p>The French explorers <!--del_lnk--> Louis Joliet and <!--del_lnk--> Jacques Marquette were the first Europeans to explore the area that came to be known as Kansas City, during a six-day canoe trip up the <a href="../../wp/m/Missouri_River.htm" title="Missouri River">Missouri River</a> in 1673. The French first settled at <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis in the lower <!--del_lnk--> Missouri Valley in 1765. <!--del_lnk--> Fran&ccedil;ois Chouteau established Chouteau Landing at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers in 1821.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In 1833 <!--del_lnk--> John McCoy established <!--del_lnk--> West Port along the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe Trail, three miles away from the river. Then in 1834, McCoy established <!--del_lnk--> Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri River to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, and in 1850 the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<p>By that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby <!--del_lnk--> Independence had become critical points in America&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> westward expansion. Three major <!--del_lnk--> trails - the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe, <!--del_lnk--> California, and <!--del_lnk--> Oregon - all originated in <!--del_lnk--> Jackson County.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> February 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1853 the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of 0.98 square miles and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes and Charlotte Streets on the east.<p><a id="Civil_War" name="Civil_War"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Civil War</span></h3>
      <p>The area was ripe with animosity as the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> approached. As a <!--del_lnk--> slave state, Missourians tended to sympathize with the southern states. With Kansas petitioning to enter the <!--del_lnk--> Union under the new doctrine of <!--del_lnk--> popular sovereignty, many from the area crossed into Kansas to sway the state towards allowing <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, at first by ballot box and then by bloodshed.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the Civil War, the City of Kansas was in the midst of battles, almost all of them victories by the Union. The <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Independence in August of 1862 stunted a <!--del_lnk--> Confederate advance into northern Missouri (settled by pro-slavery <!--del_lnk--> Virginians), and the October 1864 <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Westport effectively ended Confederate efforts to occupy the city. However, a successful raid on <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence, Kansas led by <!--del_lnk--> William Quantrill forced General <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Ewing to issue <!--del_lnk--> General Order No. 11, forcing the eviction of residents in four counties, including Jackson, except those living in the city and nearby communities, or those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>After the Civil War, the City of Kansas grew rapidly. The selection of the city over <!--del_lnk--> Leavenworth, Kansas for the <!--del_lnk--> Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Octave Chanute, opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889 and the city limits to extend south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on <!--del_lnk--> December 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1897.<p>Kansas City, guided by architect <!--del_lnk--> George Kessler, became a forefront example of the <!--del_lnk--> City Beautiful movement, developing a network of boulevards and parks around the city. The relocation of <!--del_lnk--> Union Station to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Liberty Memorial in 1923 gave the city two of its most identifiable landmarks. Further spurring Kansas City&#39;s growth was the opening of the innovative <!--del_lnk--> Country Club Plaza development by <!--del_lnk--> J.C. Nichols in 1925 as part of his <!--del_lnk--> Country Club District plan.<p><a id="Pendergast_era" name="Pendergast_era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pendergast era</span></h3>
      <p>At the <!--del_lnk--> turn of the century, political machines attempted to gain clout in the city, with the one led by <!--del_lnk--> Tom Pendergast emerging as the dominant machine by 1925. A new city charter passed that year made it easier for his Democratic Party machine to gain control of the city council (slimmed from 32 members to nine) and appoint a crooked city manager. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to <!--del_lnk--> tax evasion. The machine, however, gave rise to <a href="../../wp/h/Harry_S._Truman.htm" title="Harry S. Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, who quickly became Kansas City&#39;s favorite son.<p><a id="Post-WWII_sprawl" name="Post-WWII_sprawl"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-WWII sprawl</span></h3>
      <p>After <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the city experienced considerable sprawl, as the affluent populace bolted for <!--del_lnk--> suburbs like <!--del_lnk--> Johnson County, Kansas and eastern Jackson County. However, many also went north of the Missouri River, where Kansas City had incorporated areas during the 1920s and in 1963. This annexation would pay off for the city in the 1970s, when a population and developmental boom occurred in both Platte and Clay counties, bringing more buisinesses to the Northland and making many of the landowners in the area millionares. The population of the city proper dipped, but over the past 15 years has rebounded to nearly 450,000. Not only has growth in annexed areas (as far north as <!--del_lnk--> Smithville and south as <!--del_lnk--> Cass County) contributed to the growth, but also successful efforts to revitalize the downtown area. Such growth and ability to annex surrounding areas has allowed Kansas City to surpass St. Louis as the largest single <!--del_lnk--> municipality in the state of Missouri.<p><a id="Notable_Kansas_Citians" name="Notable_Kansas_Citians"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Notable Kansas Citians</span></h3>
      <p>Kansas City has served as a launching pad for several storied careers. <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Hemingway.htm" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> wrote for the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas City Star during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. <a href="../../wp/w/Walt_Disney.htm" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> moved to Kansas City and established his first animation studio, <!--del_lnk--> Laugh-O-Gram Studio, at 31st and Locust in <!--del_lnk--> 1923. Early screen actors <!--del_lnk--> Jean Harlow, <!--del_lnk--> Ginger Rogers and <!--del_lnk--> Craig Stevens, writers <!--del_lnk--> Robert Heinlein, <!--del_lnk--> William Least Heat Moon and director <!--del_lnk--> Robert Altman all grew up in Kansas City.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>
      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 318.0 <!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (823.7 <!--del_lnk--> km&sup2;). 313.5 mi&sup2; (812.1 km&sup2;) of it is land and 4.5 mi&sup2; (11.6 km&sup2;) of it (1.41%) is water.<p>Kansas City is often imagined by outsiders to be flat like Chicago, Dallas or New York, but in fact it has many rolling hills. Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by <!--del_lnk--> limestone and <!--del_lnk--> bedrock cliffs that were carved by <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a>. Kansas City is situated at the junction between the <!--del_lnk--> Dakota and <!--del_lnk--> Minnesota ice lobes during the maximum late <!--del_lnk--> Independence glaciation of the <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene <!--del_lnk--> epoch. The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central portion of Kansas City, Missouri. This valley is an eastward continuation of Turkey Creek valley. <!--del_lnk--> Union Station is located in this valley.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h3>
      <p>Kansas City lies almost in the exact geographic centre of the continental United States, at the confluence of the second largest river in the country, the Missouri River, and the Kansas River (also known as the Kaw River). This makes for a <!--del_lnk--> continental climate with moderate precipitation and extremes of hot and cold. Summers can be very humid, with moist air riding up from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and July/August daytime highs reaching into the triple digits. Winters vary from mild days to bitterly cold, with lows reaching into the teens below zero a few times a year. Spring and Autumn are pleasant, and peppered with thunderstorms.<table class="wikitable">

Truman</a>, who became a Senator, <!--del_lnk--> Vice President of the United States and then <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> from <!--del_lnk--> 1945-<!--del_lnk--> 1953.<p>Kansas City has hosted the <!--del_lnk--> 1900 Democratic National Convention, the <!--del_lnk--> 1928 Republican National Convention, which nominated <a href="../../wp/h/Herbert_Hoover.htm" title="Herbert Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Iowa for President, and the memorable <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Republican National Convention, which nominated Kansas U.S. Senator <!--del_lnk--> Bob Dole for Vice President.<p>Kansas City consistently votes Democractic in Presidential elections, however on the state and local level Republicans often find some modest success. Missouri was a <!--del_lnk--> Blue state in the 1996 Presidential election and <!--del_lnk--> Red state in the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections. Since Kansas City borders on the state of <!--del_lnk--> Kansas which consistently votes Republican, and since the suburbs of Kansas City typically vote Republican, the city is sometimes associated with Republicans.<p><a id="Crime" name="Crime"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crime</span></h2>
      <p>As of October 30, 2006, Kansas City ranks as twenty first highest amount of crime in the United States, as reported by the FBI.<p>Kansas City ranked eighth in rate of murders in the 2004 <!--del_lnk--> United States cities by crime rate for cities with populations more than 400,000. The entire Kansas City metropolitan area has the fourth worst violent crime rate among cities with more than 100,000 with a rate of 614.7 crimes per 100,000 residents.<p>Most of the city&#39;s murders and violent crimes occur in the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> inner core. The violent crime rates in the core have consistently driven the city and metropolitan area down on &quot;livability&quot; indexes, hindering initiatives in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> 1980s and <!--del_lnk--> 1990s to revive downtown Kansas City. In recent years, however, attempts at revitalizing the downtown area have been more successful. Downtown currently has one of the lowest crime rates in the urban core, and thousands more people have moved to this area. However, other parts of the urban core with higher <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a> levels remain places where crime is unabated.<p>Some of the earliest violence in Kansas City erupted during the bloody <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Shortly after its founding in 1853, the <!--del_lnk--> Bleeding Kansas incidents erupted affecting <!--del_lnk--> border ruffians and <!--del_lnk--> Jayhawkers who both lived in the city. During the war, Union troops <!--del_lnk--> burned all occupied dwellings in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas.<p>After the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas City Times turned <!--del_lnk--> Jesse James into a folk hero in its coverage. James was born in the metro area at <!--del_lnk--> Kearney, Missouri and robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th and Campbell.<p>In the early 20th Century under &quot;Boss&quot; Tom Pendergast, Kansas City became the country&#39;s &quot;most wide open town&quot;, with virtually no enforcement of liquor laws or hours. While this would give rise to <!--del_lnk--> Kansas City Jazz, it also led to the rise of the Kansas City mob (initially under <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Lazia) as well as the arrival of gangsters. The 1930&#39;s saw the <!--del_lnk--> Kansas City Massacre at <!--del_lnk--> Union Station, as well as a shootout between police and outlaws <!--del_lnk--> Bonnie and Clyde at the <!--del_lnk--> Red Crown Tavern near what is now <!--del_lnk--> Kansas City International Airport.<p>In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gangland war over control of the <!--del_lnk--> River Quay entertainment district in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations into the mob took hold after boss <!--del_lnk--> Nick Civella was recorded discussing gambling bets on <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl IV (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated Minnesota). The war and investigation would lead to the end of mob control of the <!--del_lnk--> Stardust Casino, which was the basis for the movie <!--del_lnk--> Casino (although the Kansas City connections are minimized in the movie).<p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, musician <!--del_lnk--> Andre &quot;Mac Dre&quot; Hicks was killed in Kansas City after performing a concert. Later, <!--del_lnk--> Anthony &quot;Fat Tone&quot; Watkins was killed in retaliation for the death of Mac Dre. Mac Minister was taken to prison for the murder of Fat Tone.<p><a id="Sister_cities" name="Sister_cities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sister cities</span></h2>

       <li>Buses run 7 days a week from 5:00am to 1:00am. During rush hour periods, the buses make stops every 10 minutes. All other times, the buses make stops every 15-30 minutes.

The stockyards, which were second only to those of Chicago in size, never recovered from the <!--del_lnk--> Great Flood of 1951 and eventually closed.

In 1946 <!--del_lnk--> Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q was opened by one of Perry&#39;s cooks. The Gates recipe added even more molasses. Although Bryant&#39;s and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants they have had little or no luck exporting the barbecue beyond the Kansas City metropolitan area.<p>In 1977 <!--del_lnk--> Rich Davis, a child psychologist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it <!--del_lnk--> KC Masterpiece and in <!--del_lnk--> 1986 he sold the sauce to the Kingsford division of <!--del_lnk--> Clorox. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, with a restaurant in the suburb of Overland Park, KS.<p>One of the most popular and recognized BBQ establishments in Kansas City is <!--del_lnk--> Fiorella&#39;s Jack Stack Restaurant. As of November 2006, the Fiorella family has 4 restaurants in the Kansas CIty area. Russ Fiorella started the chain in 1957 and then continued by his son, Jack and Jack&#39;s wife Delores.

      <p>Kansas City Jazz in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the <!--del_lnk--> 1940s. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s City Boss <!--del_lnk--> Tom Pendergast was at his height of his power and left Kansas City a wide open town in which night clubs were allowed to remain open from dusk to dawn. In this venue, an era of <!--del_lnk--> musical improvisation developed in which it was not uncommon for a single &quot;song&quot; to be performed all night by competing performers who passed through the city. The era ended in <!--del_lnk--> 1936 when producer <!--del_lnk--> John H. Hammond began signing Kansas City talent and transferring the acts to <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>.<p>The era of Kansas City influence is bracketed by the signing of <!--del_lnk--> Count Basie in <!--del_lnk--> 1929 to the advent of Kansas City native <!--del_lnk--> Charlie Parker in the 1940s. Pendergast pleaded guilty to income tax evasion in <!--del_lnk--> 1939 and the city soon began a crackdown of the clubs.<p>In the 1970s Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a sanitized family friendly atmosphere. In the 1970s an effort to open jazz clubs in the River Quay area of City Market along the Missouri ended in a gangland war in which three of the new clubs were blown up in what ultimately resulted in the removal of Kansas City mob influence in the Las Vegas casinos that was partially depicted in the movie <!--del_lnk--> Casino (movie).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1981, 114 people died in the <!--del_lnk--> Hyatt Regency walkway collapse at a <!--del_lnk--> tea dance that was attempting to recreate the jazz era. In <!--del_lnk--> 1999 the <!--del_lnk--> American Jazz Museum opened in the 18th and Vine neighbourhood.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h4>
      <p>Kansas City has an avid local music scene and is a very popular locale for many <!--del_lnk--> punk and <!--del_lnk--> hip-hop acts.
