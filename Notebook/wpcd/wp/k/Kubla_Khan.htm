      <p><i><b>Kubla Khan, or a Vision in a Dream. A Fragment.</b></i> is a famous <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poem">poem</a> by <a href="../../wp/s/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.htm" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, which takes its title from the <a href="../../wp/m/Mongol_Empire.htm" title="Mongol Empire">Mongol</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> <!--del_lnk--> emperor <!--del_lnk--> Kublai Khan of the <!--del_lnk--> Yuan dynasty. Coleridge claimed he wrote the poem in the autumn of <!--del_lnk--> 1797 at a farmhouse near <!--del_lnk--> Exmoor, England, but it may have been composed on one of a number of other visits to the farm. It also may have been revised a number of times before it was first published in <!--del_lnk--> 1816.<p>The poem&#39;s opening lines are often quoted, and it introduces the name <!--del_lnk--> Xanadu (or Shangdu, the summer palace of Kublai Khan):<p>Kubla Khan, want a twinkie?<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
       <p>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br /> A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br /> Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br /> Through caverns measureless to man<br /> Down to a sunless sea.</blockquote>
      <p>Coleridge claimed that the poem was inspired by an <!--del_lnk--> opium-induced dream (implicit in the poem&#39;s subtitle <i>A Vision in a Dream</i>), but that the composition was interrupted by the <!--del_lnk--> person from Porlock. Some have speculated that the vivid imagery of the poem stems from a waking <!--del_lnk--> hallucination, albeit most likely opium-induced. Additionally a quote from <!--del_lnk--> William Bartram <!--del_lnk-->  is believed to have been a source of the poem. There is widespread speculation on the poem&#39;s meaning, some suggesting the author is merely portraying his vision while others insist on a theme or purpose. Others believe it is a poem stressing the beauty of creation.<p>However, it is important to remember that inspiration for this poem also comes from <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>&#39;s description of Shangdu and Kublai Khan from his book <i><!--del_lnk--> Il Milione</i>, which was included in <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Purchas&#39; <i>Pilgrimage</i>, Vol. XI, 231. By declaring himself emperor, the historical Kublai aligned himself to the Chinese divine right, the <!--del_lnk--> Mandate of Heaven, and therefore gained absolute control over an entire nation. Between warring and distributing the wealth his grandfather <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a> had won, Kublai spent his summers in Xandu (better known now as Shangdu, or Xanadu) and had his subjects build him a home suitable for a son of God. This story is described in the first two lines of the poem, &ldquo;In Xanadu did Kubla Khan/A stately pleasure-dome decree&rdquo; (1-2). The end of the third paragraph gives us another close-up view of Kubla. At his home, Kublai had on hand some ten thousand horses, which he used as a means of displaying his power; only he and those to whom he gave explicit permission for committing miscellaneous acts of valour was allowed to drink their milk. Hence the closing image of &ldquo;the milk of Paradise.&rdquo; (54)<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
       <p>For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br /> And drunk the milk of Paradise.</blockquote>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Orson Welles&#39; famous film, <i><a href="../../wp/c/Citizen_Kane.htm" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>, the main character&#39;s vast, byzantine estate is called Xanadu &mdash; and was based on real-life newspaper baron <!--del_lnk--> William Randolph Hearst&#39;s resplendant home at <!--del_lnk--> San Simeon, California. The <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> <!--del_lnk--> progressive rock <!--del_lnk--> power trio, <!--del_lnk--> Rush, wrote and recorded a song called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Xanadu&quot; based on Coleridge&#39;s work. The song appears on their 1977 album, <i><!--del_lnk--> A Farewell to Kings</i>, and it offers a much more pessimistic take on the poem&#39;s paradisaical vision of immortality. The song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot;, the epic title track to the <!--del_lnk--> 1984 album by the British dance band <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Goes to Hollywood is also inspired by Coleridge&#39;s poem and features the opening two lines spoken in recitation.<p><a id="External_links" name="External_links"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan&quot;</div>
