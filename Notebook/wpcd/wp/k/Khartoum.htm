      <p>Khartoum was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1821 by Muhammad Ali , the ruler of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, as an outpost for the Egyptian army, but grew as a regional centre of trade, including the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> trade. Troops loyal to the <!--del_lnk--> Mahdi <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Ahmad laid siege to Khartoum starting on <!--del_lnk--> March 13, <!--del_lnk--> 1884 against the defenders led by <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> General <!--del_lnk--> Charles George Gordon, resulting in the massacre of the Anglo-Egyptian garrison.<p>The heavily damaged city fell to the Mahdists on <!--del_lnk--> January 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1885. Omdurman was the scene of the bloody <!--del_lnk--> battle (<!--del_lnk--> September 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1898) in which British forces under <!--del_lnk--> Sirdar <!--del_lnk--> Horatio Kitchener defeated the Mahdist forces defending the city.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1899 Khartoum became capital of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and, with the independence of Sudan in <!--del_lnk--> 1956, the capital of the new country.<p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h3>
      <p>In 1973, the city was the site of a <!--del_lnk--> hostage crisis in which members of <!--del_lnk--> Black September held ten hostages at the <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi</a> embassy, five of whom were diplomats. The US ambassador, the US deputy ambassador, and the Belgian Charg&eacute; d&#39;affaires were murdered. The remaining hostages were released (see <!--del_lnk--> Khartoum diplomatic assassinations).<p>The first oil pipeline between Khartoum and <!--del_lnk--> Port Sudan was completed in 1977.<p>Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Khartoum was the destination for hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflicts in neighboring nations such as <a href="../../wp/c/Chad.htm" title="Chad">Chad</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>. The refugees settled in large slums at the outskirts of the city. From the mid-1980s onward, large numbers of <!--del_lnk--> internally displaced from the violence of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Sudanese Civil War and <a href="../../wp/d/Darfur_conflict.htm" title="Darfur conflict">Darfur conflict</a> have settled around Khartoum.<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> accused <a href="../../wp/o/Osama_bin_Laden.htm" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> al-Qaeda group of responsibility and launched <!--del_lnk--> cruise missile attacks (<!--del_lnk--> August 20) on the <!--del_lnk--> al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum. The factory, whose destruction had devastating effects on the Sudanese economy, may have been wrongly targeted as strong evidence against any ties to bin Laden has surfaced.<p>The <a href="../../wp/a/Arab_League.htm" title="Arab League">Arab League</a> summit of March 28-29, 2006 was held in Khartoum, during which the Arab League awarded <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> the Arab League presidency.<p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h2>
