      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Whyte notation, a <b>4-6-0</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> railroad <!--del_lnk--> steam locomotive that has a two-axle <!--del_lnk--> leading truck followed by three <!--del_lnk--> driving axles. This wheel arrangement became the second-most popular configuration for new steam locomotives in <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">America</a> in the mid-19th century. It is commonly called a <b>Ten-wheeler</b>.<p>The equivalent <!--del_lnk--> UIC classification is <b>2&#39;C</b>.<p>

      <p>The first 4-6-0 built in America was the <i>Chesapeake</i>. It was built by <!--del_lnk--> Norris in March 1847 for the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia and Reading railroad. There is still a question as to who was the original designer of this type. Many authorities attribute the design to <!--del_lnk--> Septimus Norris, but in a paper written in 1885, George E. Sellers attributes the design to <!--del_lnk--> John Brandt.<p>Brandt worked for the Erie Railway between 1842 and 1851. The Erie&#39;s own management didn&#39;t feel it in their best interests to pursue construction, so Brandt showed the design to <!--del_lnk--> Baldwin and Norris. Baldwin was similarly unimpressed, but Norris liked the idea. According to Sellers, <!--del_lnk--> James Millholland, of the Reading, saw the 4-6-0 design as well and ordered one from Norris for the Reading. However, Sellers may have misrecalled a few of the specifics as Millholland did not work for the Reading until 1848, a year later. Also, Sellers lists the first 4-6-0 constructed as the <i>Susquehanna</i>, which was the Erie railroad&#39;s first 4-6-0.<p>The attribution to Septimus Norris lies in a patent that many sources cite for this locomotive type that was filed in 1846. However, such a patent has not yet been found in searches at the <!--del_lnk--> USPTO. Septimus Norris did file a patent in 1854 for running gears, and the patent application showed a 4-6-0 in the drawing. Norris&#39; wording in the 1854 patent was vague in regard to the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement; the filing didn&#39;t specifically claim invention of the 4-6-0 type.<p>A few days after William Norris completed the <i>Chesapeake</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Hinkley completed their first 4-6-0, the <i>New Hampshire</i> for the <!--del_lnk--> Boston and Maine Railroad. The first 4-6-0 from <!--del_lnk--> Rogers was the previously mentioned <i>Susquehanna</i> for the Erie Railroad.<p>Baldwin&#39;s first 4-6-0 did not appear until 1852. Through the 1860s and into the 1870s, demand for the 4-6-0 grew as more railroad executives switched from purchasing a single, general-purpose type of locomotive (at that time, the <a href="../../wp/4/4-4-0.htm" title="4-4-0">4-4-0</a>), to purchasing locomotives for specific purposes. Both the <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Baltimore and Ohio were early adopters of the 4-6-0, using them for fast freight and heavy passenger trains.<p>

      <p>The first 4-6-0 to be introduced to Britain was the <!--del_lnk--> Highland Railway Jones Goods Class in 1894, but the type later mostly found use as <!--del_lnk--> mixed traffic and passenger locomotives, British freight trains being generally too slow to require a four-wheel <!--del_lnk--> leading truck.<p>
