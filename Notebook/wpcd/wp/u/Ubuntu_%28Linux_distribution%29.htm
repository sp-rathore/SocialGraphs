      <p><b>Ubuntu</b> (<!--del_lnk--> IPA pronunciation: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/u&#39;buntu/</span>) is a widely used <!--del_lnk--> Linux distribution predominantly targeted at personal computers. Based on <!--del_lnk--> Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu concentrates on <!--del_lnk--> usability, regular releases, ease of installation, and freedom from legal restrictions. Ubuntu is sponsored by <!--del_lnk--> Canonical Ltd., a private company founded by <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South African</a> <!--del_lnk--> entrepreneur <!--del_lnk--> Mark Shuttleworth.<p>The name of the distribution comes from the <a href="../../wp/z/Zulu.htm" title="Zulu">Zulu</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Xhosa concept of <i><!--del_lnk--> ubuntu</i>, and can be roughly defined as, &quot;the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity&quot;. Ubuntu&rsquo;s slogan &ndash; &ldquo;Linux for Human Beings&rdquo;, encapsulates one of its main goals &ndash; making Linux more available and easy to use.<p>The most recent version, Ubuntu 7.04 <i>(Feisty Fawn)</i>, was released on <!--del_lnk--> April 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2007. Version 7.10 <i>(Gutsy Gibbon)</i> is scheduled for release on <!--del_lnk--> October 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2007.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p><a id="History_and_development" name="History_and_development"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History and development</span></h2>
      <p>Originally referred to as <i>no-name-yet.com</i>, Ubuntu&#39;s first release on <!--del_lnk--> October 20, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 (version 4.10, following the &quot;Y.MM&quot; standard) began as a temporary <!--del_lnk--> fork of Debian GNU/Linux, with the aim of drawing from Debian&#39;s code regularly in order to allow for a new version of Ubuntu to be released every six months, in step with the six month <a href="../../wp/g/GNOME.htm" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> release cycle. In contrast to other general-purpose forks of Debian such as <!--del_lnk--> Xandros, <!--del_lnk--> Linspire and <!--del_lnk--> Libranet, Canonical remains close to Debian&#39;s philosophy with Ubuntu and uses predominantly <!--del_lnk--> free software rather than making the inclusion of proprietary applications part of their <!--del_lnk--> business model.<p>Ubuntu uses Debian&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Advanced Packaging Tool to manage installed packages. Ubuntu packages are generally based on packages from Debian&#39;s <i>unstable</i> repository; however, they are not always compatible with each other. Several Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of packages within Debian&#39;s repositories, and Ubuntu changes are contributed back to Debian as they are made, rather than being announced only at release time. <!--del_lnk--> Ian Murdock, the founder of Debian, criticised Ubuntu in April 2005 for incompatibilities between its packages and those of <!--del_lnk--> Debian <i>sarge</i>, saying that Ubuntu had diverged too far to remain compatible.<p>Bugs in Ubuntu are tracked through the <!--del_lnk--> Launchpad web interface, which integrates with the <!--del_lnk--> Bazaar version control system in a similar way to <!--del_lnk--> SourceForge&#39;s integration with <!--del_lnk--> CVS.<p>Ubuntu is currently funded by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Shuttleworth through <!--del_lnk--> Canonical Ltd. On <!--del_lnk--> July 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Canonical announced the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu Foundation and provided an initial funding of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>10 million. The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of Ubuntu, but as of 2006, the foundation remains dormant. Shuttleworth describes the foundation as an emergency fund should Canonical&#39;s involvement end.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2007 <!--del_lnk--> Dell announced it would sell desktops and laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed. It also stated that customers would be able to buy support for Ubuntu through Dell, the support coming from Canonical.<p><a id="Features" name="Features"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Features</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Usability" name="Usability"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Usability</span></h3>
      <p>Ubuntu uses <a href="../../wp/g/GNOME.htm" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> as its default <!--del_lnk--> desktop environment, intended to provide a free, simple and intuitive interface. Whilst offering a full range of desktop applications including <a href="../../wp/o/OpenOffice.org.htm" title="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mozilla_Firefox.htm" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> and <!--del_lnk--> GIMP, it aims to avoid overlap in its default feature set rather than providing many different variants of similar packages.<p>After the initial Ubuntu installation, the user is greeted by a default desktop with no desktop icons and an orange-brown <!--del_lnk--> user interface, unusual in an operating system as nearly all others use blue as their default colour. Applications are located under the &#39;Applications menu&#39;, a desktop launcher menu in the top-left corner. Open windows can be viewed on the taskbar along the bottom of the screen. Ubuntu is available in over 40 languages, and also allows users to submit additional translations using the Rosetta Translation tool.<p>Ubuntu&#39;s focus on usability includes the widespread use of the <code><!--del_lnk--> sudo</code> tool, which allows users to carry out administrative tasks without initiating a potentially unsafe <!--del_lnk--> superuser session.<p><a id="Distribution" name="Distribution"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Distribution</span></h3>
      <p>Ubuntu ships as an <!--del_lnk--> ISO image that fits on a single <a href="../../wp/c/Compact_Disc.htm" title="CD">CD</a> or alternatively, in the case of the older version, Dapper Drake 6.06 LTS, and just released Feisty Fawn 7.04, mailed free to anyone requesting them via Canonical&#39;s <i>ShipIt</i> service. This is intended to reduce the amount of time it takes to download Ubuntu and the possibility of losing part of the installation software and/or to aid those users who are not comfortable/able to burn an ISO image to CD. Many Linux distributions necessitate the downloading of multiple ISO images and hours of installation process, while Ubuntu is one of the few distributions that can be installed quickly, and from a single CD. Additionally, all Ubuntu versions since 4.10 can be downloaded for free.<div class="thumb tright">
      </div>
      <p>Since version 6.06 LTS, Ubuntu&#39;s disc has served both as a <!--del_lnk--> live CD and an install disc. This disc boots into a fully featured desktop, allowing the user to see whether his hardware is compatible and experiment with the applications available. The CD also allows the user to install Ubuntu to the hard disk using the <i>Ubiquity</i> application, and preserves documents created on the live desktop. An alternate install disc using the text-mode <!--del_lnk--> debian-installer is also available, aimed towards those with lower system specifications, towards administrators installing Ubuntu on many systems, and for complex <!--del_lnk--> disk partitioning.<p>The live CD also contains a collection of free and <!--del_lnk--> open source applications including <a href="../../wp/m/Mozilla_Firefox.htm" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mozilla Thunderbird, <!--del_lnk--> AbiWord, <!--del_lnk--> Blender and <!--del_lnk--> ClamAV, prepared in collaboration with the <!--del_lnk--> OpenCD project, which can be installed if Windows is running while the CD is in the drive.<p>There are two types of releases: one for <!--del_lnk--> desktop and <!--del_lnk--> laptop computers and one for <!--del_lnk--> servers. The desktop and laptop version is available for <!--del_lnk--> x86 and <!--del_lnk--> x86-64 computers. The server edition is available for both platforms in addition to <!--del_lnk--> SPARC and does not ship as a Live CD (using the text-mode installer exclusively).<p><a id="Accessibility" name="Accessibility"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Accessibility</span></h3>
      <p>Ubuntu emphasizes <!--del_lnk--> accessibility and <!--del_lnk--> internationalisation, to reach as many people as possible. Since version 5.04, <!--del_lnk--> UTF-8 has been the default <!--del_lnk--> character encoding. High-visibility themes, screen-reading software, and an on-screen keyboard all come with Ubuntu.<p>Canonical&#39;s <i>Rosetta</i> tool is a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Launchpad <!--del_lnk--> web-based application which allows Ubuntu users to contribute <!--del_lnk--> translations of Ubuntu software in a straightforward way.<p><a id="Ease_of_installation" name="Ease_of_installation"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Ease of installation</span></h3>
      <p>Ubuntu is installed using a live CD (or <!--del_lnk--> LiveDistro). Users may boot their computer from the CD instead of the hard disk. When they are ready to install, they launch an installer which guides them through the process.<p>Details of the installation process can be found on the <!--del_lnk--> main Ubuntu site and at <!--del_lnk--> Easy Ubuntu Linux.<p>After installation, Ubuntu also offers an automatic updating feature. With user permission, the system will find, retrieve, install, and configure software updates.<p><a id="Community" name="Community"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Community</span></h3>
      <p>Ubuntu places particular emphasis on community involvement with the development process.<p>Ubuntu has a number of official <!--del_lnk--> web forums where discussion of the operating system is encouraged. Canonical host a number of <!--del_lnk--> mailing lists for the project and the developer mailing lists and Ubuntu&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> developer conferences remain open to users. Ubuntu&#39;s regular development conferences are open to the general public.<p>Users are encouraged to make use of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Fridge</i>, a community <!--del_lnk--> weblog intended to keep users informed with Ubuntu-related news.<p>The <i>Human</i> user interface theme in Ubuntu is characterised by shades of brown and orange, with art intended to mimic African tribal imagery. Illustrations of human beings in global communities feature prominently in Ubuntu promotional artwork.<p><a id="Package_classification_and_support" name="Package_classification_and_support"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Package classification and support</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>Ubuntu divides all software into four sections, called <b>components</b>, to reflect differences in licensing and level of support available. The components are Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse.<p>Main and Universe contain software which meets the Ubuntu license requirements, which correspond roughly to the <!--del_lnk--> Debian Free Software Guidelines. Main may also contain binary <!--del_lnk--> firmware and selected <!--del_lnk--> fonts used in supported software that cannot be modified without permission. In all cases, redistribution is unencumbered.<p>Non-free <!--del_lnk--> device drivers remain in the Restricted component, where support is present because of their importance, but limited due to lack of, or limited, access to the source code.<p>It is intended that Main and Restricted contain all software needed for a general-use desktop operating system. Other, unsupported programs are placed in Universe (free) and Multiverse (Non-free). Multiverse contains software packages which may infringe on U.S. and international <!--del_lnk--> patent or <!--del_lnk--> copyright law. Examples of these include software that enables the playback of patented media formats. Due to the questionable legal status of unofficial DVD-decoding in some parts of the world, <!--del_lnk--> Libdvdcss was removed from Ubuntu&#39;s official repository, but can still be downloaded at the <!--del_lnk--> VideoLAN Project&#39;s website. Encoding and decoding libraries for many proprietary media formats such as <!--del_lnk--> Windows Media are also unavailable by default.<p><i>Ubuntu Backports</i> is an officially recognized project to <!--del_lnk--> backport newer versions of certain software that are available only in unstable versions of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive; it mostly consists of user-requested packages, which are approved if they meet quality guidelines.<p>Unofficial utilities such as <!--del_lnk--> EasyUbuntu and <!--del_lnk--> Automatix aim to automate the installation and configuration of software which is not officially packaged for Ubuntu for legal or philosophical reasons. They are not recommended by the Ubuntu development team and have been accused of breaking updates.<p>Ubuntu has a certification system for <!--del_lnk--> third-party proprietary software, and Canonical manage a special repository for certified proprietary packages named <i>Commercial</i>, which includes software that Canonical have obtained special permission to distribute. As of this writing, the repository includes the <!--del_lnk--> Opera web browser and the <!--del_lnk--> RealPlayer media player.<p><a id="Releases" name="Releases"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Releases</span></h2>

      <p>The first release, 4.10, introduced an update manager and improved laptop capabilities. 5.04 was the first release to allow bugs to be reported via <!--del_lnk--> Launchpad. It also intoduced a graphical progress bar during boot-up. Third release, 6.06 LTS, was the first to include the Live CD and installer on the same disc.

The latest release, 7.04, includes wireless <!--del_lnk--> WPA support, easier installation of restricted <!--del_lnk--> codecs and optional desktop effects such as a wobble on moving a window. During the installation, wizard can detect <a href="../../wp/w/Windows_XP.htm" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a> accounts and transfer data from them. There is also a <!--del_lnk--> KVM virtualisation support. The planned 7.10 release will include more graphical desktop effects, an unattended installation and more <!--del_lnk--> Click&#39;N&#39;Run options.<p><a id="Long_Term_Support" name="Long_Term_Support"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Long Term Support</span></h3>

      <p>Release 6.06 LTS, codenamed &quot;Dapper Drake&quot;, is the first <i>Long Term Support</i> release of Ubuntu. Canonical intends to support LTS releases with updates longer than other Ubuntu releases. Package updates are planned and paid technical support is available for three years on the desktop and five years on the server.<p>Ubuntu 6.06 LTS initially included GNOME 2.14, Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.3, OpenOffice.org 2.0.2, <!--del_lnk--> Xorg 7.0, <!--del_lnk--> GCC 4.0.3, and version 2.6.15 of the <!--del_lnk--> Linux kernel. The first maintenance release, version 6.06.1, appeared on <!--del_lnk--> 10 August <!--del_lnk--> 2006, and is still distributed alongside more recent releases.<p>Version 6.06 was the first to be distributed as a single <a href="../../wp/c/Compact_Disc.htm" title="Compact disc">compact disc</a> that served both as a <!--del_lnk--> Live CD and an install disc. This disc boots into a full-featured desktop, allowing users to see whether their hardware is compatible and experiment with the applications available and then install Ubuntu to the hard disk using the <i>Ubiquity</i> graphical installer. The installation process preserves documents created on the live desktop. An alternate install disc using the text-mode <!--del_lnk--> debian-installer is available for download, and is aimed at people with lower system specifications, administrators installing on many systems, and for complex <!--del_lnk--> disk partitioning including the use of <!--del_lnk--> LVM or <!--del_lnk--> RAID.<p>Because of the longer support cycle, ShipIt program continued to ship Dapper, rather than switching to newer Edgy Eft. However, since 11 April 2007, Feisty Fawn is available for ordering on the ShipIt website.<p>The next LTS release is expected to be released in 2008 - either Gutsy+1 (8.04) or Gutsy+2 (8.10).<p><a id="Edgy_Eft" name="Edgy_Eft"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Edgy Eft</span></h3>

      <p>The following Ubuntu release, version 6.10, known as &quot;Edgy Eft&quot;, debuted new features such as a new <!--del_lnk--> System V init daemon replacement called <!--del_lnk--> Upstart, as well as improvements to the memory usage of applications like <!--del_lnk--> Evolution and <!--del_lnk--> Nautilus which led to an increase in the speed of system boot up and application launch compared to version 6.06. Major applications in this release include <a href="../../wp/g/GNOME.htm" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> 2.16.1, <a href="../../wp/m/Mozilla_Firefox.htm" title="Mozilla Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a> 2.0, <a href="../../wp/o/OpenOffice.org.htm" title="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a> 2.0.4, <!--del_lnk--> X.Org Server 7.1.1, <!--del_lnk--> GCC 4.1.1, and version 2.6.17 of the <!--del_lnk--> Linux kernel.<p>Like previous releases, Edgy allows for direct <!--del_lnk--> upgrades from the previous version. Upgrading from version 6.06 is not performed automatically like normal package upgrades, requiring a special switch to <!--del_lnk--> Update Manager. Other methods, such as the <tt>dist-upgrade</tt> feature of apt-get, are not recommended. Some users reported serious trouble in the process.<p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h3>
      <p>The next stable release will be Ubuntu 7.10, codenamed &quot;Gutsy Gibbon&quot;. Currently, this release is scheduled for <!--del_lnk--> 18 October <!--del_lnk--> 2007. Gutsy is planned to also include a version containing only software that can be modified and redistributed, that is <!--del_lnk--> free software, in conjunction with <!--del_lnk--> gNewSense.<p><a id="System_requirements" name="System_requirements"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">System requirements</span></h3>
      <p>The current Ubuntu release, 7.04, requires 256 <!--del_lnk--> megabytes of <!--del_lnk--> RAM, and, when installed to the <!--del_lnk--> hard disk, requires at least three <!--del_lnk--> gigabytes of hard-disk space if installed as the usual Desktop installation. The Server installation requires 64MB of RAM and 500MB of hard disk space.<p><a id="Known_problems" name="Known_problems"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Known problems</span></h3>
      <p>Upgrading to Ubuntu 7.04 from previous versions has been known to cause the boot process to fail. The main symptom is a partial boot followed by a command prompt showing several processes failing due to &quot;unknown stanza&quot;. A critical file necessary for booting Ubuntu contains a typo, which has caused this problem. Currently the best way to solve this problem is to reformat the hard drive or partition containing Ubuntu and do a complete re-install from the Ubuntu Live CD. Support for solving this problem may be found at the <!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu Team Wiki.<p><a id="Variants" name="Variants"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Variants</span></h2>

      <p>Variants of Ubuntu are divided into two broad categories:<ol>
       <li>Subsets of the distribution created by and within Ubuntu with a custom installer or <!--del_lnk--> live CD that highlight certain aspects or software within the distribution. These are variously referred to as subproject, or flavours. They are analogous to &quot;custom distributions&quot; in the Debian community.<li>Derivatives of Ubuntu created by individuals, groups or organization working outside of the Ubuntu project but using or tracking Ubuntu software. These projects are technically <!--del_lnk--> forks of Ubuntu.</ol>
      <p><a id="Official.2Finternal_variants" name="Official.2Finternal_variants"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Official/internal variants</span></h3>
      <p>There are several official variants of Ubuntu available, with releases simultaneous with Ubuntu&#39;s, as their packages are drawn from the same repositories. They are:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Kubuntu, which uses <!--del_lnk--> KDE instead of <a href="../../wp/g/GNOME.htm" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> as the default <!--del_lnk--> desktop environment.<li><!--del_lnk--> Edubuntu, &quot;designed for school environments, and should be equally suitable for kids to use at home.&quot;<li><!--del_lnk--> Xubuntu, which uses the <!--del_lnk--> Xfce as the default desktop environment and is designed for less powerful computers.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu Server Edition, which provides server applications.</ul>
      <p>Kubuntu, Ubuntu and Edubuntu can be ordered as CDs from the ShipIt service.<p><a id="Unofficial_derivatives" name="Unofficial_derivatives"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Unofficial derivatives</span></h3>
      <p>Other derivates include unofficial variants that usually use alternate windowing systems.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Elbuntu uses the <!--del_lnk--> Enlightenment window manager.<li><!--del_lnk--> Fluxbuntu uses the <!--del_lnk--> Fluxbox <!--del_lnk--> window manager. It is intended for use on machines too slow to run a full desktop environment well.<li><!--del_lnk--> Linux For Clinics aims to create a medical friendly Ubuntu distribution.<li><!--del_lnk--> Uberyl A Ubuntu based distribution that has <!--del_lnk--> Beryl and Automatix by default.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu Lite shares a similar goal (intended for use on machines too slow to run a full desktop environment ), but uses <!--del_lnk--> IceWM instead.<li><!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu Studio is a release geared towards multimedia production and uses the <a href="../../wp/g/GNOME.htm" title="GNOME">GNOME</a> <!--del_lnk--> desktop environment.<li><!--del_lnk--> nUbuntu uses <!--del_lnk--> Fluxbox to be more lightweight, but aims to appeal to experienced Linux users, particularly in the area of <!--del_lnk--> network security.</ul>
      <p><a id="Specific_derivatives" name="Specific_derivatives"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Specific derivatives</span></h3>
      <p>Mark Shuttleworth has also endorsed the creation of an Ubuntu distribution using only <!--del_lnk--> Free Software Foundation-approved free software. Its release is now planned to coincide with Gutsy Gibbon. A project with similar goals, <!--del_lnk--> gNewSense, was released on <!--del_lnk--> November 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2006; gNewSense is not an official version of Ubuntu.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> LinuxMCE (Linux Media Centre Edition) is an alternative to Microsoft&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Windows Media Centre based on Ubuntu.<li><!--del_lnk--> Scibuntu aims to make scientific programs more accessible.</ul>
      <p>It was widely rumoured that <a href="../../wp/g/Google.htm" title="Google">Google</a> would be distributing an Ubuntu derivative called <!--del_lnk--> Goobuntu. Google confirmed that it has created a modified version of Ubuntu but insisted there are no plans to distribute it outside the company.<p><!--del_lnk--> xUbuntu (not to be confused with <!--del_lnk--> Xubuntu) is an PC-/Xbox-enabled version of Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution. xUbuntu is not a stand-alone, independent distribution. The install process, the bootloader, the kernel and the kernel modules - are all customized for PC and Xbox (i386).<p><a id="Support" name="Support"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Support</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ubuntu website offers both commercial and community support. Community support is free while commercial requires payments.<p>Community support is available in the forms of <!--del_lnk--> forums, <!--del_lnk--> IRC channels, <!--del_lnk--> blogs and <!--del_lnk--> documentation.<p>Ubuntu&#39;s Documentation lists extensive guides on all branches of Ubuntu, such as Ubuntu server version, <!--del_lnk--> Kubuntu and <!--del_lnk--> Xubuntu. There are also extensive documentation to help with installation for <!--del_lnk--> i386, <!--del_lnk--> amd64, <!--del_lnk--> powerpc, <!--del_lnk--> sparc, <!--del_lnk--> hppa and <!--del_lnk--> ia64 machines. Extracts from the official Ubuntu book are also included. Documentations are available in <!--del_lnk--> HTML and <!--del_lnk--> PDF form.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> community documentation is an alternative to the official documentation. The community documentation is available in many languages such as, but not limited to: Hebrew, German, French, Russian, Italian, Korean and Chinese. Community Documentations are available on topics such as installation, maintenance, hardware, applications, switching from other operating systems and drivers.<p>Versions are supported for 18 months after release. Long term support (LTS) editions are supported for four to six years.<p><a id="Community_2" name="Community_2"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Community</span></h2>
      <p><b>Ubuntu-Women</b> is a women-oriented project under Ubuntu and sponsored by Canonical to provide a platform and encouragement for women to contribute to free and open source software.<p>Started in January 2006, the goal of Ubuntu-Women is to supplement and inspire women to be more aware of the technical aspects of the Ubuntu world. Here, women can communicate openly and ask questions to volunteers and mentors. By getting involved in this project, one gets the opportunity to create new <!--del_lnk--> FLOSS software.<p>Participation in Ubuntu-Women is open to both men and women using Ubuntu.<p><b>Each-One-Teach-One</b> is a mentoring program where women can interact with experts who volunteer in specific technical, documentation, translation fields which provides them the necessary information and support to grow in the Ubuntu world.<p><a id="Response" name="Response"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Statistics from Google Trends suggest that since late 2005, Google has been receiving increasingly more searches for Ubuntu than for other popular Linux distributions. The Ubuntu page on <!--del_lnk--> DistroWatch has been the most frequently accessed of a comprehensive list of Linux distributions for more than a year. Ubuntu was awarded the Reader Award for best Linux distribution at the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in London. It has been favourably reviewed in online and print publications. At Debconf 6 in May 2006, Mark Shuttleworth stated that &quot;about 6 million Breezy CDs&quot; had been distributed through Ubuntu&#39;s ShipIt program. Many reviewers of Ubuntu point out a main part of Ubuntu&#39;s success is its community. Ubuntu was voted distribution of 2006 on <!--del_lnk--> LinuxQuestions.org.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> French Parliament has decided to switch to Ubuntu in June 2007.<p>Ubuntu and Canonical have received some criticism from the <!--del_lnk--> free software community for the decision to include a larger number of proprietary drivers in the default installation for version 7.04, and as a result have decided to make these drivers optional. Ubuntu has also received criticism from the Debian community, citing that Ubuntu developers have forked the OS significantly enough to cause a break between Debian and Ubuntu developers.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28Linux_distribution%29&quot;</div>
