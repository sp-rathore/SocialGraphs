      <p><b>The University of Texas at Austin</b>, often called <b>UT</b> or <b>Texas</b>, is the <!--del_lnk--> flagship institution of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Texas System. The main campus is located less than a mile from the <!--del_lnk--> Texas State Capitol in <!--del_lnk--> Austin. Founded in 1883, the university is considered to be a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Public Ivy,&quot; and had <!--del_lnk--> the fourth largest single-campus enrollment in the nation as of fall 2006 (and had the largest enrollment in the country from 1997&ndash;2003), with nearly 50,000 undergraduate and graduate students and 20,000 faculty and staff.<p>The university also operates various auxiliary facilities aside from the main campus, most notably the <!--del_lnk--> J.J. Pickle Research Campus. Texas is a major centre for academic research, annually exceeding $380 million in funding. In addition, the University&#39;s notable athletic programs were recognized by <i><!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated,</i> which dubbed UT as &quot;America&#39;s Best Sports College&quot; in 2002. In January 2006, Texas won the <!--del_lnk--> Division I-A national football championship by beating the <!--del_lnk--> USC Trojans in the <!--del_lnk--> Rose Bowl.<p>UT has a network of over 450,000 living alumni, one of the largest of any American university.<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The first mention of a public university in Texas can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> state of <!--del_lnk--> Coahuila y Texas. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was ever taken by the Mexican government. After Texas gained its independence from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of the Republic, which included a provision to establish public education in <!--del_lnk--> republic, including two universities or colleges. On <!--del_lnk--> January 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1839, Congress agreed to eventually set aside fifty <!--del_lnk--> leagues of land towards the effort; in addition, forty acres in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill&quot;.<p>In 1846, Texas was annexed into the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. The state legislature passed the <!--del_lnk--> Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States <!--del_lnk--> bonds towards construction. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities&#39; fifty leagues. However, Texas&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> secession from the Union and the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> prevented further action on these plans.<p>After the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Constitution of 1866 mandated that the state establish a university &quot;at an early day.&quot; The passing of the <!--del_lnk--> Morrill Act in 1862 facilitated the creation of <!--del_lnk--> Texas A&amp;M University, which was established in 1871 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas. During the construction of Texas A&amp;M, the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Constitution of 1876 called for the creation of a &quot;university of the first class,&quot; The University of Texas. It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated one million acres (4000 km&sup2;) in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and <!--del_lnk--> grazing rights going to The University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M.<p>In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original &quot;College Hill,&quot; an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on <!--del_lnk--> September 15, 1883.<p>The old <!--del_lnk--> Victorian-<!--del_lnk--> Gothic <!--del_lnk--> Main Building served as the central point of the campus&#39;s forty acre site, and was used for nearly all purposes. However, by the 1930s, discussions rose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.<p>Constitutional restrictions against funding building construction hampered expansion. However, the funds generated by <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> discovered on university-owned grounds in 1923 were put towards its general endowment fund. This extra revenue allowed the university to pay down its debt, and pass bond in 1931 and 1947, funding the necessary expansion after the enrollment spike following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of <!--del_lnk--> eminent domain. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original forty acres.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> August 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1966, <!--del_lnk--> Charles Whitman, an <!--del_lnk--> architectural engineering major at the university, barricaded himself in the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a <!--del_lnk--> sniper rifle and various other weapons. In a 96-minute stand-off, Whitman killed 15 people and wounded many more . Following the incident, the observation deck was closed until 1968 and closed again in 1975 following a series of <!--del_lnk--> suicide jumps. In 1998, after the installation of security and safety measures, the observation deck reopened to the public.<p><a id="Campus" name="Campus"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Campus</span></h2>

      <p>Today, the university encompasses about 350 acres (1.4 km&sup2;) on its main campus adjacent to downtown Austin and about 850 acres (3.4 km&sup2;) overall, including the <!--del_lnk--> J.J. Pickle Research Campus in north Austin and other properties in Austin and throughout Texas.<p>One of the university&#39;s most visible features is the <!--del_lnk--> Main Building, including a 307-foot tower designed by <!--del_lnk--> Paul Philippe Cret. Completed in 1937, the Main Building is located in the middle of campus. The tower usually appears illuminated in white light in the evening but is lit orange for various special occasions, including athletic victories and academic accomplishments, such as commencement. The tower is darkened for solemn occasions. At the top of the tower is a <!--del_lnk--> carillon of 56 bells, the largest in Texas. Songs are played on weekdays by resident carillonneur Tom Anderson, in addition to the usual pealing of <!--del_lnk--> Westminster Quarters every quarter hour between 6 AM and 9 PM.<p>The university is home to seven museums and seventeen libraries, which hold over eight million volumes. The holdings of the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Harry Ransom Humanities Research Centre include one of only twenty-one remaining complete copies of the <!--del_lnk--> Gutenberg Bible worldwide and the world&#39;s earliest-known photograph: <i>View from the Window at Le Gras</i> taken by <!--del_lnk--> Nic&eacute;phore Ni&eacute;pce. On <!--del_lnk--> April 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the <!--del_lnk--> Blanton Museum of Art opened. The 155,000 square foot (14,000 m&sup2;) museum hosts approximately 17,000 works from Europe, the United States, and Latin America.<p>The university also contains an extensive underground <!--del_lnk--> tunnel system that links many of the buildings. The tunnel system is closed to the public and is guarded by <!--del_lnk--> silent alarms. The tunnels are used for communications and utility service.<p>The university operates a 1.1 megawatt <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus. The university&#39;s first reactor went critical, at Taylor Hall on the main campus, in August 1963 at 10 kW using fuel loaned from the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Government. This reactor was upgraded to 250 kW in 1968. In the late 1980s, the university began work on the reactor for the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab at the Pickle Campus. This reactor went critical in 1992, despite local news reports on its safety.<p>The university continues to expand facilities on the campus. In February 2006, the Board of Regents voted to update and expand the football stadium. On <!--del_lnk--> March 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the student body passed a referendum to build a new Student Activities Centre next to Gregory Gym on the east side of campus, pending final approval by the Board of Regents. According to <i>The Daily Texan</i>, the project is estimated to cost $51 million and is set to open between fall 2010 and fall 2012. Funding will primarily come from students, raising tuition by a maximum of $65 per semester.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The university receives income from an endowment known as the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent University Fund (PUF), with $11.6 billion (<!--del_lnk--> fourth-largest in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>) in assets as of November 2005, of which 30 percent is dedicated to the university. Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of this fund. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas&#39;s two university systems, The University of Texas System and <!--del_lnk--> the Texas A&amp;M University System; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities&#39; annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University&#39;s total endowment value.<p><a id="Student_life" name="Student_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Student life</span></h2>

      <p>The campus is currently home to thirteen dormitories, with a fourteenth under construction and slated for opening in spring 2007. On-campus housing can hold more than 6,700 students. <!--del_lnk--> Jester Centre is the largest dormitory with its capacity of 2,945. Academic enrollment exceeds the capacity of on-campus housing; as a result, most students must live in private dormitories, <!--del_lnk--> housing cooperatives, apartments, or with <!--del_lnk--> Greek organizations and other off-campus residences. The Division of Housing and Food Service, which already has the largest market share of the estimated 27,000 beds in the campus area, plans to expand to 9,000 beds in the near future.<p><a id="Student_organizations" name="Student_organizations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Student organizations</span></h3>
      <p>The university recognizes more than 1,000 student organizations. In addition, the University supports three official student governance organizations that represent student interests to faculty, administrators, and the Texas Legislature. <!--del_lnk--> Student Government represents student interests in general, the <!--del_lnk--> Senate of College Councils represents students in academic affairs and coordinates the college councils, and the <!--del_lnk--> Graduate Student Assembly represents graduate student interests.<p><a id="Greek_organizations" name="Greek_organizations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Greek organizations</span></h3>
      <p>The Office of the Dean of Students&#39; Greek Life and Education section administers more than 50 Greek organizations, and about 9% of men and 12% of women in the undergraduate class choose to join one of these groups. Other registered student organizations also name themselves with Greek letters, including the founding chapters of <!--del_lnk--> Beta Upsilon Chi, a national Christian fraternity, and <!--del_lnk--> Sigma Phi Lambda, a national Christian sorority.<p><a id="School_spirit" name="School_spirit"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">School spirit</span></h3>

      <p>The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as &quot;America&#39;s Best Sports College&quot; in a 2002 analysis performed by <i><!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated.</i><p><a id="Varsity_sports" name="Varsity_sports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Varsity sports</span></h3>
      <p>The university&#39;s men&#39;s and women&#39;s athletics teams are nicknamed the Longhorns. A charter member of the <!--del_lnk--> Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996, Texas now competes in the <!--del_lnk--> Big 12 Conference (South Division) of the <!--del_lnk--> NCAA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Division I-A.<p>The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a <!--del_lnk--> college football powerhouse. The team experienced its greatest success under coach <!--del_lnk--> Darrell Royal, winning three National Championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970, and winning a fourth title under head coach <!--del_lnk--> Mack Brown in 2005 after the 41-38 defeat of previously undefeated (and top-ranked) <!--del_lnk--> USC in the <!--del_lnk--> Rose Bowl.<p>In recent years, the men&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> basketball team has gained prominence, advancing to the <!--del_lnk--> NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004 and the <!--del_lnk--> Elite Eight in 2006.<p>The university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> baseball team is considered one of the best in the nation with more trips to the <!--del_lnk--> College World Series than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1970, 1983, 2002 and 2005.<p><a id="Rivalries" name="Rivalries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rivalries</span></h3>
      <p>The university&#39;s major rival in almost every sport is generally considered to be <!--del_lnk--> Texas A&amp;M University. The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the <!--del_lnk--> State Farm <!--del_lnk--> Lone Star Showdown series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. The game used to be played on Thanksgiving day but in recent years has been played on the day following <!--del_lnk--> Thanksgiving.<p>Many fans and observers, however, argue that the Longhorns&#39; biggest rival in football is the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oklahoma. The football game between Texas and Oklahoma is known as the <a href="../../wp/a/AT%2526T.htm" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a> <!--del_lnk--> Red River Rivalry and is held annually in <a href="../../wp/d/Dallas%252C_Texas.htm" title="Dallas, Texas">Dallas, Texas</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> Cotton Bowl. This longstanding rivalry pits the populations of Texas and Oklahoma against one another in a bitter competition over state pride and bragging rights. In recent years, this rivalry has been particularly spirited, in part due to the fact that at least one school had been ranked in the top 5 nationally at the time of the game.<p>Many other schools also consider Texas among their biggest rivals. <p><a id="Facilities" name="Facilities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Facilities</span></h3>
