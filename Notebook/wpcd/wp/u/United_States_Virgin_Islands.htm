      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Islands were originally settled by the <!--del_lnk--> Ciboney, <!--del_lnk--> Carib, and <!--del_lnk--> Arawaks. The islands were named by <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> on his second voyage in <!--del_lnk--> 1493 for <!--del_lnk--> Saint Ursula and her virgin followers. Over the next three hundred years, the islands were held by many <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> powers, including <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Britain, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Knights of Malta, and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Danish West India Company settled on <!--del_lnk--> Saint Thomas in <!--del_lnk--> 1672, on <!--del_lnk--> Saint John in <!--del_lnk--> 1694, and purchased <!--del_lnk--> Saint Croix from <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1733. The islands became royal Danish colonies in <!--del_lnk--> 1754, their name in Danish translating as <i>Jomfru&oslash;erne</i>. <a href="../../wp/s/Sugarcane.htm" title="Sugarcane">Sugarcane</a>, produced by <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> labor, drove the islands&#39; <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economy</a> during the 18th and early 19th centuries, until the <!--del_lnk--> abolition of slavery by Governor <!--del_lnk--> Peter von Scholten on <!--del_lnk--> July 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1848.<p>For the remainder of the Danish time, the islands were not economically viable and significant transfers were made from the Danish state budgets to the authorities in the islands. An attempt to sell the islands to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> was made early in the 20th century, but a deal proved elusive. A number of reforms in the hope of reviving the islands&#39; economy were attempted, but none having great success. The onset of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> brought the reforms to a close, and again left the islands isolated and exposed.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> submarine warfare phases of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, fearing that the islands might be seized by <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> as a submarine base, once again approached <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> to sell the islands to the United States. After a few months of negotiations a selling sum of $25 million was agreed. The Danish <!--del_lnk--> Crown may have felt some pressure to accept the sale, thinking that the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> would seize the islands if Denmark was invaded by Germany. However, at the same time the economics of continued possession weighed heavily on the minds of Danish decision makers, and a bipartisan consensus in favour of selling emerged in the Danish parliament. A subsequent referendum held in late <!--del_lnk--> 1916 confirmed the decision to sell by a wide margin. The deal was thus ratified and finalized on <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1917, when the United States and Denmark exchanged their respective treaty ratifications. The U.S. took <!--del_lnk--> possession of the islands on <!--del_lnk--> March 31, 1917, when the territory was renamed the U.S. Virgin Islands.<p>U.S. <a href="../../wp/c/Citizenship.htm" title="Citizenship">citizenship</a> was granted to the inhabitants of the islands in <!--del_lnk--> 1927.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

The territory consists of four main islands: <!--del_lnk--> Saint Thomas, <!--del_lnk--> Saint John, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Croix, and <!--del_lnk--> Water Island, as well as several dozen smaller islands. The combined land area of the islands is roughly twice the size of <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a><p>The U.S. Virgin Islands are known for their white sand <!--del_lnk--> beaches, including <!--del_lnk--> Magens Bay and <!--del_lnk--> Trunk Bay, and strategic harbors, including <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte Amalie and <!--del_lnk--> Christiansted. Most of the islands, including Saint Thomas, are volcanic in origin and hilly. The highest point is <!--del_lnk--> Crown Mountain, Saint Thomas (474m). Saint Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, lies to the south and has a flatter terrain. The <!--del_lnk--> National Park Service owns more than half of Saint John, nearly all of <!--del_lnk--> Hassel Island, and many acres of <!--del_lnk--> coral reef.

      <p>The U.S. Virgin Islands are an organized, unincorporated <!--del_lnk--> territory of the United States. Even though they are U.S. citizens, Virgin Islanders cannot vote in <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Presidential elections.<p>The main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the <!--del_lnk--> Independent Citizens Movement (ICM), and the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates run as independents.<p>At the national level, the U.S. Virgin Islands elects a <!--del_lnk--> delegate to Congress from its at large <!--del_lnk--> congressional district. However, the elected delegate while able to vote in committee cannot participate in floor votes.<p>At the territorial level, fifteen <!--del_lnk--> senators&mdash;seven from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large who must be a resident of Saint John&mdash;are elected for two-year terms to the <!--del_lnk--> unicameral <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Islands Legislature.<p>The U.S. Virgin Islands has elected a <!--del_lnk--> territorial governor every four years since <!--del_lnk--> 1970. Previous governors were appointed by the President of the United States.<p>The U.S. Virgin Islands has both a District Court and a Superior Court. Judges are appointed by the President and the governor respectively.<p>The United States Congress has organized several local referenda to aid in the islands&#39; self-determination. As with <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, the residents have been given the choice of independence, status quo, or statehood; however, these measures have failed to attract sufficient civic interest or voter turn-out to produce even a noteworthy plurality, much less a majority, and thus the islands will retain their current territorial status for the foreseeable future. It is theorized that Puerto Rican requests for political self-determination might serve as a catalyst for political interest in the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as in other American territories.<p>With much controversy, these efforts by the federal government to normalize the unincorporated territory&#39;s status are completely discounted by the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Committee on Decolonization, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are currently in the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p><a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">Tourism</a> is the primary economic activity. The islands normally host 2 million visitors a year, many of whom visit on <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships. The manufacturing sector consists of petroleum refining, textile, electronics, <!--del_lnk--> rum distilling, pharmaceutical, and watch assembly plants. The agricultural sector is small, with most food being imported. International business and financial services are a small but growing component of the economy. <!--del_lnk--> Hovensa, one of the world&#39;s largest <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> <a href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Oil refinery">refineries</a>, is located on <!--del_lnk--> Saint Croix.<p>The islands are subject to tropical storms and <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">hurricanes</a>. In recent history, substantial damage was caused by <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Hugo in <!--del_lnk--> 1989 and <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Marilyn in <!--del_lnk--> 1995.
