      <p>A <b>university</b> is an institution of <!--del_lnk--> higher education and <!--del_lnk--> research, which grants <!--del_lnk--> academic degrees at all levels (<!--del_lnk--> bachelor, <!--del_lnk--> master, and <!--del_lnk--> doctorate) in a variety of subjects.

      <p>Relative to the above definition, there is controversy as to which university is the world&#39;s oldest. The original Latin word &quot;universitas&quot;, first used in time of renewed interest in Classical <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> tradition, tried to reflect this feature of the <!--del_lnk--> Academy of Plato. If we consider university simply as a higher education institution, then it could be <!--del_lnk--> Shang Hsiang, founded before the 21<sup>st</sup> century BC in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> according to <!--del_lnk--> legend. Later <!--del_lnk--> Taixue and <!--del_lnk--> Guozijian serve as the highest level of educational etablishment while <!--del_lnk--> academies became very popular as non-governmental etablishments teaching <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese literature among other things. The choice for the oldest university is usually among <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda, <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople, <!--del_lnk--> Al Karaouine or <!--del_lnk--> Al-Azhar universities. <!--del_lnk--> Nalanda University, founded in <!--del_lnk--> Bihar, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> around the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BC conferred academic degree titles to its graduates, while also offering <!--del_lnk--> post-graduate courses. Another Indian university whose ruins were only recently excavated was Ratnagiri University in <!--del_lnk--> Orissa. Al-Azhar University, founded in <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> in the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a>, offered a variety of post-graduate degrees, and is often regarded as the first full-fledged university. The <!--del_lnk--> University of Constantinople, founded in 849, by the regent Bardas of emperor Michail III, is generally considered the first institution of higher learning with the characteristics we associate today with a university (research and teaching, auto-administration, academic independence, et cetera). The <!--del_lnk--> Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the <!--del_lnk--> University of Al Karaouine in <!--del_lnk--> Fez, Morocco as the oldest university in the world with its founding in <!--del_lnk--> 859.<p><a id="Medieval_European_universities" name="Medieval_European_universities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval European universities</span></h3>

      <p>The first European medieval university was the <!--del_lnk--> University of Magnaura in <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople (now <a href="../../wp/i/Istanbul.htm" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>), founded in 849 by the regent <!--del_lnk--> Bardas of emperor <!--del_lnk--> Michael III, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> University of Preslav and <!--del_lnk--> University of Ohrid (9th century) in the <!--del_lnk--> Bulgarian Empire, founded by <!--del_lnk--> Tsar Simeon I of Bulgaria, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Salerno (9th century), <!--del_lnk--> University of Bologna (1088) in <a href="../../wp/b/Bologna.htm" title="Bologna">Bologna</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Paris (c. 1100) in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, France, later associated with the Sorbonne, and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oxford (11th century) in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Many of the medieval universities in Western Europe were born under the aegis of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, usually as cathedral schools or by <!--del_lnk--> papal bull as <!--del_lnk--> Studia Generali (NB: The development of cathedral schools into Universities actually appears to be quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception - see Leff, <i>Paris and Oxford Universities</i>). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries.<p>In Europe, young men proceeded to university when they had completed their study of the <!--del_lnk--> trivium&ndash;the preparatory arts of <!--del_lnk--> grammar, <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric, and <!--del_lnk--> dialectic or <a href="../../wp/l/Logic.htm" title="Logic">logic</a>&ndash;and the <!--del_lnk--> quadrivium: <a href="../../wp/a/Arithmetic.htm" title="Arithmetic">arithmetic</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, and <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>. (See <!--del_lnk--> Degrees of the University of Oxford for the history of how the trivium and quadrivium developed in relation to degrees, especially in <!--del_lnk--> anglophone universities).<p><a id="Emergence_of_modern_universities" name="Emergence_of_modern_universities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Emergence of modern universities</span></h3>

      <p>The end of the medieval period marked the beginning of the transformation of universities that would eventually result in the modern research university. Many external influences, such as eras of <!--del_lnk--> humanism, <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, and revolution, shaped research universities during their development, and the discovery of the <!--del_lnk--> New World in 1492 added <a href="../../wp/h/Human_rights.htm" title="Human rights">human rights</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/International_law.htm" title="International law">international law</a> to the university <!--del_lnk--> curriculum.<p>By the 18th century, universities published their own <!--del_lnk--> research journals, and by the 19th century, the German and the French university models had arisen. The German, or Humboldtian model, was conceived by <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm von Humboldt and based on <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Schleiermacher&rsquo;s liberal ideas pertaining to the importance of <!--del_lnk--> freedom, <!--del_lnk--> seminars, and <!--del_lnk--> laboratories in universities. The French university model involved strict discipline and control over every aspect of the university.<p>Universities concentrated on science in the 19th and 20th centuries, and they started to become accessible to the masses after 1914. Until the 19th century, <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> played a significant role in university curriculum; however, the role of religion in research universities decreased in the 19th century, and by the end of the 19th century, the German university model had spread around the world. The British also established universities worldwide, and <!--del_lnk--> higher education became available to the masses not only in Europe. In a general sense, the basic structure and aims of universities have remained constant over the years.<p><a id="Organization" name="Organization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Organization</span></h2>

      <p>Although each institution is differently organized, nearly all universities have a board of trustees, a president, <!--del_lnk--> chancellor or <!--del_lnk--> rector, at least one vice president, vice-chancellor or vice-rector, and deans of various divisions. Universities are generally divided into a number of academic departments, schools or <!--del_lnk--> faculties. <!--del_lnk--> Public university systems are ruled over by government-run higher education boards. They review financial requests and budget proposals and then allocate funds for each university in the system. They also approve new programs of instruction and cancel or make changes in existing programs. In addition, they plan for the further coordinated growth and development of the various institutions of higher education in the state or country. However, many public universities in the world have a considerable degree of financial, research and pedagogical autonomy. <!--del_lnk--> Private universities are privately funded having generally a broader independence from state policies.<p>Despite the variable policies, or cultural and economic standards available in different geographical locations create a tremendous disparity between universities around the world and even inside a country, the universities are usually among the foremost research and advanced training providers in every society. Most universities not only offer courses in subjects ranging from the natural sciences, engineering, architecture or medicine, to sports administration, social sciences, law or humanities, they also offer many amenities to their student population including a variety of places to eat, banks, bookshops, print shops, job centres, and bars. In addition, most major universities have their own <a href="../../wp/l/Library.htm" title="Library">libraries</a>, sports centers, restaurants, <!--del_lnk--> students&#39; unions, <!--del_lnk--> botanical gardens, <!--del_lnk--> astronomical observatories, <!--del_lnk--> university hospitals and clinics, <!--del_lnk--> computer labs, <!--del_lnk--> research laboratories, <!--del_lnk--> business incubators and many other.<p><a id="Universities_around_the_world" name="Universities_around_the_world"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Universities around the world</span></h2>

      <p>The funding and organization of universities is very different in different countries around the world. In some countries universities are predominantly funded by the state, while in others funding may come from donors or from fees which students attending the university must pay. In some countries the vast majority of students attend university in their local town, while in other countries universities attract students from all over the world, and may provide university accommodation for their students.<p><a id="Universities_and_student_life_in_different_countries" name="Universities_and_student_life_in_different_countries"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Universities and student life in different countries</span></h3>

      <p>In the United States, there is no legal definition of the term &quot;university.&quot; The usual practice in the United States today is to call an institution made up of <!--del_lnk--> undergraduate students a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> college.&quot; This can be a two-year <!--del_lnk--> community college, which grants an <!--del_lnk--> AA or a four-year college, such as a <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts college, which grants a <!--del_lnk--> B.A.. An institution which is comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students (and often of several schools) is called a university. Some schools such as <!--del_lnk--> Boston College, <!--del_lnk--> Dartmouth College, and <!--del_lnk--> College of William and Mary, which offer a number of graduate programs, have retained the term &quot;college&quot; in their names for historical reasons. Similarly, some institutions granting few if any graduate degrees may be called universities for historical reasons. Another criterion used to distinguish between a college and a university in the United States is the balance of teaching and research that occurs in the institution. Colleges have historically focused on teaching and universities on scholarship and research.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Carnegie Basic Classification system distinguishes among institutions on the basis of the prevalence of degrees they grant. Formerly designated by <!--del_lnk--> Roman numerals, their current and past classification system uses the following names to designate institutions of higher education: <!--del_lnk--> Research I universities, Doctorate-granting Universities, Master&rsquo;s Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associate&rsquo;s Colleges, Special Focus Institutions, and Tribal Colleges, with subdivisions in some of the categories. As the category names indicate, the Carnegie Foundation considers the granting of <!--del_lnk--> master&#39;s degrees a prerequisite for an institution being classified as a university.<p><a id="Admissions" name="Admissions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Admissions</span></h2>
      <p>Admission systems and university structures vary widely around the world (see <!--del_lnk--> college admissions).

      <p>Colloquially, the term <b>university</b> may be used to describe a phase in one&#39;s life: &quot;when I was at university&hellip;&quot; (in the United States and the Republic of Ireland, <b>college</b> is used instead: &quot;when I was in college...&quot;). See the <!--del_lnk--> college article for further discussion. In Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the <!--del_lnk--> German speaking countries &quot;university&quot; is often contracted to &quot;uni&quot;.

Sometimes national or racial limitations exist - for students, staff, research.<p><a id="Nazi_universities" name="Nazi_universities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nazi universities</span></h3>
      <p>Books from university libraries, written by anti-Nazi or Jewish authors, were burned in places (<!--del_lnk--> eg. in Berlin) in <!--del_lnk--> 1933, and the curricula were subsequently modified. Jewish professors and students were expelled according to the <!--del_lnk--> racial policy of Nazi Germany, see also the <!--del_lnk--> Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. <!--del_lnk--> Martin Heidegger became the rector of <!--del_lnk--> Freiburg University, where he delivered a number of Nazi speeches. On August 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1933 Heidegger established the F&uuml;hrer-principle at the university, later he was appointed F&uuml;hrer of Freiburg University. <!--del_lnk--> University of Pozna&#x144; was closed by the Nazi Occupation in <!--del_lnk--> 1939. <!--del_lnk--> 1941-<!--del_lnk--> 1944 a German university worked there. <!--del_lnk--> University of Strasbourg was transferred to <!--del_lnk--> Clermont-Ferrand and Reichsuniversit&auml;t Stra&szlig;burg existed 1941-1944.<p>Nazi universities ended in <!--del_lnk--> 1945.<p><a id="Soviet_universities" name="Soviet_universities"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Soviet universities</span></h3>
      <p>Soviet type universities existed in <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and in other countries of the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Bloc. Medical, technical, economical, technological and artistical faculties were separated from universities (compare the <!--del_lnk--> List of institutions of higher learning in Russia). Soviet ideology was taught divided into three disciplines: <!--del_lnk--> Scientific Communism, <!--del_lnk--> Marxism-Leninism (mostly in form of <!--del_lnk--> Leninism) and Communist <i>Political Economy</i>) and was introduced as part of many courses, eg. teaching <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>&#39; or <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>&#39;s views on energy or history. Communist parties controlled or influenced universities. The leading university was the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow State University. After <a href="../../wp/j/Joseph_Stalin.htm" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>&#39;s death, universities in some Communist countries obtained more freedom. <!--del_lnk--> Patrice Lumumba Peoples&#39; Friendship University provided higher education as well as a <!--del_lnk--> KGB training ground for young communists from <!--del_lnk--> developing countries.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Related terms</span></h2>
