      <p><!--del_lnk--> Great Britain and <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> is the latest of several unions formed over the last 300 years. The <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Scotland and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England had existed as separate states with their own <!--del_lnk--> monarchs and political structures since the 9th century. The once independent <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Principality of Wales</a> fell under the control of English monarchs from the <!--del_lnk--> Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, becoming itself part of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England by the <a href="../../wp/l/Laws_in_Wales_Acts_1535%25E2%2580%25931542.htm" title="Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542">Laws in Wales Act 1535</a>.  With the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union 1707, the independent states of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and Scotland, having been in <!--del_lnk--> personal union since 1603, agreed to a political union as the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain. <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union 1800 united the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Ireland, which had been gradually brought under English control between 1541 and <!--del_lnk--> 1691, to form the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  Independence for the now <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in 1922 followed the <!--del_lnk--> partition of the island of Ireland two years previously, with six of the nine <!--del_lnk--> counties of the <!--del_lnk--> province of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster remaining within the <span class="abbr">UK</span>, which then <!--del_lnk--> changed to the current name in 1927. <p>The dominant industrial and maritime power of the 19th century, the United Kingdom is often credited with being the nation that &quot;created the modern world&quot;,  by playing a leading role in developing <!--del_lnk--> Western ideas of property, <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary democracy</a> as well as making significant contributions to literature, the arts, and science and technology. At its zenith, the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> stretched over one-quarter of the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s surface and encompassed a third of its population, making it the largest empire in history. The first half of the 20th century, however, saw the Empire&#39;s strength seriously depleted from the effects of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

Plans are to hold a <!--del_lnk--> referendum on the issue if and when <!--del_lnk--> five economic tests indicate that entry into the <!--del_lnk--> Eurozone would be beneficial. <p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>
      <p>The United Kingdom is a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>, with <!--del_lnk--> executive power exercised on behalf of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">monarch</a> by the <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">prime minister</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> cabinet ministers who head <!--del_lnk--> departments. The cabinet, including the prime minister, and other <!--del_lnk--> ministers collectively make up <!--del_lnk--> Her Majesty&#39;s Government. These ministers are drawn from and are responsible to <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a>, the legislative body, which is traditionally considered to be &quot;supreme&quot; (that is, able to legislate on any matter and not bound by decisions of its predecessors). The United Kingdom is one of the few countries in the world today that does not have a codified <!--del_lnk--> constitution, relying instead on traditional <!--del_lnk--> customs and separate pieces of <!--del_lnk--> constitutional law.<p>While the monarch is <!--del_lnk--> head of state and technically holds all executive power, it is the prime minister who is the <!--del_lnk--> head of government. The government is answerable chiefly to the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, from which constitutional convention requires that the prime minister be drawn. The majority of cabinet members are from the House of Commons, the rest from the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>. Ministers do not, however, legally have to come from Parliament, though that is the modern day custom. The British system of government has been emulated around the world &mdash; a legacy of the British Empire&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> colonial past &mdash; most notably in the other <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth Realms. The <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament (MP) who commands a majority in the House of Commons is normally appointed prime minister - usually the leader of the largest party or, if there is no majority party, the largest coalition. The current prime minister is <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party, who has been in office since 1997.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the United Kingdom, the monarch has extensive theoretical powers, but his/her role is mainly, though not exclusively, ceremonial . The monarch is an integral part of Parliament (as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Crown-in-Parliament&quot;) and theoretically gives Parliament the power to meet and create legislation. An <!--del_lnk--> Act of Parliament does not become law until it has been signed by the monarch (known as <!--del_lnk--> Royal Assent), although not one has refused assent to a bill that has been approved by Parliament since <a href="../../wp/a/Anne_of_Great_Britain.htm" title="Anne of Great Britain">Queen Anne</a> in 1708 . Although the abolition of the monarchy has been suggested, the popularity of the monarchy remains strong in the United Kingdom. Support for a <!--del_lnk--> British republic usually fluctuates between 15% and 25% of the population, with roughly 10% undecided or indifferent.  The current monarch is <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">HM Queen Elizabeth II</a> who acceded to the throne in 1952 and was crowned in 1953.<p><a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament</a> is the national legislature of the United Kingdom. It is the ultimate legislative authority in the United Kingdom, according to the doctrine of <!--del_lnk--> parliamentary sovereignty (however, questions over sovereignty have been brought forward because of the <span class="abbr">UK</span>&#39;s entry in to the European Union ). It is <!--del_lnk--> bicameral, composed of the elected <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> and the unelected <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, whose members are mostly appointed. The House of Commons is the more powerful of the two houses. The House of Commons houses 646 members who are directly elected from single-member constituencies based on population. The House of Lords has around 700 members (though the number is not fixed), constituted of <!--del_lnk--> life peers, <!--del_lnk--> hereditary peers, and bishops of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. (Note: The <!--del_lnk--> House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic inheritance of seats in the Lords and permitted just 92 hereditary peers to remain.

      <p>Since the 1920s, the two largest political parties in British politics have been the <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party and <!--del_lnk--> Conservative Party. Though coalition and minority governments have been an occasional feature of <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentary politics, the <!--del_lnk--> first-past-the-post electoral system used for <!--del_lnk--> general elections tends to maintain the dominance of these two parties, though each has in the past century relied upon a third party to deliver a working majority in Parliament . The <!--del_lnk--> Liberal Democrats are the third largest party in the British parliament and actively seek a reform of the electoral system to address the dominance of the two-party system .<p>Though many in the United Kingdom consider themselves &#39;British&#39; as well as &#39;English&#39;, &#39;Scottish&#39; &#39;Welsh&#39;, or &#39;Irish&#39; (and increasingly also &#39;Afro-Caribbean&#39;, &#39;Indian&#39;, or &#39;Pakistani&#39;), there has long been a widespread sense of separate national identities in the nations of Scotland and Wales and amongst the Catholic and Protestant community in Northern Ireland . Independence for the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in 1922 provided only a partial solution to what had been termed in the 19th Century the &#39;Irish Question&#39;, and competing demands for a <!--del_lnk--> united Ireland or continued union with Great Britain have brought civil strife and political instability up to the present day.<p>Though &#39;nationalist&#39; (as opposed to &#39;unionist&#39;) tendencies have shifted over time in Scotland and Wales, with the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish National Party founded in 1934 and <!--del_lnk--> Plaid Cymru (the Party of Wales) in 1925, a serious political crisis threatening the integrity of the United Kingdom as a state has not occurred since the 1970s. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each possess a legislature and government alongside that of the United Kingdom. However, this increased <!--del_lnk--> autonomy and <!--del_lnk--> devolution of executive and legislative powers has not contributed to a reduction in support for independence from the United Kingdom, with the rise of new pro-independence parties. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Green Party and the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Socialist Party have gained popularity in recent years but have not significantly dented the parliamentary dominance on the three main parties.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Tendencies to devolution with the wider United Kingdom have had only little resonance in England. There is currently little appetite for a <!--del_lnk--> devolved English parliament, although senior Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have voiced concerns in regard to the <!--del_lnk--> West Lothian Question , which is raised where certain policies for England are set by MPs from all four constituent nations whereas similar policies for Scotland or Wales might be decided in the devolved assemblies by legislators from those countries alone. Alternative proposals for English <!--del_lnk--> regional government have stalled, following a poorly received referendum on devolved government for the <!--del_lnk--> North East of England, which had hitherto been considered the region most in favour of the idea. England is therefore governed according to the balance of parties across the whole of the United Kingdom.<p>The resurgence in <!--del_lnk--> Celtic language and identity, as well as &#39;regional&#39; politics and development, has contributed to forces pulling against the unity of the state . However, there is at present little sign of any imminent &#39;crisis&#39; (at the <!--del_lnk--> last General Election, both the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish National Party and <!--del_lnk--> Plaid Cymru saw their percentage of the overall vote drop, though the SNP did gain two more seats and are the second largest party in the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament as well as official opposition). Nevertheless many in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> would like <!--del_lnk--> independence  although most English do not. In Northern Ireland, there has been a significant decrease in violence over the last twenty years, though the situation remains tense, with the more hardline parties, such as <!--del_lnk--> Sinn F&eacute;in and the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Unionists, now holding the most parliamentary seats (see <!--del_lnk--> Demographics and politics of Northern Ireland).<p><a id="Law" name="Law"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law</span></h2>

      <p><a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> has a temperate climate, with plentiful rainfall all year round, though the seasons are quite variable in temperature. However, temperatures rarely fall below &minus;5&nbsp;&deg;C (23&nbsp;&deg;F) or rise above 32&nbsp;&deg;C (90&nbsp;&deg;F). The prevailing wind is from the southwest, bringing mild and wet weather to England regularly, from the Atlantic Ocean. It is driest in the east and warmest in the southeast, which is closest to the European mainland. Snowfall can occur in Winter and early Spring, though it is not that common away from high ground.<p>The highest temperature recorded in England is 38.5&nbsp;&deg;C (101.3&nbsp;&deg;F) on <!--del_lnk--> 10 August <!--del_lnk--> 2003 at Brogdale, near Faversham, Kent. . The lowest temperature ever recorded in England is &minus;26.1&nbsp;&deg;C (&minus;15.0&nbsp;&deg;F) on <!--del_lnk--> 10 January <!--del_lnk--> 1982 at Edgmond, near Newport, Shropshire. <p><a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>&#39; climate is much like that of England with the highest maximum temperature recorded at 35.2&nbsp;&deg;C (95.4&nbsp;&deg;F) in Hawarden Bridge, Flintshire on <!--del_lnk--> 2 August <!--del_lnk--> 1990, and the lowest minimum temperature at -23.3&nbsp;&deg;C (-10&nbsp;&deg;F) in Rhayader, Radnorshire on <!--del_lnk--> 21 January <!--del_lnk--> 1940. <p>The climate of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> is temperate and oceanic, and tends to be very changeable. It is warmed by the Gulf Stream from the Atlantic, and as such is much warmer than areas on similar latitudes, for example Oslo, Norway. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the <span class="abbr">UK</span>, with the coldest ever <span class="abbr">UK</span> temperature of -27.2&deg;C (-17.0&nbsp;&deg;F) recorded at Braemar in the Grampian Mountains, on <!--del_lnk--> 11 February <!--del_lnk--> 1895 and <!--del_lnk--> 10 January <!--del_lnk--> 1982 and also at Altnaharra, Highland, on <!--del_lnk--> 30 December <!--del_lnk--> 1995. Winter maximums average 6&nbsp;&deg;C (42.8&nbsp;&deg;F) in the lowlands, with summer maximums averaging 18&nbsp;&deg;C (64.4&nbsp;&deg;F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9&nbsp;&deg;C (91.2&nbsp;&deg;F) at Greycrook, Scottish Borders on <!--del_lnk--> 9 August <!--del_lnk--> 2003.<p>Generally, western Scotland is warmer than the east because of the influence of the Atlantic ocean currents and the colder surface temperatures of the North Sea. <!--del_lnk--> Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, is the sunniest place in Scotland: it had 300 days with sunshine in 1975. Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest place, with annual rainfall exceeding 120 <!--del_lnk--> inches (3,000&nbsp;mm). In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 31 inches (800&nbsp;mm) annually. Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar experiences an average of 59 snow days per year, while coastal areas have an average of less than 10 days.<p>The whole of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> has a temperate maritime climate, rather wetter in the west than the east, although cloud cover is persistent across the region. The weather is unpredictable at all times of the year, and although the seasons are distinct, they are considerably less pronounced than in interior Europe or the eastern seaboard of North America. Average daytime maximums in Belfast are 6.5&nbsp;&deg;C (43.7&nbsp;&deg;F) in January and 17.5&nbsp;&deg;C (63.5&nbsp;&deg;F) in July. The damp climate and extensive deforestation in the 16th and 17th centuries resulted in much of the region being covered in rich green grassland.

      <p>At the April <!--del_lnk--> 2001 <span class="abbr">UK</span> Census, the United Kingdom&#39;s population was 58,789,194, the third-largest in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> (behind <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>) and the twenty-first largest in the world. This had been estimated up to 59,834,300  by the <!--del_lnk--> Office for National Statistics in 2004. Two years later it had increased to 60.2 million, largely from net immigration, but also because of a rising birth rate and increasing life expectancy. <p>Its overall population density is one of the highest in the world. About a quarter of the population lives in England&#39;s prosperous south-east  and is predominantly urban and suburban, with an estimated 7,517,700 in the capital of London.  The United Kingdom&#39;s high literacy rate (99%)  is attributable to universal public education introduced for the primary level in 1870 and secondary level in 1900 (except in Scotland where it was introduced in 1696, see <!--del_lnk--> Education in Scotland). Education is mandatory from ages five to sixteen.<p><a id="Immigration" name="Immigration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Immigration</span></h3>
      <p>Located as they are on a group of islands close to <!--del_lnk--> Continental Europe, the lands now constituting the United Kingdom have been subject to many invasions and migrations, especially from Scandinavia and the continent, including Roman occupation for several centuries. Present day Britons are descended mainly from the varied ethnic stocks that settled there before the eleventh century. The pre-Celtic, Celtic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norse influences were blended on Great Britain under the Normans, Scandinavian Vikings who had lived in Northern France. Between the various constituent countries, there has been sufficient internal migration to mix the population.<p>Immigration has come through interaction with continental <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and international ties forged by the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. Constant waves of immigration hit the <span class="abbr">UK</span>, with Europe, Africa and South-East Asia being the biggest areas from where people emigrate. As of <!--del_lnk--> 2001, 7.9% of the <span class="abbr">UK</span>&#39;s population identified themselves as an &#39;<!--del_lnk--> ethnic minority&#39;. The United Kingdom has amongst the highest immigration rates in Europe, along with <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>  it is now believed that the percentage of &#39;<!--del_lnk--> ethnic minorities&#39; is some 9% of the total <span class="abbr">UK</span> population. In some <span class="abbr">UK</span> cities the percentage of &#39;<!--del_lnk--> minority groups&#39; is large but is still less than half, for example; Birmingham (<span class="abbr">UK</span>&#39;s 2nd largest city) has 29.6% , Leicester 36% . The latest figures (for 2005) show net imigration to the <span class="abbr">UK</span> of 185,000, down from a record high of 223,000 in 2004.<p>The latest wave of immigration to hit the <span class="abbr">UK</span> began in May 2004 when the European Union was expanded. From May 2004 to September 2006, around 500,000 people from <!--del_lnk--> Central and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe immigrated to the <span class="abbr">UK</span> to work. This figure is for arrivals only and does not take account of people leaving, hence <!--del_lnk--> net migration is likely to be lower. In 2005 net migration from the new EU states stood at 64,000.<p>In addition, there are a large number of Indians, mainly from northern India, who make up about 2.0% of the population.<p><a id="Language" name="Language"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Language</span></h3>

      <p>Whilst the <span class="abbr">UK</span> does not have an official language, the predominant <!--del_lnk--> tongue is <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>. This is a West Germanic language, descended from <!--del_lnk--> Old English, which features a large number of borrowings from <!--del_lnk--> Norman French. The other main indigenous languages are the <!--del_lnk--> Insular Celtic languages, i.e. the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic languages of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. These fall into two groups: the P-Celtic languages (<!--del_lnk--> Welsh and the <!--del_lnk--> Cornish language); and the Q-Celtic languages (<!--del_lnk--> Irish and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic).<p>The English language has spread to all corners of the world (primarily because of the British Empire) and is referred to as a &quot;global language&quot;. Worldwide, it is taught <!--del_lnk--> as a second language more than any other.  The United Kingdom&#39;s Celtic languages are also spoken by small groups around the globe, mainly <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic in Nova Scotia, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and Welsh in <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia, <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>.<p>Additional indigenous languages are <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> (which is closely related to English); <!--del_lnk--> Romany ; and <!--del_lnk--> British Sign Language (<!--del_lnk--> Northern Ireland Sign Language is also used in Northern Ireland). Celtic dialectal influences from <!--del_lnk--> Cumbric persisted in Northern England for many centuries, most famously in a unique set of numbers used for counting sheep.<p>Recent immigrants, especially from the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth, speak many other languages, including <!--del_lnk--> Gujarati, <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi, <!--del_lnk--> Urdu, <!--del_lnk--> Bengali, <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese, <!--del_lnk--> Turkish and <!--del_lnk--> Polish.

      <p>Unlike many countries today, which are officially <!--del_lnk--> secular, the UK is an officially Christian country. This is reflected throughout British public life, for instance, there are established state churches in England and Scotland and the Head of State is a Christian monarch crowned by an Arch-bishop in a church. British society is said to belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Judaeo-Christian tradition.<p>A majority of Britons, 72%, identify themselves as Christian. Christianity was first introduced to Britain by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Romans</a>.<p>Despite this, a relatively small proportion of the population attends public worship on a weekly basis. The United Kingdom has one of the lowest levels of public worship attendance in the world, with less than 8% of people attending any form of worship on a regular basis (of whom the majority are of middle-aged and older generations). <p>Each home nation has its own church hierarchy.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> is the officially established <!--del_lnk--> Christian church in England, and acts as the &#39;mother&#39; and senior branch of the worldwide Anglican Communion. Originally established as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Church in 597AD by <!--del_lnk--> Augustine of Canterbury on behalf of <!--del_lnk--> Pope Gregory I, the Church split from <!--del_lnk--> Rome in <!--del_lnk--> 1534 during the reign of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII of England</a>. The Church of England is a state church, and some of her bishops sit in the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> British monarch is required to be a member of the Church of England under the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Settlement 1701 and is the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Governor. <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics are expressly forbidden from becoming monarch, stemming from conflict over the crown and whether Britain was in the past, Catholic or <!--del_lnk--> Protestant.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland (known informally as The Kirk) is the national church of Scotland. It is a <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian church and is not subject to state control. The British monarch is an ordinary member, although the monarch is required to swear an oath to &quot;defend the security&quot; of the Church at their coronation. Splits in the Church since the <!--del_lnk--> reformation have led to the creation of various other Presbyterian churches in Scotland including the <!--del_lnk--> Free Church of Scotland and the <!--del_lnk--> Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland.<p>The Church of England was established in Wales until the 1920s, when the <!--del_lnk--> Church in Wales was separated from the Church of England and disestablished. The Church in Wales remains in the <a href="../../wp/a/Anglican_Communion.htm" title="Anglican Communion">Anglican Communion</a>. The <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> was disestablished in the 19th century.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic Church is the second largest denomination of Christianity in the <span class="abbr">UK</span>. After the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, strict laws were passed against Catholics; these were removed by the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Emancipation laws in the 1850s. The Catholic hierarchy is separate in England and Wales, Scotland.<p>In Northern Ireland the <!--del_lnk--> Catholic Church in Ireland is the largest single denomination. The <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian Church in Ireland is the largest Protestant denomination and is in terms of theology and history very closely linked to the Church of Scotland.

The biggest groups of British Muslims are of <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistani</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladeshi</a> origin.

      <p>The British economy is the home of the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon model, focusing on the principles of liberalisation, the <!--del_lnk--> free market, &#39;common law&#39; relating to property, and low taxation and regulation. Based on <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a> <!--del_lnk--> exchange rates, the United Kingdom is the fifth largest economy in the world; , the second largest in Europe after <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, and the sixth-largest overall by <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates.<p>The British were the first in the world to enter the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, and, like most industrialising countries at the time, initially concentrated on heavy industries such as <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding, <!--del_lnk--> coal mining, <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> production, and <!--del_lnk--> textiles. The empire created an overseas market for British products, allowing the United Kingdom to dominate international trade in the 19th century. However, as other nations industrialised and surplus labour from agriculture began to dry up, the United Kingdom started to lose its economic advantage. As a result, heavy industry declined throughout the 20th century. The British service sector, however, has grown substantially, and now makes up about 73% of GDP. <p>The service sector of the United Kingdom is dominated by <!--del_lnk--> financial services, especially in banking and insurance. London is one of the world&#39;s largest financial centres with the <!--del_lnk--> London Stock Exchange, the <!--del_lnk--> London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, and the <!--del_lnk--> Lloyd&#39;s of London insurance market all based in the city. It also has the largest concentration of foreign bank branches in the world. In the past decade, a rival financial centre in London has grown in the <!--del_lnk--> Docklands area, with <a href="../../wp/h/HSBC.htm" title="HSBC">HSBC</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Citigroup, and <!--del_lnk--> Barclays Bank all relocating their head offices there. The Scottish capital, <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> also has one of the large financial centres of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> .<p><!--del_lnk--> Tourism is very important to the British economy. With over 27 million tourists a year, the United Kingdom is <!--del_lnk--> ranked as the sixth major tourist destination in the world. <p>The British manufacturing sector, however, has greatly diminished since World War II. It is still a significant part of the economy, but only accounted for one-sixth of national output in 2003.. The <!--del_lnk--> British motor industry is a significant part of this sector, although all large-volume producers are now foreign-owned. Civil and defence aircraft production is led by the United Kingdom&#39;s largest aerospace firm, <a href="../../wp/b/BAE_Systems.htm" title="BAE Systems">BAE Systems</a>, and the pan-European consortium known as <a href="../../wp/a/Airbus.htm" title="Airbus">Airbus</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Rolls-Royce holds a major share of the global aerospace engines market. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry is also strong in the <span class="abbr">UK</span>, with the world&#39;s second and third largest pharmaceutical firms (<a href="../../wp/g/GlaxoSmithKline.htm" title="GlaxoSmithKline">GlaxoSmithKline</a> and <!--del_lnk--> AstraZeneca, respectively) being based in the <span class="abbr">UK</span>. <p>The United Kingdom&#39;s agriculture sector is small by European standards, accounting for only 0.9% of GDP.  The <span class="abbr">UK</span> though has large coal, <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a>, and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">oil</a> reserves. Primary energy production accounts for about 10% of <!--del_lnk--> Gross domestic product (GDP),  one of the highest shares of any industrial state.<p>The currency of the <span class="abbr">UK</span> is <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">pound sterling</a>, represented by the symbol &pound;. The <!--del_lnk--> Bank of England is the central bank and is responsible for issuing currency, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland retain the right to issue their own notes, subject to retaining enough Bank of England notes in reserve to cover the issue. The <span class="abbr">UK</span> chose not to join the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">Euro</a> on the currency&#39;s launch, although the government has pledged to hold a public referendum for deciding membership if &quot;five economic tests&quot; are met.  Currently <span class="abbr">UK</span> public opinion is against the notion. <p>Government involvement over the economy is exercised by the <!--del_lnk--> Chancellor of the Exchequer (currently <a href="../../wp/g/Gordon_Brown.htm" title="Gordon Brown">Gordon Brown</a>) who heads <!--del_lnk--> HM Treasury, but the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister (currently <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>), is <!--del_lnk--> First Lord of the Treasury (the <!--del_lnk--> Chancellor of the Exchequer being the Second Lord of the Treasury). However since 1997, the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of England, headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor of the Bank of England, has control of interest rates and other monetary policy. The UK government has greatly increased <!--del_lnk--> public sector spending (i.e.: government spending of taxes) since 1995, and annual spending on investment in infrastructure has grown from &pound;5.6bn in 1997 to &pound;29bn in 2006.<p><a id="Administrative_subdivisions" name="Administrative_subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative subdivisions</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> armed forces of the United Kingdom are known as the <b>British Armed Forces</b> or <b>Her Majesty&#39;s Armed Forces</b>, but officially <b>Armed Forces of the Crown</b>. Their <!--del_lnk--> Commander-in-Chief is the <!--del_lnk--> British monarch, <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">HM The Queen</a> and they are managed by the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of Defence. The armed forces are controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Defence Council currently headed by <!--del_lnk--> Air Chief Marshal <!--del_lnk--> Sir Jock Stirrup.<p>The United Kingdom fields one of the most powerful and comprehensive armed forces in the world. Its global <!--del_lnk--> power projection capabilities are deemed second only to the <!--del_lnk--> United States military, and its navy is the world&#39;s second strongest.  Further, the Royal Navy&#39;s total naval tonnage is second only to the <!--del_lnk--> United States military and the third largest share of tactical combat aircraft to the <!--del_lnk--> US and <!--del_lnk--> France. The <span class="abbr">UK</span> has the fifth highest <!--del_lnk--> military expenditure in the world.<p>The United Kingdom possesses a comprehensive nuclear arsenal, one of the <!--del_lnk--> small number of countries to do so, utilising the submarine-based <!--del_lnk--> Trident II ballistic missile system with nuclear warheads. These <!--del_lnk--> Vanguard class submarines were designed and built by <!--del_lnk--> VSEL (now <!--del_lnk--> BAE Systems Submarines) at <!--del_lnk--> Barrow-in-Furness.<p>The strength of British armed forces and their role overseas, has led some to call the era a <!--del_lnk--> British Moment, where the nation has a unique and growing role in world affairs.<p>The British Armed Forces are charged with protecting the United Kingdom and its overseas territories, promoting the United Kingdom&#39;s wider security interests, and supporting international peacekeeping efforts. They are active and regular participants in the <!--del_lnk--> North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and other coalition operations.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> British Army had a reported strength of 102,440 in 2005  and the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> a strength of 49,210. The 36,320-member <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> operates the United Kingdom&#39;s nuclear deterrent, which consists of four <!--del_lnk--> Trident missile-armed submarines, while the <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Marines.htm" title="Royal Marines">Royal Marines</a> are the Royal Navy&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Light Infantry units for <!--del_lnk--> amphibious operations and for specialist reinforcement forces in and beyond the <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> area. This puts total active duty military personnel in the 190,000 range, currently deployed in over 80 countries.<p>There are also reserve forces supporting the regular military. These include an army reserve, the <!--del_lnk--> Territorial Army (TA); the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR), <!--del_lnk--> Royal Marines Reserve (RMR) and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF). About 9% of the regular armed forces is made up of women, a figure that is higher for the reserve forces.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom Special Forces, principally the <!--del_lnk--> Special Air Service (SAS) and <!--del_lnk--> Special Boat Service (SBS), but including others, provide troops trained for quick, mobile, military responses in <!--del_lnk--> counter-terrorism, land, maritime and <!--del_lnk--> amphibious operations, often where secrecy or covert operations are required. The Royal Navy is the second largest navy in the western world in terms of gross tonnage. Despite the United Kingdom&#39;s wide-ranging capabilities, recent pragmatic defence policy has a stated assumption that &quot;the most demanding operations&quot; would be undertaken as part of a coalition.  <!--del_lnk--> Bosnia, <!--del_lnk--> Kosovo, <!--del_lnk--> United States invasion of Afghanistan, <!--del_lnk--> Iraq (<!--del_lnk--> <i>Granby</i>, <!--del_lnk--> no-fly zones, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Desert Fox</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Telic</i>) may all be taken as precedent; indeed the last war in which the British military fought alone was the <!--del_lnk--> Falklands War of 1982, with full-scale combat operations lasting almost three months.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>The countries that make up the United Kingdom have provided some of the world&#39;s most notable and popular authors, poets and literary figures. The English playwright and poet <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> is arguably the most famous writer in the English language.<p>Many world-famous writers and poets lived and wrote in the United Kingdom. England is particularly well represented in the history of the <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">novel</a>. Early English writers who could be described as novelists include <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Malory and <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth. These romantic writers were followed by a wave of more realistic writers in later centuries, including <a href="../../wp/j/Jane_Austen.htm" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a> (often credited with inventing the modern novel), <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Bront&euml; sisters, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad, <!--del_lnk--> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and <!--del_lnk--> H. G. Wells. In the 20th century, <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Woolf, <!--del_lnk--> D. H. Lawrence, <a href="../../wp/j/J._R._R._Tolkien.htm" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, <!--del_lnk--> George Orwell, <!--del_lnk--> Graham Greene and <!--del_lnk--> Ian McEwan all excelled. Tolkien became one of the most popular writers of the modern world, returning to a <!--del_lnk--> Romantic view of fiction. Childrens&#39; author <a href="../../wp/j/J._K._Rowling.htm" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has had huge recent success.<p>Wales and Scotland have also contributed many fine writers to the UK&#39;s stock of great literature, particularly in poetry. In the early medieval period, Welsh writers composed the famous <!--del_lnk--> Mabinogion. In modern times, the poets <!--del_lnk--> R.S. Thomas and <!--del_lnk--> Dylan Thomas bring Welsh culture and ideas to a world audience. In Romantic literature, Scotland offers <!--del_lnk--> Sir Walter Scott and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s epic adventures and the leading poet of his day, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns. Modern Scottish writers like <!--del_lnk--> Hugh MacDiarmid and <!--del_lnk--> Neil M. Gunn helped develop a distinct modernist and nationalist Scottish voice, sometimes termed the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Renaissance. A more grim outlook is found in <!--del_lnk--> Ian Rankin&#39;s detective stories set in Edinburgh.<p>Many authors from other nationalities, particularly the Irish, and from <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth countries, have also lived and worked in the UK. Significant examples through the centuries include <!--del_lnk--> Jonathon Swift, <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Wilde, <!--del_lnk--> Bram Stoker, <!--del_lnk--> George Bernard Shaw, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad and <!--del_lnk--> Salman Rushdie. <!--del_lnk--> Kazuo Ishiguro offers another viewpoint, that of a Japanese author working in the United Kingdom and writing on British themes such as social class.<p>The history of the theatre in the United Kingdom is particularly vivid. Shakespeare&#39;s contemporaries <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Marlowe and <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a> add depth to the early theatre. More recently <!--del_lnk--> Alan Ayckbourn, <!--del_lnk--> Harold Pinter, <!--del_lnk--> Michael Frayn, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Stoppard and <!--del_lnk--> David Edgar have combined elements of surrealism, realism and radicalism.<p>Important poets include <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Milton.htm" title="John Milton">John Milton</a>, <!--del_lnk--> William Blake, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns, <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Byron, <!--del_lnk--> John Keats, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Tennyson, <a href="../../wp/t/T._S._Eliot.htm" title="T.

Also British pop producers <!--del_lnk--> Stock Aitken Waterman - dominated the charts in the late-80&#39;s and early-90&#39;s with their instantly recognisable brand of pop from acts including today&#39;s pop superstar, <a href="../../wp/k/Kylie_Minogue.htm" title="Kylie Minogue">Kylie Minogue</a>.
