      <p><b>The University of Chicago</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> private university located principally in the <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park neighbourhood of <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Founded in 1890 by oil magnate <!--del_lnk--> John D. Rockefeller, the University of Chicago held its first classes on <!--del_lnk--> October 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1892. Chicago was one of the first universities in the country to be conceived as a combination of the American interdisciplinary <!--del_lnk--> liberal arts college and the German <!--del_lnk--> research university.<p>The University of Chicago is widely recognized as one of the world&#39;s foremost universities. The university is affiliated with 79 <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize laureates. Particularly notable are the university&#39;s 27 <!--del_lnk--> laureates in physics and 23 <!--del_lnk--> laureates in economics. Historically, the university is noted for its unique undergraduate <!--del_lnk--> core curriculum as well as other educational innovations pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Maynard Hutchins in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s (including the <!--del_lnk--> academic quarter system), and for influential academic movements such as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Economics&quot;, the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Sociology,&quot; the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Literary Criticism,&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> law and economics movement in legal analysis. The University of Chicago was the site of the world&#39;s first self-sustained <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reaction. It is also home to the largest <!--del_lnk--> university press in the country.<p>

      </div>
      <p>The University of Chicago is principally located seven miles south of <!--del_lnk--> downtown Chicago, in the neighborhoods of <!--del_lnk--> Hyde Park and <!--del_lnk--> Woodlawn. The University of Chicago&#39;s campus is bisected by Frederick Law Olmsted&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Midway Plaisance, a large linear park created for the <!--del_lnk--> 1893 World&#39;s Fair. The bulk of the campus, including the Main Quadrangle, is located north of the Midway, while several of the professional schools are located south of the Midway. The university&#39;s campus is noted for its <!--del_lnk--> neo-Gothic architecture, which was constructed entirely out of <!--del_lnk--> limestone in the late 19th century, and is complemented by the Main Quandrangles&#39; status as a <!--del_lnk--> botanical garden. The buildings of the original quadrangles were deliberately patterned after the layouts of <!--del_lnk--> Oxford University and <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>. Mitchell Tower, for example, is a smaller-sized reproduction of Oxford&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Magdalen Tower, and the University Commons, <!--del_lnk--> Hutchinson Hall, is a duplicate of Oxford&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Christ Church Hall.<p>Contemporary buildings have attempted to complement the style of the original architecture, with varying degrees of success. One of the most striking modern additions is the <!--del_lnk--> Regenstein Library, designed by architect <!--del_lnk--> Walter Netsch and constructed on the grounds of the former <!--del_lnk--> Stagg Field, the site of the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s first nuclear reaction. The campus is also home to <!--del_lnk--> Rockefeller Chapel, designed by <!--del_lnk--> Bertram Goodhue, and the <!--del_lnk--> Robie House, designed by <a href="../../wp/f/Frank_Lloyd_Wright.htm" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>.<p>A recent two billion dollar campaign has brought unprecedented expansion to the university, including: the unveiling of the Max Palevsky Residential Commons, the <!--del_lnk--> Gerald Ratner Athletics Centre, a new hospital, and a new science building. The Jules and Gwen Knapp Center for Biomedical Discovery, a ten-story medical research centre, as well as further additions to the medical campus are currently under construction.. The university plans to direct the next stage of its campaign towards revamping and consolidating dormitories, some of which are far from campus and aging poorly. Plans are underway for the construction of a new dormitory on land south of the Midway Plaisance.<p>The university also maintains several facilities apart from its main campus. The university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Graduate School of Business maintains campuses in <a href="../../wp/s/Singapore.htm" title="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and in the Chicago Loop, while the Paris Centre, a campus located on the <!--del_lnk--> left bank of the <!--del_lnk--> River Seine in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs.<p>Moreover, the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Yerkes Observatory, in <!--del_lnk--> Williams Bay, Wisconsin constructed in 1897, is home to the <!--del_lnk--> largest refracting telescope ever built. Although Yerkes was never able to match the observation conditions afforded by the mountaintop location of its main competitor, the <!--del_lnk--> Lick Observatory, Yerkes was a leader in astrophysics. It was at Yerkes that the spiral structure the <!--del_lnk--> Milky Way Galaxy was first demonstrated, and carbon first discovered in <!--del_lnk--> stellar spectra.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The campus is furthermore home to the <!--del_lnk--> Oriental Institute, an internationally renowned <!--del_lnk--> archeology <!--del_lnk--> museum and research centre for ancient <!--del_lnk--> Near Eastern studies. The Institute is housed in an unusual <!--del_lnk--> Gothic and <!--del_lnk--> Art Deco building designed by the architectural firm <!--del_lnk--> Mayers Murray &amp; Phillip.

      <p>The University of Chicago was founded by oil magnate <!--del_lnk--> John D. Rockefeller, who later called it &quot;the best investment I ever made.&quot; The University&#39;s founding was part of a wave of university foundings that followed the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Incorporated in 1890, the University has dated its founding as <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1891, when <!--del_lnk--> William Rainey Harper became its first president. The first classes were held on <!--del_lnk--> October 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1892, with an enrollment of 594 students and a faculty of 120, including eight former college presidents.<p>Westward migration, population growth, and industrialization led to an increasing need for elite schools away from the East Coast, especially schools whose focus would be on issues vital to national development. Though Rockefeller was urged to build in New England or the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, he ultimately chose Chicago. His choice reflected his strong desire to realize <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>&#39;s dream of a natural <!--del_lnk--> meritocracy&#39;s rise to prominence, determined by talent rather than familial heritage. Rockefeller&#39;s early fiscal emphasis on the physics department showed his pragmatic, yet deeply intellectual, desires for the school.<p>Though founded under <!--del_lnk--> Baptist auspices, Chicago has never had a sectarian affiliation. The school&#39;s traditions of rigorous scholarship were established primarily by Presidents <!--del_lnk--> William Rainey Harper and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Maynard Hutchins. Chicago opened its door to women and minorities from the very beginning, at a time when their access to other leading universities was extremely rare. It was the first major university to enroll women on an equal basis with men  , as well as the first major, predominantly white university to offer a black professor a tenured post circa <!--del_lnk--> 1947. <p>Unlike many other American universities at the time (with the notable exception of <!--del_lnk--> Johns Hopkins), the University of Chicago was set up around a number of graduate research institutions, following <!--del_lnk--> Germanic precedent. The <!--del_lnk--> college itself remained quite small compared to its <!--del_lnk--> East Coast peers until around the middle of the 20th century.<p>As a result, the graduate population of the university, to this day, dwarfs the undergraduate population 2:1, while the university&#39;s undergraduate student body remains the third smallest amongst the top 10 national universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is also one of the lowest amongst national universities, at 4:1, and all faculty members are required to teach undergraduate courses.<p>During his presidency, Robert Maynard Hutchins met with the president of rival <!--del_lnk--> Northwestern University to discuss the future of the two institutions through the <!--del_lnk--> Depression and the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">looming war</a>. Hutchins concluded that, in order to secure the future of both universities, it was in the best interest of both for the two campuses to merge as the Universities of Chicago, with Northwestern&#39;s campus serving as the site for undergraduate education, and the Hyde Park campus serving as the graduate studies campus. President Hutchins&#39; vision for what he hoped would become the preeminent university in the world was eventually quashed by Northwestern University&#39;s board of trustees, a result that Hutchins called &quot;one of the lost opportunities of American education.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>As part of the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project, University of Chicago chemists, led by <!--del_lnk--> Glenn T. Seaborg, began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element, <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> George Herbert Jones Laboratory was the site where, for the first time, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured in September 1942. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element&#39;s atomic weight. Room 405 of the building was named a <!--del_lnk--> National Historic Landmark in May 1967.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s first self-sustained nuclear reaction was achieved at <!--del_lnk--> Stagg Field on the campus of the university under the direction of professor <!--del_lnk--> Enrico Fermi. A sculpture by <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_Moore.htm" title="Henry Moore">Henry Moore</a> marks the location where the nuclear reaction took place (now deemed a <!--del_lnk--> National Historic Landmark). Stagg Field has since been demolished to make way for the <!--del_lnk--> Regenstein Library.<p>In addition to its groundbreaking work involving <!--del_lnk--> nuclear energy, the University of Chicago is also recognized for numerous other significant discoveries, including:<ul>
       <li>The technique of <!--del_lnk--> carbon-14 dating, developed in 1949 by <!--del_lnk--> Willard Frank Libby and his team during his tenure as a professor at the university. Libby was awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960 for this discovery.<li>The discovery of the atmosphere&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> jet stream.<li>The discovery of <!--del_lnk--> REM sleep.<li>The procedure for the nation&#39;s first living-donor <!--del_lnk--> liver transplant.<li>The famous <!--del_lnk--> Miller-Urey experiment, considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life.<li>The development of <!--del_lnk--> agent orange, a highly-toxic <!--del_lnk--> herbicide that would gain notoriety for its use during the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>.</ul>
      <p>In 1955, the University of Chicago became the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> improvisational comedy with the formation of the undergraduate comedy troupe, the <!--del_lnk--> Compass Players.<p>In 1978, <!--del_lnk--> Hanna Holborn Gray, then the provost of <!--del_lnk--> Yale University, became President of the university, the first woman ever to serve as the president of a major research university.<p>In 1999, then-President <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university&#39;s famed <!--del_lnk--> core curriculum, including reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When <i><!--del_lnk--> The New York Times</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Economist</i>, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The National Association of Scholars, for example, released a statement saying, &quot;<i>It is truly depressing to observe a steady abandonment of the University of Chicago&#39;s once imposing undergraduate core curriculum, which for so long stood as the benchmark of content and rigor among American academic institutions.</i>&quot; The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy led to Sonnenschein&#39;s resignation in 2000.<p>In 2006, the University of Chicago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Oriental Institute became the centre of controversy when <!--del_lnk--> U.S. federal courts <!--del_lnk--> ruled to seize and auction its valuable collection of ancient <!--del_lnk--> Persian artifacts, the proceeds of which would go to compensate the victims of a <!--del_lnk--> 1997 bombing in Jerusalem that the United States claim was funded by <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. The ruling threatens the university&#39;s invaluable collection of ancient <!--del_lnk--> clay tablets held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s but officially owned by Iran.<p><a id="Academics" name="Academics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Academics</span></h2>

      <p>The University of Chicago&#39;s <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economics</a> department is particularly well-known. In fact, an entire school of thought (the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Economics) bears its name. Led by <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize laureates such as <!--del_lnk--> Milton Friedman, <!--del_lnk--> Ronald Coase, <!--del_lnk--> George Stigler, <!--del_lnk--> Gary Becker, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Lucas, <!--del_lnk--> James Heckman, and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fogel, the university&#39;s economics department has played an important role in shaping ideas about the <!--del_lnk--> free market. The <!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Economics is also famous for applying economic principles to every aspect of human life, as famously demonstrated by <!--del_lnk--> Steven Levitt in his best-selling book, <i><!--del_lnk--> Freakonomics</i>.<p>The university is also known for creating the first <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociology</a> department in the United States, which later gave birth to the <!--del_lnk--> Chicago School of Sociology. Scholars affiliated with this school are considered pioneers in the field and include <!--del_lnk--> Albion Small, <!--del_lnk--> George Herbert Mead, <!--del_lnk--> Robert E. Park, <!--del_lnk--> W. I. Thomas, and <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Burgess.<p>The university is home to several committees for interdisciplinary scholarship, the most famous of which is the <!--del_lnk--> Committee on Social Thought. One of several Ph.D-granting committees at the university, it was started in 1941 by University of Chicago president <!--del_lnk--> Robert Maynard Hutchins along with historian John U. Nef, economist <!--del_lnk--> Frank Knight, and anthropologist <!--del_lnk--> Robert Redfield. The committee is interdisciplinary, but it is not centered on any specific topic. Since its inception, the committee has drawn together noted academics and writers to &quot;foster awareness of the permanent questions at the origin of all learned inquiry&quot;. Members of this program have included <!--del_lnk--> Hannah Arendt, <a href="../../wp/t/T._S._Eliot.htm" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S.

      <p>The University of Chicago currently maintains twelve units: <!--del_lnk--> the College, four divisions of graduate research, six professional schools, and the Graham School of General Studies. The University of Chicago also operates the Library, the Press, the Lab Schools, and the Hospitals.<p>Faculty and students at the adjacent <!--del_lnk--> Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago also collaborate closely with the university. Although formally unrelated, the <!--del_lnk--> National Opinion Research Centre is also located on the campus, with many faculty members and graduate students holding research appointments at NORC.<p>The university also operates the <!--del_lnk--> University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (from <!--del_lnk--> day care through <!--del_lnk--> high school, founded by <!--del_lnk--> John Dewey and considered one of the leading <!--del_lnk--> preparatory schools in the United States), the Hyde Park Day Schools (for the learning disabled of otherwise exceptional ability), and the Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioural and emotional problems). The university also administers two unaffiliated public <!--del_lnk--> charter schools on the South Side of Chicago.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Chicago Press is the largest <!--del_lnk--> university press in the country. It publishes a wide array of scholarly and academic texts, including the influential <i><!--del_lnk--> Chicago Manual of Style</i>, as well as several academic journals (including <i><!--del_lnk--> Critical Inquiry</i>).<p>The University of Chicago&#39;s library system is also one of the largest in the country. The university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Regenstein Library is committed to providing physical, &quot;browsable&quot; access to print books in a single location, rather than relying on offsite storage as many libraries do. A planned expansion will raise its collection from 6.5 million volumes to 8 million volumes, surpassing the <!--del_lnk--> University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (currently the largest with 7.5 million volumes onsite) and making the Regenstein the largest such university library in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. In 2005, funding was approved for the construction of a 38,000-square-foot addition to the library in order to accommodate the collection&#39;s expansion. It is scheduled to be completed by winter of 2009. The &quot;Reg&quot;, as it is commonly called by students, is noted for its exceptional breadth and depth of material. Within its 2007 rankings, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Princeton Review</i> ranked it among the top three college libraries in the country.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> John Crerar Library is recognized as one of the best libraries in the country for research and teaching in the sciences, medicine, and technology. Completing the science quadrangle is the Kersten Physics Teaching Centre, which is recognized as the most advanced facility in the U.S. for the teaching of undergraduate physics. Students in the College have access to all of the university&rsquo;s special libraries, including the D&rsquo;Angelo Law Library, Yerkes Observatory Library for astronomy and astrophysics, the Social Service Administration Library, and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science.<p>Chicago also operates a number of off-campus scientific research institutions, including the <!--del_lnk--> Argonne National Laboratory, part of the <!--del_lnk--> United States Department of Energy&#39;s national laboratory system. The university also owns and operates the <!--del_lnk--> Oriental Institute and has a stake in the <!--del_lnk--> Apache Point Observatory in <!--del_lnk--> Sunspot, <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico. It is also a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> Committee on Institutional Cooperation.<p>In February 2006, the University of Chicago announced its bid for a <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Department of Energy contract to obtain complete management rights to the <!--del_lnk--> Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, which maintains the <!--del_lnk--> Tevatron, the world&#39;s highest-energy particle accelerator. Fermilab is currently one of the world&#39;s primary scientific research centers in the fields of <!--del_lnk--> elementary particle physics and <!--del_lnk--> astrophysics.<p><a id="Undergraduate_college" name="Undergraduate_college"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Undergraduate college</span></h3>

      <p>The centerpiece of the University of Chicago is the undergraduate college, known as the <!--del_lnk--> College of the University of Chicago. The majority of undergraduate courses are small, discussion-based <!--del_lnk--> seminars, and undergraduate students routinely take their upper-level courses alongside graduate students.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The College of the University of Chicago grants <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor of Arts and <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor of Science degrees in 52 majors and 14 minors in the biological, physical, and social sciences, as well as in the humanities and interdisciplinary areas. A major may provide a comprehensive understanding of a well-defined field, such as anthropology or mathematics, or it may be an interdisciplinary program such as African and African-American studies, environmental studies, biological chemistry, or cinema and media studies. A full list of offered majors and minors is available within the college&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> main article.<p>Undergraduate students must undergo a rigorous <!--del_lnk--> core curriculum, the goal of which is to impart an education that is both timeless and a vehicle for interdisciplinary debate. Students must take courses designed to foster critical skills in a broad range of academic disciplines, including history, literature, science, mathematics, writing, and critical reasoning. Core curriculum classes at Chicago are capped at 25 students and are generally led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a <!--del_lnk--> teaching assistant). Currently, 15 courses are required in addition to tested foreign language proficiency if no Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate examinations are used for exemption (a reduction of six quarters may be achieved via this method). While the science curriculum has largely followed the intellectual evolution of its respective fields, the requisite humanities and social science sequences now have several variants that encompass non-Western, non-canonical, and critical theory texts. While in totality the core curriculum&rsquo;s goal is to impart an education that is both timeless and a vehicle for interdisciplinary debate, the increasing number of options to students within its confines produces a wide variety of backgrounds amongst graduates.<p>First-year students are assigned to one of 37 houses through the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> house system. House sizes range from 25 to 100 members but typically consist of no more than 70 students. Each house is staffed with at least one upperclassman who acts as a Resident Assistant(RA). Each house is also assigned a Resident Head (RH) family, typically upper level graduate students or staff at the university, who provide additional support. The house system serves as the focal point of university life, with each house offering amenities such as kitchens, common areas, and study rooms. A significant portion of the undergraduate student body, however, lives off-campus, and relocation amongst the houses is not uncommon.<p><a id="Rankings_and_reputation" name="Rankings_and_reputation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rankings and reputation</span></h2>

Furthermore, in the annual rankings by the <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times Higher Education Supplement</i>, based on a subjective peer review by scholars, Chicago placed 11th internationally <!--del_lnk--> . Finally, in its 2006 evaluation of universities on the dual basis of distinction in research and international diversity, <i><!--del_lnk--> Newsweek</i> ranked the University of Chicago 20th in the world. <p>The University of Chicago was ranked 9th (tied with <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University and <!--del_lnk--> Dartmouth College) among undergraduate programs at national universities, according to the 2007 rankings list produced by <i><!--del_lnk--> U.S. News and World Report</i>. The university was also ranked 6th in a peer assessment by academic deans. In its 2007 rankings, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Princeton Review</i> rated the university 1st for having the &quot;Best Overall Academic Experience For Undergraduates&quot; among all American colleges and universities.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Graduate School of Business, the <!--del_lnk--> Law School, the <!--del_lnk--> School of Social Service Administration, and the <!--del_lnk--> Divinity School are amongst the leading institutions in their fields internationally, while the <!--del_lnk--> Pritzker School of Medicine and the <!--del_lnk--> Harris School of Public Policy Studies perform strongly at the national level.<p>The university also operates the <!--del_lnk--> University of Chicago Hospitals, which was ranked the fourteenth best hospital in the country by <i><!--del_lnk--> U.S. News and World Report</i>.

      <p>Chicago&#39;s sports teams are called the <b><!--del_lnk--> Maroons</b>, and their colors are <!--del_lnk--> maroon and <!--del_lnk--> white. They participate in the <!--del_lnk--> NCAA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Division III as members of the <!--del_lnk--> University Athletic Association (UAA). At one point, the University of Chicago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> football teams (nicknamed the <i>Monsters of the Midway</i> at the time) were among the best in the country, winning seven <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten Conference titles from 1899 to 1924, including a national championship in 1905 while playing at the old <!--del_lnk--> Stagg Field. The University is also one of only a few schools to be undefeated in football against <!--del_lnk--> Notre Dame. In 1935, Chicago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jay Berwanger was the winner of the first-ever <!--del_lnk--> Heisman Trophy. The following year, Berwanger also became the first player to be drafted by the <!--del_lnk--> National Football League.<p>However, the university, (a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> Big Ten Conference), de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 when it dropped football and withdrew from the league in 1946. It would reinstate football as a Division III team in 1969, continuing to play its home games at the new Stagg Field. The Maroon football team has won the University Athletic Association championship in 1998, 2000 and 2005. The University maintains an affiliation with the Big Ten schools through the <!--del_lnk--> Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a consortium of twelve <!--del_lnk--> Midwestern research universities.<p>The school&#39;s mascot is the <b><!--del_lnk--> Phoenix</b>, chosen in honour of the city of Chicago&#39;s rebirth after the <!--del_lnk--> Great Chicago Fire, and also in honour of the previous University of Chicago, which dissolved due to financial reasons (making the current University of Chicago the second university to carry the name). The <!--del_lnk--> gargoyle has become an unofficial mascot of the university, owing to the ubiquitous statues of gargoyles that adorn many of the buildings on campus.<p><a id="Student_life" name="Student_life"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Student life</span></h2>

      <p>The annual <!--del_lnk--> University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt is a multi-day event in which large teams compete to obtain all of the notoriously esoteric items on a list. Held every May since 1987, it is considered to be the largest <!--del_lnk--> scavenger hunt in the world. Established by student Chris Straus, the &quot;Scav Hunt&quot;, as it is known among University students, has become one of the university&#39;s most popular traditions and has typically pushed the boundaries of absurdity.<p>Each year, the scavenger hunt list includes roughly 300 items, each with an assigned point value. The items vary widely and may involve performances, large-scale constructions, and long-distance travel in addition to traditional listings. Teams are generally expected to fall well short of completing half of the list and instead compete for total points amassed. The more difficult and time-consuming items earn more points. Notable past items include: a <!--del_lnk--> passport stamped by all members of the <!--del_lnk--> axis of evil, a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactor, a <a href="../../wp/c/Calvin_and_Hobbes.htm" title="Calvinball">Calvinball</a> tournament, a <!--del_lnk--> ninja muffin and a <!--del_lnk--> cell phone <!--del_lnk--> marching band.
