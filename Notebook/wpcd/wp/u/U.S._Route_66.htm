      <p><b>U.S. Route 66</b>, (also known as <b>Route 66</b>, <b>The Main Street of America</b>, <b>The Mother Road</b> and the <b>Will Rogers Highway</b>) was a highway in the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway system. One of the original federal routes, US 66 was established on November 11th, <!--del_lnk--> 1926, though signs did not go up until the following year. It originally ran from <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Illinois through <!--del_lnk--> Missouri, <!--del_lnk--> Kansas, <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma, <!--del_lnk--> Texas, <!--del_lnk--> New Mexico, <!--del_lnk--> Arizona and <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> before ending at <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> for a total of 2,448 miles (3,939 km).<p>Route 66 underwent many improvements and realignments. Most of those affected the total mileage somewhat. One of those resulted in the movement of the endpoint from <a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica. Contrary to common belief, Route 66 never ran to the ocean; it terminated onto what was then US-101, at the intersection of what is today <!--del_lnk--> Ocean Boulevard and <!--del_lnk--> Santa Monica Boulevard.<p>Route 66 was a major path of the migrants who went west, especially during the <!--del_lnk--> Dust Bowl of the 1930s, and supported the economies of the communities through which the road passed. People became prosperous due to the growing popularity of the highway, and those same people later fought to keep the highway alive even with the growing threat of the new <!--del_lnk--> Interstate Highway System.<p>US 66 was officially <!--del_lnk--> decommissioned (that is, officially removed from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> Highway System) on <!--del_lnk--> June 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1985 after it was decided the route was no longer relevant and had been replaced by the Interstate Highway System. Portions of the road that passed through Illinois, New Mexico, and Arizona have been designated a <!--del_lnk--> National Scenic Byway of the name &quot;<b>Historic Route 66</b>&quot;. It has begun to return to maps in this form.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Championed by Oklahoman <!--del_lnk--> Cyrus Avery in 1923 when the first talks about a national highway system began, US 66 was first signed in 1927 as one of the original <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highways, although it was not completely paved until 1938. Avery was adamant that the highway have a round number and had proposed number 60 to identify it. A controversy erupted over the number 60, largely from delegates from <!--del_lnk--> Kentucky which wanted a <!--del_lnk--> Virginia Beach&ndash;Los Angeles highway to be <!--del_lnk--> US 60 and <!--del_lnk--> US 62 between Chicago and <!--del_lnk--> Springfield, Missouri. Arguments and counter-arguments continued and the final conclusion was to have US 60 run between Virginia Beach, Virginia and Springfield, Missouri, and the Chicago&ndash;<a href="../../wp/l/Los_Angeles%252C_California.htm" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a> route be US 62. Avery settled on &quot;66&quot; (which was unassigned) because he thought the double-digit number would be easy to remember as well as pleasant to say and hear.<p>After the new federal highway system was officially created, Avery called for the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Highway 66 Association to promote the complete paving of the highway from end to end and to promote travel down the highway. In 1927, in <!--del_lnk--> Tulsa, Oklahoma, the association was officially established with <!--del_lnk--> John T. Woodruff of Springfield, Missouri elected the first president. In 1928, the association made its first attempt at publicity, the &quot;Bunion Derby&quot;, a footrace from Los Angeles to <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, of which the path from Los Angeles to Chicago would be on Route 66. <!--del_lnk-->  The publicity worked: several dignitaries, including <!--del_lnk--> Will Rogers, greeted the runners at certain points on the route. The association went on to serve as a voice for businesses along the highway until it disbanded in 1976.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Traffic grew on the highway due to the geography through which it passed. Much of the highway was essentially flat and this made the highway a popular <!--del_lnk--> truck route. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s saw many farming families (mainly from Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas) heading west for agricultural jobs in California. Route 66 became the main road of travel for these people, often derogatorily called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Okies&quot;. And during the Depression, it gave some relief to communities located on the highway. The route passed through numerous small towns, and with the growing traffic on the highway, helped create the rise of mom-and-pop businesses (mainly as service stations, restaurants, and motor courts) up and down the highway.<p>Much of the early highway, like all the other early highways, was gravel or graded dirt. Due to the efforts of the US Highway 66 Association, Route 66 became the first highway completely paved in 1938. Several places were dangerous, more than one part of the highway was nicknamed &quot;Bloody 66&quot; and gradually work was done to realign these segments to remove dangerous curves. However, one section (through the <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountains of Arizona) was fraught with sharp hairpin turns and was the steepest along the entire route&mdash;so much so that some early travelers, too frightened at the prospect of driving such a potentially dangerous road, hired locals to navigate the winding grade. The section remained until 1953&mdash;despite this, Route 66 continued to be a popular route.<p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, more migration west occurred because of war-related industries in California. Route 66, already popular and fully paved, became one of the main routes and also served for moving military equipment. <!--del_lnk--> Fort Leonard Wood in <!--del_lnk--> Missouri was located near the highway, which was locally upgraded quickly to a divided highway to help with military traffic.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the 1950s, Route 66 became the main highway for vacationers heading to Los Angeles. The road passed through the <!--del_lnk--> Painted Desert and near the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canyon.htm" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Meteor Crater in Arizona was another popular stop. This sharp rise in tourism in turn gave rise to a burgeoning trade in all manner of roadside attractions including <!--del_lnk--> teepee-shaped motels, <!--del_lnk--> frozen custard stands, <!--del_lnk--> Indian curio shops, and reptile farms. <!--del_lnk--> Meramec Caverns near <!--del_lnk--> St. Louis began advertising on barns, billing itself as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Jesse James hideout&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> Big Texan advertised a free 72 ounce steak dinner to anyone who could eat the whole thing in an hour. It also marked the birth of the fast-food industry: <!--del_lnk--> Red&#39;s Giant Hamburgs in Springfield, Missouri, site of the first <!--del_lnk--> drive-through restaurant, and the first <!--del_lnk--> McDonald&#39;s in <!--del_lnk--> San Bernardino, California. Changes like these to the landscape further cemented 66&#39;s reputation as a near-perfect microcosm of the culture of America, now linked by the automobile.<p><a id="Changes_in_routing" name="Changes_in_routing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Changes in routing</span></h3>
      <p>Four major sections of US 66 underwent major realignments during the 1930s.<p>In 1930, between <!--del_lnk--> Springfield, Illinois and <!--del_lnk--> East St. Louis, Illinois, US 66 was shifted further east to what is now roughly I-55. The original alignment followed the current <!--del_lnk--> Illinois Route 4.<p>From downtown St. Louis to <!--del_lnk--> Gray Summit, Missouri, US 66 originally went down Market Street and Manchester Road (now, largely, <!--del_lnk--> Route 100). In 1932, this route was changed, the original alignment never being viewed as anything more than temporary. The planned route was down Watson Road (now <!--del_lnk--> Route 366), but Watson Road had not yet been completed.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>From west of <!--del_lnk--> El Reno, Oklahoma to <!--del_lnk--> Bridgeport, Oklahoma, US 66 turned north to <!--del_lnk--> Calumet, Oklahoma and then west to <!--del_lnk--> Geary, Oklahoma then southwest across the <!--del_lnk--> South Canadian River over a <!--del_lnk--> suspension toll bridge into <!--del_lnk--> Bridgeport, Oklahoma. In 1933, a straighter cut-off route was completed from west of <!--del_lnk--> El Reno, Oklahoma directly to a point one mile south of <!--del_lnk--> Bridgeport, Oklahoma crossing over a 38-span steel <!--del_lnk--> pony truss bridge over the South Canadian River and bypassing both Calumet and Geary by several miles.<p>From west of <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosa, New Mexico to north of <!--del_lnk--> Los Lunas, New Mexico, the road originally turned north from current I-40 along much of what is now US 84 to near <!--del_lnk--> Las Vegas, followed (roughly) <!--del_lnk--> I-25 through <!--del_lnk--> Santa Fe and <!--del_lnk--> Albuquerque to Los Lunas and then turned northwest along the present State Highway 6 alignment to a point near Laguna. In 1937, a straight-line route was completed from west of Santa Rosa through Moriarty and east-west through Albuquerque and west to Laguna. This newer routing saved travelers as much as four hours of travel through New Mexico.<p>Also, US 66 was rerouted around several larger cities via bypass or beltline routes to permit travelers to avoid city traffic congestion. Some of those cities included Springfield, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri, Springfield, Missouri; <!--del_lnk--> Joplin, Missouri; and <!--del_lnk--> Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.<p><a id="Decline" name="Decline"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Decline</span></h3>

      <p>The beginning of the end for Route 66 came in <!--del_lnk--> 1956 with the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Interstate Highway Act by President <!--del_lnk--> Dwight Eisenhower. As a general fighting in the <!--del_lnk--> European theatre during World War II, Eisenhower was impressed by Germany&#39;s high-speed roadways, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Autobahnen&quot;. Eisenhower envisioned a similar system of roads for the US in which one could conceivably drive at high speed from one end of the country to the other without stopping, as well as making it easier to mobilize troops in the event of a national emergency.<p>During its nearly 60-year existence, Route 66 was under constant change. As highway engineering became more sophisticated, engineers constantly sought more direct routes between cities and towns. Increased traffic led to a number of major and minor realignments of US 66 through the years, particularly in the years immediately following World War II when Illinois began widening US 66 to four lanes through virtually the entire state from Chicago to the <a href="../../wp/m/Mississippi_River.htm" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a> just east of St. Louis, Missouri, and included bypasses around virtually all of the towns. By the early-to-mid 1950s, Missouri also upgraded its sections of US 66 to four lanes complete with bypasses. Most of the newer four-lane 66 paving in both states was upgraded into the interstate highway system in later years.<p>One of the remnants of Route 66 is the highway now known as Veterans Parkway, east and south of <!--del_lnk--> Normal, Illinois, and <!--del_lnk--> Bloomington, Illinois. The two sweeping curves on the southeast and southwest of the cities originally were intended to easily handle traffic at speeds up to 100 miles per hour, as part of an effort to make Illinois 66 an Autobahn equivalent for military transport.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1953, the first major bypassing of US 66 occurred in Oklahoma with the opening of the <!--del_lnk--> Turner Turnpike between Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The new 88-mile toll road paralleled US 66 for its entire length and bypassed each of the towns along 66. The Turner Turnpike was joined in 1957 by the new <!--del_lnk--> Will Rogers Turnpike, which connected Tulsa with the Oklahoma-Missouri border west of Joplin, Missouri, again paralleling US 66 and bypassing the towns in northeastern Oklahoma in addition to the entire state of Kansas. Both Oklahoma turnpikes were soon designated as <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 44, along with the US 66 bypass at Tulsa that connected the city with both turnpikes.<p>In some cases, such as many areas in Illinois, the new Interstate not only paralleled the old Route 66, it actually incorporated much of it. A typical approach was to build one new set of lanes, then move one direction of traffic to it, then rebuild those old lanes as the new lanes for the other direction of traffic, and finally abandon the other old set of lanes or convert them into a <!--del_lnk--> frontage road.<p>The same scenario was used in western Oklahoma when US 66 was initially upgraded to a four-lane highway such as from Sayre through Erick to the Texas border at Texola in 1957 and 1958 where the old paving was retained for westbound traffic and a new parallel lane built for eastbound traffic (Much of this section was entirely bypassed by I-40 in 1975), and on two other sections; from Canute to Elk City in 1959 and Hydro to Weatherford in 1960 - both of which were upgraded with the construction of a new westbound lane in 1966 to bring the highway up to full interstate standards and demoting the old US 66 paving to frontage road status. In the initial process of constructing I-40 across western Oklahoma, the state also included projects to upgrade the through routes in El Reno, Weatherford, Clinton, Canute, Elk City, Sayre, Erick and Texola to four-lane highways not only to provide seamless transitions from the rural sections of I-40 from both ends of town but also to provide easy access to those cities in later years after the I-40 bypasses were completed.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In New Mexico as in most other states, rural sections of I-40 were to be constructed first with bypasses around cities to come later. However, some business and civic leaders in cities along US 66 were completely opposed to bypassing fearing loss of business and tax revenues. In 1963, the New Mexico Legislature enacted legislation that banned the construction of interstate bypasses around cities by local request. This legislation was short-lived, however, due to pressures from Washington and threat of loss of federal highway funds so it was rescinded by 1965. In 1964, Tucumcari and San Jon became the first cities in New Mexico to work out an agreement with state and federal officials in determining the locations of their I-40 bypasses as close to their business areas as possible in order to permit easy access for highway travelers to their localities. Other cities soon fell in line including Santa Rosa, Moriarty, Grants and Gallup although it wasn&#39;t until well into the 1970s that most of those cities would be bypassed by I-40.<p>By the late 1960s, most of the rural sections of US 66 had been replaced by I-40 across New Mexico with the most notable exception being the 40-mile strip from the Texas border at Glenrio west through San Jon to Tucumcari, which was becoming increasingly treacherous due to heavier and heavier traffic on the narrow two-lane highway. During 1968 and 1969, this section of US 66 was often referred to by locals and travelers as &quot;Slaughter Lane&quot; due to numerous injury and fatal accidents on this stretch. Local and area business and civic leaders and news media called upon state and federal highway officials to get I-40 built through the area, however, disputes over proposed highway routing in the vicinity of San Jon held up construction plans for several years as federal officials proposed that I-40 run some five to six miles north of that city while local and state officials insisted on following a proposed route that touched the northern city limits of San Jon. In November of 1969, a truce was reached when federal highway officials agreed to build the I-40 route just outside of the city, therefore providing local businesses dependent on highway traffic easy access to and from the expressway via the north-south highway that crossed old US 66 in San Jon. Interstate 40 was completed from Glenrio to the east side of San Jon in 1976 and extended west to Tucumcari in 1981, including the bypasses around both cities.<p>Originally, highway officials planned for the last section of US 66 to be bypassed by interstates in Texas, but as was the case in many places, lawsuits held up construction of the new interstates. The US Highway 66 Association had become a voice for the people who feared the loss of their businesses. Since the interstates only provided access via ramps at intersections, travelers could not pull directly off a highway into a business. At first, plans were laid out to allow (mainly national chains) to be placed in interstate medians. Such lawsuits effectively prevented this on all but toll roads. Some towns in Missouri threatened to sue the state if the US 66 designation was removed from the road, though lawsuits never materialized. Several businesses were well known to be on US 66, and fear of losing the number resulted in the state of Missouri officially requesting the designation &quot;Interstate 66&quot; for the St. Louis to Oklahoma City section of the route, but it was denied. In 1984, Arizona also saw its final stretch of highway decommissioned with the completion of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 40 through <!--del_lnk--> Williams. Finally, with decertification of the highway by the <!--del_lnk--> American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials the following year, U.S. Route 66 officially ceased to exist.<p>With the decommissioning of US 66, no single interstate route was designated to replace it. <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 55 covered the section from Chicago to St. Louis; Interstate 44 carried the traffic on to Oklahoma City; <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 40 took the largest chunk, replacing 66 to <!--del_lnk--> Barstow, California; <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 15 took over for the route to San Bernardino; and <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 10 carried Route 66&#39;s traffic across the Los Angeles metro area to Santa Monica.<p><a id="After_decertification" name="After_decertification"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">After decertification</span></h3>

      <p>When the highway was decommissioned, sections of the road were disposed of in various ways. Within many cities, the route became a &quot;business loop&quot; for the interstate. Some sections became state roads, local roads, private drives, or were abandoned completely. Although it is no longer possible to drive Route 66 uninterrupted all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles, more than eighty percent of the original route and alternate alignments are still drivable with careful planning. Some stretches are quite well-preserved, including one between Springfield, Missouri and Tulsa.<p>Some states have kept the 66 designation for parts of the highway, albeit as state roads. In Missouri, Routes <!--del_lnk--> 366, <!--del_lnk--> 266, and <!--del_lnk--> 66 are all original sections of the highway. <!--del_lnk--> State Highway 66 in Oklahoma remains as the alternate &quot;free&quot; route near its turnpikes. A long segment in Arizona signed as <!--del_lnk--> State Route 66 links <!--del_lnk--> Seligman to <!--del_lnk--> Kingman. A surface street stretch between <!--del_lnk--> San Bernardino and <!--del_lnk--> La Verne (known as <!--del_lnk--> Foothill Boulevard) to the east of <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles retains its number as <!--del_lnk--> State Route 66. Several county roads and city streets have also retained the &quot;66&quot; name.<p><a id="Revival" name="Revival"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Revival</span></h3>

      <p>In 1990, Route 66 associations were founded separately in both Arizona and Missouri. Other groups in the other Route 66 states soon followed. The same year, the state of Missouri declared Route 66 in that state a &quot;State Historic Route&quot;. The first &quot;Historic Route 66&quot; marker was erected on Kearney Street at Glenstone Avenue in Springfield, Missouri (now replaced, the original sign has been placed at <!--del_lnk--> Route 66 State Park near <!--del_lnk--> Eureka). Other historic markers now line&mdash;at times sporadically&mdash;the entire 2,400&nbsp;mile (3,860&nbsp;km) length of road. A section of the road in Arizona was placed on the <!--del_lnk--> National Register of Historic Places; the <!--del_lnk--> Arroyo Seco Parkway in the Los Angeles Area and Route 66 in New Mexico have been made into National Scenic Byways; and in 2005, the State of Missouri made the road a state scenic byway from Illinois to Kansas. In the cities of <!--del_lnk--> Rancho Cucamonga, <!--del_lnk--> Rialto, and <!--del_lnk--> San Bernardino in California, there are US 66 signs erected along <!--del_lnk--> Foothill Boulevard and on Huntington Drive in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Arcadia.<p><a id="Route_66_and_American_pop_culture" name="Route_66_and_American_pop_culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Route 66 and American pop culture</span></h2>
      <p>Route 66 gave its name to a company and also was immortalized in literature, popular music, and television. Although several businesses became associated with Route 66 because of their being on or near the highway, <!--del_lnk--> Phillips 66 actually took part of their name directly from the highway.<p>Because the road through Oklahoma was relatively flat and straight, two <!--del_lnk--> chemical engineers decided to test a new <!--del_lnk--> gasoline from a Tulsa oil company in the late 1920s. The company car they were driving ran exceptionally well on the new blend, prompting the engineer in the passenger seat to exclaim that the car was &quot;going like sixty&quot;. His companion looked at the speedometer and said that they were going more like 66&nbsp;miles/hour (106&nbsp;km/h). The combination of the highway number and the speed of the car led to the naming of Phillips 66 gasoline, a brand still marketed today.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1939, California writer <!--del_lnk--> John Steinbeck published <i><!--del_lnk--> The Grapes of Wrath</i>, his novel about the westward migration of Oklahoma&#39;s Dust Bowl farmers to California&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> San Joaquin Valley. The book described the problems many of them faced, including prejudice and poverty, as they traveled to a hopefully better life. In this book, he spent a chapter describing the path west, which funnels to Oklahoma City and continues down Route 66. He referred to Route 66 as the &quot;Mother Road&quot;, a nickname the highway still retains. The book won a <!--del_lnk--> Pulitzer Prize and made the road even more famous.<p>In 1946, jazz composer and pianist <!--del_lnk--> Bobby Troup wrote his best-known song, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> (Get Your Kicks On) Route 66&quot;, after driving the highway himself to get to California. He presented it to <!--del_lnk--> Nat King Cole who in turn made it one of the biggest hit singles of his career. The title was suggested by Troup&#39;s first wife, Cynthia, who accompanied him on the trip. The song later became a hit for <!--del_lnk--> Chuck Berry, and has been recorded by many subsequent artists, including <a href="../../wp/t/The_Rolling_Stones.htm" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Depeche Mode,<!--del_lnk--> John Mayer and Disney Channel&#39;s The Cheetah Girls.<p>The highway also gave its name to a popular <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> show, <i><!--del_lnk--> Route 66</i>, seen from 1960 through 1964 on <!--del_lnk--> CBS. The show featured <!--del_lnk--> Martin Milner and <!--del_lnk--> George Maharis as <!--del_lnk--> Tod and <!--del_lnk--> Buz, two young men in a <!--del_lnk--> Corvette looking for adventure along America&#39;s highways. Maharis was later replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Glenn Corbett, who played a returning Viet Nam vet named <!--del_lnk--> Linc. Strangely, though the entire program was filmed on location, it was rarely shot along Route 66. Since then, the Corvette has become the car most associated with Route 66. The theme song from the TV series, long a staple of General Motors advertising for the Corvette, was written and played by <!--del_lnk--> Nelson Riddle and his band.<p>Another famous <!--del_lnk--> GM product has a strong connection to Route 66: The <!--del_lnk--> Cadillac Ranch, located near <a href="../../wp/a/Amarillo%252C_Texas.htm" title="Amarillo, Texas">Amarillo, Texas</a>, features a row of ten vintage <!--del_lnk--> Cadillacs standing up at an angle, with their front ends buried into the ground.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> NBA Development League basketball team, the <!--del_lnk--> Tulsa 66ers, was named after the route. The road also lent its name to a <!--del_lnk--> minor league baseball team, the <!--del_lnk--> Inland Empire 66ers.<p>In &quot;Graham Canyon,&quot; an early episode of the cartoon series <!--del_lnk--> Rugrats, the Pickles family take a road trip on Route 66.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Country western song <i>Is Anybody Going To San Antone</i> (recorded by <!--del_lnk--> Doug Sahm and <!--del_lnk--> Charley Pride, among others) includes the line: &quot;Here I am walking up Sixty-Six/Wishing she hadn&#39;t done me that way.&quot;<p>Currently, <!--del_lnk--> K-Mart&#39;s line of jeans also bears the name of the former highway, branded as &quot;Route 66&quot;.<p>On the Disney&#39;s film <i><!--del_lnk--> A Goofy Movie</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Goofy and <!--del_lnk--> Max are going on vacation using Route 66.<p>In the <i><a href="../../wp/s/Stargate_SG-1.htm" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i> episode &quot;1969&quot;, the SG-1 team drives a <!--del_lnk--> hippie bus along much of the route traversed by the highway, with prop <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route shield signs posted at the side of the road.<p>The highway was referred to as &quot;the fabled Route 66&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Stacy Peralta&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Dogtown and Z-Boys.</i><p>The <!--del_lnk--> Disney/<!--del_lnk--> Pixar movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Cars</i> is set mainly in the <!--del_lnk--> fictional town of <!--del_lnk--> Radiator Springs, located on Route 66 and bypassed by I-40. Radiator Springs was based largely on <!--del_lnk--> Amboy, California, an actual Route 66 town that saw a rapid decline when I-40 opened in the early 1970s. The film was originally titled <i>Route 66</i>, but had its name changed to avoid confusion with the 1960s-vintage TV show. It opened <!--del_lnk--> June 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Several familiar sites associated with Route 66 appear in the film, including a visual homage to the <!--del_lnk--> Cadillac Ranch, the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas and the Wigwam motels in Holbrook, Arizona and on the border of San Bernardino and Rialto in California.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> manga <i><!--del_lnk--> Shaman King</i>, after <!--del_lnk--> Yoh Asakura and his group land in America, they are unsure if they are actually there until <!--del_lnk--> Tao Ren points out they are after he spots the sign for Route 66.<p>The <a href="../../wp/u/U2.htm" title="U2">U2</a> song &quot;Heartland&quot; from their album <!--del_lnk--> Rattle and Hum, references Route 66 with the lines, &quot;66 a highway speaks, of deserts dry, of cool green valleys, gold and silver veins, all the shining cities.&quot;<p><a id="Nicknames" name="Nicknames"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Nicknames</span></h2>
      <p>Over the years, U.S. Route 66 received many nicknames:<ol>
       <li>The Great Diagonal Way&mdash;Right after Route 66 was commissioned, it received this nickname because a large section of the highway (Chicago to Oklahoma City) ran diagonally, unlike the other highways.<li>The Main Street of America&mdash;Advertised as such by the US Highway 66 Association to promote the highway. The title had also been claimed by supporters of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Route 40, but the Route 66 group was more successful.<li>The Mother Road&mdash;Called this by <!--del_lnk--> John Steinbeck in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Grapes of Wrath</i>, the title continued to be applied to the highway.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Will Rogers Highway&mdash; &quot;officially&quot; named this by the <!--del_lnk--> US Highway 66 Association in 1952. A plaque dedicating the highway to the humorist is still located opposite the western terminus of Route 66 in Santa Monica, California.
