      <p>When refined, uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a>, which is slightly softer than <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a>. It is <!--del_lnk--> malleable, <!--del_lnk--> ductile, and slightly <!--del_lnk--> paramagnetic. Uranium metal has very high <!--del_lnk--> density, 65% more dense than <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a>, but slightly less dense than <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a>. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into <!--del_lnk--> uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.<p>Uranium metal has three <!--del_lnk--> allotropic forms:<ul>
       <li>alpha (orthorhombic) stable up to 667.7 &deg;C<li>beta (tetragonal) stable from 667.7 &deg;C to 774.8 &deg;C<li>gamma (body-centred cubic) from 774.8 &deg;C to melting point - this is the most malleable and ductile state.</ul>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Natural uranium metal contains about 0.71% <!--del_lnk--> U-235, 99.28% <!--del_lnk--> U-238, and about 0.0054% <!--del_lnk--> U-234. In order to produce <!--del_lnk--> enriched uranium, the process of <!--del_lnk--> isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power, weapons, or other uses. The remainder, <i>depleted uranium</i>, contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, the enrichment process produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1 kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8 kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining.<p>Its two principal isotopes are <!--del_lnk--> <sup>235</sup>U and <!--del_lnk--> <sup>238</sup>U. Naturally-occurring uranium also contains a small amount of the <!--del_lnk--> <sup>234</sup>U isotope, which is a decay product of <sup>238</sup>U. The isotope <sup>235</sup>U or enriched uranium is important for both <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors and <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a> because it is the only isotope existing in nature to any appreciable extent that is <!--del_lnk--> fissile, that is, fissionable by thermal <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a>. The isotope <sup>238</sup>U is also important because it absorbs neutrons to produce a radioactive isotope that subsequently decays to the isotope <sup>239</sup>Pu (<a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>), which also is fissile.<p>The artificial <!--del_lnk--> <sup>233</sup>U isotope is also fissile and is made from <a href="../../wp/t/Thorium.htm" title="Thorium">thorium-232</a> by <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutron</a> bombardment.<p>Uranium was the first element that was found to be fissile. Upon bombardment with slow neutrons, its <sup>235</sup>U isotope becomes the very short lived <sup>236</sup>U which immediately divides into two smaller nuclei, releasing <!--del_lnk--> nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If these neutrons are absorbed by other <sup>235</sup>U nuclei, a <!--del_lnk--> nuclear chain reaction occurs and, if there is nothing to absorb some neutrons and slow the reaction, the reaction is explosive. The first atomic bomb worked by this principle (<a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a>). A more accurate name for both this and the hydrogen bomb (<!--del_lnk--> nuclear fusion) would be &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; or &quot;nuclear weapon&quot;, because only the nuclei participate.<p><a id="Applications" name="Applications"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications</span></h2>
      <p>Before <!--del_lnk--> radiation was discovered, uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery dyes (such as <!--del_lnk--> uranium glass and in <!--del_lnk--> Fiestaware.) There was also some use in <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">photographic</a> chemicals (esp. <!--del_lnk--> uranium nitrate.) It was used in filaments for lamps and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are <!--del_lnk--> mordants of silk or wool. Uranium was also used to improve the appearance of dentures. After the discovery of uranium radiation, additional scientific and practical values of uranium were pursued.<p>After the discovery in 1939 that it could undergo <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_fission.htm" title="Nuclear fission">nuclear fission</a>, uranium gained importance with the development of practical uses of nuclear energy. The first atomic bomb used in warfare, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Little Boy&quot;, was a uranium bomb. This bomb contained enough of the uranium-235 isotope to start a runaway chain reaction which in a fraction of a second caused a large number of the uranium atoms to undergo fission, thereby releasing a fireball of energy.<p>The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel commercial <!--del_lnk--> nuclear power plants. Generally this is in the form of <!--del_lnk--> enriched uranium, which has been processed to have higher-than-natural levels of <sup>235</sup>U and can be used for a variety of purposes relating to nuclear fission. Commercial <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> plants use fuel typically enriched to 2&ndash;3% <sup>235</sup>U, though some reactor designs (such as the <!--del_lnk--> Candu reactors) can use <!--del_lnk--> natural uranium (unenriched, less than 1% <sup>235</sup>U) fuel. Fuel used for <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy submarine reactors is typically highly enriched in <sup>235</sup>U (the exact values are <!--del_lnk--> classified information). When uranium is enriched over 85% it is known as &quot;weapons grade&quot;. In a <!--del_lnk--> breeder reactor, <sup>238</sup>U can also be converted into <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a>.<p>Currently the major application of uranium in the U.S. military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of <!--del_lnk--> depleted uranium alloyed with 1&ndash;2% other elements. The applications of these armor-piercing rounds range from the 20&nbsp;mm <!--del_lnk--> Phalanx gun of the U.S. Navy for piercing attacking missiles, through the 30&nbsp;mm gun in <!--del_lnk--> A-10 aircraft, to 105mm and larger tank barrels. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and flammability of the projectile enable destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armour and the removable armour on combat vehicles are also hardened with depleted uranium (DU) plates. The use of DU became a contentious political-environmental issue after US, UK and other countries&#39; use of DU munitions in wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions of uranium compounds left in the soil.<p>Other uses include:<ul>
       <li>The long <!--del_lnk--> half-life of the isotope <sup>238</sup>U (4.51 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> years) make it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest <!--del_lnk--> igneous rocks and for other types of <!--del_lnk--> radiometric dating (including <!--del_lnk--> uranium-thorium dating and <!--del_lnk--> uranium-lead dating).<li><!--del_lnk--> Uranyl acetate, UO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>COO)<sub>2</sub> is used in <!--del_lnk--> analytical chemistry.

Due to its high density, this material has also found use in <!--del_lnk--> inertial guidance devices and in <!--del_lnk--> gyroscopic <!--del_lnk--> compasses.</ul>

      <p>The use of uranium, in its natural <!--del_lnk--> oxide form, dates back to at least CE <!--del_lnk--> 79, when it was used to add a yellow colour to <!--del_lnk--> ceramic glazes (yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found near <!--del_lnk--> Naples, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>). When this was rediscovered, in the earlier part of the 19th century, the world&rsquo;s only known source of uranium &#39;earths&#39; were the old <!--del_lnk--> Habsburg silver mines in <!--del_lnk--> Joachimsthal, <!--del_lnk--> Bohemia, and the local glassmaking industry kept a tight lid on the secret ingredient and its supply as long as it could.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> discovery of the element is credited to the German chemist <!--del_lnk--> Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who in <!--del_lnk--> 1789 found uranium in a <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">mineral</a> called <!--del_lnk--> pitchblende. It was named after <!--del_lnk--> Uranus the planet, which had been discovered eight years earlier by <!--del_lnk--> William Herschel. It was first isolated as a <a href="../../wp/m/Metal.htm" title="Metal">metal</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1841 by <!--del_lnk--> Eugene-Melchior Peligot. In 1850 the first commercial use of Uranium in glass was developed by Lloyd &amp; Summerfield of <a href="../../wp/b/Birmingham.htm" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Uranium was found to be <!--del_lnk--> radioactive by French physicist <!--del_lnk--> Henri Becquerel in <!--del_lnk--> 1896, who first discovered the process of radioactivity with uranium <a href="../../wp/m/Mineral.htm" title="Mineral">minerals</a>.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project, the wartime <!--del_lnk--> Allied program to develop the first <!--del_lnk--> atomic bombs during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the United States government bought up many reserves of uranium around the world, although the process of enriching it to applicable levels required gargantuan facilities (see <!--del_lnk--> Oak Ridge National Laboratory). Eventually enough uranium, mainly from the <a href="../../wp/d/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo.htm" title="Democratic Republic of the Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (Belgian Congo), was enriched for one atomic bomb nicknamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Little Boy&quot;, which was dropped on <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima, Japan on August 6th, 1945. The other nuclear weapons developed during the war used plutonium as their fissionable material, which itself requires uranium to produce. Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare, and that <!--del_lnk--> nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks, though within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Manhattan Project, the names <i>tuballoy</i> and <i>oralloy</i> were used to refer to natural uranium and enriched uranium respectively, originally for purposes of secrecy. These names are still used occasionally to refer to natural or enriched uranium. Less commonly, <i>25</i> was used to refer to Uranium-235 by scientists at the Project. The names <i>Q-metal</i>, <i>depletalloy</i>, and <i>D-38</i>, once applied to depleted uranium, have fallen into disuse.<p>70% of the world&#39;s known uranium is located in <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>.

Initially, the compounds formed in yellowcakes were not identified; in 1970, the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Bureau of Mines still referred to yellowcakes as the final precipitate formed in the milling process and considered it to be <!--del_lnk--> ammonium diuranate or <!--del_lnk--> sodium diuranate. The compositions were variable and depended upon precipitating conditions. Among the compounds identified in yellowcakes include: <!--del_lnk--> uranyl hydroxide, <!--del_lnk--> uranyl sulfate, <!--del_lnk--> sodium para-uranate, and <!--del_lnk--> uranyl peroxide, along with various <!--del_lnk--> uranium oxides.

      <p>Naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major <!--del_lnk--> isotopes, <sup>238</sup>U, <sup>235</sup>U, and <sup>234</sup>U, with <sup>238</sup>U being the most abundant (99.3% <!--del_lnk--> natural abundance). All three isotopes are <!--del_lnk--> radioactive, creating <!--del_lnk--> radioisotopes, with the most abundant and stable being <sup>238</sup>U with a <!--del_lnk--> half-life of 4.5 &times; 10<sup>9</sup> years, <sup>235</sup>U with a half-life of 7 &times; 10<sup>8</sup> years, and <sup>234</sup>U with a half-life of 2.5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> years. <sup>238</sup>U is an &alpha; emitter, <!--del_lnk--> decaying through the uranium natural decay series into <sup>206</sup><a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">Pb</a>.<p>Uranium isotopes can be separated to increase the concentration of one isotope relative to another. This process is called &quot;enrichment&quot; (see <!--del_lnk--> enriched uranium). To be considered &quot;enriched&quot; the <sup>235</sup>U fraction has to be increased to significantly greater than 0.711% (by weight) (typically to levels from 3% to 7%). <sup>235</sup>U is typically the main fissile material for <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> reactors. Either <sup>235</sup>U or <sup>239</sup>Pu are used for making <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>. The process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of <sup>235</sup>U and with a correspondingly increased fraction of <sup>238</sup>U, called <!--del_lnk--> depleted uranium or &quot;DU&quot;. To be considered &quot;depleted&quot;, the <sup>235</sup>U isotope concentration has to have been decreased to significantly less than 0.711% (by weight). Typically the amount of <sup>235</sup>U left in depleted uranium is 0.2% to 0.3%. This represents anywhere from 28% to 42% of the original fraction of <sup>235</sup>U.<p>Another way to look at this is as follows: <!--del_lnk--> Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWR) use natural uranium (0.71% fissile material). From <!--del_lnk--> Pressurised water reactors (PWRs) of typical design (most USA reactors are PWR) we note the fuel goes in with about 4% <sup>235</sup>U and 96% <sup>238</sup>U and comes out with about 1% <sup>235</sup>U, 1% <sup>239</sup>Pu and 95% <sup>238</sup>U. If the <sup>239</sup>Pu were removed (fuel reprocessing is not allowed in the USA) and this were added to the depleted uranium then we would have 1.2% fissile material in the reprocessed depleted uranium and at the same time have 1% fissile material in the left over spent fuel. Both of these would be considered &quot;enriched&quot; fuels for a PHWR style reactor.<p><sup>233</sup>U, an artificial isotope, is used as a reactor fuel in India. It has also been tested in nuclear weapons, but the results were unpromising.<p><a id="Hazards" name="Hazards"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Hazards</span></h2>
      <p>All isotopes and compounds of uranium are toxic, <!--del_lnk--> teratogenic, and radioactive. It has been shown that some compounds of uranium could cause renal damage, but no conclusive evidence has yet been produced.<p>No deaths are causally associated with prolonged occupational exposure to inhaled uranium compounds . Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities, those deaths were not associated with uranium . On the basis of the available data, exposure to environmental uranium or to uranium at levels found at hazardous waste sites will not be lethal to humans.<p>Radiological effects are generally local because this is the nature of alpha radiation, the primary form from U-238 decay. Uranium compounds in general are poorly absorbed by the lining in the lungs and may remain a radiological hazard indefinitely. Uranyl (UO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) ions, such as from <!--del_lnk--> uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals.<p>Finely-divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is <!--del_lnk--> pyrophoric, so small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.<p>A person can be exposed to uranium (or its radioactive daughters) by inhaling dust in air or from smoking tobacco products which have been grown using certain <!--del_lnk--> phosphate fertilizers, or ingesting water and <a href="../../wp/f/Food.htm" title="Food">food</a>. The general population is exposed to uranium primarily through food and water; the average daily intake of uranium from food ranges from 0.07 to 1.1 micrograms per day. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, or facilities that mine or process uranium ore or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures which are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to <a href="../../wp/r/Radon.htm" title="Radon">radon</a> gas, a radioactive <!--del_lnk--> carcinogen.<p>Uranium can enter the body when it is inhaled or swallowed, or under rare circumstances it may enter through cuts in the <!--del_lnk--> skin. Uranium does not absorb through the skin, and <!--del_lnk--> alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin, so uranium that is outside the body is much less harmful than it would be if it were inhaled or swallowed. When uranium enters the body it can lead to kidney damage. Uranium itself is not a chemical carcinogen.<p><!--del_lnk--> Uranium mining carries the danger of airborne radioactive dust and the release of radioactive <a href="../../wp/r/Radon.htm" title="Radon">radon</a> gas and its <!--del_lnk--> daughter products (an added danger to the already dangerous activity of all <!--del_lnk--> hard rock mining). As a result, without proper <!--del_lnk--> ventilation, uranium miners have a dramatically increased risk of later development of <a href="../../wp/l/Lung_cancer.htm" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> and other <!--del_lnk--> pulmonary diseases. There is also the possible danger of groundwater contamination with the toxic chemicals used in the separation of the uranium ore.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium&quot;</div>
