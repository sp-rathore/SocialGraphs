      <p>Ancient Ipswich was successively a <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon settlement known as &quot;Gippeswick&quot;.<p>The area around Ipswich, or <b>Gippeswick</b>, was sparsely settled until the withdrawal of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>. Afterward, its position as a convenient harbour on the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> made it convenient to <!--del_lnk--> Saxon settlers, and it is claimed to be the first Anglo-Saxon town. The kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> East Anglia was for a time centered around Ipswich.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich Museum houses <!--del_lnk--> replicas of the <!--del_lnk--> Mildenhall Treasure and the <!--del_lnk--> Sutton Hoo treasure, as well as <!--del_lnk--> Saxon <a href="../../wp/w/Weapon.htm" title="Weapon">weapons</a> and <a href="../../wp/j/Jewellery.htm" title="Jewellery">jewellery</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> King John granted it its first <!--del_lnk--> charter in <!--del_lnk--> 1200, and in the next four centuries it made most of its wealth trading Suffolk <!--del_lnk--> cloth with <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">the Continent</a>.<p>During the Middle Ages the <!--del_lnk--> Marian Shrine of <!--del_lnk--> Our Lady of Grace was a popular <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage destination, and attracted a number of royal pilgrims. The statue was taken away to be burned, although it is now believed to have survived and still to exist in <!--del_lnk--> Nettuno, Italy.<p>Around <!--del_lnk--> 1380, <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer satirised the merchants of Ipswich in the <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury Tales.<p><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Cardinal Wolsey, the son of a wealthy landowner, was born in Ipswich about <!--del_lnk--> 1475. One of <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>&#39;s closest political allies, he founded a <!--del_lnk--> college in the town in <!--del_lnk--> 1528, which is now known as <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich School. He remains one of the town&#39;s most famed figures.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1555, the <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich Martyrs were burnt at the stake for their <!--del_lnk--> Protestant beliefs. A monument commemorating this event now stands near the scene of their Martyrdom in <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch Park.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1611 to <!--del_lnk--> 1634 Ipswich was a major centre for emigration to <!--del_lnk--> New England. This was organised by the Town Lecturer, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Ward. His brother <!--del_lnk--> Nathaniel Ward was first minister of <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich, Massachusetts.<p>Ipswich had a <!--del_lnk--> racecourse which ran a mix of flat and National Hunt races from <!--del_lnk--> 1710 to <!--del_lnk--> 1911.<p>The painters <a href="../../wp/j/John_Constable.htm" title="John Constable">John Constable</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Gainsborough.htm" title="Thomas Gainsborough">Thomas Gainsborough</a> lived and worked in Ipswich. In <!--del_lnk--> 1835, <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> stayed in Ipswich and used it as a setting for scenes in his novel <i><!--del_lnk--> The Pickwick Papers</i>. The hotel where he resided first opened in 1518; it was then known as The Tavern and is now known as the Great White Horse Hotel. Dickens made the hotel famous in chapter XXI of <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, vividly describing the hotel&#39;s meandering corridors and stairs.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Ipswich is governed locally by a two-tier Council System. Ipswich Borough Council which fulfils District Council functions such as refuse collection, housing and planning and Suffolk County Council which provides services such as education and social services.<p>Between 1979 and September 2004 Ipswich Borough Council was under Labour Control but the town is now governed by a coalition of Conservative and Liberal Democrat Councillors with Labour in opposition.<p>The County Council was controlled by a Labour/Liberal Democrat administration between May 1993 and May 2005 but has since reverted to Conservative Control. This is despite the fact that 10 out of the 13 County Councillors representing Ipswich are Labour and only 1 is a Conservative.<p>In April 2006 the local <!--del_lnk--> borough council initiated public discussions about the idea of turning the borough into a <!--del_lnk--> unitary authority. Ipswich had constituted a <!--del_lnk--> county borough from 1889 to 1974, independent of the administrative county of <!--del_lnk--> East Suffolk, and this status was not restored by the <!--del_lnk--> Banham/Cooksey Commission in the 1990s. Ipswich, <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Exeter and <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> have united to campaign for unitary authority status for the four towns.<!--del_lnk-->  Ipswich hopes to use the window of opportunity presented by the October 2006 <!--del_lnk--> Local Government White Paper to regain unitary status.<p>The town is covered by two parliamentary constituencies - <!--del_lnk--> Ipswich which covers about 75% and is represented by Labour MP <!--del_lnk--> Chris Mole, and <!--del_lnk--> Central Suffolk &amp; North Ipswich which covers the remaining 25% and is represented by Conservative MP <!--del_lnk--> Michael Lord.<p><a id="Modern_Ipswich" name="Modern_Ipswich"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern Ipswich</span></h2>
      <p>The former airport has been re-developed into the new residential district of <!--del_lnk--> Ravenswood. However, the front of the control building was saved. It was designed by Heining and Chitty in 1938 and <!--del_lnk--> Grade 2 listed. The rest of the building was taken down after it was deemed unsafe to reuse.<p>Modern figures with Ipswich connections include the musician <!--del_lnk--> Nik Kershaw, the children&#39;s TV presenter <!--del_lnk--> Brian Cant, the <!--del_lnk--> punk rock band <!--del_lnk--> The Adicts, <!--del_lnk--> heavy metal band <!--del_lnk--> Cradle of Filth, <!--del_lnk--> cartoonist <!--del_lnk--> Carl Giles and <a href="../../wp/f/Formula_One.htm" title="Formula One">Formula One</a> owner <!--del_lnk--> Bernie Ecclestone.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tolly Cobbold Brewery, built in the 19th century and rebuilt 1894&ndash;1896, is one of the finest <!--del_lnk--> Victorian <!--del_lnk--> breweries in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. There was a Cobbold Brewery in the town from <!--del_lnk--> 1746 until <!--del_lnk--> 2002 when <!--del_lnk--> Ridley&#39;s Breweries took Tolly Cobbold over. <!--del_lnk--> Felix Thornley Cobbold presented <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch Mansion to the town in <!--del_lnk--> 1896.<p>Ipswich Centre contains the all-glass building owned by <!--del_lnk--> Willis Limited, properly called the <!--del_lnk--> Willis Building but still often called the &quot;Willis-Faber building&quot; by locals, as the company Willis Corroon themselves used to be called Willis Faber. Designed by <!--del_lnk--> Norman Foster, the building dates from <!--del_lnk--> 1974. It became the youngest Grade I <!--del_lnk--> listed building in Britain in <!--del_lnk--> 1991, ironically standing right next to one of the oldest extant buildings in Ipswich, the Unitarian Meeting House, which is also Grade I listed.<p>Ipswich is the last place in the area to have an independent bus company which has the unusual practice of naming its buses.<p>Ipswich has undergone an extensive <!--del_lnk--> gentrification programme in recent years, principally centred around the waterfront. Though this has turned a derelict dock area into an emerging residential and commercial centre, it is being completed at the expense of much of the town&#39;s industrial and maritime heritage and in spite of efforts made by a local group, <!--del_lnk--> The Ipswich Society. Much of this development is residential and is marketed at high net-worth individuals in the <!--del_lnk--> DINKY demographic. As such, some have considered it incompatible with Ipswich&#39;s existing <!--del_lnk--> socioeconomic mix. It could therefore be considered to be aimed at encouraging <!--del_lnk--> economic migration to the town, particularly as a commutable <!--del_lnk--> satellite town of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Holywells Park is a 67 acre (27&nbsp;ha) public park, situated near the docks, that was painted by <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Gainsborough.htm" title="Thomas Gainsborough">Thomas Gainsborough</a>.<p>Ipswich is set to be the main hub for <!--del_lnk--> University Campus Suffolk, which will give <!--del_lnk--> Suffolk its first <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a>.<p>&#39;Chantry&#39; is the name of a housing estate and park, located in Ipswich, in East Anglia within England.

      <p>Like many other similar towns, Ipswich is home to many artists, with galleries at <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch Mansion, the Town Hall, a gallery in the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient House and the <!--del_lnk--> Artists Gallery in Electric House being the more prominent. The visual arts are further supported with many sites of sculpture with easy accessibility a list of which is on <!--del_lnk--> The Wolsey Gallery&#39;s website. The Borough Council promotes creation of new public works of art and has been known to make this a condition of planning permission<!--del_lnk--> .<p>Performing arts are well represented with Ipswich being home to <!--del_lnk--> DanceEast which has the primary aim of advocating innovation and development of dance in the East of England<!--del_lnk--> . They are building new premises as part of the waterfront development, these will be the first custom built dance facilities in the East of England at a cost of around &pound;8million.<p>Since <!--del_lnk--> 1991, there has been an annual <!--del_lnk--> arts festival called <i>Ip-Art</i> which brings together many events across art disciplines and different venues, notably a free music day in <!--del_lnk--> Christchurch Park, which in <!--del_lnk--> 2006 had over 50 different acts performing over 7 stages.<p><a id="Industry" name="Industry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Industry</span></h2>
      <p>Industry around Ipswich has had a strong agricultural bias with <!--del_lnk--> Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies Ltd, one of the most famous agricultural manufacturers, located in the town. There was a <a href="../../wp/s/Sugar_beet.htm" title="Sugar beet">sugar beet</a> factory at Ipswich for many years; it was closed in 2001 as part of a rationalisation by <!--del_lnk--> British Sugar.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> British Telecom Research Laboratories were located to the east of the town in 1975 at <!--del_lnk--> Martlesham Heath.
