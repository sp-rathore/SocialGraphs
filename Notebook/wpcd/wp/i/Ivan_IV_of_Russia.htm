      <p>Ivan (or Ioann, as his name is rendered in <!--del_lnk--> Church Slavonic) was a long-awaited son of <!--del_lnk--> Vasili III. Upon his father&#39;s death, he formally came to the throne at the age of three, but his minority was dominated by regents. Initially his mother <!--del_lnk--> Elena Glinskaya acted as regent, but she died when Ivan was only eight. She was replaced as regent by <!--del_lnk--> boyars from the <!--del_lnk--> Shuisky family until Ivan assumed power in <!--del_lnk--> 1544. According to his own letters, Ivan customarily felt neglected and offended by the mighty boyars from the Shuisky and <!--del_lnk--> Belsky families. These traumatic experiences may have contributed to his hatred of the boyars and to his mental instability. He was known to throw cats and dogs out of the <!--del_lnk--> Kremlin windows, among other cruel acts.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>Ivan was crowned tsar with <!--del_lnk--> Monomakh&#39;s Cap at the <!--del_lnk--> Cathedral of the Dormition at age sixteen on <!--del_lnk--> January 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1547. Despite calamities triggered by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Fire of 1547, the early part of his reign was one of peaceful reforms and modernization. Ivan revised the law code (known as the sudebnik), created a <!--del_lnk--> standing army (the <!--del_lnk--> streltsy), established the <!--del_lnk--> Zemsky Sobor, the council of the nobles (known as the Chosen Council), and confirmed the position of the Church with the <!--del_lnk--> Council of the Hundred Chapters, which unified the rituals and ecclesiastical regulations of the entire country. He introduced the local self-management in rural regions, mainly in the Northeast of Russia, populated by the state peasantry. During his reign the first <!--del_lnk--> printing press was introduced to Russia (although the first Russian printers <!--del_lnk--> Ivan Fedorov and <!--del_lnk--> Pyotr Mstislavets had to flee from <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> to the <!--del_lnk--> Grand Duchy of Lithuania).<p>In 1547 Hans Schlitte, the <!--del_lnk--> agent of tsar Ivan, employed handicraftsmen in Germany for work in Russia. However all these handicraftsmen were arrested in <!--del_lnk--> L&uuml;beck at the request of Poland and Livonia. The German merchant companies ignored the new port built by tsar Ivan on the river Narva in 1550 and delivered the goods still in the Baltic ports owned by Livonia. Russia remained isolated from sea trade.<p>Ivan formed new trading connections, opening up the <!--del_lnk--> White Sea and the port of <!--del_lnk--> Arkhangelsk to the <!--del_lnk--> Muscovy Company of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> merchants. In 1552 he defeated the <!--del_lnk--> Kazan <!--del_lnk--> Khanate, whose armies had repeatedly devastated the Northeast of Russia , and annexed its territory. In 1556, he annexed the <!--del_lnk--> Astrakhan Khanate and destroyed the largest slave market on the river Volga. These gains of tsar complicated the migration of aggressive nomadic hordes from Asia to Europe through Volga and transformed Russia into a multinational and multiconfessional state. He had <!--del_lnk--> St. Basil&#39;s Cathedral constructed in <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> to commemorate the seizure of Kazan. Legend has it that he was so impressed with the structure that he had the architects blinded, so that they could never design anything as beautiful again.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Other less positive aspects of this period include the introduction of the first laws restricting the mobility of the <!--del_lnk--> peasants, which would eventually lead to <!--del_lnk--> serfdom. The dramatic change in Ivan&#39;s personality is traditionally linked to his near-fatal illness in <!--del_lnk--> 1553 and the death of his first wife, <!--del_lnk--> Anastasia Romanovna. Ivan suspected boyars of poisoning his wife and of plotting to replace him on the throne with his cousin, <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir of Staritsa. In addition, during that illness Ivan had asked the boyars to swear an oath of allegiance to his eldest son, an infant at the time. Many boyars refused, deeming the tsar&#39;s health too hopeless to survive. This angered Ivan and added to his distrust of the boyars. There followed brutal reprisals and murders of innocent people, including <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan Philip and Prince <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky.<p>Also problematic was the <!--del_lnk--> 1565 formation of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oprichnina</i>. The <i>Oprichnina</i> was the section of Russia (mainly the Northeast) directly ruled by Ivan and policed by his personal servicemen, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oprichniki</i>. This whole system of <i>Oprichnina</i> has been viewed by some historians as a tool against the omnipotent hereditary nobility of Russia (<!--del_lnk--> boyars) who opposed the absolutist drive of the tsar, while others have interpreted it as a sign of the <!--del_lnk--> paranoia and mental deterioration of the tsar.<p><a id="Later_reign" name="Later_reign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Later reign</span></h2>
      <p>The latter half of Ivan&#39;s reign was far less successful. Although <!--del_lnk--> Khan <!--del_lnk--> Devlet I Giray of <!--del_lnk--> Crimea repeatedly devastated Moscow region and even <!--del_lnk--> set Moscow on fire in 1571, the tsar supported <!--del_lnk--> Yermak&#39;s conquest of Tatar <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, adopting a policy of <!--del_lnk--> empire-building, which led him to launch a victorious war of seaward expansion to the west, only to find himself fighting the <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedes</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuanians</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poles</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Livonian <!--del_lnk--> Teutonic Knights.<p>For twenty-four years the <!--del_lnk--> Livonian War dragged on, damaging the Russian economy and military but winning Russia no territory. In the 1560s the combination of drought and famine, Polish-Lithuanian raids, Tatar attacks, and the sea-trading blockade carried out by the Swedes, Poles and the Hanseatic League devastated Russia. The price of grain increased by a factor of ten. Epidemics of the plague killed 10,000 in Novgorod. In 1570 the plague killed 600-1000 in Moscow daily. . Ivan&#39;s closest advisor, Prince <!--del_lnk--> Andrei Kurbsky, defected to the Lithuanians, headed the Lithuanian troops and devastated the Russian region of Velikie Luki. This treachery deeply hurt Ivan. As the Oprichnina continued, Ivan became mentally unstable and physically disabled. In one week, he could easily pass from the most depraved orgies to prayers and fasting in a remote northern monastery.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Because he gradually grew unbalanced and violent, the Oprichniks under <!--del_lnk--> Malyuta Skuratov soon got out of hand and became murderous thugs. They massacred nobles and peasants, and conscripted men to fight the war in Livonia. Depopulation and famine ensued. What had been by far the richest area of Russia became the poorest. In a dispute with the wealthy city of <!--del_lnk--> Novgorod, Ivan ordered the Oprichniks to murder inhabitants of this city, which was never to regain its former prosperity. Between thirty and forty thousand might have been killed during the infamous <!--del_lnk--> Massacre of Novgorod in 1570; many others were deported elsewhere. Yet the official death toll named 1,500 of <!--del_lnk--> Novgorod <i>big</i> people (nobility) and only mentioned about the same number of <i>smaller</i> people. Many modern researchers estimate number of victims between two and three thousand. (After the famine and epidemics of 1560s the population of Novgorod did not exceed 10,000-20,000.) <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1581, Ivan beat his pregnant daughter-in-law for wearing immodest clothing, causing a miscarriage. His son, also named Ivan, upon learning of this, engaged in a heated argument with his father, which resulted in Ivan striking his son in the head with his pointed staff, causing his son&#39;s (accidental) death. This event is depicted in the famous painting by <!--del_lnk--> Ilya Repin, <i>Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on Friday, November 16, 1581</i> better known as <i>Ivan the Terrible killing his son</i>.<p><a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and legacy</span></h2>

      <p>Although it is thought by many that Ivan died while setting up a chess board, it is more likely that he died while playing with little boys along with <!--del_lnk--> Bogdan Belsky on <!--del_lnk--> March 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1584. When Ivan&#39;s tomb was opened during renovations in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, his remains were examined and discovered to contain very high amounts of <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a>, indicating a high probability that he was poisoned. Modern suspicion falls on his advisors Belsky and <!--del_lnk--> Boris Godunov (who became tsar in <!--del_lnk--> 1598). Three days earlier, Ivan had allegedly attempted to rape Irina, Godunov&#39;s sister and Fyodor&#39;s wife. Her cries attracted Godunov and Belsky to the noise, whereupon Ivan let Irina go, but Belski and Godunov considered themselves marked for death. The tradition says that they either poisoned or strangled Ivan in fear for their own lives. The mercury found in Ivan&#39;s remains may also be related to treatment for <!--del_lnk--> syphilis, which it is speculated that Ivan had. Upon Ivan&#39;s death, the ravaged kingdom was left to his unfit and childless son <!--del_lnk--> Feodor.<p><a id="Epistles" name="Epistles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Epistles</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> D.S. Mirsky called Ivan &quot;a pamphleteer of genius&quot;. His <!--del_lnk--> epistles are the masterpieces of old Russian (perhaps all Russian) political <!--del_lnk--> journalism. They may be too full of texts from the Scriptures and the Fathers, and their <!--del_lnk--> Church Slavonic is not always correct. But they are full of cruel irony, expressed in pointedly forcible terms.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The shameless bully and the great <!--del_lnk--> polemicist are seen together in a flash when he taunts runaway Kurbsky with the question: &quot;If you are so sure of your righteousness, why did you run away and not prefer martyrdom at my hands?&quot; Such strokes were well calculated to drive his correspondent into a rage. &quot;The part of the cruel tyrant elaborately upbraiding an escaped victim while he continues torturing those in his reach may be detestable, but Ivan plays it with truly Shakespearian breadth of imagination&quot;..<p>Besides his letters to Kurbsky he wrote other satirical invectives to men in his power. The best is his letter to the abbot of the <!--del_lnk--> Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, where he pours out all the poison of his grim irony on the unascetic life of the boyars, shorn monks, and those exiled by his order. His picture of their luxurious life in the citadel of ascetism is a masterpiece of trenchant sarcasm.<p><a id="Sobriquet" name="Sobriquet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><!--del_lnk--> Sobriquet</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> word <i>terrible</i> is usually used to translate the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a> word <i>grozny</i> in Ivan&#39;s nickname, but the modern English usage of terrible, with a pejorative connotation of bad or evil, does not precisely represent the intended meaning.

Perhaps a translation closer to the intended sense would be <i>Ivan the Fearsome</i>. (Compare the city name <!--del_lnk--> Grozny.)
