      <p>There are several suggestions for the origin of the name of <i>Iraq</i>; - one dates back to the <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a> city of <!--del_lnk--> Uruk (or Erech). Another suggestion is that <i>Iraq</i> comes from the <!--del_lnk--> Aramaic language, meaning &quot;the land along the banks of the rivers.&quot; Another suggestion is <i>Iraq</i> is a reference to the root of a palm tree, as they are numerous in the country.<p>Under the Persian <!--del_lnk--> Sassanid dynasty, there was a region called &quot;Erak Arabi&quot; referring to part of the south western region of the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a>, which now is part of southern Iraq.

      <p>Iraq was historically known as <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, which literally means &quot;between the rivers&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> Greek. This land was home to the world&#39;s first civilization, the <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumerian</a> culture, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Akkadian, <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian, and <a href="../../wp/a/Assyria.htm" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> cultures, whose influence extended into neighboring regions as early as 5000 BC. These civilizations produced the earliest <a href="../../wp/w/Writing.htm" title="Writing">writing</a> and some of the first <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">sciences</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">laws</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophies</a> in the world, making the region the centre of what is commonly called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cradle of Civilization&quot;. Ancient Mesopotamian <a href="../../wp/c/Civilization.htm" title="Civilization">civilization</a> dominated other civilizations of its time.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> sixth century BC, the region became a part of the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persian Empire</a> under <a href="../../wp/c/Cyrus_the_Great.htm" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a>, before it was conquered by <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> and remained under <a href="../../wp/h/Hellenistic_Greece.htm" title="Hellenistic Greece">Greek</a> rule for nearly two centuries. A Central Asian tribe of <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> called <!--del_lnk--> Parthians then annexed the region, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanid Persians until the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a>.<p>Beginning in the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">seventh century AD</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> spread to what is now Iraq. The prophet <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed&#39;s cousin and son-in-law moved his capital to Kufa &quot;fi al-Iraq&quot; when he became the fourth <!--del_lnk--> caliph. The <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads ruling from <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> in the 7th century ruled the province of Iraq.<p><a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, the capital of the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> <!--del_lnk--> Caliphate, was the leading city of the Arab and Muslim world for five centuries. In 1258, Baghdad was devastated by the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols and was later occupied by the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Turks</a>. Ottoman rule over Iraq lasted until the <!--del_lnk--> Great War (World War I) when the Ottomans sided with <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Central Powers. During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the Ottomans were driven from much of the area by the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.<p><a id="Modern_history" name="Modern_history"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Modern history</span></h3>

      <p>During World War I, the British and French divided the Middle East in the <!--del_lnk--> Sykes-Picot Agreement. The British would control Mesopotamia. At the end of World War I, the <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> granted the area to the United Kingdom as a <!--del_lnk--> mandate. It was formed out of three former <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> vilayets</i> (regions): <!--del_lnk--> Mosul, <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Basra. However, for three out of four centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule, the vilayets of Baghdad, Mosul, and Basra were administered from Baghdad. During the British mandate, the country was ruled by British colonial administrators who used the British armed forces to put down rebellions against the government. They selected the <!--del_lnk--> Hashemite king, Faisal, who had been forced out of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> by the French, to be their client ruler.<p>Iraq was granted independence in 1932 by the urging of <!--del_lnk--> King Faisal, though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces in the country. King Ghazi of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal died in 1933, while Iraq suffered from military coups (dictatorships) until he died in 1939. Iraq was invaded by the United Kingdom in 1941, for fears that the government of <!--del_lnk--> Rashid Ali might cut oil supplies to Western nations and because of his strong leanings to <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. A military occupation followed after the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on <!--del_lnk--> October 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1947. The rulers of the country during the occupation and the remainder of the Hashemite monarchy period were the autocratic prime minister <!--del_lnk--> Nuri al-Said who also ruled from 1930-1932 and the advisor <!--del_lnk--> &#39;Abd al-Ilah to the king <!--del_lnk--> Faisal II.<p><a id="Hashemite_monarchy" name="Hashemite_monarchy"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Hashemite monarchy</span></h4>
      <p>The reinstalled <!--del_lnk--> Hashemite monarchy lasted until 1958, when it was overthrown through a <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;etat by the <!--del_lnk--> Iraqi Army, known as the <!--del_lnk--> 14 July Revolution. The coup brought <!--del_lnk--> Brigadier General <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Karim Qassim to power. He withdrew from the <!--del_lnk--> Baghdad Pact and established friendly relations with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> but his government lasted only until 1963, when it was overthrown by <!--del_lnk--> Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Abdul Salam Arif.

In the late 1980s, Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime launched the <!--del_lnk--> al-Anfal campaign (Spoils of War), which led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of <!--del_lnk--> Kurds (182 000 is the number given by Kurdish authorities for the year 1988 alone) in northern Iraq when the military razed thousands of villages, launched poison gas attacks and rounded up men, women and children before shooting them or burying them alive in mass graves.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1990 Iraq <!--del_lnk--> invaded <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> resulting in the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War and <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> economic sanctions imposed at the urging of the U.S. The economic sanctions were designed to compel Saddam to dispose of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

The U.S. and the UK declared <!--del_lnk--> no-fly zones over Kurdish northern and Shiite southern Iraq to oversee the Kurds and southern Shiites.<p>In July 2005, Hussein, and seven co-defendants were processed in <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> for the 1982 mass killing of 148 residents of the Shi&#39;ite town of Dujail, a retaliation prompted by an assassination attempt against Saddam.

On Sunday, November 5th, 2006, Saddam, his half-brother and former intelligence chief Barzan Hassan, and former chief judge of the Revolutionary Court Awad Bandar, were found guilty and sentenced to <!--del_lnk--> death by hanging.

      <p>Iraq was <!--del_lnk--> invaded in March 2003 by a United States-organized coalition with the stated reasons that Iraq had not abandoned its nuclear and chemical weapons development program according to <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> resolutions. The justifications given for invasion included purported Iraqi government links to <!--del_lnk--> Al Qaeda, claims that Iraq had <!--del_lnk--> weapons of mass destruction, the opportunity to remove an oppressive dictator from power, and the bringing of democracy to Iraq. A range of other possible motives include control over Iraqi oil fields, a desire to make amends for failing to overthrow Saddam during the Gulf war, revenge for Saddam&#39;s effort to assassinate former President George Bush, and creating a counterbalance to a nuclear-armed Iranian theocracy.<p>The United States established the <!--del_lnk--> Coalition Provisional Authority to govern Iraq. Government authority was transferred to an <!--del_lnk--> Iraqi Interim Government in 2004 and a permanent government was elected in October 2005. Over 140,000 Coalition troops remain in Iraq in order to assist the government, although there is increasing media speculation on a complete handover to Iraqi government forces within the next 12 months.<p><a id="Judging_the_success_of_the_occupation" name="Judging_the_success_of_the_occupation"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Judging the success of the occupation</span></h5>
      <p>Of the stated or assumed goals of the occupation, the coalition forces have been successful in removing Saddam Hussein from his position as a claimed oppressive dictator and in bringing democracy to Iraq. However, the occupation failed in its stated goal to destroy the country&#39; weapons of mass destruction, and to date no use-ready weapons of mass destruction have been found by coalition forces although some chemical shells were found that were left over from the <!--del_lnk--> Iran-Iraq War. It is also probable that there was little or no pre-existing al-Qaeda presence in Iraq, where it had been suppressed by the secular Iraqi government. After the invasion, al-Qaeda was however able to exploit the insurgency to establish its organization in the country in concurrency with a Sunni-led insurgency and sectarian violence. In 2006, Foreign Policy Magazine named Iraq as the fourth most unstable nation in the world. In October 2006 former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker referred to the situation in Iraq as being &quot;a helluva mess&quot;.<p><a id="Loss_of_life_following_occupation" name="Loss_of_life_following_occupation"></a><h5><span class="mw-headline">Loss of life following occupation</span></h5>
      <p>According to a recent <!--del_lnk--> epidemiologic <!--del_lnk--> study by Burnham et al in <!--del_lnk--> The Lancet medical journal, 655,000 Iraqis have died directly or indirectly as a result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The 95% <!--del_lnk--> confidence interval of this estimate spans from 393,000 to 943,000 dead. These numbers have been controversial and were immediately denounced both politically and within the statistical analysis community. The methodology used by Burham et al, known as cross-sectional population-based cluster sampling, is respected among <!--del_lnk--> epidemiologists for estimating mortality rates in war-torn countries. However, questions have arisen regarding the sufficiency of the sample size for the extrapolations made in the Lancet survey.<p>The Lancet estimate is significantly higher than estimates from other organizations. In 2004, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) used 2,200 cluster points of 10 interviews each for a total sample of 21,688, to arrive at their estimate of between 18,000 and 29,000 violent deaths during the first year after the invasion. The 2006 Lancet survey used 47 cluster points, and a total of 1,849 households, to arrive at their estimate of 112,000 total excess Iraqi deaths for the first year and on until August 2004 (a period of a year and 4 months).<p>In an opinion piece published in the <!--del_lnk--> Wall Street Journal on October 18, 2006, Steven E. Moore, of Gorton Moore International, wrote &quot;What happens when you don&#39;t use enough cluster points in a survey? You get crazy results when compared to a known quantity, or a survey with more cluster points. There was a perfect example of this two years ago. The UNDP&#39;s survey, in April and May 2004, estimated between 18,000 and 29,000 Iraqi civilian deaths due to the war. This survey was conducted four months prior to another, earlier study by the Johns Hopkins team, which used 33 cluster points and estimated between 69,000 and 155,000 civilian deaths--four to five times as high as the UNDP survey, which used 66 times the cluster points.&quot;<p>Concerning the 2004 UNDP study, Appendix C of the 2006 Lancet article supplement states: &quot;Working for the U.N. Development Program, the highly regarded Norwegian researcher Jon Pederson led a survey that recorded between 18,000 and 29,000 violent deaths during the first year of occupation. The survey was not focused on deaths, but asked about them over the course of lengthy interviews that focused on access to services. While this was more than twice the rate recorded by IBC at the time, Pederson expressed concern for the completeness and quality of the data in a newspaper interview last year. The surveys reported in The Lancet were focused solely on recording deaths and count about two and a half times as many excess deaths from all causes over the same period.&quot;<p>The 2006 Lancet article supplement also states: &quot;In 2004 we estimated that somewhere in excess of 100,000 deaths had occurred from the time of the invasion until August 2004. Using data from the 2006 survey to look at the time included in the 2004 survey, we estimate that the number of excess deaths during that time were about 112,000. That these two surveys were carried out in different locations and two years apart from each other yet yielded results that were very similar to each other, is strong validation of both surveys. ... In the news media coverage of the 2004 survey report, much was made of the wide confidence intervals, which is a statistical technique that was frequently misunderstood. With the much larger sample of the 2006 survey, the confidence intervals are narrowed significantly.&quot;<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Iraq Body Count project, as of October 19 2006, reports a range of between 43,937 and 48,783 civilian deaths as a result of the U.S. invasion. Iraq Body Count relies solely upon passive surveillance of officially reported deaths in generating this number. The authors of The Lancet study criticize this methodology, writing &quot;Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates.&quot; Such a tenfold gap between the findings of active versus passive reporting is in line with the findings of The Lancet study.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

The north of the country is largely mountainous, with the highest point being a 3,611 metres (11,847 <!--del_lnk--> ft) point, unnamed on the map opposite, but known locally as <!--del_lnk--> Cheekah Dar (black tent).

In the 1980s financial problems caused by massive expenditures in the <!--del_lnk--> eight-year war with <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and damage to oil export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity measures, borrow heavily, and later reschedule foreign debt payments. Iraq suffered economic losses from the war of at least <!--del_lnk--> US$100 <!--del_lnk--> billion. After hostilities ended in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities. A combination of low oil prices, repayment of war debts (estimated at around <!--del_lnk--> US$3 billion a year) and the costs of reconstruction resulted in a serious financial crisis which was the main short term motivation for the <!--del_lnk--> invasion of Kuwait.<div class="thumb tright">
