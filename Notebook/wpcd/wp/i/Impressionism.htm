      <p>Radicals in their time, early Impressionists broke the picture-making rules of academic painting. They began by giving colors, freely brushed, primacy over line, drawing inspiration from the work of painters such as <!--del_lnk--> Eugene Delacroix. They also took the act of painting out of the studio and into the world. Previously, not only <!--del_lnk--> still lifes and <!--del_lnk--> portraits but also <!--del_lnk--> landscapes had been painted indoors, but the Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting <i><!--del_lnk--> en plein air</i>. They used short, &quot;broken&quot; brush strokes of pure and unmixed colour, not smoothly blended as was the custom at the time. For example, instead of physically mixing yellow and blue paint, they placed unmixed yellow paint on the canvas next to unmixed blue paint, thus mixing the colors through our perception of them: creating the &quot;impression&quot; of green. Painting realistic scenes of modern life, they emphasized vivid overall effects rather than details.<p>Although the rise of Impressionism in France happened at a time when a number of other painters, including the <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italian</a> artists known as the <!--del_lnk--> Macchiaioli, and <!--del_lnk--> Winslow Homer in the United States, were also exploring <i>plein-air</i> painting, the Impressionists developed new techniques that were specific to the movement. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it was an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.<p>The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if it did not meet with approval of the artistic establishment. By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than recreating the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism became seminal to various movements in painting which would follow, including <!--del_lnk--> Post-Impressionism, <!--del_lnk--> Fauvism, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a>.<div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/68/6807.jpg.htm" title="Paintings by Renoir"><img alt="Paintings by Renoir" height="692" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Impressionism_renoir.jpg" src="../../images/68/6807.jpg" width="210" /></a></span></div>
      <p><a id="Beginnings" name="Beginnings"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings</span></h2>
      <p>In an atmosphere of change as <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and waged war, the <!--del_lnk--> Acad&eacute;mie des beaux-arts dominated the French art scene in the middle of the 19th century. The Acad&eacute;mie was the upholder of traditional standards for French painting, both in content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued (landscape and still life were not), and the Acad&eacute;mie preferred carefully finished images which mirrored reality when closely examined. Colour was somber and conservative, and the traces of brush strokes were suppressed, concealing the artist&#39;s personality, emotions, and working techniques.<p>The Acad&eacute;mie held an annual, juried art show, the <!--del_lnk--> Salon de Paris, and artists whose work displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries reflected the values of the Acad&eacute;mie, represented by the highly polished works of such artists as <!--del_lnk--> Jean-L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me and <!--del_lnk--> Alexandre Cabanel.<p>The young artists painted in a lighter and brighter style than most of the generation before them, extending further the <!--del_lnk--> realism of <!--del_lnk--> Gustave Courbet and the <!--del_lnk--> Barbizon school. They were more interested in painting landscape and contemporary life than in recreating scenes from history. Each year, they submitted their art to the Salon, only to see the juries reject their best efforts in favour of trivial works by artists working in the approved style. A core group of young realists, <a href="../../wp/c/Claude_Monet.htm" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Auguste Renoir, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Sisley and <!--del_lnk--> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bazille, who had studied under <!--del_lnk--> Charles Gleyre, became friends and often painted together. They were soon joined by <!--del_lnk--> Camille Pissarro, <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_C%25C3%25A9zanne.htm" title="Paul C&eacute;zanne">Paul C&eacute;zanne</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Armand Guillaumin.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1863, the jury rejected <i><!--del_lnk--> The Luncheon on the Grass</i> <i>(Le d&eacute;jeuner sur l&#39;herbe)</i> by <a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589douard_Manet.htm" title="&Eacute;douard Manet">&Eacute;douard Manet</a> primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men on a picnic. While nudes were routinely accepted by the Salon when featured in historical and allegorical paintings, the jury condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting. The jury&#39;s sharply worded rejection of Manet&#39;s painting, as well as the unusually large number of rejected works that year, set off a firestorm among French artists. Manet was admired by Monet and his friends, and led the discussions at <!--del_lnk--> Caf&eacute; Guerbois where the group of artists frequently met.<p>After seeing the rejected works in 1863, Emperor Napoleon III decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the <!--del_lnk--> Salon des Refus&eacute;s (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refus&eacute;s drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art, and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.<p>Artists&#39; petitions requesting a new Salon des Refus&eacute;s in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In April of <!--del_lnk--> 1874 a group consisting of Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, C&eacute;zanne, <!--del_lnk--> Berthe Morisot and <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Degas organized their own exhibition at the studio of the photographer <!--del_lnk--> Nadar. They invited a number of other progressive artists to exhibit with them, including the slightly older <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Boudin, whose example had first persuaded Monet to take up <i>plein air</i> painting years before. Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, <!--del_lnk--> Johan Jongkind, declined to participate, as did Manet. In total, thirty artists participated in the exhibition, the first of eight that the group would present between 1874 and 1886.<p>The critical response was mixed, with Monet and especially C&eacute;zanne bearing the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist <!--del_lnk--> Louis Leroy wrote a scathing review in the <i>Le Charivari</i> newspaper in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Impression, Sunrise</i> <i>(Impression, soleil levant)</i>, he gave the artists the name by which they would become known. Derisively titling his article <i>The Exhibition of the Impressionists</i>, Leroy declared that Monet&#39;s painting was at most a sketch and could hardly be termed a finished work.<div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/68/6808.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="625" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Impressionism_degas.jpg" src="../../images/68/6808.jpg" width="210" /></a></span></div>
      <p>He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,<dl>
       <dd><i>Impression &mdash; I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it &hellip; and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.</i></dl>
      <p>The term &quot;Impressionists&quot; quickly gained favor with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. Monet, Sisley, Morisot and Pissarro may be considered the &quot;purest&quot; Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and color. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors. Renoir turned against Impressionism for a time in the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. &Eacute;douard Manet, despite his role as a leader to the group, never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour, and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his <i>Spanish Singer</i> had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that &quot;the Salon is the real field of battle&quot; where a reputation could be made.<p>Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Prussian War in 1870), defections occurred as C&eacute;zanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions in order to submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin&#39;s membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and C&eacute;zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy. Degas created dissention by insisting on the inclusion of realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, leading Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of &quot;opening doors to first-come daubers&quot;. The group divided over the invitation of <!--del_lnk--> Signac and <!--del_lnk--> Seurat to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.<p>The individual artists saw few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance. Their dealer <!--del_lnk--> Durand-Ruel played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York</a>. Although Sisley would die in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879. Financial security came to Monet in the early 1880s and to Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.<p><a id="Impressionist_techniques" name="Impressionist_techniques"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impressionist techniques</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Short, thick strokes of paint are used to quickly capture the essence of the subject rather than its details.<li>Colors are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, creating a vibrant surface. The optical mixing of colors occurs in the eye of the viewer.<li>Grays, and dark tones, are produced by mixing complimentary colors. In pure Impressionism the use of black paint is avoided.<li>Wet paint is placed into wet paint without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.<li>Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes) which earlier artists built up carefully to produce effects. The surface of an Impressionist painting is typically opaque.<li>The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colors from object to object.<li>In paintings made <i><!--del_lnk--> en plein air</i> (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness and openness that was not captured in painting previously. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)</ul>
      <p>Painters throughout history had occasionally used these methods, but Impressionists were the first to use all of them together and with such boldness. Earlier artists whose works display these techniques include <!--del_lnk--> Frans Hals, <a href="../../wp/d/Diego_Vel%25C3%25A1zquez.htm" title="Diego Vel&aacute;zquez">Diego Vel&aacute;zquez</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Peter_Paul_Rubens.htm" title="Peter Paul Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/John_Constable.htm" title="John Constable">John Constable</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> J. M. W. Turner. French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> colorist <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, the leader of the realists <!--del_lnk--> Gustave Courbet, and painters of the Barbizon school such as <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned much from the work of <!--del_lnk--> Camille Corot and <!--del_lnk--> Eug&egrave;ne Boudin, who painted from nature in a style that was close to Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.<p>Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes) which allowed artists to work more spontaneously both outdoors and indoors. Previously, each painter made his or her own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.<p><a id="Content_and_composition" name="Content_and_composition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Content and composition</span></h2>
      <p>Before the Impressionists other painters, notably such 17th century Dutch painters as <!--del_lnk--> Jan Steen, had focused on common subjects, but their approach to composition was traditional. They arranged their compositions in such a way that the main subject commanded the viewer&#39;s attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance. <a href="../../wp/p/Photography.htm" title="Photography">Photography</a> was in fact gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to capture the moment, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.<p>Another major influence was Japanese art prints (<!--del_lnk--> Japonism), which had originally come into the country as wrapping paper for imported goods. The art of these prints contributed significantly to the &quot;snapshot&quot; angles and unconventional compositions which are a characteristic of the movement.<p><!--del_lnk--> Edgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints. His <i>The Dance Class</i> <i>(La classe de danse)</i> of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant.<p><a id="Post-Impressionism" name="Post-Impressionism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Impressionism</span></h2>
      <p>Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. From the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form and line, derived from the Impressionist example: <!--del_lnk--> Vincent Van Gogh, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Gauguin, <!--del_lnk--> Georges Seurat and <!--del_lnk--> Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; <!--del_lnk--> Camille Pissarro briefly painted in a <!--del_lnk--> pointillist manner, and even Monet abandoned strict <i>plein air</i> painting. <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_C%25C3%25A9zanne.htm" title="Paul C&eacute;zanne">Paul C&eacute;zanne</a>, who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasizing pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters can by definition be categorized as Impressionism.<p><a id="Painters_known_as_Impressionists" name="Painters_known_as_Impressionists"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Painters known as Impressionists</span></h2>
      <p>The central figures in the development of Impressionism in France, listed alphabetically, were:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Bazille<li><!--del_lnk--> Gustave Caillebotte (who, younger than the others, joined forces with them in the mid 1870s)<li><!--del_lnk--> Mary Cassatt (American-born, she lived in Paris and participated in four Impressionist exhibitions)<li><a href="../../wp/p/Paul_C%25C3%25A9zanne.htm" title="Paul C&eacute;zanne">Paul C&eacute;zanne</a> (though he later broke away from the Impressionists)<li><!--del_lnk--> Edgar Degas (a realist who despised the term &quot;Impressionist&quot; but is considered one due to his loyalty to the group)<li><!--del_lnk--> Armand Guillaumin<li><a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589douard_Manet.htm" title="&Eacute;douard Manet">&Eacute;douard Manet</a> (who did not regard himself as an Impressionist, but is generally considered one)<li><a href="../../wp/c/Claude_Monet.htm" title="Claude Monet">Claude Monet</a> (the most prolific of the Impressionists and the one who most clearly embodies their aesthetic)<li><!--del_lnk--> Berthe Morisot<li><!--del_lnk--> Camille Pissarro<li><!--del_lnk--> Pierre-Auguste Renoir<li><!--del_lnk--> Alfred Sisley</ul>
      <p>Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe De Nittis, an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at Degas&#39; invitation, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work. <!--del_lnk--> Eva Gonzal&egrave;s was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. <!--del_lnk--> Walter Sickert, an English friend of Degas, was also influenced by <!--del_lnk--> James Abbott McNeill Whistler, an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colors. <!--del_lnk--> Federico Zandomeneghi was another friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists.<p>By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as <!--del_lnk--> Jean Beraud and <!--del_lnk--> Henri Gervex found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art. Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from actual Impressionist practice.<p>As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists too numerous to list became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> The American Impressionists, including <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Carl Frieseke, <!--del_lnk--> Childe Hassam, <!--del_lnk--> Willard Metcalf, <!--del_lnk--> Lilla Cabot Perry, <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Robinson, <!--del_lnk--> John Henry Twachtman, and <!--del_lnk--> J.
