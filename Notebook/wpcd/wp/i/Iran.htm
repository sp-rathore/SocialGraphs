      <p>In former ages, the names &#x100;ry&#x101;n&#x101; and Persis were used to describe the region which is today known as the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau. The earliest Iranian reference to the word (airya/arya/aryana etc), however, predates the Iranian prophet <a href="../../wp/z/Zoroaster.htm" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> (est. anywhere between 1200 to 1800 <!--del_lnk--> BCE, according to Greek sources, as early as 6000 BCE and is attested in non-<!--del_lnk--> Gathic <!--del_lnk--> Avestan; it appears as <i>airya</i>, meaning noble/spiritual/elevated; as <i>airya dainhava</i> (Yt.8.36, 52) meaning the land of the Aryans; and as <i><!--del_lnk--> airyana vaejah</i>, the original land of the Aryans.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid dynasty (550-330 BCE), the <!--del_lnk--> Persian people called their provincial homeland <i>P&#x101;rsa</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> Old Persian name for <a href="../../wp/c/Cyrus_the_Great.htm" title="Cyrus the Great">Cyrus the Great</a>&#39;s kingdom which belonged to the Persian tribe of the <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian</a> branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians and which can still be found in the term <i>Pars</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Fars as part of the heartland of Iran and for example in the map by <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes and other historical or modern maps.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>However, the country as a whole was called <i>Aryanam</i>. The word <i>Ariya</i>, noble/spiritual/elevated, is attested in the Inscriptions of <!--del_lnk--> Darius the Great and his son, <!--del_lnk--> Xerxes I; it is used both as a linguistic and a racial designation as Darius refers to this at the <!--del_lnk--> Behistun inscription (DBiv.89), which is written in <!--del_lnk--> Aryan language/<i>airyan</i>, also<p>known as <!--del_lnk--> Old Persian. Both Darius and Xerxes state in <!--del_lnk--> Naqsh-i Rustam (DNa.14), <!--del_lnk--> Susa (DSe.13), and <!--del_lnk--> Persepolis (XPh.13):<p><i>Adam P&#x101;rsa, P&#x101;rsahy&#x101; pu&ccedil;a; Ariya, Ariya ci&ccedil;a...</i><br /> &quot;I am Persian, son of a Persian; an <!--del_lnk--> Aryan, having <!--del_lnk--> Aryan lineage.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Parthian times (248 BCE &ndash; 224 <!--del_lnk--> CE), Aryanam was modified to <i>Aryan</i>. In the early <!--del_lnk--> Sassanid Period (224&ndash;651 CE), it had already evolved to <!--del_lnk--> Middle Persian <i>&#x112;r&#x101;n</i> or <i>&#x112;r&#x101;n Shahr</i> which finally resulted in <!--del_lnk--> New Persian <i>Iran</i> or <i>Iran Shahr</i>.<p>At the time of the Achaemenian empire, the Greeks called the country <i>Persis</i>, the Greek name for Pars (Fars), the central region where the empire was founded; this passed into Latin and became <i>Persia</i>, the name widely used in Western countries which causes confusion as Persia is actually Pars (Fars) province.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">twentieth century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> a dispute arose over whether Iran or Persia is the correct name for the country. On <!--del_lnk--> 21 March <!--del_lnk--> 1935, the ruler of the country, <!--del_lnk--> Reza Shah Pahlavi, issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term <i>Iran</i> in formal correspondence in accordance with the fact that &quot;Persia&quot; was a term used for a country called &quot;Iran&quot; in Persian. Opponents claimed that this act brought cultural damage to the country and separated Iran from its past in the West. The <!--del_lnk--> 1979 Revolution led to the establishment of the present day <!--del_lnk--> theocracy that is officially called the <i><a href="../../wp/i/Islamic_republic.htm" title="Islamic republic">Islamic Republic of Iran</a></i>, but the <!--del_lnk--> noun <i>Persia</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> adjective <i>Persian</i> are still commonly used.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Parthia was led by the <!--del_lnk--> Arsacid dynasty, who reunited and ruled over the Iranian plateau, taking over the eastern provinces of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek <!--del_lnk--> Seleucid Empire, beginning in the late <!--del_lnk--> 3rd century <!--del_lnk--> BCE, and intermittently controlled <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> between ca 150 BCE and 224 <!--del_lnk--> CE. It was the second native dynasty of ancient Iran (<!--del_lnk--> Persia). Parthia (mostly due to their invention of <!--del_lnk--> heavy cavalry) was the arch-enemy of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the east; and it limited Rome&#39;s expansion beyond <!--del_lnk--> Cappadocia (central <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia).<p>The Parthian armies included two types of <!--del_lnk--> cavalry: the heavily-armed and armoured <!--del_lnk--> cataphracts and lightly armed but highly-mobile <!--del_lnk--> mounted archers. For the Romans, who relied on heavy <!--del_lnk--> infantry, the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in <!--del_lnk--> siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able to completely <!--del_lnk--> anex each other.<p>The Parthian empire lasted five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this long lasted empire came in 224 CE, when the empire was loosely organized and the last king was defeated by one of the empire&#39;s vassals, the Persians of the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanian dynasty.<p><a id="Zoroastrianism_and_Second_Persian_Empire:_Sassanian_Empire" name="Zoroastrianism_and_Second_Persian_Empire:_Sassanian_Empire"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Zoroastrianism and Second Persian Empire: Sassanian Empire</span></h3>

      <p>Before the Islamic conquest of Persia, <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism was the national religion of the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanian Empire of Persia, and played an important role in the earlier <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenian and <!--del_lnk--> Parthian dynasties. The Iranian <!--del_lnk--> Prophet <a href="../../wp/z/Zoroaster.htm" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a> is considered by numerous scholars as the founder of the earliest religion based on revealed scripture. Many scholars point out that <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and subsequently, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> have borrowed from <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism in regards to the concepts of <!--del_lnk--> Eschatology, <!--del_lnk--> Angelology and <!--del_lnk--> Demonology, as well as the fallen angel Satan, as the ultimate agent of evil; some suggest it might have been a process of mutual influencing. Zoroastrian monotheism has had major influence on the religions of the Middle Eastern monotheisms in adaptations of such concepts as heavens, hells, judgment day and messianic figures. These concepts (amongst many others) reflect the extreme <!--del_lnk--> dualism of <!--del_lnk--> Persian culture which has influenced <!--del_lnk--> Eastern and <!--del_lnk--> Western civilization. According to Professor <!--del_lnk--> Mary Boyce, who was the world&#39;s leading doyenne of <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrian studies and <!--del_lnk--> Iranology, Zoroastrianism is the oldest of the revealed credal religions, and it has probably had more influence on mankind, directly and indirectly, than any other single faith. Nonetheless, claims of Zoroastrianism influencing ancient Jewish (and subsequent Christian) thought are disputed by other scholars or explained by the mutual influencing phenomenon.<p>Despite its heavy persecution of Christians during the <a href="../../wp/4/4th_century.htm" title="4th century">fourth century</a>, <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">fifth century</a> Zoroastrian Iran became a haven for <!--del_lnk--> Nestorians fleeing Christian territories that supported the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ephesus. As a result, the <!--del_lnk--> Assyrian Church of the East was formed.<p>The first Shah of the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanian Empire, <!--del_lnk--> Ardashir I, started reforming the country both economically and militarily. The empire&#39;s territory encompassed all of today&#39;s Iran, <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Armenia.htm" title="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, eastern parts of <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and parts of <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Caucasia, <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia and <!--del_lnk--> Arabia. During <!--del_lnk--> Khosrau II&#39;s rule in 590-628, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Palestine and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> were also annexed to the Empire. The Sassanians called their empire <i>Er&#x101;nshahr</i> (or <i>Iransh&aelig;hr</i>, &quot;Dominion of the Aryans&quot;, i.e. of <a href="../../wp/i/Iranian_peoples.htm" title="Iranian peoples">Iranians</a>).<p>An interesting chapter of Iran&#39;s history followed after roughly six hundred years of conflict with the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>. According to historians, the war-exhausted Persians lost the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of al-Q&#x101;disiyyah (632 CE) in <!--del_lnk--> Hilla, (present day <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>). The Persian general <!--del_lnk--> Rostam Farrokhz&#x101;d had been criticised for his decision to face the Arabs on their own ground, suggesting that the Persians could have prevailed if they had stayed on the opposite bank of the <a href="../../wp/e/Euphrates.htm" title="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. The first day of battle ended with Persian advances and the Arab force appeared as though it would succumb to the much larger <!--del_lnk--> Sassanian army. In particular, the latter&#39;s elephants terrified the Arab cavalry. By the third day of battle, Arab veterans arrived on the scene and re-enforced the Arab army. In addition a clever trick whereby the Arab horses were decorated in costume succeeded in frightening the Persian elephants. When an Arab warrior succeeded in slaying the lead elephant, the rest fled into the rear, trampelling numerous Persian fighters. At dawn of the fourth day, a sandstorm broke out blowing sand in the Persian army&#39;s faces resulting in total disarray for the <!--del_lnk--> Sassanian army and paving way for the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic conquest of Persia.<p>The Sassanian era, encompassing the length of the <!--del_lnk--> Late Antiquity period, is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of <!--del_lnk--> Persian civilization, and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam. Persia influenced Roman civilisation considerably during the Sassanians times; their cultural influence extending far beyond the empire&#39;s territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India and also playing a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art. This influence carried forward to the early <!--del_lnk--> Islamic world. The dynasty&#39;s unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing and other skills, were taken from the Sassanian Persians into the broader Muslim world.<p><a id="Islamic_Persia_and_Islamic_Golden_Age_of_Persia" name="Islamic_Persia_and_Islamic_Golden_Age_of_Persia"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Islamic Persia and Islamic Golden Age of Persia</span></h3>

      <p>After the conquest Persians began to look for ways in which they could remain <!--del_lnk--> Muslim but also define themselves as Persians and sought the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Persianisation&quot; of Islam. In the 8 CE (2 H) they helped the Abbassids to overthrow the <!--del_lnk--> Umayyad Dynasty, an Arab-oriented regime that was largely disdainful towards Persians and Persian culture. Under the <!--del_lnk--> Abbasids, Persians (and other non-Arabs) began to take on a more meaningful role in the Islamic Empire&#39;s intellectual, cultural, and political realms. Persians entered the <!--del_lnk--> Abbassid government as ministers, among those were the <!--del_lnk--> Barmakids. They established new dynasties in some parts of Iran, which derived legitimacy from the <!--del_lnk--> caliphs. <!--del_lnk--> Tahirid dynasty and <!--del_lnk--> Samanid dynasty were among those. One of these dynasties (<!--del_lnk--> Buwayhid) also conquered <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>.<p>Also a cultural movement emerged during the <a href="../../wp/9/9th_century.htm" title="9th century">ninth</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">tenth centuries</a>. There was a resurgence of <!--del_lnk--> Persian national identity. It was not against Islamic identity but against <!--del_lnk--> Arabization of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Muslims. The most notable effect of the movement was the decision of the continuation of the <!--del_lnk--> Persian language, the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Persians to the present day. <!--del_lnk--> Ferdowsi, Iran&#39;s greatest epic poet, is regarded today as the most important person in maintaining the Persian language.<p>During this period, <!--del_lnk--> Persia and Persian scientists created an <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Golden Age (see <!--del_lnk--> List of Iranian scientists and scholars). Persia was at this point of history a world centre of scientific inquiry, with philosophers, scientists, engineers and historians contributing enormously to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science in <!--del_lnk--> the Renaissance. The late <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> however brought many critical events in the region. From 1220, Persia was again invaded and destroyed by wave after wave of calamity starting with the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol invasion, followed later by <!--del_lnk--> Tamerlane. During the <!--del_lnk--> Mongol period more than half of the population were killed and didn&#39;t reach its pre-Mongol levels until the twentieh century.<p><a id="Safavid_Empire.2C_Shi.27a_Islam_and_modern_Iran" name="Safavid_Empire.2C_Shi.27a_Islam_and_modern_Iran"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Safavid Empire, Shi&#39;a Islam and modern Iran</span></h3>
      <p>Persia&#39;s first encompassing <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a Islamic state was established under the <!--del_lnk--> Safavid dynasty in 1501. The Safavid dynasty soon became a major power in the world and started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule the Persian Architecture flowered again and saw many new monuments. The decline of the Safavid state in the seventeenth century increasingly turned Persia into an arena for rising rival colonial powers such as <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Russia and the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> that wielded great political influence in <a href="../../wp/t/Tehran.htm" title="Tehran">Tehran</a> under the <!--del_lnk--> Qajarid dynasty. Iran however, managed to maintain its sovereignty and was never colonized, making it unique in the region. With the rise of <!--del_lnk--> modernization in the late nineteenth century, desire for change led to the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911. In 1921, <!--del_lnk--> Reza Khan (known as <a href="../../wp/r/Reza_Shah.htm" title="Reza Shah">Reza Shah</a> after assuming the throne) staged a <!--del_lnk--> coup against the weakened <!--del_lnk--> Qajar dynasty.

      <p>During <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Britain and the USSR invaded Iran from August 25 to September 17, 1941, to stop an Axis-supported coup and secure Iran&#39;s petroleum infrastructure. The <!--del_lnk--> Allies forced the Shah to abdicate in favour of his son, <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whom they hoped would be more supportive. In 1951, an eccentric pro-democratic nationalist, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Mossadegh rose to prominence in Iran and was elected its first <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Mossadegh alarmed the West by his <!--del_lnk--> nationalization of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later <!--del_lnk--> British Petroleum, BP) that had controlled the country&#39;s oil reserves. In response, Britain immediately embargoed Iran. In 1953, members of the British Intelligence Service invited the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> under President Eisenhower to join them in <!--del_lnk--> Operation Ajax to overthrow Iran&rsquo;s democracy. President Eisenhower agreed, authorizing the CIA to take the lead in the operation of overthrowing Mossadegh and reinstalling a US-friendly monarch. The CIA faced many setbacks, but eventually succeeded.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Regardless of this setback, the <!--del_lnk--> covert operation soon went into full swing, conducted from the US Embassy in Tehran under the leadership of <!--del_lnk--> Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.. Agents were hired to facilitate violence; and, as a result, protests broke out across the nation. Anti- and pro-monarchy protestors violently clashed in the streets, leaving almost three hundred dead. The operation was successful in triggering a coup, and within days, pro-Shah tanks stormed the capital and bombarded the Prime Minister&#39;s residence.

      <p>Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was then reinstated as Shah. His rule became increasingly <a href="../../wp/a/Autocracy.htm" title="Autocracy">autocratic</a> in the following years. With strong support from the US and UK, the Shah further modernized Iranian industry, but simultaneously crushed all forms of political opposition with his intelligence agency, <!--del_lnk--> SAVAK. <!--del_lnk--> Ayatollah <!--del_lnk--> Ruhollah Khomeini became an active critic of the Shah&#39;s modernization efforts and publicly denounced the government. Khomeini, who was popular in religious circles, was arrested and imprisoned for 18 months. After his release in 1964, Khomeini publicly criticized the United States government. The Shah was persuaded to send him into exile by General <!--del_lnk--> Hassan Pakravan. Khomeini was sent first to <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> and then to <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>.

      <p>1979 saw an increase in protests against the <!--del_lnk--> Shah, culminating in the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian Revolution. The Shah fled the country again, after which <!--del_lnk--> Khomeini returned from exile in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> on <!--del_lnk--> February 1, 1979 and eventually succeeded in taking power. On <!--del_lnk--> February 11, Khomeini declared a provisional government led by prime minster <!--del_lnk--> Mehdi Bazargan and on <!--del_lnk--> March 30 to <!--del_lnk--> March 31, asked all Iranians sixteen years of age and older, male and female, to vote in a referendum on the question of establishing an <a href="../../wp/i/Islamic_republic.htm" title="Islamic republic">Islamic republic</a> in Iran. Over 98% voted in favour of replacing the monarchy with the newly-proposed form of government. Khomeini&#39;s new Islamic state instated <!--del_lnk--> conservative Islamic laws and unprecedented levels of direct clerical rule.<p>Iran&#39;s relations with the United States were severely strained after the revolution, especiallly when Iranian students <!--del_lnk--> seized US embassy personnel on <!--del_lnk--> November 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1979, labeling the embassy a &quot;den of spies&quot; and accused its personnel of being CIA agents trying to overthrow the revolutionary government, as the CIA had done to <!--del_lnk--> Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953. Khomeini did not stop the students from holding embassy employees hostage and instead supported the embassy take over, a move which only increased his popularity among the revolutionaries. <!--del_lnk--> Women, <!--del_lnk--> African Americans and one hostage diagnosed with <a href="../../wp/m/Multiple_sclerosis.htm" title="Multiple sclerosis">multiple sclerosis</a> were soon released. Despite attempts made by the administration of <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">US President</a> <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> at negotiating and rescuing the remaining hostages through such methods as <!--del_lnk--> Operation Eagle Claw, Iran refused to release them and threatened to put the hostages on trial for espionage. The students demanded the handover of the shah in exchange for the hostages. However, this exchange never took place, and after 444 days of captivity, embassy employees were finally allowed to leave Iran and return to the United States on the basis of <!--del_lnk--> Algiers declaration in which U.S. hasn&#39;t released the properties of Iran.<p>Meanwhile, <!--del_lnk--> Iraqi leader <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein decided to take advantage of what he perceived to be disorder in the wake of the Iranian Revolution and its unpopularity with Western governments. Of particular interest was that the once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution. With the Shah out of power, Hussein had far-reaching ambitions to assert himself as the new strong man of the Middle East and planned a full-scale invasion of Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. The Iraqi army&#39;s assault took the country completely by surprise and the destructive <!--del_lnk--> Iran-Iraq War called &quot;Sadd&#x101;m&#39;s al-Q&#x101;disiyyah&quot; in <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, and the &quot;Imposed war&quot; in Iran had begun.<p>Tens of thousands of Iranian <!--del_lnk--> civilians and <!--del_lnk--> military personnel were killed when Iraq used <!--del_lnk--> chemical weapons in its warfare. <!--del_lnk--> Iraq was financially backed by <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Arab countries of the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> (beginning in <!--del_lnk--> 1983), <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>,and the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a> (which also sold weapons to Iran) All of these countries provided intelligence, agents for chemical weapons as well as other forms of military assistance to Saddam Hussein.

Khomeini refused a cease-fire from Iraq which was demanding huge reparation payments and an end to his rule. Khomeini also sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi&#39;a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, &quot;drank the cup of poison&quot; and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations. With the fall of Saddam&#39;s regime in Iraq in April <!--del_lnk--> 2003 and his capture in December of that year, Iran announced it had sent its own indictment against Saddam to Iraq&#39;s government, with the list of complaints including the use of chemical weapons. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be anywhere between 500,000 to 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed Saddams chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks, while unanimously announcing that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war. <p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

The President is responsible for the implementation of the Constitution and for the exercise of executive powers, except for matters directly related to the Supreme Leader, who has the final say in all matters. The President appoints and supervises the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and selects government policies to be placed before the legislature. Eight Vice-Presidents serve under the President, as well as a cabinet of twenty-one ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature. Unlike many other states, the executive branch in Iran does not control the armed forces. Although the President appoints the Ministers of Intelligence and Defense, it is customary for the President to obtain explicit approval from the Supreme Leader for these two ministers before presenting them to the legislature for a vote of confidence.<p><a id="Council_of_Guardians" name="Council_of_Guardians"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Council of Guardians</span></h4>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Council of Guardians comprises twelve jurists including six appointed by the Supreme Leader. The head of the judiciary, who is also appointed by the Supreme Leader, recommends the remaining six, who are officially appointed by <!--del_lnk--> Parliament. The Council interprets the constitution and may <!--del_lnk--> veto Parliament. If a law is deemed incompatible with the constitution or <i><!--del_lnk--> Sharia</i> (Islamic law) , it is referred back to Parliament for revision. In a controversial exercise of its authority, the Council has drawn upon a narrow interpretation of Iran&#39;s constitution to veto parliamentary candidates.<p><a id="Expediency_Council" name="Expediency_Council"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Expediency Council</span></h4>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> <i>Majles-e Shura-ye Eslami</i> (Islamic Consultative Assembly) is comprised of 290 members elected for four-year terms. The Majlis drafts <!--del_lnk--> legislation, ratifies international <!--del_lnk--> treaties, and approves the national budget. All Majlis candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Guardians. Before the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Revolution, Iran&#39;s legislature was <!--del_lnk--> bicameral with both the Majlis and a <!--del_lnk--> Senate; the Senate was eliminated in the 1979 constitution.<p><a id="Judiciary" name="Judiciary"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Judiciary</span></h4>
      <p>The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the Judiciary, who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court and the chief public prosecutor. There are several types of courts including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and &quot;revolutionary courts&quot; which deal with certain categories of offenses, including crimes against <!--del_lnk--> national security. The decisions of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed. The Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by <!--del_lnk--> clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving <!--del_lnk--> lay people. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework and is accountable only to the Supreme Leader. The Court&rsquo;s rulings are final and cannot be appealed.<p><a id="Assembly_of_Experts" name="Assembly_of_Experts"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Assembly of Experts</span></h4>

According to article seven of Iran&#39;s Constitution, these local councils together with the Parliament are &quot;decision-making and administrative organs of the State&quot;.

      <p>Iran is the seventeenth-largest country in the world.

      <p>Iran&#39;s economy is a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> central planning, <!--del_lnk--> state ownership of oil and other large <a href="../../wp/b/Business.htm" title="Business">enterprises</a>, village <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, and small-scale private trading and service ventures. Its economic <!--del_lnk--> infrastructure has been improving steadily over the past two decades.<p>In the early 21st century the service sector contributed the largest percentage of the GDP, followed by industry (<!--del_lnk--> mining and manufacturing) and <!--del_lnk--> agriculture. About 45 percent of the government&#39;s budget came from oil and natural gas revenues, and 31 percent came from taxes and fees. Government spending contributed to an average annual inflation rate of 14 percent in the period 2000-2004. In 2004 the GDP was estimated at $163 billion, or $2,440 per capita ($8,100 at <!--del_lnk--> PPP). Because of these figures and the country&rsquo;s diversified but small industrial base, the United Nations classifies Iran&#39;s economy as semideveloped.<p>The current administration continues to follow the market reform plans of the previous one and indicated that it will diversify Iran&#39;s oil-reliant economy. It is attempting to do this by <!--del_lnk--> investing revenues in areas like <a href="../../wp/a/Automobile.htm" title="Automobile">automobile</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Manufacturing.htm" title="Manufacturing">manufacturing</a>, <!--del_lnk--> aerospace industries, consumer <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronics</a>, <!--del_lnk--> petrochemicals and <!--del_lnk--> nuclear technology.<p>Iran also expects to attract billions of dollars of <!--del_lnk--> foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment climate, such as reduced restrictions and duties on imports, and free-trade zones like in <!--del_lnk--> Chabahar and the island of <!--del_lnk--> Kish. Modern Iran has a solid <!--del_lnk--> middle class and a growing economy but continues to be affected by <!--del_lnk--> inflation and <!--del_lnk--> unemployment.<p>Iranian budget deficits have been a chronic problem, in part due to large-scale state subsidies (totaling some $7.25 billion per year) that include foodstuffs and especially gasoline.<p>Iran is <!--del_lnk--> OPEC&#39;s second largest oil producer, exporting over three million barrels of oil per day; moreover, it holds 10% of the world&#39;s confirmed oil reserves. Iran also has the world&#39;s second largest <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> reserves (after <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>). The strong oil market in 1996 helped ease financial pressures on Iran and allowed for Tehran&#39;s timely debt service payments.<p>The services sector has seen the greatest long-term growth in terms of its share of GDP, but the sector remains volatile. State investment has boosted agriculture with the liberalization of production and the improvement of packaging and marketing helping to develop new export markets. Thanks to the construction of many <a href="../../wp/d/Dam.htm" title="Dam">dams</a> throughout the country in recent years, large-scale <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a> schemes, and the wider production of export-based agricultural items like <!--del_lnk--> dates, <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> pistachios, produced the fastest economic growth of any sector in Iran over much of the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s. Although successive years of severe <a href="../../wp/d/Drought.htm" title="Drought">drought</a> in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 have held back output growth substantially, <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a> remains one of the largest employers, accounting for 22% of all jobs according to the 1991 census.<p>Iran has also developed a <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> nanotechnology, and <!--del_lnk--> pharmaceuticals industry. For energy, it currently relies on conventional methods, but as of March 2006, uranium refinement, the last major hurdle to developing nuclear power, was revealed to have taken place.<p>Iran&#39;s major commercial partners are <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>.

      <p>Iran is a diverse country consisting of people of many religions and ethnic backgrounds cemented by the <!--del_lnk--> Persian culture. <!--del_lnk--> Persians, the founders of <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Persia, constitute the majority of the <!--del_lnk--> population. Seventy percent of present-day Iranians are <!--del_lnk--> Iranic peoples, native speakers of <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European languages who are descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan (<!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians) tribes that began migrating from Central Asia into what is now Iran in the second millennium BC. The majority of the population speaks one of the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian languages, including the official language, <!--del_lnk--> Persian (<!--del_lnk--> Farsi). The main ethnic groups are <!--del_lnk--> Persians (51%), <!--del_lnk--> Azeris (24%), <!--del_lnk--> Gilaki and Mazandarani (8%), <!--del_lnk--> Kurds (7%), <!--del_lnk--> Arabs (3%), <!--del_lnk--> Baluchi (2%), <!--del_lnk--> Lurs (2%), <!--del_lnk--> Turkmens (2%), <!--del_lnk--> Qashqai, <!--del_lnk--> Armenians, <!--del_lnk--> Persian Jews, <!--del_lnk--> Georgians, <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians, <!--del_lnk--> Circassians, <!--del_lnk--> Tats, <!--del_lnk--> Pashtuns and others (1%). The number of native speakers of Persian in Iran is estimated at around 40 million.

      <p>Iranian culture has long been the predominant culture of the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, with <!--del_lnk--> Persian considered the language of intellectuals during much of the second millennium AD. Nearly all philosophical, scientific, or literary work of the Islamic empires was written in or translated to Persian, as well as Arabic. The <!--del_lnk--> Islamic conquest of Iran during the first half of the seventh century began a synthesis of the Arabic and Iranian tongues. By the tenth century, this cultural diffusion threatened to erase native Persian entirely, as many Persian writers, scientists, and scholars elected to write in the language of the Qur&#39;an (Arabic) (see <!--del_lnk--> List of Iranian scientists and scholars). Moreover, Islamic caliphate was largely disdainful towards Persians and Persian culture more specifically during the rule of first caliphate dynasty of <!--del_lnk--> Umayyads who vividly sought Arabic supremacy in all aspects of their empire. This prompted <!--del_lnk--> Ferdowsi to compose the <i><!--del_lnk--> Shahnameh</i> (Persian: <i>Book of Kings</i>), Iran&#39;s national epic from its legendary prehistoric nascence till its defeat at the battle of <i>al-Q&#x101;disiyyah</i>. It was written entirely in Persian. This gave rise to a strong reassertion of Iranian national identity, and is in part responsible for the continued existence of Persian as a separate language.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">
