      <p>The name &quot;Israel&quot; is rooted in the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew Bible, <!--del_lnk--> Genesis 32:28, where <!--del_lnk--> Jacob is renamed Israel after successfully wrestling with an angel of God. The biblical nation fathered by Jacob was then called &quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Children of Israel&quot; or the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Israelites.&quot;<p>The modern country was named <i>State of Israel</i>, and its citizens are referred to as <i>Israelis</i> in English. Other rejected name proposals included <i><!--del_lnk--> Eretz Israel</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Zion</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Judea</i> and <i>New Judea</i>. The use of the term Israeli to refer to a citizen of Israel was decided by the Government of Israel in the weeks immediately after independence and announced by <!--del_lnk--> Foreign Minister <!--del_lnk--> Moshe Shertok.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The first historical record of the word &quot;Israel&quot; comes from an Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> stele documenting <!--del_lnk--> military campaigns in <!--del_lnk--> Canaan. Although this stele which referred to a people (the <!--del_lnk--> determinative for &#39;<a href="../../wp/c/Country.htm" title="Country">country</a>&#39; was absent) is dated to approximately 1211 <!--del_lnk--> BCE, Jewish tradition holds that the <!--del_lnk--> Land of Israel has been a Jewish <!--del_lnk--> Holy Land and <!--del_lnk--> Promised land for three thousand years. The land of Israel holds a special place in Jewish religious obligations, encompassing Judaism&#39;s most important sites (such as the remains of the <!--del_lnk--> First and <!--del_lnk--> Second Temples of the Jewish <!--del_lnk--> King, <!--del_lnk--> Solomon). Connected with these two versions of the temple are religiously significant rites which stand as the origin for many aspects of modern Judaism. Starting around the eleventh century <!--del_lnk--> BCE, the first of a series of <!--del_lnk--> Jewish kingdoms and states established intermittent rule over the <!--del_lnk--> region that lasted more than a <!--del_lnk--> millennium.<div class="thumb tright">

In particular, the failure of the <!--del_lnk--> Bar Kokhba&#39;s revolt against the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 132 CE resulted in a large-scale expulsion of Jews. It was during this time that the Romans gave the name <!--del_lnk--> Syria Palaestina to the geographic area, in an attempt to erase Jewish ties to the land. Nevertheless, the Jewish presence in Palestine remained constant. The main Jewish population shifted from the <!--del_lnk--> Judea region to the <!--del_lnk--> Galilee. The <!--del_lnk--> Mishnah and <!--del_lnk--> Jerusalem Talmud, two of Judaism&#39;s most important religious texts, were composed in the region during this period. The <!--del_lnk--> Muslims conquered the land from the <a href="../../wp/b/Byzantine_Empire.htm" title="Byzantine Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> in 638 <!--del_lnk--> CE. The <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew <!--del_lnk--> niqqud was invented in <!--del_lnk--> Tiberias during this time. The area was ruled by the <!--del_lnk--> Omayyads, then by the <!--del_lnk--> Abbasids, <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders, the <!--del_lnk--> Kharezmians and <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, before becoming part of the empire of the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks (1260-1516) and the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1517.<p><a id="Zionism_and_Immigration" name="Zionism_and_Immigration"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Zionism and Immigration</span></h3>

      <p>Jews living in the <!--del_lnk--> Diaspora have sought to emigrate into Israel throughout the centuries. For example, in 1141 <!--del_lnk--> Yehuda Halevi issued a call to the Jews to emigrate to Eretz Israel and eventually died in Jerusalem. In 1267, <!--del_lnk--> Nahmanides settled in Jerusalem and since then a continual Jewish presence in Jerusalem has been maintained. <!--del_lnk--> Yosef Karo immigrated to the large Jewish community in <!--del_lnk--> Safed in 1535. Waves of immigration also occurred, for example in the years 1209-1211, the &quot;aliyah of the Rabbis of France and England&quot; to <!--del_lnk--> Acre became famous as in 1258 and 1266. In 1260, <!--del_lnk--> Yechiel of Paris emigrated to Acre along with his son and a large group of followers. Small waves of immigration occurred during the 18th century out of religious motives, famously <!--del_lnk--> Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk and 300 of his followers, <!--del_lnk--> Judah he-Hasid and over 1000 disciples, and over five hundred disciples (and their families) of the <!--del_lnk--> Vilna Gaon known as <!--del_lnk--> Perushim. Waves of rabbinical students immigrated in 1808-1809, settling in <!--del_lnk--> Tiberias, <!--del_lnk--> Safed and then in <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>.<p>In 1860, the old Jewish community in Jerusalem started building neighborhoods outside the walls of the Old City (the first one being <!--del_lnk--> Mishkenot Sha&rsquo;ananim). In 1878, the first modern agricultural settlement was founded in the form of <!--del_lnk--> Petah Tikva.<p>The first big wave of modern immigration to Israel, or <i>Aliyah</i> (<big>&#x5E2;&#x5DC;&#x5D9;&#x5D9;&#x5D4;</big>) started in 1881 as Jews fled growing persecution, or followed the <!--del_lnk--> Socialist <a href="../../wp/z/Zionism.htm" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> ideas of <!--del_lnk--> Moses Hess and others of &quot;redemption of the soil.&quot; Jews bought land from Ottoman and individual Arab landholders. After Jews established agricultural settlements, tensions erupted between the Jews and Arabs.<p><!--del_lnk--> Theodor Herzl (1860&ndash;1904), an <!--del_lnk--> Austro-Hungarian Jew, founded the <!--del_lnk--> Zionist movement. In 1896, he published <i><!--del_lnk--> Der Judenstaat</i> (<i>The Jewish State</i>), in which he called for the establishment of a national Jewish state. The following year he helped convene the first <!--del_lnk--> World Zionist Congress.<p>The establishment of Zionism led to the <!--del_lnk--> Second Aliyah (1904&ndash;1914) with the influx of around forty thousand Jews. In 1917, the British Foreign Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Arthur J. Balfour issued the <!--del_lnk--> Balfour Declaration that &quot;view[ed] with favour the establishment in <!--del_lnk--> Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.&quot; In <!--del_lnk--> 1920, Palestine became a <a href="../../wp/l/League_of_Nations.htm" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> <!--del_lnk--> mandate administered by Britain.<p>Jewish immigration resumed in <!--del_lnk--> third (1919&ndash;1923) and <!--del_lnk--> fourth (1924&ndash;1929) waves after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a>. A <!--del_lnk--> massacre of Jews by Arabs in 1929 killed 133 Jews, including 67 in <!--del_lnk--> Hebron.<p>The rise of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazism</a> in 1933 led to a <!--del_lnk--> fifth wave of Aliyah. The Jews in the region increased from 11% of the population in 1922 to 30% by 1940. 28% of the land was already bought and owned by Zionist organizations plus additional private land owned by Jews. The southern half of the country is the barren and mostly empty <!--del_lnk--> Negev desert. The subsequent <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> in Europe led to <!--del_lnk--> additional immigration from other parts of Europe. By the end of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the number of Jews in Palestine was approximately 600,000.<p>In 1939, the British introduced a <!--del_lnk--> White Paper of 1939, which limited Jewish immigration over the course of the war to 75,000 and restricted purchase of land by Jews, perhaps in response to the <!--del_lnk--> 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. The White Paper was seen as a betrayal by the Jewish community and Zionists, who perceived it as being in conflict with the <!--del_lnk--> Balfour Declaration. The Arabs were not entirely satisfied either, as they wanted Jewish immigration halted completely. However, the White Paper guided British policy until the end of the term of their Mandate. As a result, many Jews fleeing to Palestine to avoid Nazi persecution and the <a href="../../wp/t/The_Holocaust.htm" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> were intercepted and returned to Europe. Two specific examples of this policy involved the ships <i><!--del_lnk--> Struma</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Exodus</i> (carrying Holocaust survivors in <!--del_lnk--> 1947).<p>Attempts by Jews to circumvent the blockade and flee Europe became known as <!--del_lnk--> Aliya Beth.<p><a id="Jewish_Underground_groups" name="Jewish_Underground_groups"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Jewish Underground groups</span></h3>

      <p>Many Arabs, opposed to the Balfour Declaration, the mandate, and the Jewish National Home, instigated riots and <!--del_lnk--> pogroms against Jews in Jerusalem, Hebron, Jaffa, and Haifa. As a result of the 1921 Arab attacks, the <!--del_lnk--> Haganah was formed to protect Jewish settlements. The Haganah was mostly defensive in nature, which among other things caused several members to split off and form the militant group <!--del_lnk--> Irgun (initially known as Hagana Bet) in 1931. The Irgun adhered to a much more active approach, which included attacks and initiation of armed actions against the British, such as attacking British military headquarters, the <!--del_lnk--> King David Hotel, which killed 91 people. Haganah, on the other hand, often preferred restraint. A further split occurred when <!--del_lnk--> Avraham Stern left the Irgun to form <!--del_lnk--> Lehi, (also known as the <i>Stern Gang</i>) which was much more extreme in its methods. Unlike the Irgun, they refused any co-operation with the British during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> and even attempted to work with the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazi">Nazis</a> to secure European Jewry&#39;s emigration to Palestine.<p>These groups had an enormous impact on events and procedures in the period preceding the <!--del_lnk--> 1948 Arab-Israeli War, such as <!--del_lnk--> Aliya Beth (the clandestine immigration from Europe), the forming of the <!--del_lnk--> Israel Defense Forces, and the withdrawal of the British, as well as to a great degree forming the foundation of the <!--del_lnk--> political parties which exist in Israel today.<p><a id="Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel" name="Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Establishment of the State of Israel</span></h3>

      <p>In 1947, following increasing levels of violence from groups such as Irgun and Lehi, uncontrollable immigration from Europe and general war-weariness, the British government decided to withdraw from the <!--del_lnk--> Palestine Mandate. The <!--del_lnk--> UN General Assembly approved the <!--del_lnk--> 1947 UN Partition Plan dividing the territory into two states, with the Jewish area consisting of roughly 55% of the land, and the Arab area roughly 45%. <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was planned to be an international region administered by the UN to avoid conflict over its status.<p>Immediately following the adoption of the Partition Plan by the UN General Assembly on <!--del_lnk--> November 29, <!--del_lnk--> 1947, <!--del_lnk--> David Ben-Gurion tentatively accepted the partition, while the Arab League rejected it. The Arab Higher Committee immediately ordered a violent three-day <!--del_lnk--> strike on Jewish civilians, attacking buildings, shops, and neighborhoods, and prompting counter-attacks organized by underground Jewish militias like the <!--del_lnk--> Lehi and <!--del_lnk--> Irgun. These attacks soon turned into widespread fighting between Arabs and Jews, this civil war being the first &quot;phase&quot; of the 1948 War of Independence.<p>The State of Israel was proclaimed on <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1948, one day before the expiry of the <!--del_lnk--> Palestine Mandate.<p>Israel was admitted as a member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1949.<p><a name="1948_War_of_Independence_and_migration"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1948 War of Independence and migration</span></h3>
      <p>Following the State of Israel&#39;s establishment, the armies of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> joined the fighting and began the second phase of the 1948 Arab &ndash; Israeli War. From the north, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, were all but stopped relatively close to the borders. Jordanian forces, invading from the east, captured East <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and laid siege on the city&#39;s west. However, forces of the <!--del_lnk--> Haganah successfully stopped most invading forces, and <!--del_lnk--> Irgun forces halted Egyptian encroachment from the south. At the beginning of June, the <!--del_lnk--> UN declared a one-month ceasefire during which the <!--del_lnk--> Israel Defense Forces were officially formed. After numerous months of war, a ceasefire was declared in 1949 and temporary borders, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Green Line, were instituted. Israel had gained an additional 26% of the Mandate territory west of the <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan_River.htm" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>. Jordan, for its part, held the large mountainous areas of <!--del_lnk--> Judea and <!--del_lnk--> Samaria, which became known as the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>. Egypt took control of a small strip of land along the coast, which became known as the <a href="../../wp/g/Gaza_Strip.htm" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>.<p>During and after the war, then Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> David Ben-Gurion set about establishing order by dismantling the <!--del_lnk--> Palmach and underground organizations like the <!--del_lnk--> Irgun and <!--del_lnk--> Lehi. Those two groups were classified as terror organizations after the murder of <!--del_lnk--> Folke Bernadotte, a <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> diplomat.<p>Large numbers of the Arab population fled the newly-created Jewish State during the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian exodus, which is referred to by many Palestinian groups and individuals as the <i>Nakba</i> (<a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: <big>&#x627;&#x644;&#x646;&#x643;&#x628;&#x629;</big>), meaning &quot;disaster&quot; or &quot;cataclysm&quot;. Some Israeli historians suggest that the Palestinians fled because of orders from Arab generals. Many Palestinians left under the belief that the Arab armies would prevail and they would return. Moreover, &quot;<i>Arab inhabitants of the State of Israel</i>&quot; were offered &quot;<i>full and equal citizenship and due representation in all its provisional and permanent institutions</i>&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel; many, however, refused.<p>Estimates of the final refugee count range from 400,000 to 900,000 with the official United Nations count at 711,000. The continuing conflict between Israel and the Arab world resulted in a lasting displacement that persists to this day.<p>Immigration of Holocaust survivors and Jewish refugees from Arab lands doubled Israel&#39;s population within a year of independence. Over the following years approximately 850,000 <!--del_lnk--> Sephardi and <!--del_lnk--> Mizrahi Jews fled or were expelled from surrounding Arab countries and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>. Of these, about 600,000 settled in Israel; the remainder went to Europe and the Americas (see <!--del_lnk--> Jewish exodus from Arab lands).<p><a name="1950s_and_1960s"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1950s and 1960s</span></h3>

      <p>On the political field, tensions once again arose between Israel and her neighbors in May 1967. Syria, Jordan, and Egypt had been hinting at war , and Egypt expelled <!--del_lnk--> UN Peacekeeping Forces from the <a href="../../wp/g/Gaza_Strip.htm" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a>. When Egypt closed the strategic <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Tiran to Israeli vessels, Israel deemed it a <!--del_lnk--> casus belli for pre-emptively attacking Egypt on <!--del_lnk--> June 5. In the ensuing <!--del_lnk--> Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Israel defeated the armies of three large Arab states and decimated their <!--del_lnk--> air forces. Territorially, Israel conquered the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a>, Gaza Strip, <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula, and <!--del_lnk--> Golan Heights. The <!--del_lnk--> Green Line of 1949 became the armistice boundary between Israel and the <!--del_lnk--> Occupied Territories (called by Israel the <!--del_lnk--> Disputed Territories). The Sinai was later returned to Egypt following the signing of a peace treaty.<p>In 1967, Israeli aircraft <!--del_lnk--> attacked the USS <i>Liberty</i>, killing 34 American servicemen. American and Israeli investigations into the incident concluded that the attack was a tragic accident involving confusion over the identity of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Liberty</i>.<p>In 1969, <!--del_lnk--> Golda Meir, Israel&#39;s first and, to date, only female prime minister was elected.<p><a name="1970s"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1970s</span></h3>
      <p>Between 1968 and 1972, a period known as the <!--del_lnk--> War of Attrition, numerous scuffles erupted along the border between Israel and Syria and Egypt. Furthermore, in the early 1970s, <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian groups embarked on an unprecedented wave of attacks against Israel and <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> targets in other countries. The climax of this wave occurred at the <!--del_lnk--> 1972 Munich Olympic Games, when, in the <!--del_lnk--> Munich massacre, Palestinian militants held hostage and killed members of the Israeli delegation. Israel responded with <!--del_lnk--> Operation Wrath of God, in which agents of <!--del_lnk--> Mossad assassinated most of those who were involved in the massacre.<p>Finally, on <!--del_lnk--> October 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1973, the day in 1973 of the Jewish <!--del_lnk--> Yom Kippur fast, the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israel. However, despite early successes against an unprepared Israeli army, Egypt and Syria failed to accomplish their goal of regaining the territories lost in 1967. A number of years of relative calm ensued, which fostered the environment in which Israel and Egypt could make peace.<p>In 1974, <!--del_lnk--> Yitzhak Rabin, with Meir&#39;s resignation, became Israel&#39;s fifth prime minister. Then, in the 1977 <!--del_lnk--> Knesset elections, the Ma&#39;arach, the ruling party since 1948, created a storm by leaving the government. The new <!--del_lnk--> Likud party, led by <!--del_lnk--> Menachem Begin, became the new ruling party.<p>Then, in November of that year, Egyptian President <!--del_lnk--> Anwar Sadat, making a historic visit to the Jewish State, spoke before the <!--del_lnk--> Knesset: the first recognition of Israel by its Arab neighbors. Military reserves officers formed the <!--del_lnk--> Peace Now movement to encourage this effort. Following the visit, the two nations conducted negotiations which led to the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Camp David Accords. In March 1979, Begin and Sadat signed the <!--del_lnk--> Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty in <!--del_lnk--> Washington, DC. As laid out in the treaty, Israel withdrew from the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula and evacuated the settlements established there during the 1970s. It was also agreed to lend <!--del_lnk--> autonomy to <!--del_lnk--> Palestinians across the <!--del_lnk--> Green Line.<p><a name="1980s"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1980s</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> First Intifadah then broke out in 1987 and was accompanied by waves of violence in the <!--del_lnk--> Occupied Territories. Following the outbreak, Shamir once again was elected prime minister, in 1988.<p><a name="1990s"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1990s</span></h3>
      <p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf War, <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> hit Israel with thirty-nine <!--del_lnk--> Scud missiles, although Israel was not a member of the coalition and was not involved in the fighting. The missiles didn&#39;t kill Israeli citizens directly, but there were some deaths from wrong use of the gas masks provided, one Israeli died from a <!--del_lnk--> heart attack following a hit, and one Israeli died from a <!--del_lnk--> Patriot missile hit. During the war, Israel also provided gas masks for the Palestinians in the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Gaza. The PLO, however, supported <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein. Palestinians in the <a href="../../wp/w/West_Bank.htm" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Gaza marched and famously stood on their rooftops while Scud missiles were falling and cheered <!--del_lnk--> Saddam Hussein calling for him to bomb Israel with chemical weapons. Ultimately, Palestinians also used the gas masks against Israeli use of <!--del_lnk--> tear gas in the coming years.<p>The early 1990s were marked by the beginning of a massive <!--del_lnk--> immigration of Soviet Jews, who, according to the <!--del_lnk--> Law of Return, were entitled to become Israeli citizens upon arrival. About 380,000 arrived in 1990-91 alone. Although initially favouring the right, the new immigrants became the target of an aggressive election campaign by <!--del_lnk--> Labor, which blamed their employment and housing problems on the ruling <!--del_lnk--> Likud. As a result, in the 1992 elections the immigrants voted <i>en masse</i> for Labor, letting the left achieve a 61-59 majority in the 1992 Knesset elections.<p>Following the elections, <!--del_lnk--> Yitzhak Rabin became prime minister, forming a left-wing government coalition. During the election campaign his Labor party promised Israelis a significant improvement in personal security and achievement of a comprehensive peace with the Arabs &quot;within six to nine months&quot; after the elections. By the end of 1993 the government abandoned the framework of <!--del_lnk--> Madrid and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Oslo Accords with the <!--del_lnk--> PLO. In 1994, <a href="../../wp/j/Jordan.htm" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> became the second of Israel&#39;s neighbours to make peace with it.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The initial wide public support for the Oslo Accords began to wane as Israel was struck by an unprecedented wave of attacks supported by the militant <!--del_lnk--> Hamas group, which opposed the accords. Public support slipped even further. On November 4, 1995, a Jewish nationalist militant named <!--del_lnk--> Yigal Amir <!--del_lnk--> assassinated Rabin.<p>Public dismay with the assassination created a backlash against Oslo opponents and significantly boosted the chances of <!--del_lnk--> Shimon Peres, Rabin&#39;s successor and Oslo architect, to win the upcoming 1996 elections. However, a new wave of suicide bombings combined with Arafat&#39;s statements extolling the Muslim nationalist militant <!--del_lnk--> Yahya Ayyash, made the public mood swing once again and in May 1996 Peres narrowly lost to his challenger from <!--del_lnk--> Likud, <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Netanyahu.<p>Although seen as a hard-liner opposing the Oslo Accords, Netanyahu withdrew from <!--del_lnk--> Hebron and signed the <!--del_lnk--> Wye River Memorandum giving wider control to the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian National Authority. During Netanyahu&#39;s tenure, Israel experienced a lull in attacks against Israel&#39;s civilian population by Palestinian groups, but his government fell in 1999.

      <p>Barak initiated unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000. This process was intended to frustrate <!--del_lnk--> Hezbollah attacks on Israel by forcing them to cross Israel&#39;s border. Barak and <!--del_lnk--> Yassir Arafat once again conducted negotiations with <!--del_lnk--> President Clinton at the <!--del_lnk--> July 2000 Camp David summit. However, the talks failed. Barak offered to form a <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian State initially on 73% of the West Bank and 100% of the Gaza Strip.

In response, Israel began <!--del_lnk--> Operation Summer Rains, which consisted of heavy bombardment of <!--del_lnk--> Hamas targets as well as bridges, roads, and the only power station in Gaza. Israel has also deployed troops into the territory. Israel&rsquo;s critics have accused it of disproportionate use of force and <!--del_lnk--> collective punishment of innocent civilians and not giving <!--del_lnk--> diplomacy a chance. Israel argues that they have no other option to get their soldier back and put an end to the rocket attacks into Israel.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict refers to the military conflict in <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and northern Israel, primarily between <!--del_lnk--> Hezbollah and Israel, which started on <!--del_lnk--> 12 July <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The conflict began with a cross-border Hezbollah raid and shelling, which resulted in the capture of two and killing of three Israeli soldiers. Israel held the Lebanese government responsible for the attack, as it was carried out from Lebanese territory, and initiated an air and naval <!--del_lnk--> blockade, <!--del_lnk--> airstrikes across much of the country, and ground incursions into <!--del_lnk--> southern Lebanon. Hezbollah continuously launched rocket attacks into northern Israel and engaged the Israeli Army on the ground with hit-and-run guerrilla attacks. A ceasefire came into effect at 05:00 <!--del_lnk--> UTC, <!--del_lnk--> 14 August <!--del_lnk--> 2006, although violations of the ceasefire have occurred from both sides. The conflict killed over one thousand Lebanese civilians, 440 Hezbollah militants, and 119 Israeli soldiers, as well as forty-four Israeli civilians, and caused massive damage to the civilian infrastructure and cities of Lebanon and damaged thousands of buildings across northern Israel, many of which were completely destroyed.<p><a id="Geography_and_climate" name="Geography_and_climate"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Geography and climate</span></h2>

The Supreme Court serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and as the body for a separate institution known as the High Court of Justice (HCOJ). The HCOJ has the unique responsibility of addressing petitions presented to the Court by individual citizens.

      <p>Israel&#39;s military consists of a unified <!--del_lnk--> Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known in <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> by the acronym <i>Tzahal</i> (<big>&#x5E6;&#x5D4;&quot;&#x5DC;</big>). Historically, there have been no separate Israeli military services. The Navy and <!--del_lnk--> Air Force are subordinate to the Army. There are other paramilitary agencies that deal with different aspects of Israel&#39;s security (such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Magav</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Shin Bet</i>). The IDF was based on paramilitary underground armies, chiefly <!--del_lnk--> Haganah.<p>The IDF is one of the <!--del_lnk--> best funded military forces in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and ranks among the most battle-trained armed forces in the world, having been involved in five major wars and numerous border conflicts. In terms of personnel, the IDF&#39;s main resource is the training quality of its soldiers and expert institutions, rather than sheer numbers of soldiers. It also relies heavily on high-tech weapons systems, some developed and manufactured in Israel for its specific needs, and others imported (largely from the United States).<p>Most Israelis (males and females) are <!--del_lnk--> drafted into the military at age 18. Also immigrants sometimes volunteer to join the IDF. An exception are <!--del_lnk--> Israeli Arabs, most of whom are not conscripted because of a possible conflict of interests, due to the possibility of war with neighboring Arab states. Other exceptions are those who cannot serve because of injury or disability, women who declare themselves married, or those who are religiously observant. Compulsory service is three years for men, and two years for women. <!--del_lnk--> Circassians and <!--del_lnk--> Bedouin also actively enlist in the IDF. Since 1956, <!--del_lnk--> Druze men have been conscripted in the same way as Jewish men, at the request of the Druze community. Men studying full-time in religious institutions can get a deferment from conscription. Most <!--del_lnk--> <i>Haredi</i> Jews extend these deferments until they are too old to be conscripted, a practice that has fueled much controversy in Israel.<p>While Israeli Arabs are not conscripted, they are allowed to enlist voluntarily. This is the same policy as the Bedouin and many non-Jewish citizens of Israel.<p>Following compulsory service, Israeli men become part of the IDF reserve forces, and are usually required to serve several weeks every year as reservists until their forties.<p><a id="Nuclear_capability" name="Nuclear_capability"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Nuclear capability</span></h3>
      <p>There is much speculation regarding the nuclear capabilities of Israel. Since the middle of the twentieth century, the <!--del_lnk--> Negev Nuclear Research Centre has been operational and capable of producing <!--del_lnk--> weapons grade <!--del_lnk--> nuclear material. This site has never been under the watch of the <!--del_lnk--> International Atomic Energy Agency, so it is therefore widely believed that Israel has a significant stockpile of nuclear weapons. The IAEA has stated outright that it believes Israel &quot;to be a state possessing nuclear weapons,&quot; but the Israeli government has never confirmed or denied this assertion. Although size of nuclear arsenal is debated, it is generally accepted that Israel possesses more than one hundred devices. Israel is not a signatory of the <!--del_lnk--> Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<p>The supposed number of stationary nuclear weapons in 2002 is 200; Great Britain has 190.<p>Data on Israeli nuclear deployment capability is much more freely available than hard data on their nuclear program. Israel leads the Middle East in <!--del_lnk--> medium-range ballistic missile development. The <!--del_lnk--> Jericho series of ballistic missile was begun in the 1970s, with three major designs built to date; Jericho I, II, and III. The Jericho II series has been in service since the mid 1980s and has a confirmed range of 1500&nbsp;km. The latest missile design, the Jericho III, has a conservative range estimate of 4500&nbsp;km.<p>In addition to ballistic missile technology, Israel maintains a fleet of <!--del_lnk--> Dolphin class submarines, widely suspected of having nuclear launch capability.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former <!--del_lnk--> USSR topped 750,000 during the period 1989&ndash;1999, bringing the population of Israel from the former <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to one million, one-sixth of the total population, many of them highly educated, adding scientific and professional expertise of substantial value for the economy&#39;s future.
