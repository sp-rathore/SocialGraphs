      <p>The <b>Ivory-billed Woodpecker</b> (<i>Campephilus principalis</i>) is a very large and extremely rare or extinct member of the <a href="../../wp/w/Woodpecker.htm" title="Woodpecker">woodpecker</a> <a href="../../wp/s/Scientific_classification.htm" title="Scientific classification">family</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Picidae. It is officially listed as an <!--del_lnk--> endangered species, but by the end of the 20th century had widely been considered <a href="../../wp/e/Extinction.htm" title="Extinction">extinct</a>.<p>Reports of at least one male bird in <!--del_lnk--> Arkansas in 2004 and 2005 were reported in April 2005 by a team led by the <!--del_lnk--> Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2005). If confirmed, this would make the Ivory-billed Woodpecker a <!--del_lnk--> lazarus species, a species that is rediscovered alive after being considered extinct for some time. However, despite the highly publicized announcement of its rediscovery, skepticism about the reported sightings has been growing, with a number of prominent experts questioning the evidence.<p>In June 2006, a $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to the discovery of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker nest, roost or feeding site.<p>In late September 2006, a team of <!--del_lnk--> ornithologists from <!--del_lnk--> Auburn University and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Windsor published a paper detailing suggestive evidence for the existence of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers along the <!--del_lnk--> Choctawhatchee River in northwest <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> (Hill <i>et al.</i>, 2006). To date, the group has been unable to obtain either photographic or material evidence of these birds, and their findings remain inconclusive. Some speculate that the focus should be on protection of habitat rather than further intrusive studies.<p>

      <p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is one of the largest woodpecker species in the world. The largest is the closely related <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Woodpecker (<i>C. imperialis</i>) of western <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, another rare species which is very likely to be extinct. The Ivory-billed measures from 48 to 53&nbsp;cm (19 to 21&nbsp;in) in length and 450 to 570&nbsp;g (1.0 to 1.25&nbsp;lb) in weight, with short legs and feet ending in large, curved claws.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The bird is shiny blue-black with extensive white markings on its neck and on both the upper and lower trailing edges of its wings. It has a pure white bill and displays a prominent top crest, red in the male and black in the female. These characteristics distinguish it from the darker-billed <!--del_lnk--> Pileated Woodpecker. Like all woodpeckers, it has a strong and straight chisel-like bill and a long, mobile, hard-tipped, barbed <!--del_lnk--> tongue. Its drum is a single or double rap, and its alarm call, a <i>kent</i> or <i>hant</i>, sounds like a toy <a href="../../wp/t/Trumpet.htm" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a> repeated in a series or as a double note.<p><a id="Habitat_and_diet" name="Habitat_and_diet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Habitat and diet</span></h2>
      <p>Ivory-billeds are known to prefer thick hardwood swamps and pine <a href="../../wp/f/Forest.htm" title="Forest">forests</a>, with large amounts of dead and decaying <a href="../../wp/t/Tree.htm" title="Tree">trees</a>. Prior to the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, much of the <!--del_lnk--> Southern United States was covered in vast tracts of <!--del_lnk--> primeval hardwood forests that were suitable as habitat for the bird. At that time, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker ranged from east <!--del_lnk--> Texas to <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina, and from southern <!--del_lnk--> Illinois to <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. After the Civil War, the <!--del_lnk--> timber industry <!--del_lnk--> deforested millions of acres in the South, leaving only sparse isolated tracts of suitable habitat.<p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker feeds mainly on the <!--del_lnk--> larvae of wood-boring <a href="../../wp/b/Beetle.htm" title="Beetle">beetles</a>, but also eats <a href="../../wp/s/Seed.htm" title="Seed">seeds</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Fruit.htm" title="Fruit">fruit</a>, and other <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>. The bird uses its enormous white bill to hammer, wedge, and peel the bark off dead trees to find the insects. Surprisingly, these birds need about 25&nbsp;km&sup2; (10&nbsp;square miles) per pair so they can find enough food to feed their young and themselves. Hence, they occur at low densities even in healthy populations. The more common <!--del_lnk--> Pileated Woodpecker may compete for food with this species.<p><a id="Breeding_biology" name="Breeding_biology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Breeding biology</span></h2>
      <p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker is thought to pair for life. Pairs are also known to travel together. These paired birds will mate every year between January and May. Before they have their young, they excavate a nest in a dead or partially dead tree about 8&ndash;15&nbsp;m up from the ground. Usually two to five <!--del_lnk--> eggs are laid and incubated for 3 to 5&nbsp;weeks. Both parents sit on the eggs and are involved in taking care of the chicks, with the male taking sole responsibility at night. They feed the chicks for months. About five weeks after the young are born, they learn to fly. Even after the young are able to fly, the parents will continue feeding them for another two months. The family will eventually split up in late fall or early winter.<p><a id="Status" name="Status"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Status</span></h2>
      <p>Heavy logging activity exacerbated by <!--del_lnk--> hunting by collectors decimated the population of Ivory-billed Woodpeckers in the late 1800s. It was generally considered extinct in the 1920s, when a pair turned up in Florida, only to be shot for specimens.<p>By 1938, an estimated 20 individuals remained in the wild, located in the old-growth forest called the Singer Tract in <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana, where logging rights were held by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company. The company brushed aside pleas from four Southern governors and the <!--del_lnk--> National Audubon Society that the tract be publicly purchased and set aside as a reserve, and clearcut the forest. By 1944 the last known Ivory-billed Woodpecker, a female, was gone from the cut-over tract (<i>Smithsonian</i> p 98).<p><a id="Reported_sightings:_1940s_to_1990s" name="Reported_sightings:_1940s_to_1990s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Reported sightings: 1940s to 1990s</span></h3>
      <p>The Ivory-billed Woodpecker was listed as an endangered species on <!--del_lnk--> March 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1967, though the only evidence of its existence at the time was a possible recording of its call made in East Texas. The last reported sighting of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuban">Cuban</a> subspecies (<i>C. p. bairdii</i>), after a long interval, was in 1987; it has not been seen since.<p>Two tantalizing photos were given to <!--del_lnk--> LSU <!--del_lnk--> museum director <!--del_lnk--> George Lowery in 1971 by a source who wished to remain anonymous but who came forward in 2005 as outdoorsman <!--del_lnk--> Fielding Lewis.<p>The photos, taken with a cheap <!--del_lnk--> Instamatic camera, show what appears to be a male Ivory-Billed perched on the trunks of two different trees in the <!--del_lnk--> Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird&#39;s distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos - taken from a distance - are very grainy. Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the <!--del_lnk--> American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds, believing that the bird seen is either a misidentifed <!--del_lnk--> Pileated, or - seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos - a mounted specimen.<p>There were numerous unconfirmed reports of the bird,  but many <!--del_lnk--> ornithologists believed the species had been wiped out completely, and it was assessed as &quot;extinct&quot; by the <!--del_lnk--> International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1994. This assessment was later altered to &quot;critically endangered&quot; on the grounds that the species could still be extant.<p><a name="2002_Pearl_River_expedition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2002 Pearl River expedition</span></h3>
      <p>In 1999, there was an unconfirmed sighting of a pair of birds in the <!--del_lnk--> Pearl River region of southeast Louisiana by a forestry student, David Kulivan, which some experts considered very compelling. In a 2002 expedition in the forests, swamps, and <!--del_lnk--> bayous of the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area by <!--del_lnk--> LSU, biologists spent 30 days searching for the bird.<p>In the afternoon of <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, after ten days, a rapping sound similar to the &quot;double knock&quot; made by the Ivory-billed Woodpecker was heard and recorded. The exact source of the sound was not found because of the swampy terrain, but signs of active woodpeckers were found (i.e., scaled bark and large tree cavities). The expedition was inconclusive, however, as it was determined that the recorded sounds were likely gunshot echoes rather than the distinctive double rap of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker.<p>Since 2002, most of the attention in the search for the Ivory-billed Woodpecker has turned away from the Pearl River region, although several unconfirmed sightings were reported there in February 2006, see <!--del_lnk--> video clips.<p><a name="2004.2F2005_Arkansas_reports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2004/2005 Arkansas reports</span></h3>
      <p>A group of seventeen authors headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Cornell Lab of Ornithology reported the discovery of at least one Ivory-billed Woodpecker, a male, in the Big Woods area of Arkansas in 2004 and 2005, publishing the report in the journal <!--del_lnk--> <i>Science</i> on <!--del_lnk--> April 28, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2005).<p>One of the authors, who was kayaking in the <!--del_lnk--> Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, <!--del_lnk--> Monroe County, Arkansas, on <!--del_lnk--> February 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, reported on a website the sighting of an unusually large red-crested woodpecker. This report led to more intensive searches there and in the <!--del_lnk--> White River National Wildlife Refuge, undertaken in deepest secrecy for fear of a stampede of <!--del_lnk--> bird-watchers, by experienced observers over the next fourteen months. About fifteen sightings occurred during the period (seven of which were considered compelling enough to mention in the scientific article), possibly all of the same bird. The secrecy permitted <!--del_lnk--> The Nature Conservancy and <a href="../../wp/c/Cornell_University.htm" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a> to quietly buy up Ivory-billed habitat to add to the 120,000 acres (490 km&sup2;) of the Big Woods protected by the Conservancy.<p>A very large woodpecker was videotaped on <!--del_lnk--> April 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2004; its size, wing pattern at rest and in flight, and white plumage on its back between the wings were cited as evidence that the woodpecker sighted was an Ivory-billed Woodpecker. That same video included an earlier image of what was suggested to be such a bird perching on a <!--del_lnk--> Water Tupelo (<i><!--del_lnk--> Nyssa aquatica</i>).<p>The report also notes that drumming consistent with that of Ivory-billed Woodpecker had been heard in the region. It describes the potential for a thinly distributed population in the area, though no birds have been located away from the primary site. A current concern is that many bird enthusiasts will rush to the area in an attempt to catch a glimpse of this rare bird. Ornithologists and veteran birders tell of adult woodpeckers abandoning their nests and young out of alarm at the encroachments of overenthusiastic birdwatchers.<p><a id="Debate" name="Debate"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Debate</span></h3>
      <p>In June 2005, ornithologists at <!--del_lnk--> Yale University, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Kansas, and <!--del_lnk--> Florida Gulf Coast University submitted a scientific article skeptical of the initial reports of rediscovery. However, after reviewing new sound recordings from the <!--del_lnk--> White River of Arkansas supplied to them by the Cornell team that reported the rediscovery, they announced in August 2005 that they had concluded that the bird has indeed been rediscovered and withdrew their paper. Yale ornithologist <!--del_lnk--> Richard Prum stated:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;We were very skeptical of the first published reports, and thought that the previous data were not sufficient to support this startling conclusion. But the thrilling new sound recordings provide clear and convincing evidence that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker is not extinct.</blockquote>
      <p>In August 2005, despite the arguments for the existence of at least one Ivory-billed Woodpecker, questions about the evidence remained. Cornell could not say with absolute certainty that the sounds recorded in Arkansas were made by Ivory-bills.<p>Some skeptics, including Richard Prum, believe the video could have been of a <!--del_lnk--> Pileated Woodpecker.<p>In December 2005, Richard Prum&#39;s position was presented this way:<blockquote>
       <p>Prum, intrigued by some of the recordings taken in Arkansas&#39; Big Woods, said the evidence thus far is refutable.</blockquote>
      <p>On page 13 of the American Birding Association publication &quot;Winging It&quot; (Nov/Dec 2005), it was announced:<blockquote>
       <p>The ABA Checklist Committee has not changed the status of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker from Code 6 (EXTINCT) to another level that would reflect a small surviving population. The Committee is waiting for unequivocal proof that the species still exists.</blockquote>
      <p>In a commentary published in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Auk</i> in January 2006, Jerome Jackson expressed hus skepticism of the Ivory-bill evidence in no uncertain terms:<blockquote>
       <p>Prum, Robbins, Brett Benz, and I remain steadfast in our belief that the bird in the Luneau video is a normal Pileated Woodpecker. Others have independently come to the same conclusion, and publication of independent analyses may be forthcoming [...] For scientists to label sight reports and questionable photographs as &#39;proof&#39; of such an extraordinary record is delving into &#39;faith-based&#39; ornithology and doing a disservice to science.&quot; (Jackson, 2006a),</blockquote>
      <p>sparking off a side debate coming close to personal accusation (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2006b,c; Jackson, 2006b).<p>In March of 2006, a research team headed by <!--del_lnk--> David A. Sibley of Concord, MA published findings in the journal <i>Science</i>, saying that the videotape was most likely of a Pileated woodpecker, with mistakes having been made in the interpretation of its posture. They conclude that it lacks certain features of an Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and has others consistent with the Pileated (Sibley <i>at al.</i>, 2006) The original Cornell research team stood by their original findings in a response article in the same issue of <i>Science</i>, stating:<blockquote>
       <p>Claims that the bird in the Luneau video is a normal pileated woodpecker are based on misrepresentations of a pileated&#39;s underwing pattern, interpretation of video artifacts as plumage pattern, and inaccurate models of takeoff and flight behavior. These claims are contradicted by experimental data and fail to explain evidence in the Luneau video of white dorsal plumage, distinctive flight behaviour, and a perched woodpecker with white upper parts.&quot; (Fitzpatrick <i>et al.</i>, 2006a)</blockquote>
      <p>In May of 2006, it was announced that a large search effort led by the Cornell team had been suspended for the season with only a handful of unconfirmed, fleeting sightings to report. Apparently conservation officers plan to allow the public back into areas of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge that had been restricted upon the initial reported sightings. The search team reportedly plans to resume the search in autumn after the leaves fall, although at a somewhat smaller scale and possibly focusing on the White River region.<p><a name="2005.2F2006_Florida_reports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2005/2006 Florida reports</span></h3>
      <p>In September 2006, new claims that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker may not be extinct were released by a research group consisting of members from <!--del_lnk--> Auburn University in Alabama and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Windsor in Ontario. Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Geoff Hill of Auburn University and Dr. Daniel Mennill of the University of Windsor have revealed a collection of evidence that the birds may still exist in the cypress swamps of the <!--del_lnk--> Florida panhandle. Their evidence includes 14 sightings of the birds and 300 recordings of sounds that can be attributed to the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, but also includes tell-tale foraging signs and appropriately sized tree nest cavities (Hill <i>et al.</i>, 2006). This evidence remains inconclusive as it excludes the photographic or DNA evidence that many experts cite as necessary before the presence of the species can be confirmed. While Dr. Hill and Dr. Mennill are themselves convinced of the bird&#39;s existence in Florida, they are quick to acknowledge that they have not yet conclusively proven the species&#39; existence. The research team will undertake a more complete survey of the <!--del_lnk--> Choctawhatchee River in the coming winter season in hopes of obtaining photographic evidence of the bird&#39;s existence.<p><a id="Tourism" name="Tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tourism</span></h2>
      <p>In economically struggling east Arkansas, the speculation of a possible return of the Ivory-bill has served as a great source of economic exploitation, with tourist spending up 30%, primarily in and around the city of <!--del_lnk--> Brinkley, Arkansas. A woodpecker &quot;festival&quot;, a woodpecker hairstyle (a sort of mohawk with red, white, and black dye), and an &quot;Ivory-bill Burger&quot; have been featured locally. The lack of confirmed proof of the bird&#39;s existence, and the extremely small chance of actually seeing the bird even if it does exist (especially since the exact locations of the reported sightings are still guarded), have prevented the explosion in tourism some locals had anticipated.<p>Brinkley, Arkansas, hosted &quot;The Call of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker Celebration&quot; in February 2006. The celebration included exhibits, birding tours, educational presentations, a vendor market, and more.<p><a id="Other_facts" name="Other_facts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other facts</span></h2>
