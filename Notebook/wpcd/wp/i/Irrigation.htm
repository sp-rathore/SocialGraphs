      <p><b>Irrigation</b> is the artificial application of water to the soil. In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rainfall</a> in periods of drought, but also to protect plants against frost. Additionally irrigation helps to suppress weed growing in rice fields. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is sometimes referred to as <!--del_lnk--> dryland farming or as rainfed farming.<div class="thumb tright">

They are now found in Asia, the middle east and north Africa. The system comprises a network of vertical wells and gently sloping tunnels driven into the sides of cliffs and steep hills to tap groundwater. <p>The irrigation works of ancient <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the earliest dating from about 300 BCE, in the reign of King <!--del_lnk--> Pandukabhaya and under continuous development for the next thousand years, were one of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world. In addition to underground canals, the <!--del_lnk--> Sinhalese were the first to build completely artificial reservoirs to store water.

      <p>At the global scale 278.8 Mha (689 million acres) of agricultural land was equipped with irrigation infrastructure around the year 2000. About 68 % of the area equipped for irrigation is located in Asia, 17 % in America, 9 % in Europe, 5 % in Africa and 1 % in Oceania. The largest contiguous areas of high irrigation density are found in North India and Pakistan along the rivers Ganges and Indus, in the Hai He, Huang He and Yangtze basins in China, along the Nile river in Egypt and Sudan, in the Mississippi-Missouri river basin and in parts of California.

      <p>Localized irrigation is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it.

      <p>Water is delivered at or near the <!--del_lnk--> root zone of plants, drop by drop. This type of system can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation, if managed properly, since evaporation and runoff are minimized. In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with <!--del_lnk--> plastic mulch, further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer. The process is known as <i><!--del_lnk--> fertigation</i>. Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip system is operated for too long of a duration or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and relatively labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other types of systems, with the exception of low energy centre pivot systems and surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating <!--del_lnk--> emitters are available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a computerized set of <!--del_lnk--> valves. Both pressure regulation and filtration to remove particles are important. The tubes are usually black (or buried under soil or mulch) to prevent the growth of algae and to protect the <!--del_lnk--> polyethylene from degradation due to <!--del_lnk--> ultraviolet light. But drip irrigation can also be as low-tech as a porous <a href="../../wp/c/Clay.htm" title="Clay">clay</a> vessel sunk into the soil and occasionally filled from a hose or bucket. <!--del_lnk--> Subsurface drip irrigation has been used successfully on lawns, but it is more expensive than a more traditional sprinkler system. Surface drip systems are not cost-effective (or aesthetically pleasing) for lawns and <!--del_lnk--> golf courses. <!--del_lnk--> Jain Irrigation Systems, Chapin Watermatics, Eurodrip, Plastro Irrigation Systems are major manufacturer of Drip Irrigation Systems.<p><a id="Sprinkler_irrigation" name="Sprinkler_irrigation"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Sprinkler irrigation</span></h3>

      <p>In sprinkler or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system utilizing sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers is often referred to as a <i>solid-set</i> irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called <i>rotors</i> and are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 40 to 130 lbf/in&sup2; (275 to 900 kPa) and flows of 50 to 1200 US gal/min (3 to 76 L/s), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 0.5 to 1.9 inches (10 to 50 mm). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and <!--del_lnk--> logging.<p>Sprinklers may also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as <i>traveling sprinklers</i> may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these utilize a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a &quot;waterreel&quot; traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water. Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable. These cable-type travelers are definitely old technology and their use is limited in today&#39;s modern irrigation projects.<p><a id="Center_pivot_irrigation" name="Center_pivot_irrigation"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Centre pivot irrigation</span></h4>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Centre pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation consisting of several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminium) joined together and supported by <!--del_lnk--> trusses, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length. The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the centre of the arc. These systems are common in parts of the United States where terrain is flat.<div class="thumb tleft">

      </div>
      <p>Most centre pivot systems now have drops hanging from a u-shaped pipe called a <i>gooseneck</i> attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubbler&#39;s that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. The crops are planted in a circle to conform to the centre pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA (<!--del_lnk--> Low Energy Precision Application). Originally, most centre pivots were water powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems (<i><!--del_lnk--> T-L Irrigation</i>) and electric motor driven systems (<i>Lindsay</i>, <i>Reinke</i>, <i>Valley</i>, <i>Zimmatic</i>). Most systems today are driven by an electric motor mounted low on each span. This drives a reduction gearbox and transverse driveshafts transmit power to another reduction gearbox mounted behind each wheel. Precision controls, some with <!--del_lnk--> GPS location and remote computer monitoring, are now available.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A series of pipes, each with a wheel of about 1.5 m diameter permanently affixed to its midpoint and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together at one edge of a field. Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient water has been applied, the hose is removed and the remaining assembly rotated either by hand or with a purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers move 10m across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated until the opposite edge of the field is reached. This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more labor intensive to operate, and it is limited in the amount of water it can carry. Most systems utilize 4 or 5 inch diameter aluminium pipe. One feature of a lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily disconnected. They are most often used for small or oddly-shaped fields, such as those found in hilly or mountainous regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Sub-irrigation also sometimes called <i>seepage irrigation</i> has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high <!--del_lnk--> water tables. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow the <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> to be <!--del_lnk--> moistened from below the plants&#39; <!--del_lnk--> root zone. Often those systems are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches and the control the water table thereby.<p>Sub-irrigation is also used in <!--del_lnk--> commercial <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse production, usually for <!--del_lnk--> potted plants. Water is delivered from below, absorbed upwards, and the excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and <!--del_lnk--> nutrients floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time, 10-20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding <a href="../../wp/t/Tank.htm" title="Tank">tank</a> for reuse. Sub-irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor-saving through lowered system maintenance and <!--del_lnk--> automation. It is similar in principle and action to subsurface drip irrigation.<p>

      <p>These systems have low requirements for infrastructure and technical equipment but need high labor inputs. Irrigation using watering cans is to be found for example in peri-urban agriculture around large cities in some African countries.<h2><span class="mw-headline">How an in-ground irrigation system works</span></h2>
      <p>Most commercial and residential irrigation systems are &quot;<!--del_lnk--> in ground&quot; systems, which means that everything is <!--del_lnk--> buried in the ground. With the <!--del_lnk--> pipes, <!--del_lnk--> sprinklers, and irrigation <!--del_lnk--> valves being hidden, it makes for a cleaner, more presentable landscape without garden <!--del_lnk--> hoses or other items having to be moved around manually.<p><a id="Water_source_and_piping" name="Water_source_and_piping"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Controllers, zones, and valves</span></h3>
      <p>Most Irrigation systems are divided into zones. A zone is a single <!--del_lnk--> Irrigation Valve and one or a group of sprinklers that are connected by pipes. Irrigation Systems are divided into zones because there is usually not enough pressure and available flow to run sprinklers for an entire yard or sports field at once. Each zone valve has a <!--del_lnk--> solenoid on it that is controlled via wire by an <!--del_lnk--> Irrigation Controller. The <!--del_lnk--> Irrigation Controller is either a mechanical or electrical device that signals a zone to turn on at a specific time and keeps it on for a specified amount of time. &quot;Smart Controller&quot; is a recent term used to describe a controller that is capable of adjusting the watering time by itself in response to current environmental conditions. The smart controller determines current conditions by means of historic weather data for the local area, a moisture sensor, weather station, or a combination of these.<p><a id="Sprinklers" name="Sprinklers"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Sprinklers</span></h3>
      <p>When a zone comes on, the water flows through the lateral lines and ultimately ends up at the irrigation <!--del_lnk--> Sprinkler heads. Most sprinklers have pipe thread inlets on the bottom of them which allows a fitting and the pipe to be attached to them. The sprinklers are usually installed with the top of the head flush with the ground surface. When the water is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more water pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground.<p>

      <ul>
       <li>Competition for surface <!--del_lnk--> water rights.<li><!--del_lnk--> Depletion of <!--del_lnk--> underground <!--del_lnk--> aquifers.<li>Ground <!--del_lnk--> subsidence (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> New Orleans, Louisiana)<li><!--del_lnk--> Buildup of <!--del_lnk--> toxic <a href="../../wp/s/Salt.htm" title="Salt">salts</a> on soil surface in areas of high <!--del_lnk--> evaporation. This requires either <!--del_lnk--> leaching to remove these salts and a method of <!--del_lnk--> drainage to carry the salts away or use of mulch to minimize evaporation.<li><!--del_lnk--> Overirrigation because of poor <!--del_lnk--> distribution uniformity or <!--del_lnk--> management <!--del_lnk--> wastes water, chemicals, and may lead to <!--del_lnk--> water pollution.</ul>
