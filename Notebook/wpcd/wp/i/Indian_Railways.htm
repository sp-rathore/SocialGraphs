      <p><b>Indian Railways</b> (IR) is the <!--del_lnk--> state-owned <!--del_lnk--> railway company of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Indian Railways had, until <!--del_lnk--> very recently, a <!--del_lnk--> monopoly on the country&#39;s rail transport. It is one of the largest and busiest rail networks in the world, transporting just over six&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> billion passengers and almost 750 million <!--del_lnk--> tonnes of <!--del_lnk--> freight annually. IR is the world&#39;s largest commercial or utility <!--del_lnk--> employer, with more than 1.6&nbsp;million employees.<p>The railways traverse through the length and width of the country; the routes cover a total length of 63,940&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (39,230&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles). <!--del_lnk--> As of 2005 IR owns a total of 216,717 wagons, 39,936 coaches and 7,339 <!--del_lnk--> locomotives and runs a total of 14,244 trains daily, including about 8,002 passenger trains .<p>Railways were first introduced to India in 1853. By 1947, the year of <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Independence of India">India&#39;s independence</a>, there were forty-two rail systems. In 1951 the systems were <!--del_lnk--> nationalised as one unit, becoming one of the largest networks in the world.

      <p>A plan for a rail system in India was first put forward in 1832, but no further steps were taken for more than a decade. In 1844, the <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General of India <!--del_lnk--> Lord Hardinge allowed private <!--del_lnk--> entrepreneurs to set up a rail system in India. Two new railway companies were created and the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a> was asked to assist them. Interest from investors in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a> led to the rapid creation of a rail system over the next few years. The first train in India became operational on <!--del_lnk--> 1851-<!--del_lnk--> 12-22, and was used for the hauling of construction material in <!--del_lnk--> Roorkee. A year and a half later, on <!--del_lnk--> 1853-<!--del_lnk--> 04-16, the first passenger train service was inaugurated between <!--del_lnk--> Bori Bunder, <!--del_lnk--> Bombay and <!--del_lnk--> Thana. Covering a distance of 34&nbsp;km (21&nbsp;miles), it was hauled by three locomotives, Sahib, Sindh and Sultan. This was the formal birth of railways in India.<p>The British government encouraged new railway companies backed by private investors under a scheme that would guarantee an annual return of five percent during the initial years of operation. Once established, the company would be transferred to the government, with the original company retaining operational control. The route mileage of this network was about 14,500&nbsp;km (9,000&nbsp;miles) by 1880, mostly radiating inward from the three major port cities of Bombay, <!--del_lnk--> Madras and Calcutta. By 1895, India had started building its own locomotives, and in 1896 sent engineers and locomotives to help build the <!--del_lnk--> Uganda Railway.<p>Soon various independent kingdoms built their own rail systems and the network spread to the regions that became the <!--del_lnk--> modern-day states of <!--del_lnk--> Assam, <!--del_lnk--> Rajasthan and <!--del_lnk--> Andhra Pradesh. A Railway Board was constituted in 1901, but decision-making power was retained by the <!--del_lnk--> Viceroy, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Curzon. The Railway Board operated under aegis of the Department of Commerce and Industry and had three members: a government railway official serving as chairman, a railway manager from England and an agent of one of the company railways. For the first time in its history, the Railways began to make a tidy profit. In 1907, almost all the rail companies were taken over by the government.<p>The following year, the first <!--del_lnk--> electric locomotive appeared. With the arrival of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>, the railways were used to meet the needs of the British outside India. By the end of the First World War, the railways had suffered immensely and were in a poor state. The government took over the management of the Railways and removed the link between the financing of the Railways and other governmental revenues in 1920, a practice that continues to date with a separate railway budget.<p>The <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> severely crippled the railways as trains were diverted to the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, and the railway workshops were converted into munitions workshops. At the time of independence in 1947, a large portion of the railways went to the then newly formed <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. A total of forty-two separate railway systems, including thirty-two lines owned by the former Indian princely states, were amalgamated as a single unit which was christened as the <i>Indian Railways</i>.<p>The existing rail networks were abandoned in favour of zones in 1951 and a total of six zones came into being in 1952. As the <a href="../../wp/e/Economy_of_India.htm" title="Economy of India">economy of India</a> improved, almost all railway production units were indigenised. By 1985, steam locomotives were phased out in favour of diesel and electric locomotives. The entire railway reservation system was streamlined with <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computerisation</a> in 1995.<p><a id="Railway_zones" name="Railway_zones"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Railway zones</span></h2>

      <p>Indian Railways operates 8,702 passenger trains and transports around five billion annually across twenty-seven states and three <!--del_lnk--> union territories (<a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="National Capital Territory of Delhi">Delhi</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Pondicherry and <!--del_lnk--> Chandigarh). <a href="../../wp/s/Sikkim.htm" title="Sikkim">Sikkim</a> is the only state not connected.<p>The passenger division is the most preferred form of long distance transport in most of the country. In <!--del_lnk--> South India and <!--del_lnk--> North-East India however, buses are the preferred mode of transport for medium to long distance transport.<p>A standard passenger train consists of eighteen <!--del_lnk--> coaches, but some popular trains can have up to 24 coaches. Coaches are designed to accommodate anywhere from 18 to 72 passengers, but may actually accommodate many more during the holiday seasons and on busy routes. The coaches in use are <!--del_lnk--> vestibules, but some of these may be dummied on some trains for operational reasons. Freight trains use a large variety of wagons.<p>Each coach has different accommodation class; the most popular being the sleeper class. Up to nine of these type coaches are usually coupled. Air conditioned coaches are also attached, and a standard train may have between three and five air-conditioned coaches.<p>Overcrowding is the most widely faced problem with Indian Railways. In the holiday seasons or on long weekends, trains are usually packed more than their prescribed limit. Ticket-less travel, which results in large losses for the IR, is also an additional problem faced.<p><a id="Production_Services" name="Production_Services"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Production Services</span></h2>
      <p>The Indian Railways manufactures a lot of its rolling stock and heavy engineering components. This is largely due to historical reasons. As with most developing economies, the main reason is import substitution of expensive technology related products. This was relevant when the general state of the national engineering industry was immature.<p>Production Units, the manufacturing plants of the Indian Railways, are managed directly by the ministry. The General Managers of the PUs report to the Railway Board. The Production Units are<ul>

Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune do not have dedicated suburban tracks but share the tracks with long distance trains. New Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata have their own metro networks, namely the <!--del_lnk--> New Delhi Metro, the <!--del_lnk--> Chennai MRTS and the <!--del_lnk--> Kolkata metro, respectively.<p><!--del_lnk--> Suburban trains that handle <!--del_lnk--> commuter traffic are mostly <!--del_lnk--> electric multiple units. They usually have nine coaches or sometimes twelve to handle rush hour traffic. One unit of an EMU train consists of one power car and two general coaches. Thus a nine coach EMU is made up of three units having one power car at each end and one at the middle. The rakes in <a href="../../wp/m/Mumbai.htm" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> run on <!--del_lnk--> direct current, while those elsewhere use <a href="../../wp/a/Alternating_current.htm" title="Alternating current">alternating current</a>. A standard coach is designed to accommodate 96 sitting passengers, but the actual number of passengers can easily double or triple with standees during rush hour. The Kolkata metro has the administrative status of a zonal railway, though it does not come under the seventeen railway zones.<p>The Suburban trains in Mumbai handle more rush then any other suburban network in India. The network has three lines viz, western, central and harbour. It&#39;s considered to be the lifeline on Mumbai.

      <p>IR carries a huge variety of goods ranging from mineral ores, agricultural produce, petroleum, milk and vehicles. Ports and major urban areas have their own dedicated freight lines and yards. Many important freight stops have dedicated platforms and independent lines.<p>Indian Railways makes 70% of its revenues and most of its profits from the freight sector, and uses these profits to cross-subsidise the loss-making passenger sector. However, competition from trucks which offer cheaper rates has seen a decrease in freight traffic in recent years. Since the 1990s, Indian Railways has switched from small consignments to larger container movement which has helped speed up its operations. Most of its freight earnings come from such rakes carrying bulk goods such as coal, cement, food grains and iron ore.<p>Indian Railways also transports vehicles over long distances. Trucks that carry goods to a particular location are hauled back by trains saving the trucking company on unnecessary fuel expenses. Refrigerated vans are also available in many areas. The &quot;Green Van&quot; is a special type used to transport fresh food and vegetables. Recently Indian Railways introduced the special &#39;Container Rajdhani&#39; or CONRAJ, for high priority freight. The highest speed notched up for a freight train is 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) for a 4,700&nbsp;metric tonne load.<p>Recent changes have sought to boost the earnings from freight. A privatization scheme was introduced recently to improve the performance of freight trains. Companies are being allowed to run their own container trains. The first length of an 11,000km freight corridor linking India&#39;s biggest cities has recently been approved. The railways has increased load limits for the system&#39;s 220,000 freight wagons by 11%, legalizing something that was already happening. Due to increase in manufacturing transport in India that was augmented by the increase in fuel cost, transportation by rail became advantageous financially. New measures such as speeding up the turnaround times have added some 24% to freight revenues.<p><a id="Notable_trains_and_achievements" name="Notable_trains_and_achievements"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notable trains and achievements</span></h2>

This train has a compartment that serves as an operating room, a second one which serves as a storeroom and an additional two that serve as a patient ward. The train travels around the country, staying at a location for about two months before moving elsewhere.<p>Among the famous locomotives, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Fairy Queen</i> is the oldest running locomotive in the world today, though the distinction of the oldest surviving locomotive belongs to <i><a href="../../wp/j/John_Bull_%2528locomotive%2529.htm" title="John Bull (locomotive)">John Bull</a></i>. <!--del_lnk--> Kharagpur railway station also has the distinction of being the world&#39;s longest railway platform at 1072&nbsp;m (3,517&nbsp;ft). The Ghum station along the <!--del_lnk--> Toy Train route is the second highest railway station in the world to be reached by a steam locomotive. Indian Railways operates 7,566 locomotives; 37,840 Coaching vehicles and 222,147 freight wagons. There are a total of 6,853 stations; 300 yards; 2,300 goods-sheds; 700 repair shops and a total workforce of 1.54 million.<p>The shortest named station is <!--del_lnk--> Ib and the longest is <i>Sri Venkatanarasimharajuvariapeta</i>. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Himsagar Express</i>, between <!--del_lnk--> Kanyakumari and <!--del_lnk--> Jammu Tawi, has the longest run in terms of distance and time on Indian Railways network. It covers 3,745&nbsp;km (2,327&nbsp;miles) in about 74 hours and 55 minutes. The <i>Trivandrum Rajdhani</i>, between Delhi&#39;s Nizamuddin Station and Trivandrum, travels non-stop between <!--del_lnk--> Vadodara and <!--del_lnk--> Kota, covering a distance of 528&nbsp;km (328&nbsp;miles) in about 6.5 hours, and has the longest continuous run on Indian Railways today. The <i>Bhopal Shatabdi Express</i> is the fastest train in India today having a maximum speed of 140&nbsp;km/h (87&nbsp;mph) on the <!--del_lnk--> Faridabad-Agra section. The fastest speed attained by any train is 184&nbsp;km/h (114&nbsp;mph) in 2000 during test runs. This speed is much lower than fast trains in other parts of the world.

Reporting to them is the Railway Board, which has six members and a chairman.<p>Each of the sixteen zones is headed by a General Manager (GM) who reports directly to the Railway Board. The zones are further divided into divisions under the control of Divisional Railway Managers (DRM). The divisional officers of engineering, mechanical, electrical, signal &amp; telecommunication, accounts, personnel, operating, commercial and safety branches report to the respective Divisional Manager and are in charge of operation and maintenance of assets. Further down the hierarchy tree are the Station Masters who control individual stations and the train movement through the track territory under their stations&#39; administration. In addition to the zones, there are six production units (PUs) each headed by a General Manager (GM), who also report directly to the Railway Board. These production units are:<ol>

      <p>In addition to this the Central Organisation for Railway Electrification (CORE) is also headed by a GM. This is located at Allahabad. This organisation undertakes electrification projects of Indian Railway and monitors the progress of various electrification projects all over the country.<p>Apart from these zones and production units, a number of <!--del_lnk--> Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) are under the administrative control of the ministry of railways. These PSU&#39;s are:<ol>

      <p>The Railway Budget deals with the induction and improvement of existing trains and routes, the modernisation and most importantly the tariff for freight and passenger travel. The <!--del_lnk--> Parliament discusses the policies and allocations proposed in the budget. The budget needs to be passed by a simple majority in the <!--del_lnk--> Lok Sabha (India&#39;s Lower House). The comments of the <!--del_lnk--> Rajya Sabha (Upper House) are non binding. Indian Railways are subject to the same audit control as other government revenue and expenditures. Based on the anticipated traffic and the projected tariff, the level of resources required for railway&#39;s capital and revenue expenditure is worked out. While the revenue expenditure is met entirely by railways itself, the shortfall in the capital (plan) expenditure is met partly from borrowings (raised by Indian Railway Finance Corporation) and the rest from Budgetory support from the Central Government. Indian Railways pays dividend to the Central Government for the capital invested by the Central Government.<p>As per the Separation Convention, 1924, the Railway Budget is presented to the Parliament by the Union Railway Minister, two days prior to the <!--del_lnk--> General Budget, usually around <!--del_lnk--> 26 February. Though the Railway Budget is separately presented to the Parliament, the figures relating to the receipt and expenditure of the Railways are also shown in the General Budget, since they are a part and parcel of the total receipts and expenditure of the Government of India. This document serves as a balance sheet of operations of the Railways during the previous year and lists out plans for expansion for the current year.<p>The formation of policy and overall control of the railways is vested in Railway Board comprising the Chairman, Financial Commissioner and other functional Members for Traffic, Engineering, Mechanical, Electrical and Staff matters. As per the 2006 budget, Indian Railways earned <!--del_lnk--> Rs.&nbsp;54,600&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> crores (Rs. 546,000&nbsp;million or <!--del_lnk--> US$12,300&nbsp;million). Freight earnings increased by 10% from Rs.&nbsp;30,450&nbsp;cr (US$7,000&nbsp;million) in the previous year. Passenger earnings, other coaching earnings and sundry other earnings increased by 7%, 19% and 56% respectively over previous year. Its year end fund balance is expected to stand at Rs.&nbsp;11,280 cr (2.54 billion US$)..<p>Around 20% of the passenger revenue is earned from the upper class segments of the passenger segment (the air-conditioned classes). The overall passenger traffic grew 7.5% in the previous year. In the first two months of India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fiscal year 2005-06 (April and May), the Railways registered a 10% growth in passenger traffic, and a 12% in passenger earnings .<p>A new concern faced by Indian Railways is competition from <!--del_lnk--> low cost airlines that has recently made its d&eacute;but in India. In a cost cutting move, the Railways plans to minimise unwanted cessations, and scrap unpopular routes.<p><a id="Current_problems" name="Current_problems"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current problems</span></h2>

      <p>Indian railways suffers from deteriorating finances and lack the funds for future investment. Last year, India spent $28 billion, or 3.6% of GDP, on infrastructure. The main problem plaguing the Railways is the high accident rate which stands at about three hundred  a year. Although accidents such as <!--del_lnk--> derailment and collisions are less common in recent times, many are run over by trains, especially in crowded areas. Indian Railways have accepted the fact that given the size of operations, eliminating accidents is an unrealistic goal, and at best they can only minimise the accident rate. Human error is the primary cause (83%) blamed for mishaps. The Konkan Railway route suffers from <!--del_lnk--> landslides in the <!--del_lnk--> monsoon season, which has caused fatal accidents in the recent past.<p>Contributing to the Railways&#39; problems are the antiquated communication, safety and signalling equipment. One area of upgrading badly required is an automated signalling system to prevent crashes. A number of train accidents happened due to a manual system of signals between stations. However, the changeover to a new system would require a substantial investment. It is felt that this would be required given the gradual increase in train speeds and lengths, that would make accidents more dangerous. In the latest instances of signalling control by means of interlinked stations (e.g., Chennai - Washermanpet), failure-detection circuits are provided for each track circuit and signal circuit with notification to the signal control centres in case of problems . However, this is available in a very small subset of the total Railways.
