      <p>The <b>Iranian peoples</b> are a collection of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">ethnic groups</a> defined by their usage of <!--del_lnk--> Iranian languages and discernable descent from <!--del_lnk--> ancient Iranian peoples. The Iranian peoples live chiefly in the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus, and parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent, though speakers of Iranian languages were once found throughout <!--del_lnk--> Eurasia, from the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans to western <!--del_lnk--> China. As Iranian peoples are not confined to the borders of the current state of <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, the term <i><b>Iranic peoples</b></i> is sometimes used as an alternative in order to avoid confusion with the citizens of modern Iran.<p>The series of ethnic groups which comprise the Iranian peoples are traced to a branch of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European <!--del_lnk--> Aryans known as the <i>Iranians</i> or <i>Proto-Iranians</i>. Some scant information about the way of life of these early people has been elucidated through archaeological finds in <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, Central Asia and the Middle East. The Iranian peoples have played an important role throughout history: the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persians</a> established the world&#39;s first multi-national state, and the <!--del_lnk--> Scythian-<!--del_lnk--> Sarmatian nomads dominated the vast expanses of Russia and western <!--del_lnk--> Siberia for centuries and gave birth to the infamous <!--del_lnk--> Amazons. In addition, the various religions of the Iranian peoples, including <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism and <!--del_lnk--> Manichaeism, were important early philosophical influences on <!--del_lnk--> Judeo-Christianity. Early Iranian tribes were the precursors to many diverse modern peoples, including the <!--del_lnk--> Persians, the <!--del_lnk--> Kurds, the <a href="../../wp/p/Pashtun_people.htm" title="Pashtun people">Pashtuns</a>, and many other, smaller groups. The southern Iranian peoples survived <a href="../../wp/a/Alexander_the_Great.htm" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>&#39;s conquests, <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Arab attempts at cultural dominance, and devastating assaults by the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, whereas the Iranians of the north were largely assimilated by the <!--del_lnk--> Slavs and other European peoples.<p>

      <p>The term <i>Iranian</i> is derived from <i>Iran</i> (<i>lit</i>: &quot;Land of the <!--del_lnk--> Aryans&quot;). The old <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-Iranian term <i>Arya</i>, meaning &quot;noble&quot;, is believed to have been one of a series of self-referential terms used by the Aryans, at least in the areas populated by Aryans who migrated south from <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia and southern <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>. Their ancient homeland was referred to as <i><!--del_lnk--> Airyanem Vaejah</i> and varied in its geographic range, sometimes referring to <!--del_lnk--> Fars (according to <!--del_lnk--> Eratosthenes), sometimes to the area around <!--del_lnk--> Herat (<!--del_lnk--> Pliny&#39;s view), sometimes to the entire expanse of the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau (<!--del_lnk--> Strabo&#39;s designation).<p>From a <b>linguistic</b> standpoint, the term <i>Iranian peoples</i> is similar in its usage to the term <i><!--del_lnk--> Germanic peoples</i>, which includes various peoples who happen to speak <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages such as <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, or the term <i><!--del_lnk--> Slavic peoples</i>, which includes various speakers of <!--del_lnk--> Slavic languages including <!--del_lnk--> Russians, <!--del_lnk--> Bosniaks, and <!--del_lnk--> Serbs. Thus, along similar lines, the Iranian peoples include not only the <!--del_lnk--> Persians, or <!--del_lnk--> Tajiks, of <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tajikistan.htm" title="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, but also the <a href="../../wp/p/Pashtun_people.htm" title="Pashtun people">Pashtuns</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Kurds, <!--del_lnk--> Ossetians, <!--del_lnk--> Baloch, and a number of other groups. The academic usage of the term <i>Iranian peoples</i>, or <i>Iranic peoples</i>, is thus distinct from the state of <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> and its various citizens (who are all Iranian by nationality, and thus popularly referred to as <i>Iranians</i>), in the same way that <i>Germanic peoples</i> is distinct from <i><!--del_lnk--> Germans</i>. Many citizens of Iran are not necessarily &quot;Iranian peoples&quot;, by virtue of not being speakers of Iranian languages, and may not have discernable ties to ancient Iranian tribes.<p><a id="History_and_settlement" name="History_and_settlement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History and settlement</span></h2>

      <p>Having descended from the <!--del_lnk--> Aryans (Proto-<!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians), the ancient Iranian peoples separated from the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryans, <!--del_lnk--> Nuristanis and <!--del_lnk--> Dards in the early 2nd millennium BCE. The <!--del_lnk--> Iranian languages form a sub-branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranian sub-family, which is a branch of the family of <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European languages. The Iranian peoples stem from early Proto-Iranians, themselves a branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians, who are believed to have originated in either <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia or <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> circa 1800 BCE. The Proto-Iranians are traced to the <!--del_lnk--> Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex, a <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> culture of Central Asia. The area between northern Afghanistan and the <a href="../../wp/a/Aral_Sea.htm" title="Aral Sea">Aral Sea</a> is hypothesized to have been the region where the Proto-Iranians first emerged, following the separation of Indo-Iranians tribes.<p>By the first millennium BCE, <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Iranian peoples such as the <!--del_lnk--> Medes, <!--del_lnk--> Persians, <!--del_lnk--> Bactrians and <!--del_lnk--> Parthians populated the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau, while Iranian peoples such as the <!--del_lnk--> Scythians, <!--del_lnk--> Sarmatians, and <!--del_lnk--> Alans populated the steppes north of the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Saka and <!--del_lnk--> Scythian tribes remained mainly in the north, and spread as far west as the <!--del_lnk--> Balkans and as far east as <!--del_lnk--> Xinjiang. Later offshoots, related to the Scythians, included the <!--del_lnk--> Sarmatians, who vanished following <!--del_lnk--> Slavic and other invasions into southern Russia, the <a href="../../wp/u/Ukraine.htm" title="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and the Balkans, presumably due to having been assimilated by other tribes.<p>There are only scant references to these early Proto-Iranian invaders in the early writings of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Assyrians and <a href="../../wp/b/Babylonia.htm" title="Babylonia">Babylonians</a>. Two of the early offshoots of the Proto-Iranians are known: <!--del_lnk--> Avestan speakers in Afghanistan, and <!--del_lnk--> Old Persian speakers in <!--del_lnk--> Fars in southeastern Iran. The Avestan texts known as the <!--del_lnk--> Gathas are believed to have been written by <a href="../../wp/z/Zoroaster.htm" title="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>, the founder of <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism, while Old Persian appears to have been established in written form following the adoption of <!--del_lnk--> cuneiform from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sumer.htm" title="Sumer">Sumerians</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Yaz culture (ca. 1500-1100 BC) may mark the development of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Iranian and the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> Avestan culture.<p>The first mentioning by an Iranian tribe of their &quot;Aryan&quot; lineage is from an early inscription known as the <a href="../../wp/b/Behistun_Inscription.htm" title="Behistun Inscription">Behistun Inscription</a>, recording a proclamation by <!--del_lnk--> Darius I of Persia that he was of Aryan ancestry and that his language was an Aryan language. The inscription thus provides a link in the Iranian languages to the usage of the term <i>Arya</i> in early <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryan texts. These ancient Persians recognized three official languages (<!--del_lnk--> Elamite, <!--del_lnk--> Babylonian, and <!--del_lnk--> Old Persian), which suggests a <a href="../../wp/m/Multiculturalism.htm" title="Multiculturalism">multicultural</a> society. It is not known to what extent other Proto-Iranian tribes referred to themselves as &quot;Aryan&quot;, or if the term has the same meaning in other Old Iranian languages.<p><a id="Western_Iranians" name="Western_Iranians"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Western Iranians</span></h4>

      <p>The ancient Persians established themselves in the western portion of the Iranian plateau, and appear to have interacted considerably with the Elamites and Babylonians, while the Medes also intermingled with local <!--del_lnk--> Semitic peoples to the west. Remnants of the <!--del_lnk--> Median language and Old Persian show their common Proto-Iranian roots, emphasized in Strabo and Herodotus&#39; analyses of their languages, which they believed to be very similar to the languages spoken by the Bactrians and <!--del_lnk--> Soghdians in the east. Following the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Achaemenid Empire, the Persian language spread from <!--del_lnk--> Fars to various regions of the empire, with the modern dialects of Iran, Afghanistan (also known as <!--del_lnk--> Dari) and Central-Asia (known as <!--del_lnk--> Tajiki) descending from Old Persian.<p>The Avestans&#39; main impact was religious and liturgical, as the early inhabitants of the Persian Empire appear to have adopted the religion of <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism. The other prominent Iranian peoples, such as the Kurds, are surmised to stem from Iranic populations that mixed with Caucasian peoples such as the <!--del_lnk--> Hurrians, due to some unique qualities found in the Kurdish language that mirror those found in <!--del_lnk--> Caucasian languages. The <!--del_lnk--> Baloch relate an oral tradition regarding their migration from <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a> around the year 1000 CE, whereas linguistic evidence links <!--del_lnk--> Balochi to <!--del_lnk--> Kurdish and <!--del_lnk--> Zazaki.<p><a id="Eastern_Iranians" name="Eastern_Iranians"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Eastern Iranians</span></h4>
      <p>While the Iranian tribes of the south are better known through their modern counterparts, the tribes which remained largely in the vast Eurasian expanse are known through the references made to them by the ancient Greeks and Persians, as well as by archaeological finds. In the 5th century BCE, <a href="../../wp/h/Herodotus.htm" title="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> made references to a nomadic people whom he identifies as the <!--del_lnk--> Scythians and describes as having dwelt in what is today southern <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>It is believed that these Scythians were conquered by their eastern cousins, the <!--del_lnk--> Sarmatians, who are mentioned by <!--del_lnk--> Strabo as the dominant tribe which controlled the southern Russian steppe by the 1st millennium CE. These Sarmatians were also known to the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Romans</a>, who conquered the western tribes in the Balkans and sent Sarmatian conscripts, as part of Roman legions, as far west as <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a>. Some tribes of Sarmatians are also identified as the <!--del_lnk--> Amazons of Greek legend, warrior women believed to have lived in a <!--del_lnk--> matrilineal society in which both men and women took part in war, and whose existence has been supported by recently-uncovered archaeological and genetic evidence.<p>The Sarmatians of the east became the <!--del_lnk--> Alans, who also ventured far and wide, with a branch ending up in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe and <a href="../../wp/n/North_Africa.htm" title="North Africa">North Africa</a>, as they accompanied the Germanic <!--del_lnk--> Vandals during their migrations. The modern <!--del_lnk--> Ossetians are believed to be the sole direct descendants of the Alans, as other remnants of the Alans disappeared following Germanic, <!--del_lnk--> Hunnic, and ultimately Slavic invasions.<p>Some of the Saka-Scythian tribes in Central Asia would later move further south and invade the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau and northwestern <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Scythians). Another Iranian tribe related to the Saka-Scythians were the <!--del_lnk--> Parni in Central Asia, a tribe that pressured, and ultimately overthrew, the rule of the Greek <!--del_lnk--> Seleucids in Persia. The Parni replaced the Seleucids as the <!--del_lnk--> Parthians, a dynasty that ruled Persia during the early centuries of the 1st millennium CE and became the main rival of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the east. It is surmised that many Iranian tribes, including the <!--del_lnk--> Khwarezmians, <!--del_lnk--> Massagetae and <!--del_lnk--> Sogdians, were assimilated and/or pushed out of Central Asia by the migrations of <!--del_lnk--> Turkic tribes emanating out of Siberia.<p>The most dominant surviving Eastern Iranians are represented by the <a href="../../wp/p/Pashtun_people.htm" title="Pashtun people">Pashtuns</a>, whose origins are generally believed to be in southern Afghanistan, from which they began to spread until they reached as far west as <!--del_lnk--> Herat and as far east as the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Pashto language shows affinities to <!--del_lnk--> Bactrian, as both languages are believed to be of <!--del_lnk--> Middle Iranian origin. The modern <!--del_lnk--> Ossetians claim to be the descendants of the Alano-Sarmatians, and their claims are supported by their Northeast Iranian language, while culturally the Ossetians resemble their Caucasian neighbors, the <!--del_lnk--> Kabardians, <!--del_lnk--> Circassians and <!--del_lnk--> Georgians. Various extinct Iranian peoples existed in the eastern Caucasus, including the <!--del_lnk--> Azaris, while some Iranian peoples remain in the region, including the <!--del_lnk--> Talysh and the <!--del_lnk--> Tats (including the <!--del_lnk--> Judeo-Tats, who have relocated to <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>), found in Azerbaijan and as far north as the Russian republic of <!--del_lnk--> Dagestan.<p><a id="Later_developments" name="Later_developments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Later developments</span></h3>
      <p>In ancient times, the majority of southern Iranian peoples became adherents of Zoroastrianism, <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (in parts of Afghanistan and Central Asia), <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Nestorian <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> (largely amongst the Kurds and Persians living in Iraq). The Ossetians would later adopt Christianity as well, with <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodoxy becoming dominant following their annexation into the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire, while some converted to Islam due to the influence of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a>.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Starting with the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Omar in 634 CE, <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Arabs began a conquest of the Iranian plateau.

The Iranian peoples would later split along sectarian lines as the Persians (and later the <!--del_lnk--> Hazara) adopted the <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a sect, while the majority of other Iranian peoples remained adherents of <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam. As ancient tribes and identities changed, so did the Iranian peoples, many of whom assimilated foreign cultures and peoples.<p>Later, during the 2nd millennium CE, the Iranian peoples would play a prominent role during the age of Islamic expansion and empire. <a href="../../wp/s/Saladin.htm" title="Saladin">Saladin</a>, a noted adversary of the <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders, was an ethnic Kurd, while various empires centered in Iran (including the <!--del_lnk--> Safavids) re-established a modern dialect of Persian as the official language spoken throughout much of what is today Iran and adjacent parts of Central Asia. Iranian influence spread to the Ottoman Empire, where Persian was often spoken at court, as well as in the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal Empire, which began in Afghanistan and shifted to India. All of the major Iranian peoples reasserted their use of Iranian languages following the decline of Arab rule, but would not begin to form modern <a href="../../wp/n/Nationalism.htm" title="Nationalism">national</a> identities until the 19th and early 20th centuries (just as Germans and Italians were beginning to formulate national identities of their own).<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>There are an estimated 150 million native speakers of Iranian languages.

      <p>It is largely through linguistic similarities that the Iranian peoples have been linked, as many non-Iranian peoples have adopted Iranian languages and cultures. However, other common traits have been identified as well, and a stream of common historical events have often linked the southern Iranian peoples, including <!--del_lnk--> Hellenistic conquests, the various empires based in <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>, Arab <!--del_lnk--> Caliphates, and <!--del_lnk--> Turkic invasions.<p>Although most of the Iranian peoples settled in the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian plateau region, many expanded into the periphery, ranging from the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus and <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> to the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus</a> and western <!--del_lnk--> China. The Iranian peoples have often mingled with other populations, with the notable example being the <!--del_lnk--> Hazaras, who display a distinct <!--del_lnk--> Turkic-<!--del_lnk--> Mongol background that contrasts with most other Iranian peoples. Similarly, the <!--del_lnk--> Baloch have mingled with the <!--del_lnk--> Dravidian-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Brahui (who have been strongly modified by Iranian invaders themselves), while the <!--del_lnk--> Ossetians have invariably mixed with <!--del_lnk--> Georgians and other Caucasian peoples. Moreover, the Kurds are an eclectic Iranian people who, although displaying some ethnolinguistic ties to other Iranian peoples (in particular their <!--del_lnk--> Iranian language, and some cultural traits), are believed to have mixed with Caucasian and Semitic peoples. Modern Persians themselves are also a heterogeneous group of peoples descended from various ancient Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau, including the <!--del_lnk--> Elamites. Thus, not unlike the <a href="#Etymology_and_usage" title="">aforementioned example</a> of Germanic peoples including the <!--del_lnk--> English, who are both of Germanic and <!--del_lnk--> Celtic origin, Iranians are an ethno-linguistic group, and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and cultural traits that denote their respective identities.<p><a id="Culture_and_assimilation" name="Culture_and_assimilation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture and assimilation</span></h2>

      <p>Many of the cultural traits of the ancient Iranians were similar to other <!--del_lnk--> Proto-Indo-European societies. Like other Indo-Europeans, the early Iranians practiced ritual sacrifice, had a social hierarchy consisting of warriors, clerics, and farmers, and poetic hymns and sagas to recount their deeds.<p>Following the Iranian split from the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranians, the Iranians developed an increasingly distinct culture. It is surmised that the early Iranians intermarried with and <!--del_lnk--> assimilated local cultures over a long period of time, and thus a <!--del_lnk--> caste identity was never needed or created by the Iranians&mdash;in sharp contrast with the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Aryans.<p>Various common traits can be discerned amongst the Iranian peoples. For example, the social event <!--del_lnk--> Norouz is an Iranian festival that is practiced by nearly all of the Iranian peoples as well as others in the region. Its origins are traced to <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism and pre-historic times.<p>Some Iranian peoples exhibit distinct traits that are unique unto themselves. The Pashtuns adhere to a code of honour and culture known as <!--del_lnk--> Pashtunwali, which has a similar counterpart amongst the <!--del_lnk--> Baloch, called Mayar, that is more hierarchical.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>The early Iranian peoples may have worshipped various deities found throughout other cultures where <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European invaders established themselves. The earliest major religion of the Iranian peoples was <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrianism, which spread to nearly all of the Iranian peoples living in the Iranian plateau.<p>Modern speakers of Iranian languages mainly follow <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Some follow <!--del_lnk--> Judaism, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and the <a href="../../wp/b/Bah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD_Faith.htm" title="Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith">Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith</a>, with an unknown number showing no religious affiliation. Of the Muslim Iranian peoples, the majority overall are followers of the <!--del_lnk--> Sunni sect of Islam, while most Persians and Hazaras are <!--del_lnk--> Shi&#39;a. Shi&#39;a Islam and Sufism in Iran are both thought to be affected by <!--del_lnk--> Persianism. The Christian community is largely represented by the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox denomination, followed by Ossetians and <!--del_lnk--> Nestorians. <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> is followed mainly by <!--del_lnk--> Persian Jews, <!--del_lnk--> Jews of Afghanistan, <!--del_lnk--> Kurdish Jews, and <!--del_lnk--> Mountain Jews (of the Caucasus), most of which are now found in <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>. The historical religion of the Persian Empire was Zoroastrianism and it has some followers. They are known as the <!--del_lnk--> Parsis in India, or <!--del_lnk--> Zoroastrians in Iran and Pakistan.<p><a id="Iranian_influence_upon_Turkic_peoples" name="Iranian_influence_upon_Turkic_peoples"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Iranian influence upon Turkic peoples</span></h3>
      <p>In matters relating to culture, the various <!--del_lnk--> Turkic-speaking minorities of Iran (notably the <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijani_people.htm" title="Azerbaijani people">Azerbaijani people</a>) and Afghanistan (<!--del_lnk--> Uzbeks and <!--del_lnk--> Turkmen) are often conversant in Iranian languages, in addition to their own Turkic languages, and also have Iranian culture to the extent that the term <i>Turko-Iranian</i> can be applied. The usage applies to various circumstances that involve historic interaction, intermarriage, cultural assimilation, bilingualism, and cultural overlap or commonalities.<p>Notable amongst this synthesis of Turko-Iranian culture are the Azeris, whose culture, religion, and significant periods of history are linked to the Persians. Certain theories and genetic tests suggest that the Azeris are descendants of <!--del_lnk--> ancient Iranian peoples who lost their Iranian language (see <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Azari language) following the Turkic invasions of Azerbaijan in the 11th century CE. In fact, throughout much of the expanse of Central Asia and the Middle East, Iranian and Turkic culture has merged in many cases to form various hybrid populations and cultures, as evident from various ruling dynasties such as the <!--del_lnk--> Ghaznavids, <!--del_lnk--> Saljuqs, and <!--del_lnk--> Mughals.<p>Iranian cultural influences have also been significant in <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia, where Turkic invaders are believed to have largely mixed with native Iranian peoples of which only the <!--del_lnk--> Tajik remain, in terms of language usage. The areas of the former Soviet Union adjacent to Iran, Afghanistan, and the Kurdish areas (such as <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> and <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>) have gone through the prism of decades of Russian and <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> rule that has reshaped the Turko-Iranian cultures there to some degree.<p><a id="Genetics" name="Genetics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Genetics</span></h2>
      <p>Genetic testing of Iranian peoples has revealed many common genes for most of the Iranian peoples, but with numerous exceptions and regional variations. Genetic studies conducted by <!--del_lnk--> Cavalli-Sforza have revealed that Iranians cluster closely with European groups and more distantly from Near Eastern groups. Some of the common genetic markers may stem from the ancient Proto-Iranians and parallel the spread of Iranian languages, which may have also been adopted through a process of assimilation by indigenous peoples and thus account for the diversity found amongst the Iranian peoples. Nonetheless, preliminary genetic tests suggest common origins for most of the Iranian peoples:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>Populations located west of the Indus basin, including those from Iran, Anatolia and the Caucasus, exhibit a common mtDNA lineage composition, consisting mainly of western Eurasian lineages, with a very limited contribution from South Asia and eastern Eurasia (fig. 1). Indeed, the different Iranian populations show a striking degree of homogeneity. This is revealed not only by the nonsignificant FST values and the PC plot (fig. 6) but also by the SAMOVA results, in which a significant genetic barrier separates populations west of Pakistan from those east and north of the Indus Valley (results not shown). These observations suggest either a common origin of modern Iranian populations and/or extensive levels of gene flow amongst them.</td>

      <p>Basically, the findings of this study reveal many common genetic markers found amongst the Iranian peoples from the <a href="../../wp/t/Tigris.htm" title="Tigris">Tigris</a> to the areas west of the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus</a>. This correlates with the <!--del_lnk--> Iranian languages spoken from the Caucasus to Kurdish areas in the <!--del_lnk--> Zagros region and eastwards to western Pakistan and Tajikistan and parts of Uzbekistan in Central Asia. The extensive gene flow is perhaps an indication of the spread of Iranian-speaking peoples, whose languages are now spoken mainly upon the Iranian plateau and adjacent regions. These results relate the relationships of Iranian peoples with each other, while other comparative testing reveals some varied origins for Iranian peoples such as the Kurds, who show genetic ties to the Caucasus at considerably higher levels than any other Iranian peoples except the <!--del_lnk--> Ossetians, as well as links to Europe and Semitic populations that live in close proximity such as <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jews">Jews</a> and Arabs.<p>According to a recent study, the ancestors of the Kurds were from an old Mediterranean <!--del_lnk--> substratum, i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Hurrian and <!--del_lnk--> Hittite groups. According to this study the <!--del_lnk--> Aryan ancestry of the Kurds and other Iranian-speaking populations in Anatolia is not supported by genetic analyses.<p>Another recent study of the genetic landscape of Iran was completed by a team of <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge</a> geneticists led by Dr. Maziar Ashrafian Bonab (an Iranian Azarbaijani). Bonab remarked that his group had done extensive <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> testing on different language groups, including <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European and non Indo-European speakers, in Iran. The study found that the Azerbaijanis of Iran do not have a similar FSt and other genetic markers found in Anatolian and European Turks. However, the genetic Fst and other genetic traits like MRca and mtDNA of Iranian Azeris were identical to <!--del_lnk--> Persians in Iran.<p>Ultimately, genetic tests reveal that while the Iranian peoples show numerous common genetic markers overall, there are also indications of interaction with other groups, regional variations, and cases of genetic drift. In addition, indigenous populations may have survived the waves of early Aryan invasions as cultural assimilation led to large-scale language replacement (as with some Kurds, Hazaras and others). Further testing will ultimately be required and may further elucidate the relationship of the Iranian peoples with each other and various neighboring populations.<p><a id="List_of_Iranian_peoples" name="List_of_Iranian_peoples"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">List of Iranian peoples</span></h2>
