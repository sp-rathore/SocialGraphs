The extreme north is exceptionally flat, consisting mainly of deposits built up by deposition from glacial advances from Western <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> during colder times. There are more recently deposited <!--del_lnk--> shingle <a href="../../wp/b/Beach.htm" title="Beach">beaches</a> at the <!--del_lnk--> Point of Ayre. It has only one mountain higher than 2,000 <!--del_lnk--> feet, <!--del_lnk--> Snaefell, with a height of 621 metres (2,036&nbsp;ft). According to an old saying, from the summit one can see six kingdoms: those of Mann, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Heaven <!--del_lnk--> ,<!--del_lnk--> , <!--del_lnk--> .

      <p>According to the 2001 census, the Isle of Man is home to 76,315 people, of whom around 25,347 reside in the Island&#39;s capital, <!--del_lnk--> Douglas (<i>Doolish</i>). This gives the island a <!--del_lnk--> population density of 133 per square kilometre, or 345 people per square mile.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>The culture of the Isle of Man is strongly influenced by its <!--del_lnk--> Celtic and <!--del_lnk--> Norse origins. <!--del_lnk--> Manx is closely related to the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic and <!--del_lnk--> Irish languages.<p>By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly <!--del_lnk--> native speakers remained (the last of them, <!--del_lnk--> Ned Maddrell, died on <!--del_lnk--> December 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1974), but by then a scholarly <!--del_lnk--> revival had begun to spread to the populace and many had learned Manx as a second language. The first native speakers of Manx (bilingual with English) in many years have now appeared: children brought up by Manx-speaking parents. Primary immersion education in Manx is provided by the Manx government: since 2003, the former <!--del_lnk--> St. John&#39;s School building has been used by the <i>Bunscoill Gaelgagh</i> (Manx language-medium school). Degrees in Manx are available from the <!--del_lnk--> Isle of Man College, the <!--del_lnk--> Centre for Manx Studies and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh. Manx-language playgroups also exist, and Manx language classes are available in island schools. In the 1991 census, 1,689 out of a population of about 71,000 claimed to have knowledge of Manx, although the degree of knowledge in these cases presumably varied. It is currently enjoying a revival of the <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic <!--del_lnk--> Manx language (<i>Gaelg</i>).<p>A well known Manx expression is &quot;Traa Dy Liooar&quot;, meaning &quot;time enough&quot; and represents a stereotypical view of the Manx attitude to life.<p><a id="Food_and_drink" name="Food_and_drink"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Food and drink</span></h2>
      <p>The national dish of the island is &quot;Spuds and Herrin&#39;&quot;, boiled <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a> and <!--del_lnk--> herring. This plain dish is chosen because of its role supporting the subsistence farmers of the island, who crofted the land and fished the sea for centuries.<p>Seafood makes up a large proportion of the Manx diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include manx <!--del_lnk--> kippers (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from North Sea herring these days. The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked <!--del_lnk--> salmon and <!--del_lnk--> bacon.<p><!--del_lnk--> Crab, <!--del_lnk--> lobster and <!--del_lnk--> scallops are commercially fished, and the Queen Scallop (&#39;Queenies&#39;) is regarded as a particular delicacy, with a light, sweet flavour. <a href="../../wp/c/Cod.htm" title="Cod">Cod</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ling and <!--del_lnk--> mackerel are often angled for the table, and freshwater <a href="../../wp/t/Trout.htm" title="Trout">trout</a> and <!--del_lnk--> salmon can be taken from the local rivers and lakes, supported by the Government fish hatchery at Cornaa.<p>Manx meat has a good reputation. <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">Cattle</a>, <!--del_lnk--> sheep, <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pigs</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Poultry.htm" title="Poultry">poultry</a> are all commercially farmed, Manx lamb from the hill-farms being a popular dish. The Loughtan, the indigenous breed of manx sheep, has a rich, dark meat that has found favour with chefs, featuring in dishes on the BBC&#39;s <i>Masterchef</i> series.<p><a href="../../wp/m/Milk.htm" title="Milk">Milk</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a> are produced by IOM Creameries. Manx cheese has been a particular success, featuring smoked and herb-flavoured varieties, and is stocked by many of the UK&#39;s supermarket chains. Manx cheese took bronze medals in the 2005 British Cheese Awards, and sold 578 tonnes over the year.<p><a href="../../wp/b/Beer.htm" title="Beer">Beer</a> is brewed on a commercial scale by <!--del_lnk--> Okells Brewery (established in 1850) and <!--del_lnk--> Bushy&#39;s Brewery.<p>Okells produces a number of beers including classic bitters, ales and milds, with a range of specialities including &quot;Mac Lir&quot; <!--del_lnk--> wheat beer and &quot;Aile&quot; smoked porter.<p>Martin Brunnschweiler&#39;s &quot;Bushy&#39;s Brewery&quot; is a relatively recent startup that has found favour with the younger crowd and with the TT fans who congregate in his beer tent over the TT festival. Bushy&#39;s produces ales, bitters and stouts, including &quot;Old Bushy Tail&quot; and &quot;Piston Brew&quot;, alongside one-off specials and seasonal brews.<p>&quot;Manx Spirit&quot;, a spirit distilled from <!--del_lnk--> Scotch whisky, is produced by Kella Distillers.<p><a id="Government" name="Government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government</span></h2>

      <p>The Isle of Man is a <!--del_lnk--> self-governing <!--del_lnk--> crown dependency. The <!--del_lnk--> Head of State is the <!--del_lnk--> Lord of Mann, who since 1765 has been the British Sovereign, currently <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>. She is represented by the Island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant Governor. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> is responsible for the Island&#39;s defence and for representing the Island in international forums, while the Island&#39;s own <!--del_lnk--> parliament has competence over almost all domestic matters.<p>The Island&#39;s parliament is <i><!--del_lnk--> Tynwald</i> (<i>Tinvaal</i>), which dates from at least AD 979. Tynwald is a bicameral legislature, comprising the <!--del_lnk--> House of Keys (directly elected by universal suffrage) and the <!--del_lnk--> Legislative Council (consisting of indirectly elected and ex officio members). These two bodies meet together in joint session as Tynwald. There is a <!--del_lnk--> Council of Ministers, which is headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Chief Minister, currently <!--del_lnk--> Donald Gelling <!--del_lnk--> MLC.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Under <!--del_lnk--> British law, Mann is not part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. However, the UK takes care of its external and defence affairs, and retains paramount power to legislate for the Island. The Isle of Man had a dispute with the <!--del_lnk--> European Court of Human Rights in the 1970s because it was reluctant to change its laws concerning <!--del_lnk--> birching (corporal punishment).<p>The Isle of Man holds neither membership nor associate membership of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, and lies outside the <!--del_lnk--> European Economic Area (EEA). Nonetheless, Protocol Three of the <!--del_lnk--> treaty of accession of the United Kingdom permits trade for Manx goods without non-EU tariffs. In conjunction with the Customs and Excise agreement with the UK, this facilitates free trade with the UK. While Manx goods can be freely moved within the EEA, people, capital and services cannot.<p>There is no Manx citizenship. Citizenship is covered by UK law, and Manx people are classed as <!--del_lnk--> British citizens. However, those defined as Manx under Protocol Three have a special endorsement placed in their passports preventing them from freely living or working in EU states. Those Manx persons with a parent or grandparent born in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), or who have lived in the UK for five years, are not subject to this provision.<p>The restriction on free movement of persons is anomalous in that the treaty establishing the EU (formerly <!--del_lnk--> EEC) clearly states that all citizens of member states will also be citizens of the EU. However a special protocol was inserted in the Treaty of Accession of the United Kingdom excluding the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> and Isle of Man from the provisions governing free movement of people. This was done at the request of the governments of <a href="../../wp/j/Jersey.htm" title="Jersey">Jersey</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Guernsey.htm" title="Guernsey">Guernsey</a> and the Isle of Man at the time.<p>Travel to the Isle of Man is regulated by the local government laws, although the Isle of Man is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Common Travel Area. Visitors from countries who require a UK visa may also require a special Manx visa, obtainable from a British diplomatic mission. All non-Manx, including UK citizens, are required to obtain a work permit to take up employment on the Island until they have lived there for five years or more.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h3>
      <p>Most Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Though political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as is the case in the United Kingdom. Consequently, much Manx legislation develops through consensus among the members of Tynwald, which contrasts with the much more adversarial nature of the UK <!--del_lnk--> parliament.<p>One political party, <!--del_lnk--> Mec Vannin, advocates the establishment of a sovereign <!--del_lnk--> republic. A <!--del_lnk--> Manx Labour Party also exists, unaffiliated to the UK <!--del_lnk--> Labour Party. The island formerly had a <!--del_lnk--> Manx National Party and a Manx Communist party. There are Manx members in the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic League, a political pressure group that advocates greater co-operation between and political autonomy for the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic nations. The main political issues include the Island&#39;s relationship with the finance sector, housing prices and shortages, and the <!--del_lnk--> Manx language. The vast majority of the members of the <!--del_lnk--> House of Keys are non-partisan (19), with two representatives from the <!--del_lnk--> Manx Labour Party and three from the <!--del_lnk--> Alliance for Progressive Government. The next scheduled election is in 2006.<p><a id="Local_government" name="Local_government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Local government</span></h3>

      <p>The Isle of Man is divided into six administrative districts, called sheadings. The six sheadings are <!--del_lnk--> Ayre, <!--del_lnk--> Glenfaba, <!--del_lnk--> Garff, <!--del_lnk--> Michael, <!--del_lnk--> Rushen and <!--del_lnk--> Middle. The sheadings form the basis of some <!--del_lnk--> constituencies and each has a <!--del_lnk--> Coroner. This office must not be confused with the Coroner for Inquests, a role usually fulfilled by the <!--del_lnk--> High Bailiff. A person may fulfil the role of coroner for more than one sheading at the same time.<p>The term &#39;sheading&#39; is thought to be a <!--del_lnk--> Norse word for &#39;ship division&#39;; each district was believed to be responsible for producing a certain number of warships. It could also be a <!--del_lnk--> Celtic word meaning &#39;sixth part&#39;.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>

      <p>The Isle of Man became a <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> outpost/kingdom from <i>circa</i> AD 700 to AD 900. The Norse <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Mann and the Isles was created by <!--del_lnk--> Godred Crovan in 1079. Norway&#39;s King <!--del_lnk--> Magnus VI ceded the isles to <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1266, as dictated in the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Perth. The Isle of Man came under English control in the 14th century and to the <!--del_lnk--> British Crown in 1765.<p>The Isle of Man was used as a base for Alien Civilian <!--del_lnk--> Internment camps in both the <!--del_lnk--> First World War (1914-18) and the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War (1939-45).<p>Trivia: During Viking times the Isle of Man was the mainland of the <!--del_lnk--> Western Isles, Mull, Skye, etc.. It is still considered offensive to refer to the UK as the mainland. Being the Southern (most) Isle, it was named Sodor. Churches on the Island are under the stewardship of the <!--del_lnk--> Diocese of Sodor and Man. When <!--del_lnk--> Rev. W. V. Awdry wrote <!--del_lnk--> Thomas the Tank Engine he based the island of Sodor on his memories of visits to the Isle of Man. The film <!--del_lnk--> Thomas and the Magic Railroad was filmed in part on the Isle of Man.<p><a id="Myth.2C_Legend_and_Folklore" name="Myth.2C_Legend_and_Folklore"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Myth, Legend and Folklore</span></h3>
      <p>Like most Celtic races the Manx have a rich tradition of folklore, and there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the Buggane - a malevolent spirit who according to legend blew the roof off St Trinian&#39;s church in a fit of pique; and the Moddey Dhoo - a ghostly black dog who wandered the walls and corridors of Peel Castle.<p>The Isle of Man is also said to be home to fairies, known locally as &quot;the quaer fellas&quot; or &quot;themselves&quot;. There is a famous Fairy Bridge and it is said to be bad luck if one doesn&#39;t wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it.<p><a id="The_Tynwald" name="The_Tynwald"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Tynwald</span></h3>
      <p>The Island arguably has the oldest continuous parliament in the world, the <b><!--del_lnk--> Tynwald</b>, nominally founded in 979 AD (both the <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Icelandic</a> <!--del_lnk--> parliament and the <a href="../../wp/f/Faroe_Islands.htm" title="Faroe Islands">Faroese</a> <!--del_lnk--> parliament are older, but they were abolished between 1800 - 1845, and 1816 - 1852 respectively). The annual ceremonial meeting at Tynwald Hill, on <!--del_lnk--> Tynwald Day in July, continues the celebration of the Island&#39;s national day. The main purpose of the occasion is to read the titles and to give a brief description of the new laws which have been enacted by the Tynwald Court during the previous year.<p><a id="The_Triskelion" name="The_Triskelion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Triskelion</span></h3>

      <p>For centuries, the Island&#39;s symbol has been the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Triskelion and is similar to <!--del_lnk--> Sicily&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Trinacria: three bent legs, each with a spur, joined at the thigh. The Triskelion does not appear to have an official definition &mdash; Government publications, currency, flags, the tourist authority and others all use different variants. Most, but not all, preserve rotational symmetry. Some run clockwise, others anticlockwise. Some have the uppermost thigh at 12:00, others at 11:30 or 10:00, etc. Some have the knee bent at 90&deg;, some at 60&deg;, some at closer to 120&deg;. Also the degree of ornamentation of the leg wear and spur vary considerably.<p>The three legs relate directly to the island&#39;s motto &mdash; <i>Quocunque Jeceris Stabit</i>, which translates to <i>Whithersoever you throw it, it will stand.</i> Interpretations of the motto often stress stability and robustness in the Manx character. Many schools on the island have adapted the motto to promote perseverance and hard work.<p>Variations on the Triskelion are still in use on the coats of arms belonging to the different branches of the ancient Norwegian noble family that ruled Mann up until the 13th century. This particular version belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> Skancke branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Skanke family. The name stems from <i>skank</i>, the Norwegian version of the word <!--del_lnk--> shank. The Norse royal family of Man stayed on the island for some years after the death of <!--del_lnk--> Magnus III and the beginning of Scottish rule. The family&#39;s emigration only came after the a final attempt on the Manx&#39; part at restoring the old Sudreyar dynasty in the 1275 uprising against the Scots. This revolt failed disastrously, ending in the deaths of hundreds of rebels, including the last Norse King of Man, <!--del_lnk--> Godred IV Magnuson when the Manx suffered defeat in the decisive <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Ronaldsway, near <!--del_lnk--> Castletown. When the Norse-Manx royals arrived in Norway they took service as nobles of the Norwegian king, quickly becoming <!--del_lnk--> knights, <!--del_lnk--> landlords, and <!--del_lnk--> clergy under the Norwegian Crown.<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h2>

The Island started the <!--del_lnk--> Island Games in 1985.<p>Isle of Man teams and individuals participate in many sports both on and off the island.

      <p>One sport that originated on the Isle of Man is <!--del_lnk--> cammag. This is similar to the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> game of <!--del_lnk--> shinty, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Irish</a> <!--del_lnk--> hurling. It used to be the most widespread sport on the Isle of Man, but it ceased to be played after the introduction of <a href="../../wp/f/Football.htm" title="Football">football</a>, until very recently when it has been somewhat revived. It involves a <!--del_lnk--> stick (cammag) and a <!--del_lnk--> ball (crick) with anything between four and hundreds of players. Sometimes whole towns and villages took part, or even played each other. The cammag can be any stick with a bent end, and the crick can be made from cork or wood. Old accounts tell us that it was occasionally covered in a rag to make it less painful to hit. Cammag season started on <!--del_lnk--> Hunt the Wren Day (<!--del_lnk--> 26 December) and was only played by men (of all ages) during the winter. Realistically, it ceased to be played around 1900. However, in modern times, an annual match of cammag is played in <!--del_lnk--> St. John&#39;s (Balley Keill Eoin). As there are no rules to cammag, a trip to the local <!--del_lnk--> inn is advised to ease any feelings of cowardice beforehand!<p><a id="Famous_residents" name="Famous_residents"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Famous residents</span></h2>
