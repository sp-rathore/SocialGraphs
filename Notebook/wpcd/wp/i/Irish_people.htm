      <p>During the past 9,000 years of inhabitation, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> has witnessed many different peoples arrive on its shores. Legendary early arrivals included the <!--del_lnk--> Nemedians, the <!--del_lnk--> Fomorians, the <!--del_lnk--> Firbolgs and the <!--del_lnk--> Tuatha D&eacute; Danann, though with the exception of the Firbolgs, they are now treated as deities rather than actual human incursions.<p>A little over three-quarters (76.9%) of the Irish population belonged to the Catholic Church, 12.34% were Anglican, and 9.2% were Presbyterian. The most important of the minority religions were Methodists at 8%, and &lsquo;others&rsquo;&mdash;Baptists, Brethren, Quakers, etc.&mdash;together amounted to less than 1%. By the time of the First World War in 1914, there had been a slight decrease in the number of Catholics (73.86%), and a slight increases in Anglicans (13.13%) and Presbyterians (10.04%). There were also important changes in other congregation sizes: Methodists by 1914 made up 1.42% of the population, and others accounted for 1.55%.<p>The culture of the aboriginal Irish - though not the population - may have been transformed (or certainly influenced) by the arrival of Celtic culture from continental Europe between 600 BC and 150 BC. Despite assertions to the contrary, only a small number of Celts may or not have ever settled in Ireland. Irish insular culture therefore may have developed as a result of cultural exchange with the Celtic groups that did settle, those on mainland Europe, the peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Britain and the native Irish.<p>The names the ancient peoples of Ireland (creators of the Ceide Fields and <!--del_lnk--> Newgrange) used for themselves are not known, nor are their language(s). As late as the middle centuries of the <!--del_lnk--> 1st millennium <a href="../../wp/a/Anno_Domini.htm" title="Anno Domini">AD</a> the inhabitants of Ireland did not appear to have a collective name for themselves. Ireland itself was known by a number of different names &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Banba, <!--del_lnk--> Scotia, <!--del_lnk--> F&oacute;dla, <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;riu by the islanders; <!--del_lnk--> Hibernia and <!--del_lnk--> Scotia to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a>; Ierne to the <!--del_lnk--> Greeks.<p>Likewise, the terms for people from Ireland &ndash; all from <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> sources &ndash; in the late <!--del_lnk--> Roman era were varied. They included <!--del_lnk--> Attacotti, <!--del_lnk--> Scoti, and <!--del_lnk--> Gael. This last word, derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh <i>gwyddel</i> (meaning raiders), was eventually adopted by the Irish for themselves. However, as a term it is on a par with <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a>, as it describes an activity (raiding, piracy) and its proponents, not their actual ethnic affiliations. The general term <!--del_lnk--> Pretani (or the prefix prit-) was sometimes applied to all the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous inhabitants of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> (<i>&quot;Pretannic Isles&quot;</i>) by the Greeks. The equivalent Roman prefix for these <!--del_lnk--> celtic islands (which they called <i>Britannias</i> and <i>Britanniae</i>) was Brit-<!--del_lnk-->  (with similar pronunciation to prit-), and is the historical origin of the words Briton and British in <!--del_lnk--> Old English. Somewhat ironically, the word British is now more commonly associated with predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> than with its insular origins. However, Greek sources at the time cannot claim to have had an in-depth understanding of the ethnic nature of Ireland and Britain.<p>The term <i>Irish</i> and <i>Ireland</i> is derived from the <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;rainn, a people who once lived in what is now central and south <!--del_lnk--> Munster. Possibly their proximity to overseas trade with western <!--del_lnk--> Britain, <!--del_lnk--> Gaul and <!--del_lnk--> Hispania led to the name of this one people to be applied to the whole island and its inhabitants.<p>A variety of historical ethnic groups have inhabited the island, including the <!--del_lnk--> Airgialla, <!--del_lnk--> Fir Ol nEchmacht, <!--del_lnk--> Delbhna, <!--del_lnk--> Fir Bolg, <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;rainn, <!--del_lnk--> E&oacute;ganachta, Mairtine, <!--del_lnk--> Conmaicne, <!--del_lnk--> Soghain and <!--del_lnk--> Ulaid.<p>The shared language and culture of these peoples (and indeed the peoples of Atlantic Europe) is one that can be placed among the European peoples. Current genetic research supports the idea that people living in the Britain and Ireland are on average mainly descended from the indigenous European Paleolithic (Old Stone Age hunter gatherers) population (about 80%), with a smaller neolithic (New Stone Age farmers) input (about 20%). Paleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogenous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and then expanded into Europe during the <!--del_lnk--> Mesolithic period. The assumed genetic imprint of <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic incomers is seen as a cline, with stronger neolithic representation in the east of Europe and stronger paleolithic representation in the west of Europe.  The frequencies of Y-chromosome <!--del_lnk--> haplotypes in the Irish population are similar to that of most other populations of <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Europe, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Basques of northern Spain and southern France.  Y-chromosome analysis also seems to indicate that the Vikings that settled in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> came from <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a> rather than <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through the female line, shows part of the maternal ancestors of the Irish to be of broad <!--del_lnk--> north European origin.<p>Other recent evidence, involving a very large number of <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> <!--del_lnk--> markers distributed over the entire <!--del_lnk--> genome, suggests that most Irish people of today are genetically affiliated with people from other Celtic Nations, many Atlantic European populations and some other North European populations, while modern Spaniards and Portuguese have more Mediterranean inputs.  Genetic research shows that since humans settled in Ireland in the Paleolithic and Mesolithic times the main incoming populations were of broad North European origins, however in Spain the main incoming populations following Paleolithic times were of Mediterranean origins, although the Paleolithic element, also known as Basque or Iberian, continues to be the clearly dominant one in both areas to this day <!--del_lnk--> .<p>In fact, in two recently published books, Blood of the Isles, by Brian Sykes and Origins of Britons, By Stephen Oppenheimer, both authors state that according to genetic evidence, most Irish people and most Britons descend from the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula, as a result of different migrations that took place during the Mesolithic and the Neolithic and which laid the foundations for the present-day populations in the British Isles, indicating an ancient relationship among the populations of <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Europe.<p>One legend states that the Irish were descended from <!--del_lnk--> M&iacute;l Esp&aacute;ine (coined <i>Milesius</i>, from <i><a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a></i> &quot;Miles Hispaniae&quot;, meaning &quot;Soldier of <!--del_lnk--> Hispania&quot;). The character is almost certainly a mere personification of a supposed migration by a group or groups from <!--del_lnk--> Hispania to Ireland, but it is supported by the fact that the <!--del_lnk--> Celtiberian language is more closely related to <!--del_lnk--> insular Celtic than to any other. This legend is the source of the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Milesian&quot; in reference to the Irish. If this invasion was as large as the mythology would suggest, it would account for the genetic similarity of the Northern Iberian populations and the Irish.<p>The <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> were mainly <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norwegians</a> and despite their notorious reputation in <!--del_lnk--> Irish history, did not settle in particularly large numbers nor did they significantly alter the Irish polity. The arrival of the <!--del_lnk--> Normans brought <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Flanders.htm" title="Flanders">Flemish</a>, Normans, <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons and <!--del_lnk--> Bretons, most of whom became <!--del_lnk--> assimilated into <!--del_lnk--> Irish culture and polity by the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>. The late <!--del_lnk--> medieval era saw Scottish <!--del_lnk--> gallowglass families of mixed <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic-Norse<a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">-Pict</a> descent settle, mainly in the north; due to similarities of language and culture they too were assimilated. The <!--del_lnk--> Plantations of Ireland and in particular the <!--del_lnk--> Plantation of Ulster in the 17th century introduced great numbers of Scottish, <!--del_lnk--> English as well as <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <!--del_lnk--> Huguenots as colonists. Despite these divergent backgrounds most of their descendants consider themselves Irish &ndash; even where they are aware of such ancestry &ndash; mainly due to their lengthy presence in Ireland.<p>Historically, religion, politics and ethnicity became intertwined in Ireland, with <!--del_lnk--> Protestants generally identifying as British and Irish and most <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics as exclusively Irish. This is far less true today, although connections between <!--del_lnk--> ethnicity and <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a> can still be observed - especially in <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Four polls taken between 1989 and 1994 revealed that when asked to state their national identity, over 79% of Northern Ireland Protestants replied &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot; with 3% or less replying &quot;Irish&quot;, while over 60% of Northern Ireland Catholics replied &quot;Irish&quot; with 13% or less replying &quot;British&quot; or &quot;Ulster&quot;. A survey in 1999 showed that 72% of Northern Ireland Protestants considered themselves &quot;British&quot; and 2% &quot;Irish&quot;, with 68% of Northern Ireland Catholics considering themselves &quot;Irish&quot; and 9% &quot;British&quot;. The survey also revealed that 78% of Protestants and 48% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly British&quot;, while 77% of Catholics and 35% of all respondents felt &quot;Strongly Irish&quot;. 51% of Protestants and 33% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all Irish&quot;, while 62% of Catholics and 28% of all respondents felt &quot;Not at all British&quot;.<p>It is thought that the majority of the Irish population is descended from the initial settlers who arrived after the end of the last <!--del_lnk--> Ice Age, as can be seen in the high presence of the genetic marker known as <!--del_lnk--> R1b among the Irish. The genetic marker <!--del_lnk--> R1b averages at 90% amongst Irish Y-Chromosomes, Welsh Y-Chromosomes and amongst the Y-Chromosomes of the Basques of Northern Spain and South-Western France. Haplotype <!--del_lnk--> R1b averages 78% in the British Isles, 73% in Spain, 64% in Belgium, 55% in France and 40% in Germany.<p>For the global genetic make-up of the Irish and other peoples, see also: <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  and <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Surnames" name="Surnames"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Surnames</span></h2>
      <p>It is common for some Irish surnames to be <!--del_lnk--> anglicised, meaning that they were changed to sound more <!--del_lnk--> Hiberno-English. This usually occurred with Irish immigrants arriving in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> during the 19th century and the early 20th century, and and when British settlers arrived in Ireland.<p>It is also very common for people of <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic origin to have surnames beginning with &quot; &Oacute;&quot; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Mc&quot; (less frequently &quot;Mac&quot; and occasionally shortened to just &quot;Ma&quot; at the beginning of the name). &quot;O&quot; was originally &Oacute; which in turn came from Ua (originally hUa), which means &quot;<!--del_lnk--> grandson&quot;, or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> descendant&quot; of a named person. For example, the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> High King of Ireland <!--del_lnk--> Brian Boru were known as the Ua Brian (<!--del_lnk--> O&#39;Brien) clan. The prefix is often incorrectly written as O&#39;, using an English apostrophe instead of the Irish <!--del_lnk--> fada mark.<p>&quot;Mac&quot; or &quot;Mc&quot; means &quot;son of&quot;; many names also begin with this. There is no basis in fact for the claim that Mac is Scottish and Mc is Irish: Mc is simply an abbreviation of Mac. However, while both Mac and O&#39; prefixes are Gaelic in origin, Mc is more common in <!--del_lnk--> Ulster and O&#39; is far less common in Scotland than it is in Ireland. Some common surnames that begin with &Oacute; are: &Oacute; Reilly, &Oacute; Neill, &Oacute; Brien, &Oacute; Connor, &Oacute; <!--del_lnk--> Hickey, &Oacute; Leary, &Oacute; Shaughnessy, &Oacute; Donnell, &Oacute; Dowd, &Oacute; Toole, &Oacute; Meara, &Oacute; Malley, &Oacute; Hara, and &Oacute; Bradaigh,&Oacute; Sheanach&aacute;in . Some names that begin with Mac are: MacDermott, MacCarthy, MacDonough, MacDonnell, MacQuillan, MacGuinness, MacLaughlin, MacGuire, MacMahon and MacCormack.<p>&quot;<b>Fitz</b>&quot; is a version of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> word <b>fils</b>, used by the Normans, meaning <i>son</i>, which is the equivalent to the Scandinavian way to name a person. (It must be remembered that the <!--del_lnk--> Normans, although coming at that time from present day <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, were descendents of <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Vikings">Vikings</a> who settled in <!--del_lnk--> Normandy and had thoroughly adopted French ways and language.)<p>A few names that begin with Fitz are: FitzGerald, FitzSimmons, FitzGibbons, <!--del_lnk--> Fitzpatrick and FitzHenry, most of whom descend from the inital Norman settlers. Exceptions occur in a small number of Irish families of <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic origin who came to use a Norman form of their original surname - witness Mac Giolla Ph&aacute;draig becoming FitzPatrick - while some assimilated so well that the Gaelic name was dropped in favour of a new, Hiberno-Norman form. Cases in this category include Mac Gilla Mo-Cholomoc of <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> becoming FitzDermot (after Dermot or Diarmaid Mac Gilla Mo-Cholomoc).<p>Other Norman families derived their name from places or people in Ireland. This was the case of the family of Athy (see <!--del_lnk--> Tribes of Galway) who took their surname, de Athy, from the town of that name in Leinster. More common, however, was that the Normans became <!--del_lnk--> &#39;Hiberniores Hibernis ipsis&#39; and in this process the Fitzmaurices became Mac Muiris, the Fitzsimons became Mac S&iacute;om&oacute;in and Mac an Ridire, Fitzgerald became Mac Gearailt, Bermingham became Mac Fheorais, Nangle became Mac Coisdeala, Staunton became Mac an Mh&iacute;leadha, and so forth.<p>In the late <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/13th_century.htm" title="13th century">13th century</a> <!--del_lnk--> Norman, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Welsh</a>, <!--del_lnk--> English, <!--del_lnk--> Flemish and <!--del_lnk--> Breton peoples arrived in Ireland at the request of <!--del_lnk--> Diarmait Mac Murchada, <!--del_lnk--> King of Leinster, and took over parts of the island. During the next three hundred years, they intermarried with ruling <!--del_lnk--> Irish clans, adopted Irish culture and the <!--del_lnk--> Irish language and as the English put it &quot;became <!--del_lnk--> more Irish than the Irish themselves&quot;. Another common Irish surname of <!--del_lnk--> Norman Irish origin is the &#39;de&#39; habitational prefix, meaning &#39;of the&#39; and originally signifying prestige and land ownership. Many Irish surnames share this: <!--del_lnk--> de B&uacute;rca (Burke), <!--del_lnk--> de Br&uacute;n, <!--del_lnk--> de Barra, <!--del_lnk--> de Stac, <!--del_lnk--> de Ti&uacute;it, <!--del_lnk--> de Faoite(White), <!--del_lnk--> de Paor (Power), and so forth.<p>It should be emphasised, especially with Gaelic surnames, there may be two or more unrelated families bearing the same or similar surnames. For example, there were at least nine separate &Oacute; Ceallaigh <!--del_lnk--> septs, all unrelated. The Mac Lochlainn, &Oacute; Mael Sechlainn, &Oacute; Mael Sechnaill, &Oacute; Conchobair Mac Loughlin and Mac Diarmata Mac Loughlin families, all distinct, are now all subsumed together as MacLoughlin. The full surname usually indicated which family was in question, something that has being diminished with the loss of prefixes such as &Oacute; and Mac. In addition, in <!--del_lnk--> Classical Irish when a Mac surname was followed by a name which began with a vowel, the Mac became Mag. This explains why one will still see the older spelling of Mac Aonghusa (McGuinness) as Mag Aonghusa, Mac Uidhir (Maguire) as Mag Uidhir, and so forth.<p>Furthermore, different branches of a family with the same surname sometimes used distinguishing epithets, which sometimes became surnames in their own right. Hence the chief of the clan &Oacute; Cearnaigh (Kearney) was referred to as An tSionnach (Fox), which his descendants use to this day.<p>Similar surnames are often found in Scotland for many reasons, such as the use of a common language and mass Irish immigration to Scotland in the late 19th and early to mid-20th centuries. Also Scottish surnames are noticeable in some Catholics in Ireland due to intermarriage and pre-Reformation immigration.<p><a id="Personal_names_.28forenames.29" name="Personal_names_.28forenames.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personal names (forenames)</span></h2>
      <p>Personal names in modern Ireland are derived from traditional Irish names, <!--del_lnk--> anglicised Irish names, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> names and, more recently, popular <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> names.<p>The recent years have seen a major decline in most Irish names for babies being born in the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>. While in the past names such as Patrick (a name of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman</a> origin), S&eacute;amus (the Irish form of James) and others were almost ubiquitous in any family, today they are among the rarer names for children and the same goes for most other Irish names, although there are a few notable exceptions. Conor remains very popular, having topped the Most Popular new names for babies list many years running. The name Jack, which is an Irish diminutive of John, James and Jacob, has grown in popularity. <!--del_lnk--> Se&aacute;n, also derived from the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew root John, remains one of the most popular Irish names. Male names from across the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> have seen a surge in popularity from the mid 1990s, names such as Taylor being a good example of this. There are many other Anglicised Irish names which remain popular, such as Ryan, Neil and others remaining on the Names List. <!--del_lnk--> Biblical names also form a large composition, such as Matthew, Philip and Paul.<p>Aside from Se&aacute;n other male names from the <!--del_lnk--> Norman-Irish tradition include Gear&oacute;id (Gerard), Piaras (Pearse), &Eacute;amonn and Liam and indeed the very use of the name P&aacute;draig (Patrick) is a Norman tradition. Prior to the Normans the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeil, out of reverence to Saint Patrick, named their children Giolla Ph&aacute;draig, the servant of Patrick. <!--del_lnk--> Piaras is an interesting example of how both Norman and English traditions collided. Piaras is from the <!--del_lnk--> Norman-French Piers which itself is derived from the Latin, Petrus. Piaras was a common name in late medieval and early modern Ireland. However, with the expansion of British rule the English name Peter, which shares the same Latin root, began to replace it. Today, the Irish version (Peadar) of the English name (Peter), tends to be more common than the Irish version (Piaras) of the older Norman name (Piers). Thus, families with <!--del_lnk--> Norman surnames where Piaras has been a traditional name have broken the link to their historic tradition. An exception to this would be in the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeltachta&iacute; where, for example, Piaras would still be very common, especially in the <!--del_lnk--> Corca Dhuibhne area of <!--del_lnk--> County Kerry due to the legacy of <!--del_lnk--> Piaras Feirit&eacute;ar, where Piaras remains a very common name in the Feirit&eacute;ar family. The maintenance of such traditions in personal names outside the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeltachta&iacute; would generally be a sign of more educated parents. In an analogous way to Piaras, Irish families of <!--del_lnk--> patrilineal <!--del_lnk--> Gaelic descent sometimes use the Irish version (S&eacute;arlas) of the English name, Charles, rather than the name with a much longer vintage in their families, Cathal. Where Cathal is used it is often wrongly termed &quot;the Irish for Charles&quot; in a similar way to which the ancient Irish personal name, &Aacute;ine, is wrongly said to be an Irish version of the English word, Anne. Rather, both <!--del_lnk--> Cathal and <!--del_lnk--> &Aacute;ine are two <i>very</i> ancient Irish names with no etymological link whatsoever to the above English names.<p>For females, the traditional Irish names are far more popular, although their spellings are not always uniform. Names such as Mary, Ann, and Eileen which were hugely common in the past have now declined, although there was always much more variety in female names than in male. Today Aoife, Aisling, Ciara, Sin&eacute;ad, and Orla are more popular as traditional Irish names, while foreign names such as Ella, Emma, Lisa, Rachel and Isabelle have seen a rise in popularity. Some older names have maintained their popularity, such as Sarah, Kate, Catherine and Louise. Female names from the <!--del_lnk--> Norman-Irish tradition are widespread and among the most traditional of Irish personal names. In a similar way to the name P&aacute;draig (Patrick), in the pre-Norman tradition M&aacute;ire did not exist but rather Maol Muire, devotee of the virgin Mary, was the normal Irish usage. Other common Irish female names of <!--del_lnk--> Norman origin (with their anglicised form) are Caitr&iacute;ona (Catherine), S&iacute;le (Sheila), Caitl&iacute;n (Kathleen), C&aacute;it (Kate), Gear&oacute;id&iacute;n (Geraldine), Sin&eacute;ad (Jane, Janet etc) and Siobh&aacute;n (Susan, June etc). English names such as Victoria, Elizabeth, and Rebecca, while never hugely popular have also seen a decline in popularity, while some Irish names such as Bridget, Una and Maureen have dropped off the list altogether.<p>There can be major differentiations between regions. A personal name can still often indicate where a person, more precisely a man, is from. This is accounted for chiefly in the sainthood cults which have been traditional throughout the island. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> Fionnbharr is more common in Cork, <!--del_lnk--> Finnian in Meath and <!--del_lnk--> Donegal, <!--del_lnk--> Fion&aacute;n in Kerry, and so forth, where these particular saints are institutionalised in local tradition. Seaghan remains the <!--del_lnk--> Ulster Irish spelling of <!--del_lnk--> Se&aacute;n, though S&eacute;an, with the fada over the E, is also common. P&aacute;id&iacute; is more common in the <!--del_lnk--> Kerry Gaeltacht than elsewhere, and so forth. As in the Feirit&eacute;ar family above, the first name can also often indicate a family tradition as well as place.<p>See <!--del_lnk--> List of Irish given names<p><a id="Recent_history" name="Recent_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recent history</span></h2>
      <p>In <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> about 53.1% of the population are <!--del_lnk--> Protestant (21.1% Presbyterian, 15.5% Church of Ireland, 3.6% Methodist, 6.1% Other Christian) whilst a large minority are <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic at approximately 43.8%, as of 2001.<p>After Ireland became subdued by England in 1603 the English &ndash; under <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I of England</a> (reigned 1603 &ndash; 1625), <!--del_lnk--> Lord Protector, <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> (term 1653 &ndash; 1658), <a href="../../wp/w/William_III_of_England.htm" title="William III of England">William III of England</a> (reigned 1689 &ndash; 1702) and their successors &ndash; began the settling of Protestant <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a>, and later Scottish <!--del_lnk--> colonists into Ireland, where they settled most heavily in the northern <!--del_lnk--> province of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster. However, they did not intermarry heavily or <!--del_lnk--> integrate with the native Irish like the Normans did centuries earlier.<p>Tens of thousands of native Irish were displaced during the 17th century Plantations of Ireland from parts of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, and were replaced by English and Scottish planters. Only in the major part of Ulster did the plantations prove long-lived; the other three provinces (<!--del_lnk--> Connaught, <!--del_lnk--> Leinster, and <!--del_lnk--> Munster) remained heavily Catholic, and eventually, the Protestant populations of those three provinces would decrease drastically as a result of the political developments in the early 20th century in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>.<p>It is predominately religion, history and political differences (<!--del_lnk--> Irish nationalism versus British <!--del_lnk--> unionism) that divide the two communities, as many of the <!--del_lnk--> Scotch-Irish settlers are in part of <!--del_lnk--> Celtic origin themselves and therefore related to their Irish Catholic neighbours.<p>Conversely, many Irish people would have at least some English or Scottish (<!--del_lnk--> gallowglass families from the Highlands) ancestry.<p>In 1921, with the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State, six counties in the northeast remained in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.<p>&quot;Ulster-Irish&quot; surnames tend to differ based on which community families originate from. Ulster Protestants tend to have either <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> surnames while Roman Catholics tend to have Irish surnames, although this is not always the case. There are many Catholics in Northern Ireland with surnames such as Emerson, Whitson, Livingstone, Hardy, Tennyson, MacDonald (however this surname is also common with Highland Roman Catholics in Scotland), Dunbar, Groves, Legge, Scott, Gray, Page, Stewart, Rowntree, Henderson, et al; almost certainly due to intermarriage. A report commissioned by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs states that:<p>The government of the Republic of Ireland notes that prejudice against the Irish is still found in some parts of the United Kingdom.<dl>
       <dd><i>The post-1945 Irish population has therefore been caught between these two images.

Although many of them were caught and executed by the American government, some escaped and remained in Mexico. The battalion are commemorated in Mexico on Saint Patricks&#39;s day and on September 12, the anniversary of the first executions.<p><a id="Notable_Irish_people_.28selection.29" name="Notable_Irish_people_.28selection.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notable Irish people (selection)</span></h2>
