It was the third largest navy in the world by 1920 behind <!--del_lnk--> United States Navy and <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and perhaps the most modern at the brink of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. It was supported by <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet.<p>The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy trace back to early interactions with <!--del_lnk--> nations on the <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian continent</a>, beginning in the early <!--del_lnk--> medieval period and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of <!--del_lnk--> cultural exchange with <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> <!--del_lnk--> powers during the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Discovery. After two centuries of stagnation during the country&#39;s ensuing <!--del_lnk--> seclusion policy under the <!--del_lnk--> shoguns of the <!--del_lnk--> Edo period, Japan&#39;s Navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by <!--del_lnk--> American intervention in 1854. This eventually led to the <!--del_lnk--> Meiji Restoration, a period of frantic <!--del_lnk--> modernization and <!--del_lnk--> industrialization accompanied by the re-ascendance of the <!--del_lnk--> emperor. The navy&#39;s history of successes, sometimes against much more powerful foes as in the 1895 <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Japanese war and the 1905 <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War, ended in almost complete annihilation during the concluding days of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.

      <p>Japan has a long history of naval interaction with the Asian continent, involving transportation of troops between <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> and Japan, starting at least with the beginning of the <!--del_lnk--> Kofun period in the 3rd century.<p>Following the attempts at <!--del_lnk--> Mongol invasions of Japan by <!--del_lnk--> Kubilai Khan in 1281, Japanese &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wak&#x14D;&quot; <!--del_lnk--> pirates became very active in <!--del_lnk--> plundering the coast of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Empire.<p>Japan undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the <!--del_lnk--> Warring States period, when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time, Japan may have developed one of the first <!--del_lnk--> ironclad warships, when <!--del_lnk--> Oda Nobunaga, a <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <!--del_lnk--> daimyo, had six iron-covered <!--del_lnk--> Oatakebune made in 1576.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> Japanese invasion of Korea (1592-1598), a navy of about 700 ships and manned by 10,000 sailors was organized by <!--del_lnk--> Toyotomi Hideyoshi for the transportation and support of a land force of about 160,000. The transportation ships were subject to the attacks of the powerful Joseon Dynasty navy. The Japanese Navy suffered a series of defeats, at the hands of Korean Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Yi Sun-sin, using <!--del_lnk--> turtle ships, or Geobukson. After re-organizing the Navy, Japan won an engagement against Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Won Kyun of the <!--del_lnk--> Joseon Dynasty navy, and several skirmishes against Admirals <!--del_lnk--> Yi Eok Ki and <!--del_lnk--> Choi Ho of the <!--del_lnk--> Ming China navy. The sea route between the Japanese mainland and the Korean south coast was maintained by the activity of the navy throughout the campaign, allowing for the circulation of men and goods.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Japan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the <!--del_lnk--> Nanban trade period. In 1613, the Daimyo of <!--del_lnk--> Sendai, in agreement with the <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa <!--del_lnk--> Bakufu, built <!--del_lnk--> <i>Date Maru</i>, a 500 ton <!--del_lnk--> galleon-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of <a href="../../wp/h/Hasekura_Tsunenaga.htm" title="Hasekura Tsunenaga">Hasekura Tsunenaga</a> to the Americas, which then continued to Europe. From 1604, about 350 <!--del_lnk--> Red seal ships, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, were also commissioned by the Bakufu, mainly for <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asian trade.<p>From 1640, Japan chose the policy of <!--del_lnk--> Sakoku (seclusion), which forbade contacts with the West, eradicated <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death.<p>The study of Western <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding techniques resumed in the 1840s during the <!--del_lnk--> Late Tokugawa shogunate (&quot;Bakumatsu&quot;). In 1853 and 1854, <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Navy Commodore <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Perry made a demonstration of force with the newest steam warships of the U.S. Navy. Perry finally obtained the opening of the country to international trade through the 1854 <!--del_lnk--> Convention of Kanagawa. This was soon followed by the 1858 &quot;<!--del_lnk--> unequal&quot; <!--del_lnk--> U.S.-Japan Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which allowed the establishment of foreign concessions, extra-territoriality for foreigners, and minimal import taxes for foreign goods.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>As soon as Japan agreed to open up to foreign influence, the Tokugawa shogun government initiated an active policy of assimilation of Western naval technologies. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the Shogunate acquired its first steam warship, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kank&#x14D; Maru</i>, which was used for training, and established the <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki Naval Training Centre. In 1857, it acquired its first screw-driven steam warship, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kanrin Maru</i>. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, such as the future Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Takeaki Enomoto (who studied in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> from 1862&ndash;1867), starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders such as Admirals <!--del_lnk--> Heihachiro Togo and, later, <!--del_lnk--> Isoroku Yamamoto. In 1865, the French naval engineer <!--del_lnk--> L&eacute;once Verny was hired to build Japan&#39;s first modern naval arsenals, at <!--del_lnk--> Yokosuka and <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki.<p>By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Tokugawa navy was already the largest of Eastern Asia, organized around eight Western-style steam warships and the flagship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kaiy&#x14D; Maru</i>, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the <!--del_lnk--> Boshin War, under the command of Admiral Enomoto. The conflict culminated with the <!--del_lnk--> Naval Battle of Hakodate in 1869, Japan&#39;s first large-scale modern naval battle, and ended with the defeat of the last Tokugawa forces and the restoration of Imperial rule.<p><a id="Creation_of_the_Imperial_Japanese_Navy_.281869.29" name="Creation_of_the_Imperial_Japanese_Navy_.281869.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Creation of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1869)</span></h2>

      <p>From 1868, the restored <!--del_lnk--> Meiji Emperor continued with reforms to industrialize and militarize Japan to prevent the United States and European powers from overwhelming her. On <!--del_lnk--> 17 January <!--del_lnk--> 1868, the Ministry of Military Affairs (also known as the Army-Navy Ministry) was established, with <!--del_lnk--> Iwakura Tomomi, <!--del_lnk--> Shimazu Tadayoshi and <!--del_lnk--> Prince Komatsu Yoshiakira as the First Secretaries. On <!--del_lnk--> 26 March <!--del_lnk--> 1868, the first Naval Review was held in Japan (in <!--del_lnk--> Osaka Bay), with 6 ships from the private domainal navies of <!--del_lnk--> Saga, <!--del_lnk--> Ch&#x14D;sh&#x16B;, <!--del_lnk--> Satsuma, <!--del_lnk--> Kurume, <!--del_lnk--> Kumamoto and <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2252 tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the <!--del_lnk--> Boshin War.<p>In 1871, the private domainal navies were abolished, and their 11 ships were added to the 7 surviving vessels of the defunct Tokugawa <i>bakufu</i> navy to form the core of the new Imperial Japanese Navy. In 1872, the Ministry of Military Affairs was replaced by a separate Army Ministry and Navy Ministry. In October 1873, <!--del_lnk--> Katsu Kaishu became Navy Minister. The new government drafted an ambitious plan to create a Navy with 200 ships organized into 10 fleets. It was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources. Domestic rebellions, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Satsuma Rebellion (1877) forced the government to focus on land warfare. Naval policy, expressed by the slogan <i>Shusei Kokub&#x14D;</i> (Jp:&#x5B88;&#x52E2;&#x56FD;&#x9632;, lit. &quot;Static Defense&quot;), focused on coastal defenses, a standing army, and a coastal Navy, leading to a military organization under the <i>Rikushu Kaij&#x16B;</i> (Jp:&#x9678;&#x4E3B;&#x6D77;&#x5F93;, Army first, Navy second) principle.<p><a id="British_support" name="British_support"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">British support</span></h3>
      <p>During the 1870s and 1880s, the Imperial Japanese Navy remained an essentially coastal defense force, although the Meiji government continued to modernize it. The <i><!--del_lnk--> Jho Sho Maru</i> (soon renamed <i>Ry&#x16B;j&#x14D; Maru</i>) commissioned by <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Glover was launched at <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1869. In 1870, an Imperial decree determined that <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> should be the model for development. Ships such as the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fus&#x14D;</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kong&#x14D;</i> and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hiei</i> were built in British shipyards specifically for the Imperial Japanese Navy. A British naval mission visited Japan in 1873, headed by Comdr. <!--del_lnk--> Archibald Douglas. Later, Comdr. <!--del_lnk--> L.P. Willan was hired in 1879 to train naval cadets. Private construction companies such as <!--del_lnk--> Ishikawajima and <!--del_lnk--> Kawasaki also emerged around this time.<p>Two large warships were ordered from British shipyards. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Naniwa</i> and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Takachiho</i> were 3,650 ton ships. They were capable of speeds up to 18&nbsp;knots (33&nbsp;km/h) and were armed with 2 to 3-inch deck armor and two 10.2-in (260&nbsp;mm) <!--del_lnk--> Krupp guns. The naval architect Sas&#x14D; Sach&#x16B; designed these on the line of the <!--del_lnk--> Elswick class of <!--del_lnk--> protected cruisers but with superior specifications. An <!--del_lnk--> arms race was taking place with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> however, who equipped herself with two huge German <!--del_lnk--> battleships of 7,335 tons (<!--del_lnk--> <i>Ting Y&uuml;an</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Chen-Y&uuml;an</i>). Unable to confront the Chinese fleet with only two modern cruisers, Japan resorted to French assistance to build a large, modern fleet which could prevail in the upcoming conflict.<p><a id="Influence_of_the_French_.22Jeune_Ecole.22_.281880s.29" name="Influence_of_the_French_.22Jeune_Ecole.22_.281880s.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Influence of the French &quot;Jeune Ecole&quot; (1880s)</span></h3>

      <p>During the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Jeune Ecole&quot; (&quot;Young school&quot;) doctrine favoring small, fast warships, especially <!--del_lnk--> cruisers and <!--del_lnk--> torpedo boats, against bigger units. The Meiji government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats. The naval successes of the <!--del_lnk--> French Navy against China in the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-French War of 1883&ndash;85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan. In 1885, the new Navy slogan became <i>Kaikoku Nippon</i> (Jp:&#x6D77;&#x56FD;&#x65E5;&#x672C;, lit. &quot;Maritime Japan&quot;).<p>In 1886, the leading French Navy engineer <!--del_lnk--> Emile Bertin was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of <!--del_lnk--> Kure and <!--del_lnk--> Sasebo. He developed the <i>Sanseikan</i> class of cruisers; 3 units featuring a single powerful main gun, the 12.6&nbsp;in (320&nbsp;mm) <!--del_lnk--> Canet gun. Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than twenty units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of <!--del_lnk--> Yokosuka:<ul>
       <li>3 cruisers: the 4,700 ton <!--del_lnk--> <i>Matsushima</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Itsukushima</i>, built in France, and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hashidate</i>, built at Yokosuka.<li>3 coastal warships of 4,278 tons.<li>2 small cruisers: the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Chiyoda</i>, a small cruiser of 2,439 tons built in Britain, and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yaeyama</i>, 1800 tons, built at Yokosuka.<li>1 <!--del_lnk--> frigate, the 1600 tons <!--del_lnk--> <i>Takao</i>, built at Yokosuka.<li>1 <!--del_lnk--> destroyer: the 726 tons <!--del_lnk--> <i>Chishima</i>, built in France.<li>16 torpedo boats of 54 tons each, built in France by the <!--del_lnk--> Companie du Creusot in 1888, and assembled in Japan.</ul>
      <p>This period also allowed Japan &quot;to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in <!--del_lnk--> torpedoes, torpedo-boats and <!--del_lnk--> mines, of which the French at the time were probably the world&#39;s best exponents&quot; (Howe, p281). Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a &quot;Torpedo Training Centre&quot; at Yokosuka in 1886.<div class="thumb tright">

Although Japan turned out victorious, the two large German-made battleships of the Chinese Navy remained almost impervious to Japanese guns, highlighting the need for bigger capital ships in the Japanese Navy (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Ting Yuan</i> was finally sunk by torpedoes, and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Chen-Yuan</i> was captured with little damage). The next step of the Imperial Japanese Navy&#39;s expansion would thus involve a combination of heavily armed large warships, with smaller and innovative offensive units permitting aggressive tactics.<p>As a result of the conflict, under the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Shimonoseki (April 17th, 1895), <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Pescadores Islands were transferred to Japan.

Japan also obtained the <!--del_lnk--> Liaodong Peninsula, although she was forced by Russia to return it to China, only to see Russia take possession of it soon after.<p>The Imperial Japanese Navy further intervened in China in 1900, by participating together with Western Powers to the suppression of the Chinese <!--del_lnk--> Boxer Rebellion. The Navy supplied the largest number of warships (18, out of a total of 50 warships), and delivered the largest contingent of Army and Navy troops among the intervening nations (20,840 soldiers, out of total of 54,000).<div class="medialist multivideolist">

      <p>One of these battleships, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Mikasa</i>, the most advanced ship of her time, was ordered from the <!--del_lnk--> Vickers shipyard in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> at the end of 1898, for delivery to Japan in 1902. Commercial shipbuilding in Japan was exhibited by construction of the twin screw steamer <i>Aki-Maru</i>, built for <!--del_lnk--> Nippon Yusen Kaisha by the <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi Dockyard &amp; Engine Works, <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki. The imperial Japanese cruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Chitose</i> was built at the <!--del_lnk--> Union Iron Works in <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>.<p>These dispositions culminated with the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War (1904&ndash;1905).

The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated: out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, 7 captured, 6 disarmed, 4,545 Russian servicemen died and 6,106 were taken prisoner. On the other hand, the Japanese only lost 116 men and 3 torpedo boats.

      <p>During the Russo-Japanese war, Japan also made frantic efforts to have a fleet of submarines. Submarines had only recently become operational military engines, and were considered to be special weapons of considerable potential. The Imperial Japanese Navy acquired its first submarines in 1905 from the United States <!--del_lnk--> Electric Boat Company, barely four years after the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Navy had commissioned its own first submarine, <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Holland</i>. The ships were <!--del_lnk--> Holland designs. They were shipped in kit to Japan and then assembled at the <!--del_lnk--> Yokosuka Naval Yard, to become hulls <i>No1</i> through <i>5</i>, and became operational at the end of 1905.<p><a id="Towards_an_autonomous_national_Navy" name="Towards_an_autonomous_national_Navy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Towards an autonomous national Navy</span></h2>
      <p>Japan continued in its efforts to build up a strong national naval industry. Following a strategy of &quot;Copy, improve, innovate&quot;, foreign ships of various designs were usually analysed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements. Over the years, the importation of whole classes of ships was progressively substituted by local assembly, and then complete local production, starting with the smallest ships, such as torpedo boats and cruisers in the 1880s, to finish with whole battleships in the early 1900s. The last major purchase was in 1913 when the <!--del_lnk--> battlecruiser <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kong&#x14D;</i> was purchased from the <!--del_lnk--> Vickers shipyard. By 1918, there was no aspect of shipbuilding technology where Japanese capabilities fell significantly below world standards. By 1920, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world&#39;s third largest navy, and was a leader in many aspects of naval development:<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Imperial Japanese Navy was faced, before and during World War II, with considerable challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world. Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy, so that the Imperial Japanese Navy had to secure and protect sources for raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials) that were far away, and controlled by foreign countries (Britain, the United States and <!--del_lnk--> the Netherlands). To achieve this goal, she had to build large warships capable of a long range.<p>To achieve Japan&rsquo;s expansionist policies, the Imperial Japanese Navy also had to fight off the largest navies in the world (The 1922 <!--del_lnk--> Washington Naval Treaty allotted a 5/5/3 ratio for the navies of Britain, the United States and Japan). She was therefore numerically inferior and her industrial base for expansion was limited (in particular compared to the United States). Her battle tactics therefore tended to rely on technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in her previous conflicts).<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>During the interwar, Japan therefore took the lead in many areas of warship development:<ul>
       <li>In 1921 it launched the <!--del_lnk--> <i>H&#x14D;sh&#x14D;</i>, the first purpose-designed <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> in the world to be completed, and subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers second to none.<li>In keeping with its belief in big-gun action, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the first navy to mount 14-in (356&nbsp;mm) guns (with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Kong&#x14D;</i>), 16-in (406&nbsp;mm) guns (with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Nagato</i>), and the only Navy ever to mount <!--del_lnk--> 18.1-in (460&nbsp;mm) guns (with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Yamato</i>).<li>In 1928, it launched the innovative <i><!--del_lnk--> Fubuki</i>-class <!--del_lnk--> destroyer, introducing enclosed turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire and the 24-inch (610&nbsp;mm) oxygen fuelled Type 93 torpedo. The new destroyer design was soon emulated by other navies.<li>Japan developed the oxygen fuelled <!--del_lnk--> Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedo, generally recognized as the best torpedo in the world, down to the end of World War II (Westwood, <i>Fighting Ships</i>).</ul>
      <p>Japan sometimes continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas where it needed to catch up with the West: in 1921 it welcomed for a year and a half the <!--del_lnk--> Sempill Mission, a group of British aeronaval instructors who trained the Imperial Japanese Navy on several new aircraft, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Gloster Sparrowhawk, and various techniques such as torpedo bombing and flight control.<p>During the pre-war years, two schools of thought battled over whether the Navy should be organized around powerful battleships that could ultimately win over American ones in Japanese waters, or around an aggressive fleet of aircraft carriers. Neither really prevailed, and both lines of ships were developed, with the results that neither solution displayed overwhelming strength over the American adversary. A consistent weakness of Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate too much armament, and too much engine power, in comparison to ship size (a side-effect of the Washington treaty), leading to shortcomings in stability, protection and structural strength.<p><a id="World_War_II" name="World_War_II"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese Navy in World War Two was administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Ministry of the Navy of Japan and controlled by the Chief of the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff at <!--del_lnk--> Imperial General Headquarters. In order to combat the numerically superior American navy, the IJN devoted large amounts of resources to creating a force superior in quality to any navy at the time. Consequently, at the beginning of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Japan probably had the most sophisticated Navy in the world. Betting on the speedy success of aggressive tactics, Japan did not invest significantly on defensive organization: she should also have been able to protect her long shipping lines against enemy submarines, which she never managed to do, particularly under-investing in <!--del_lnk--> anti-submarine escort ships and <!--del_lnk--> escort aircraft carriers.<p>The Japanese Navy enjoyed spectacular success during the first part of the hostilities, but American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through technological upgrades to its air and naval forces and a vastly stronger industrial output. Japan&#39;s reluctance to use their <!--del_lnk--> submarine fleet for commerce raiding and failure to secure their communications also added to their defeat. During the last phase of the war the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including <!--del_lnk--> Kamikaze (suicide) actions by a variety of <!--del_lnk--> Special Attack Units.<p><a id="Battleships" name="Battleships"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Battleships</span></h3>

      <p>Japan continued to attribute considerable prestige to <!--del_lnk--> battleships and endeavoured to build the largest and most powerful ships of the period. <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamato</i>, the largest and most heavily-armed battleship in history, was launched in 1941.<p>The second half of World War II saw the last battleship duels. In the <a href="../../wp/n/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal.htm" title="Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">Battle of Guadalcanal</a> on <!--del_lnk--> November 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1942, the United States battleships <!--del_lnk--> <i>South Dakota</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Washington</i> fought and destroyed the Japanese battleship <!--del_lnk--> <i>Kirishima</i>. In the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 25 October <!--del_lnk--> 1944 six battleships, led by Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Jesse Oldendorf of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. 7th Fleet fired upon and claimed credit for sinking Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Shoji Nishimura&#39;s battleships <!--del_lnk--> <i>Yamashiro</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Fus&#x14D;</i> during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Surigao Strait; in fact, both battleships were fatally crippled by destroyer attacks before being brought under fire by Oldendorf&#39;s old battleships.<p>Nevertheless, the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Samar on <!--del_lnk--> 25 October <!--del_lnk--> 1944 during the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a> showed that battleships could still be useful, albeit inefficient weapons. Only the indecision of Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Takeo Kurita and the fight by American destroyers and <!--del_lnk--> destroyer escorts saved the American aircraft carriers of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Taffy 3&quot; from being pounded to the bottom by the gunfire of <i>Yamato</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kong&#x14D;</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Nagato</i> and their cruiser host. Miraculously for the Americans, only <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Gambier Bay</i> along with two destroyers and one destroyer escort were lost due to surface action. The <i>Yamato</i>, for all the expense that went into building her, failed to score even a single hit.<p>Ultimately, the advent of air power spelled doom for the battleship. Battleships in the Pacific ended up primarily performing shore bombardment and anti-aircraft defense for the carriers. The <i>Yamato</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Musashi</i> were sunk by aircraft attacks long before they could come within striking range of the American fleet. As a result of the changing technology, plans for even larger battleships, such as the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> Super <i>Yamato</i> class, were cancelled.<p><a id="Aircraft_carriers" name="Aircraft_carriers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Aircraft carriers</span></h3>

      <p>Japan put particular emphasis on <a href="../../wp/a/Aircraft_carrier.htm" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>. The Imperial Japanese Navy started the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific War with 10 aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. Its two <!--del_lnk--> <i>Sh&#x14D;kaku</i>s were superior to any carrier in the world until the wartime appearance of the American <!--del_lnk--> <i>Essex</i>-class aircraft carrier. However, a large number of the Japanese carriers were of small size in accordance to limitations placed upon the Navy by the London and Washington Naval Conferences. There were 7 American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, only 3 of them operating in the Pacific, and 3 British aircraft carriers, of which a single one operated in the Indian Ocean.<p>However, following the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Midway.htm" title="Battle of Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, in which four Japanese carriers were sunk, the Japanese Navy suddenly found itself short of full fleet carriers, resulting in an ambitious set of projects to convert commercial and military vessels into escort carriers such as the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Hiy&#x14D;</i> and <!--del_lnk--> <i>Shinano</i>, which became the largest aircraft carrier of World War II. The Navy also attempted to build a number of full fleet carriers, though most of these projects were not completed by the end of the war.<p><a id="Naval_aviation" name="Naval_aviation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Naval aviation</span></h3>

      <p>Japan began the war with a highly competent naval air force designed around some of the best airplanes in the world: the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Zero&quot; was considered the best carrier aircraft of the beginning of the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi G3M bomber was remarkable for its range and speed, and the <!--del_lnk--> Kawanishi H8K was considered as the world&#39;s best flying boat. The Japanese pilot corps at the beginning of the war were of high caliber as compared to their contemporaries around the world due to intense training practices and frontline experience in the <!--del_lnk--> Sino-Japanese War. The Navy also had a competent tactical bombing force based around the Mitsubishi G3M and <!--del_lnk--> G4M bombers, which astonished the world by being the first planes to sink enemy battleships under way, in the <!--del_lnk--> sinking of <i>Prince of Wales</i> and <i>Repulse</i>.<p>As the war dragged on, the Allies found weaknesses in Japanese Naval Aviation. Though most of the Japanese aircraft were characterized by having great operating ranges, they had very little in the way of defensive armament and armor. As a result, the more numerous, heavily armed and armored American aircraft were able to develop techniques that nullified the advantages of the Japanese aircraft. Although there were delays in engine development, several new competitive designs were developed during the war, but industrial weaknesses, lack of raw materials and disorganization due to Allied bombing raids hampered their mass-production. Furthermore, the IJN didn&#39;t have an efficient process for speedily replacing lost aviators, as several years of training were usually considered necessary. Therefore, they weren&#39;t able to effectively replace their seasoned pilots as they were lost through attrition following their initial successes in the Pacific campaign. The IJN pilot&#39;s later inexperience was especially evident during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of the Philippine Sea when their aircraft were shot-down in droves by the American naval pilots in what the Americans later called the, &quot;Great Marianas Turkey Shoot&quot;. Following the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf.htm" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, the Japanese Navy increasingly opted towards deploying aircraft in the kamikaze role.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Towards the end of the conflict, several competitive plane designs were developed, such as the 1943 <!--del_lnk--> Shiden, but such planes were produced too late and in insufficient numbers (415 units for the Shiden) to affect the outcome of the war. Radical new plane designs were also developed, such as the <!--del_lnk--> canard design <!--del_lnk--> Shinden, and especially jet-powered aircraft such as the <!--del_lnk--> Nakajima Kikka and the rocket-fighter <!--del_lnk--> Mitsubishi J8M. These jet designs were partially based on technology received from Nazi Germany, usually in the form of a few drawings only, and Japanese manufacturers had to play a key role in the final engineering. These developments also happened too late in the conflict to have any influence on the outcome. The Kikka only flew once before the end of the war.<br clear="all" />

      <p>Japan had by far the most varied fleet of <!--del_lnk--> submarines of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, including manned torpedoes (<!--del_lnk--> Kaiten), midget submarines (<!--del_lnk--> Ko-hyoteki, <!--del_lnk--> Kairyu), medium-range submarines, purpose-built supply submarines (many for use by the Army), long-range fleet submarines (many of which carried an aircraft), submarines with the highest submerged speeds of the conflict (<!--del_lnk--> Senkou I-200), and submarines that could carry multiple bombers (WWII&#39;s largest submarine, the <!--del_lnk--> Sentoku I-400). These submarines were also equipped with the most advanced torpedo of the conflict, the oxygen-propelled <!--del_lnk--> Long Lance. A plane from one such long-range fleet submarine, <i><!--del_lnk--> I-25</i>, conducted what is still the only aerial bombing attack on the continental United States when Warrant Flying Officer <!--del_lnk--> Nobuo Fujita attempted to start massive forest fires in the Pacific Northwest outside the town of <!--del_lnk--> Brookings, Oregon on September 9th, 1942. Other submarines undertook trans-oceanic missions to German-occupied Europe, such as <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-30</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-8</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-34</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-29</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> I-52</i>, in one case flying a Japanese <!--del_lnk--> seaplane over France in a propaganda coup. In May 1942, <!--del_lnk--> Type A midget submarines were used in the <!--del_lnk--> Attack on Sydney Harbour, and the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Madagascar.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Overall, despite their technical prowesses, Japanese submarines were relatively unsuccessful. They were often used in offensive roles against warships, which were fast, maneuverable and well-defended compared to merchant ships. In 1942, Japanese submarines managed to sink two fleet carriers, one cruiser, and a few destroyers and other warships, and damage several others. They were not able to sustain these results afterwards, as Allied fleets were reinforced and became better organized. By the end of the war, submarines were instead often used to transport supplies to island garrisons. During the war, Japan managed to sink about 1 million tons of merchant shipping (184 ships), compared to 1.5 million tons for Britain (493 ships), 4.65 million tons for the US (1,079 ships) and 14.3 million tons for Germany (2,840 ships).<p>Early models were not very maneuverable under water, could not dive very deep, and lacked <a href="../../wp/r/Radar.htm" title="Radar">radar</a>. Later in the war units that were fitted with radar were in some instances sunk due to the ability of US radar sets to detect their emissions. For example, <!--del_lnk--> <i>Batfish</i> (SS-310) sunk three such equipped submarines in the span of four days. After the end of the conflict, several of Japan&#39;s most original submarines were sent to Hawaii for inspection in &quot;Operation Road&#39;s End&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> <i>I-400</i>, <i>I-401</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <i>I-201</i> and <i>I-203</i>) before being scuttled by the U.S. Navy in 1946 when the Soviets demanded to have access to the submarines as well.<p><a id="Special_Attack_Units" name="Special_Attack_Units"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Special Attack Units</span></h3>

These units included <i><!--del_lnk--> Kamikaze</i> (&quot;Divine Wind&quot;) bombers, <i><!--del_lnk--> Shinyo</i> (&quot;Sea Quake&quot;) suicide boats, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kairyu</i> (&quot;Sea Dragon&quot;) suicide <!--del_lnk--> midget submarines, <i><!--del_lnk--> Kaiten</i> (&quot;Turn of Heaven&quot;) suicide <!--del_lnk--> torpedoes, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Fukuryu</i> (&quot;Crouching Dragon&quot;) suicide scuba divers who would swim under boats and use explosives mounted on bamboo poles to destroy both the boat and themselves.
