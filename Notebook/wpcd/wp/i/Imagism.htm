      <p><b>Imagism</b> was a movement in early 20th century <a href="../../wp/e/English_poetry.htm" title="English poetry">Anglo</a>-<a href="../../wp/p/Poetry_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Poetry of the United States">American</a> <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> that favored precision of <!--del_lnk--> imagery, and clear, sharp language. The Imagists rejected the sentiment and artifice typical of much <!--del_lnk--> Romantic and <!--del_lnk--> Victorian poetry. This was in contrast to their contemporaries, the <!--del_lnk--> Georgian poets, who were by and large content to work within that tradition. Group publication of work under the Imagist name in magazines and in four anthologies appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured writing by many of the most significant figures in <a href="../../wp/m/Modernist_poetry_in_English.htm" title="Modernist poetry in English">Modernist poetry in English</a>, as well as a number of other <!--del_lnk--> Modernist figures who were to be prominent in fields other than poetry.<p>Based in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, the Imagists were drawn from <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. Though somewhat unusual for the time, the Imagists featured a number of women writers amongst their major figures. Historically, Imagism is also significant because it was the first organised Modernist <!--del_lnk--> English-language literary movement or group. In the words of <!--del_lnk--> T.S. Eliot; &quot;The <i>point de rep&egrave;re</i> usually and conveniently taken as the starting-point of modern poetry is the group denominated &#39;imagists&#39; (<i>sic</i>) in London about 1910.&quot;<p>At the time Imagism emerged, <!--del_lnk--> Longfellow and <!--del_lnk--> Tennyson were considered the paragons for poetry, and the public valued the sometimes <!--del_lnk--> moralising tone of their writings. In contrast to this, Imagism called for a return to what were seen as more <!--del_lnk--> Classical values, such as directness of presentation, and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional <!--del_lnk--> verse forms. The focus on the &quot;thing&quot; as &quot;thing&quot; (an attempt at isolating a single image to reveal its essence) also mirrors contemporary developments in <i><!--del_lnk--> avant-garde</i> art, especially <a href="../../wp/c/Cubism.htm" title="Cubism">Cubism</a>. Although Imagism isolates objects through the use of what <a href="../../wp/e/Ezra_Pound.htm" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a> called &quot;luminous details&quot;, Pound&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ideogrammic Method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an abstraction, is similar to the way in which Cubism synthesizes a single image from multiple perspectives.<p>

      <p>In the first ten years of the 20th century, <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Austin was the serving British <!--del_lnk--> Poet Laureate. Poetry still had a large audience, and volumes of verse published during the decade included <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy&#39;s <i>The Dynasts</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Christina Rossetti&#39;s posthumous <i>Poetical Works</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Dowson&#39;s <i>Poems</i>, <!--del_lnk--> George Meredith&#39;s <i>Last Poems</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Service&#39;s <i>Ballads of a Cheechako</i> and <!--del_lnk--> John Masefield&#39;s <i>Ballads and Poems</i>. Future <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize for literature winner <a href="../../wp/w/William_Butler_Yeats.htm" title="William Butler Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a> was devoting much of his energy to the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbey_Theatre.htm" title="Abbey Theatre">Abbey Theatre</a> and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to <a href="../../wp/r/Rudyard_Kipling.htm" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. In general, the poetry of the period was formally traditionalist and decorous in content. These literary figures and values provided the context that Imagists emerged in as a self-consciously <i>avant-garde</i> movement.<p>The origins of Imagism are to be found in two poems, <i>Autumn</i> and <i>A City Sunset</i> by <!--del_lnk--> T. E. Hulme. These were published in January 1909 by the <!--del_lnk--> Poets&#39; Club in London in a booklet called <i>For Christmas MDCCCCVIII</i>. Hulme was a student of mathematics and philosophy; he had been involved in the setting up of the Club in 1908 and was its first secretary. Around the end of 1908 he presented his paper <i><!--del_lnk--> A Lecture on Modern Poetry</i> at one of the Club&#39;s meetings. Writing in <!--del_lnk--> A. R. Orage&#39;s magazine <i>The New Age</i>, the poet and critic <!--del_lnk--> F. S. Flint (a champion of <!--del_lnk--> free verse and modern French poetry) was highly critical of the club and its publications. From the ensuing debate, Hulme and Flint became close friends. In 1909 Hulme left the Poets&#39; Club, and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group which Hulme referred to as the &#39;Secession Club&#39;; they met at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in <!--del_lnk--> Soho to discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through <!--del_lnk--> free verse and the <!--del_lnk--> tanka and <!--del_lnk--> haiku and the removal of all unnecessary verbiage from poems. The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late <!--del_lnk--> Victorian and <!--del_lnk--> Edwardian revival of interest in <!--del_lnk--> Chinoiserie and <!--del_lnk--> Japonism as witnessed in the 1890s vogue for <!--del_lnk--> William Anderson&#39;s Japanese prints donated to the <!--del_lnk--> British Museum, performances of <!--del_lnk--> Noh plays in London, and the success of <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert and Sullivan&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> operetta <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mikado</i>. Direct literary models were available from a number of sources, including <!--del_lnk--> F. V. Dickins&rsquo;s 1866 <i>Hyak nin is&rsquo;shiu, or, Stanzas by a Century of Poets, Being Japanese Lyrical Odes</i>, the first English-language version of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hyakunin isshu</i>, a 13th century anthology of 100 tanka, the early 20th-century critical writings and poems of <!--del_lnk--> Sadakichi Hartmann, and contemporary <!--del_lnk--> French-language translations. This group included <!--del_lnk--> F. W. Tancred, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Campbell, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Storer, <!--del_lnk--> Desmond FitzGerald and the writer and actor <!--del_lnk--> Florence Farr, who also worked with <a href="../../wp/w/William_Butler_Yeats.htm" title="William Butler Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a> on performances of poetry to a musical accompaniment on the <!--del_lnk--> psaltery.<p>In April 1909, the American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to this group and found that their ideas were close to his own. In particular, Pound&#39;s studies of <!--del_lnk--> Romance literature had led him to an admiration of the condensed, direct expression that he detected in the writings of <!--del_lnk--> Arnaut Daniel, <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante">Dante</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Guido Cavalcanti, amongst others. For example, in his 1911/12 series of essays <i>I gather the limbs of Osiris</i>, Pound writes of Daniel&#39;s line &quot;pensar de lieis m&#39;es repaus&quot; (&quot;it rests me to think of her&quot;) (from the canzone <i>En breu brizara&#39;l temps braus</i>): &quot;You cannot get statement simpler than that, or clearer, or less rhetorical&quot;. These criteria of directness, clarity and lack of <!--del_lnk--> rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities of Imagist poetry. Through his friendship with <!--del_lnk--> Laurence Binyon, Pound had already developed an interest in <!--del_lnk--> Japanese art and he quickly became absorbed in the study of Japanese verse forms.<p>In a 1928 letter to the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <!--del_lnk--> critic and <!--del_lnk--> translator <!--del_lnk--> Ren&eacute; Taupin, Pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for Imagism, pointing out that Hulme was, in many ways, indebted to a <!--del_lnk--> Symbolist tradition, linking back via <a href="../../wp/w/William_Butler_Yeats.htm" title="William Butler Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Symons and the <!--del_lnk--> &#39;90s generation of British poets to <!--del_lnk--> Mallarm&eacute;. In 1915, Pound edited the poetry of another 90&#39;s poet, <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Johnson for the publisher <!--del_lnk--> Elkin Mathews. In his introduction, he wrote &quot;no one has written purer Imagisme than [Johnson] has, in the line &#39;Clear lie the fields, and fade into blue air.&#39; It has a beauty like the Chinese.&quot;<p><a id="Early_publications_and_statements_of_intent" name="Early_publications_and_statements_of_intent"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early publications and statements of intent</span></h2>

      <p>In 1911, Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group, his ex-fianc&eacute;e Hilda Doolittle (who had started signing her work <a href="../../wp/h/H.D..htm" title="H.D.">H.D.</a>) and her future husband <!--del_lnk--> Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring <!--del_lnk--> Greek poetic models, especially <!--del_lnk--> Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes, and even appended the signature <i>H.D. Imagiste</i> to some poems they were discussing.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> Harriet Monroe started her <i><!--del_lnk--> Poetry</i> magazine in 1911, she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor. In October 1912, he submitted three poems each by H.D. and Aldington under the <i>Imagiste</i> rubric. That same month, Pound&#39;s book <i>Ripostes</i> was published with an appendix called <i>The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme</i> which carried a note that saw the first appearance of the word <i>Imagiste</i> in print. Aldington&#39;s poems, <i>Choricos</i>, <i>To a Greek Marble</i>, and <i>Au Vieux Jadrin</i>, were in the November issue of <i>Poetry</i> and H.D.&#39;s, <i>Hermes of the Ways</i>, <i>Orchard</i>, and <i>Epigram</i>, appeared in the January 1913 issue; Imagism as a movement was launched. The April issue published what was, in the words of J.T. Barbarese, &quot;Imagism&#39;s enabling text&quot;, the <!--del_lnk--> haiku-like poem of <a href="../../wp/e/Ezra_Pound.htm" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a> entitled &quot;In a Station of the Metro&quot;:<dl>
       <dd>The apparition of these faces in the crowd:<dd>Petals on a wet, black bough.</dl>
      <p>The March issue of <i>Poetry</i> also contained Pound&#39;s <i>A Few Don&#39;ts by an Imagiste</i> and Flint&#39;s <i>Imagisme</i>. The latter contained this succinct statement of the group&#39;s position:<ol>
       <li>Direct treatment of the &quot;thing&quot;, whether subjective or objective.<li>To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation.<li>As regarding rhythm: to compose in sequence of the musical phrase, not in sequence of the <!--del_lnk--> metronome.</ol>
      <p>Pound&#39;s note opened with a definition of an image as <i>that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time</i>. Pound goes on to state that <i>It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce voluminous works</i>. His list of <i>don&#39;ts</i> reinforced Flint&#39;s three statements, while warning that they should not be considered as dogma but as the <i>result of long contemplation</i>. Taken together, these two texts comprised the Imagist programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past.<p><a id="Des_Imagistes" name="Des_Imagistes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Des Imagistes</i></span></h2>
      <p>Determined to promote the work of the Imagists, and particularly of Aldington and H.D., Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title <i><!--del_lnk--> Des Imagistes</i>. This was published in 1914 by the <!--del_lnk--> Poetry Bookshop in London. In addition to ten poems by Aldington, seven by H.D. and six by Pound, the book included work by Flint, <!--del_lnk--> Skipwith Cannell, <!--del_lnk--> Amy Lowell, <!--del_lnk--> William Carlos Williams, <a href="../../wp/j/James_Joyce.htm" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ford Madox Ford, <!--del_lnk--> Allen Upward and <!--del_lnk--> John Cournos.<p>Pound&#39;s editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, <!--del_lnk--> Pre-Raphaelite influenced, style towards a harder, more modern way of writing.<p>The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, <i>I Hear an Army</i> which was sent to Pound by <!--del_lnk--> W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound&#39;s behest, of <i><!--del_lnk--> A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Egoist</i>. Joyce&#39;s poem is not written in free verse, but in <!--del_lnk--> rhyming <!--del_lnk--> quatrains. However, it does strongly reflect Pound&#39;s interest in poems written to be sung to <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, such as the troubadours and Cavalcanti.<p>The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.<p><a id="Some_Imagist_Poets" name="Some_Imagist_Poets"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Some Imagist Poets</i></span></h2>
      <p>The following year, Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history of Imagism written by Flint and published in <i>The Egoist</i> in May 1915. Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of the Eiffel Tower poets, especially Storer. Pound, who believed that the &quot;Hellenic hardness&quot; that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems of H.D. and Aldington was likely to be diluted by the &quot;custard&quot; of Storer, was to play no further direct role in the history of the Imagists. He went on to co-found the <!--del_lnk--> Vorticists with his friend the painter and writer <!--del_lnk--> Wyndham Lewis. Around this time, the American Imagist Amy Lowell moved to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets. Lowell was a wealthy heiress from <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a> who loved <!--del_lnk--> Keats and <!--del_lnk--> cigars. She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group. Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound&#39;s autocratic editorial attitude to a more <!--del_lnk--> democratic manner. This new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership: &quot;In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology. Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor, each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best, the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form.&quot;<p>The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title <i>Some Imagist Poets</i>. The first of these appeared in 1915, planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington. Two further issues, both edited by Lowell, were published in 1916 and 1917. These three volumes featured most of the original poets with the exception of Pound, who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism &quot;Amy-gism.&quot;<p>Lowell persuaded <!--del_lnk--> D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. <!--del_lnk--> Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. However, with <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> as a backdrop, the times were not easy for <i><!--del_lnk--> avant-garde</i> literary movements (Aldington, for example, spent much of the war at the front), and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.<p><a id="The_Imagists_after_Imagism" name="The_Imagists_after_Imagism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Imagists after Imagism</span></h2>
      <p>In 1929, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Lowenfels jokingly suggested that Aldington should produce a new Imagist anthology. Aldington, by now a successful novelist, took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and H.D. The result was the <i>Imagist Anthology 1930</i>, edited by Aldington and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell, who had died, Cannell, who had disappeared, and Pound, who declined. The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the Imagists in the history of 20th-century poetry.<p>Of the poets who were published in the various Imagist anthologies, Joyce, Lawrence and Aldington are now primarily remembered and read as novelists. Marianne Moore, who was at most a fringe member of the group, carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an Imagist concern with compression of language. William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable <!--del_lnk--> foot and a <!--del_lnk--> diction he claimed was taken from &quot;the mouths of Polish mothers&quot;. Both Pound and H.D. turned to writing long poems but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an Imagist legacy. Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten except inasmuch as they contributed directly to the history of Imagism.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p>Despite being so short-lived as a movement, Imagism was to prove to be deeply influential on the course of <a href="../../wp/m/Modernist_poetry_in_English.htm" title="Modernist poetry in English">modernist poetry in English</a>. Aldington, in his 1941 memoir, writes: &quot;I think the poems of Ezra Pound, H.D., Lawrence, and Ford Madox Ford will continue to be read. And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the Imagists.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Wallace Stevens on the other hand, voiced his shortcomings in the Imagist approach; he wrote &quot;Not all objects are equal. The vice of imagism was that it did not recognize this.&quot;<p>The influence of Imagism can be seen clearly in the work of the <!--del_lnk--> Objectivist poets, who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams. The Objectivists worked mainly in free verse. Clearly linking Objectivism&#39;s principles with Imagism&#39;s, Zukovsky insisted, in his introduction to the 1931 Objectivist issue of <i><!--del_lnk--> Poetry</i>, on writing &quot;which is the detail, not mirage, of seeing, of thinking with the things as they exist, and of directing them along a line of melody.&quot;<p>The influence of Imagism can be seen in a number of 1950s poetic groups and movements, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Beat generation, the <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountain poets, and others associated with the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Renaissance. In his seminal 1950 essay, <i>Projective Verse</i>, Charles Olson, the theorist of the Black Mountain group, wrote &quot;ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION&quot;, a credo that derives directly from the Imagists.<p>Among the Beats, Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by the Imagist emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> Chinese and <!--del_lnk--> Japanese poetry. William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong impact on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like <!--del_lnk--> Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Howl</i>. One poet associated with the Objectivist group, <!--del_lnk--> Louis Zukofsky, was a major influence on the <!--del_lnk--> Language poets, who carried the Imagist focus on formal concerns to a high level of development. Another, <!--del_lnk--> Basil Bunting, was a key figure in the early development of the <!--del_lnk--> British Poetry Revival, a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the <!--del_lnk--> San Francisco Renaissance poets.<p><a id="Further_reading" name="Further_reading"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagism&quot;</div>
