      <p><b>Indonesian</b> (<i><b>Bahasa Indonesia</b></i>) is the official language of <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. Indonesian is a <!--del_lnk--> standardized dialect of the <!--del_lnk--> Malay language that was officially defined with the declaration of Indonesian independence in 1945, and the two languages remain quite similar.<p>The language is spoken fluently as a <!--del_lnk--> second language by most Indonesians, who generally use a regional language (examples are <!--del_lnk--> Minangkabau and <!--del_lnk--> Javanese) at home and in their local community. Most formal education, as well as nearly all national media and other communication, are in Indonesian. In <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, Indonesian is recognized by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other is English).<p>The Indonesian name for the language is <i>Bahasa Indonesia</i> (literally <i>language of Indonesia</i>); this name is sometimes used in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> as well. The language is sometimes called &quot;Bahasa&quot; by English-speakers, though this simply means &quot;language&quot; in Indonesian.<p>

      <p>Indonesian is a normative form of the <!--del_lnk--> Malay language, an <!--del_lnk--> Austronesian (or <!--del_lnk--> Malayo-Polynesian) language which had been used as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries, and was elevated to the status of official language with the Indonesian declaration of independence in 1945, drawing inspiration from the <!--del_lnk--> Sumpah Pemuda (Youth&#39;s Oath) event in 1928. It is very similar to the official <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysian</a> form of the language. However it does <!--del_lnk--> differ from the Malaysian form in some ways, with differences in pronunciation and also in vocabulary, due in large part to the many Dutch and Javanese words in the Indonesian vocabulary.<p>It is spoken as a mother tongue by only 7% of the population of Indonesia (mainly in the vicinity of Jakarta), but altogether more than 200 million people speak it, with varying degrees of proficiency. It is an essential means of communication in a region with more than 300 native languages, used for business and administrative purposes, at all levels of education and in all mass media.<p>However, most native Indonesian speakers would admit that the standard correct version of the language is hardly ever used in a normal daily conversation. One can read standard correct Indonesian in books and newspaper, or listen to it when watching the news on television, but few native Indonesian speakers use formally correct language in their daily conversations. While this is a phenomenon common to most languages in the world (for example, spoken English does not always correspond to written standards), the degree of &quot;correctness&quot; of spoken Indonesian (in terms of grammar and vocabulary) by comparison to its written form is noticeably low. This is mostly due to the fact that most Indonesians tend to mix aspects of their own local dialects (<!--del_lnk--> Javanese, <!--del_lnk--> Sundanese, <!--del_lnk--> Balinese, and even <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>) with Indonesian when speaking, which results in the creation of various types of accented Indonesian, the very types that a foreigner is most likely to hear upon arriving in any Indonesian city or town. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the use of <!--del_lnk--> slang, particularly in the cities. A classic example of a speaker of accented Indonesian is former president <!--del_lnk--> Soeharto, whose Javanese dialect came through whenever he delivered a speech.<p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> colonization left an imprint on the language that can be seen in words such as <i>polisi</i> (police), <i>kualitas</i> (quality), <i>konfrontasi</i> (confrontation), <i>kopi</i> (coffee), <i>rokok</i> (cigarette), <i>kantor</i> (office), and <i>resleting</i> (zipper). There are also some words derived from <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> (<i>sabun</i>, soap; <i>meja</i>, table; <i>jendela</i>, window; and <i>gereja</i>, church), <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> (<i>pisau</i> (&#x5315;&#x9996;), knife or dagger; <i>loteng</i>, [upper] floor), <!--del_lnk--> Hindi (<i>kaca</i>, mirror) and from <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> (<i>khusus</i>, special; <i>maaf</i>, sorry; <i>selamat ...</i>, a greeting; <i>kursi</i>, chair). There are also words derived from <!--del_lnk--> Javanese (<i>aku</i>, I <i>(informal)</i>, and its derivative form <i>mengaku</i>, confess).<p>See also <!--del_lnk--> List of borrowed words in Indonesian<p><a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification</span></h2>

      <p>Here are a few useful tips for the learner:<ul>
       <li>k, p, and t are <!--del_lnk--> unaspirated, i.e. they are not followed by a noticeable puff of air as they often are in English words.<li>t and d are <!--del_lnk--> dental<li>When k is at the end of a syllable it becomes a <!--del_lnk--> glottal stop, which sounds like it is cut off sharply e.g. &quot;baik&quot;, &quot;bapak&quot;. This is similar to a number of English dialects where the final t is glottalized (&quot;got&quot;, &quot;what&quot;). Only a few Indonesian words have this sound in the middle, e.g. &quot;bakso&quot; (meatballs), and it may be represented by an apostrophe in Arabic derived words such as &quot;Al Qur&#39;an&quot;.<li>Stress is placed on the <!--del_lnk--> penultimate (second-to-last) syllable of each base word. But if this syllable contains a schwa then the accent moves to the last syllable.</ul>

      <p><a id="Affix" name="Affix"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Affix</span></h3>
      <p>Indonesian language uses a lot of <!--del_lnk--> affixes (i.e. preffix, infix and suffix). According to the affix being used, a word could have different grammatical meanings (e.g. <i>me</i>makan means to eat something, <i>di</i>makan means being eaten, <i>ter</i>makan means accidentally being eaten). Often two different affixes are used to change the meaning of a word (e.g. duduk means to sit down, <i>men</i>duduk<i>kan</i> means to bring someone to sit down, <i>men</i>duduk<i>i</i> means to sit on something, <i>di</i>duduk<i>kan</i> means a person is being sat down, <i>di</i>duduk<i>i</i> means something being sat down, etc).<p><a id="Grammatical_gender" name="Grammatical_gender"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Grammatical gender</span></h3>
      <p>Indonesian does not make use of <!--del_lnk--> grammatical gender, and there are only a few words that use natural gender; the same word is used for <i>he</i> and <i>she</i> or for <i>his</i> and <i>her</i>. Most of the words that refer to people (family terms, professions, etc.) have a form that does not distinguish between the sexes. For example, <i>adik</i> can both refer to a younger sibling of either gender; no distinction is made between &quot;girlfriend&quot; and &quot;boyfriend&quot;. In order to specify the natural gender of a noun, an adjective has to be added: <i>adik laki-laki</i> corresponds to &quot;brother&quot; but really means &quot;male younger sibling&quot;. There are some words that are gendered, for instance <i>putri</i> means &quot;daughter&quot;, and <i>putra</i> means &quot;son&quot;; words like these are usually absorbed from other languages (in these cases, from <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> through the Old <!--del_lnk--> Javanese language). In Jakarta and some other areas, <i>abang</i> may be used for &quot;older brother&quot;; <i>kakak</i>, &quot;older sibling&quot;, is then used to mean &quot;older sister&quot;.<p><a id="Pluralization" name="Pluralization"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pluralization</span></h3>
      <p>Plurals are expressed by means of <!--del_lnk--> reduplication, but only when the plural is not implied in the context. Thus &quot;person&quot; is <i>orang</i>, and &quot;people&quot; is <i>orang-orang</i>, but &quot;one thousand people&quot; is <i>seribu orang</i>, as the numeral makes it unnecessary to mark the plural form. Besides expressing plurals, reduplication can also be used to create new words that differ in meaning before reduplication takes place, for instance <i>hati</i> means &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;liver&quot; (depending on context) whereas <i>hati-hati</i> means &quot;to be careful&quot; and it is often used as a verb. For foreigners who are learning Indonesian, reduplication is not as easy as it seems to be because one can say <i>orang</i> (&quot;person&quot;), <i>orang-orang</i> (&quot;people&quot;), or <i>orang-orangan</i> (&quot;scarecrow&quot;).<p><a id="Negation" name="Negation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Negation</span></h3>
      <p>There are two kinds of negation in the Indonesian language, which are <i>tidak</i> and <i>bukan</i>. <i>Tidak</i> is used for the negation of a verb. For example &quot;saya <i>tidak</i> tahu&quot; means I do <i>not</i> know. <i>Bukan</i> is used for to the negation of a noun. For example &quot;Itu <i>bukan</i> seekor anjing&quot; means that is <i>not</i> a dog. Another kind of negation is <i>jangan</i>, which is only used for the imperatives.<p><a id="Pronouns" name="Pronouns"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pronouns</span></h3>
      <p>There are two forms of &quot;we&quot;, <i>kami</i> or <i>kita</i>, depending on whether you are including the person being talked to. <i>Kami</i> is used when the other person(s) is not included, while <i>kita</i> includes the opposite party. Their usage is increasingly confused in colloquial Indonesian.<p><a id="Verbs" name="Verbs"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Verbs</span></h3>
      <p>Verbs are not <!--del_lnk--> inflected for person or number, and they are not marked for tense; tense is instead denoted by time adverbs (such as &quot;yesterday&quot;) or by other tense indicators, such as <i>sudah</i>, &quot;already&quot;. On the other hand, there is a complex system of verb affixes to render nuances of meaning and denote active-passive voices. Such affixes include prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and their combinations; all of which are often ignored in daily conversations.<p><a id="Word_order" name="Word_order"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Word order</span></h3>

      <p>Indonesian as a modern dialect of Malay has borrowed heavily from many languages, including&nbsp;: <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Persian, <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> and many other languages, including other <!--del_lnk--> Austronesian languages. It is estimated that there are some 750 Sanskrit loanwords in modern Indonesian, 1,000 Arabic loans, some <!--del_lnk--> Persian and <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> ones, some 125 Portuguese (also <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Italian) ones and a staggering number of some 10,000 loanwords from Dutch. The latter also comprises many words from other European languages, which came via Dutch, the so-called &quot;International Vocabulary&quot;. The vast majority of Indonesian words, however, come from the root lexical stock of its Austronesian heritage.<p>Although <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> are no longer the major religions of Indonesia, <a href="../../wp/s/Sanskrit.htm" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> which was the language vehicle for these religions, is still held in high esteem and is comparable with the status of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and other West European languages. Residents of <!--del_lnk--> Bali and <!--del_lnk--> Java tend to be particularly proud of the Hindu-Buddhist heritage. Sanskrit is also the main source for <!--del_lnk--> neologisms. These are usually formed from Sanskrit roots. The loanwords from Sanskrit cover many aspects of <a href="../../wp/r/Religion.htm" title="Religion">religion</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and everyday life. The Sanskrit influence came from contacts with <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> long ago before the time of <!--del_lnk--> Christ. The words are either directly borrowed from India or with the intermediary of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Javanese language. In the classical language of Java, Old Javanese, the number of Sanskrit loanwords is far greater. The Old Javanese &mdash; English dictionary by prof. <!--del_lnk--> P.J. Zoetmulder, <!--del_lnk--> S.J. (1982) contains no fewer than 25,500 entries. Almost half are Sanskrit loanwords. Unlike other loanwords, Sanskrit loanwords have entered the basic vocabulary of Indonesian, so by many these aren&#39;t felt as foreign anymore.<p>The loanwords from <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> are mainly concerned with religion, in particular with <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, as can be expected. <a href="../../wp/a/Allah.htm" title="Allah">Allah</a> is the word for <a href="../../wp/g/God.htm" title="God">God</a> even in <!--del_lnk--> Christian <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> translations. Many early Bible translators, when they came across some unusual <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> words or proper names, used the Arabic cognates. In the newer translations this practice is discontinued. They now turn to <!--del_lnk--> Greek names or use the original Hebrew Word. For example, the name <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> was initially translated as &#39;<i>Isa</i>, but is now spelt as <i>Yesus</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Psalms used to be translated as <i>Zabur</i>, the Arabic name, but now it is called <i>Mazmur</i> which corresponds more with Hebrew.<p>Loanwords from <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> are common words, which were mainly connected with articles the early European traders and explorers brought to Southeast Asia. The Portuguese were among the first westerners who sailed east to the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Spice Islands&quot;.<p>The <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> loanwords are usually concerned with cuisine, trade or often just exclusively things Chinese. There is a considerable Chinese presence in the whole of Southeast Asia. According to the Indonesian government, the relative number of people of Chinese descent in Indonesia is <i>only</i> 3.5%. Whether this is true or not is still a matter of debate, many think the number is much higher. But what is sure is that in urban centres the number can be as high as between 10&ndash;25%.<p>The former colonial power, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, left an impressive vocabulary. These <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> loanwords, and also from other non Italo-Iberian, European languages loanwords which came via Dutch, cover all aspects of life. Some Dutch loanwords, having clusters of several consonants, pose difficulties to speakers of Indonesian. This problem is usually solved by insertion of the <!--del_lnk--> schwa. For example Dutch <i>schroef</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#39;sxruf]</span>=&gt; <i>sekrup</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[s&#x259;&#39;krup]</span>.<p>As modern Indonesian draws many of its words from foreign sources, there are many <!--del_lnk--> synonyms. For example, Indonesian has three words for &quot;book&quot;, i.e. <i>pustaka</i> (from Sanskrit), <i>kitab</i> (from Arabic) and <i>buku</i> (from Dutch). These words have, unsurprisingly, slightly different meanings. A <i>pustaka</i> is often connected with ancient wisdom or sometimes with esoteric knowledge. A derived form, <i>perpustakaan</i> means a library. A <i>kitab</i> is usually a religious scripture or a book containing moral guidances. The Indonesian words for the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> are <i>Alkitab</i> and <i>Injil</i>, both directly derived from Arabic. The book containing the penal code is also called the <i>kitab</i>. <i>Buku</i> is the most common word for books.<p>In addition to those above, there are also direct borrowings from various languages in the world, such as &quot;karaoke&quot; from <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> modem&quot; from English.<p>See also <!--del_lnk--> List of borrowed words in Indonesian<p><a id="Spoken_and_informal_Indonesian" name="Spoken_and_informal_Indonesian"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Spoken and informal Indonesian</span></h2>
      <p>In very informal spoken Indonesian, the <i>ai</i> and &quot;au&quot; on the end of base words is typically pronounced as <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/e/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/o/</span>. In informal writing (personal communication and &quot;trendy&quot; magazines and newspapers) the spelling of such words is modified to reflect the actual pronunciation. E.g.: <i>capai</i> becomes <i>cape</i> or <i>capek</i>, <i>pakai</i> become <i>pake</i>, <i>kalau</i> becomes <i>kalo</i>.<p>In verbs, the <i>me-</i> prefixes are often dropped, although the nasalized initial consonant is usually retained. E.g.: &quot;mengangkat&quot; becomes &quot;ngangkat&quot; (the basic word is &quot;angkat&quot;). the &quot;-kan&quot; and &quot;-i&quot; suffixes are often replaced by &quot;-in&quot;. E.g.: &quot;mencarikan&quot; becomes &quot;nyariin&quot;, &quot;menuruti&quot; becomes &quot;nurutin&quot;.<p>Those behaviours are rarely seen in more formal speech environments.<p><a id="Writing_system" name="Writing_system"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Writing system</span></h2>
      <p>Indonesian is written using the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>.

Both <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/e/</span> and <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/&#x259;/</span> are represented with an &lt;e&gt;.<p>One common source of confusion for foreign readers, particularly when reading place names, is the spelling changes in the language that have occurred since Indonesian independence.

      <p>The first of these changes (<i>oe</i> to <i>u</i>) occurred around the time of independence in 1947; all of the others were a part of an officially-mandated <!--del_lnk--> spelling reform in 1972. Some of the old spellings, which were more closely derived from the <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a>, do survive in proper names; for example, the name of a former president of the Indonesia is still written <i><!--del_lnk--> Soeharto</i>, and the central Java city of <!--del_lnk--> Yogyakarta is sometimes written <i>Jogjakarta</i>.<p><a id="Usage_and_Styles" name="Usage_and_Styles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Usage and Styles</span></h2>
