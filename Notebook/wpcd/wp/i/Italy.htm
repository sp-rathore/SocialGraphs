      <p>Centre of the Roman civilization for centuries, Italy lost its unity after the collapse of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> and subsequent barbaric invasions. Conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Ostrogoths and briefly regained by the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Empire (552), it was partially occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Longobards in 568, resulting in the peninsula becoming irreparably divided. For centuries the country was the prey of different populations, resulting in its ultimate decadence and misery. Most of the population fled from cities to take refuge in the countryside under the protection of powerful feudal lords. After the Longobards came the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a> (774). Italy became part of the <a href="../../wp/h/Holy_Roman_Empire.htm" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Pippin the Short created the first nucleus of the State of the <!--del_lnk--> Church, which later became a strong countervailing force against any unification of the country.<p>Population and economy started slowly to pick up after 1000, with the resurgence of cities (which organised themselves politically in <i><a href="../../wp/m/Medieval_commune.htm" title="Medieval commune">Comuni</a></i>), trade, arts and literature. During the later <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> the partially democratic Comuni, which could not face the challenges of that period, were substituted by monarchic-absolutistic governments (<i><!--del_lnk--> Signorie</i>), but the fragmentation of the peninsula, especially in the northern and central parts of the country, continued, while the southern part, with <!--del_lnk--> Naples, <!--del_lnk--> Apulia and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, remained under a single domination. <!--del_lnk--> Venice and <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> created powerful commercial empires in the Eastern part of the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a>.<p><a id="Italy_during_the_Renaissance_and_Baroque" name="Italy_during_the_Renaissance_and_Baroque"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Italy during the Renaissance and Baroque</span></h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> in 1348 inflicted a terrible blow to Italy, resulting in one third of the population killed by the disease. The recovery from the disaster led to a new resurgence of cities, trade and economy which greatly stimulated the successive phase of the <a href="../../wp/h/Humanism.htm" title="Humanism">Humanism</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> (<a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th</a>-<a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th</a> centuries) when Italy again returned to be the centre of Western civilisation, strongly influencing the other European countries. During this period the many Signorie gathered in a small number of regional states, but none of them had enough power to unify the peninsula.<p>After a century where the fragmented system of Italian states and principalities were able to maintain a relative independence and a balance of power in the peninsula, in 1494 the French king <!--del_lnk--> Charles VIII opened the first of a series of invasions, lasting half of the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">16th century</a>, and a competition between <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> for the possession of the country. Ultimately Spain prevailed (the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis in 1559 recognized the Spanish possession of the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Milan and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Naples) and for almost two centuries became the hegemon in Italy. The holy alliance between reactionary Catholic Spain and the Holy See resulted in the systematic persecution of any Protestant movement, with the result that Italy remained a Catholic country with marginal Protestant presence. The Spanish domination and the control of the Church resulted in intellectual stagnation and economic decadence, also attributable to the shifting of the main commercial routes from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.<p><a id="Napoleonic_Italy_and_struggle_for_unification" name="Napoleonic_Italy_and_struggle_for_unification"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Napoleonic Italy and struggle for unification</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/a/Austria.htm" title="Austria">Austria</a> succeeded Spain as hegemon in Italy after the <!--del_lnk--> Peace of Utrecht (1713), having acquired the State of <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> and the Kingdom of Naples. The Austrian domination, thanks also to the <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> embraced by <!--del_lnk--> Habsburgic emperors, was a considerable improvement upon the Spanish one. The northern part of Italy, under the direct control of <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, again recovered economic dynamism and intellectual fervor, had improved its situation.<p>The <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Napoleonic War (1796-1815) introduced the modern ideas of <!--del_lnk--> equality, <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a> and <!--del_lnk--> nation. The peninsula was not a main battle field as in the past but <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> (born in <!--del_lnk--> Corsica in <!--del_lnk--> 1769, one year after the cession of the island from Genoa to France) changed completely its political map, destroying in 1799 the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Venice, which never recovered its independence. The states founded by Napoleon with the support of minority groups of Italian patriots were short-lived and did not survive the defeat of the French Emperor in 1815.<p>The Restoration had all the pre-Revolution states restored with the exception of the Republic of Venice (forthwith under Austrian control) and the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Genoa (under <!--del_lnk--> Savoy domination). Napoleon had nevertheless the merit to give birth to the first national movement for unity and independence. Albeit formed by small groups with almost no contact with the masses, the Italian patriots and liberals staged several uprisings in the decades up to 1860. <!--del_lnk--> Mazzini and <!--del_lnk--> Garibaldi were the most economical reformists for the impoverished masses. From 1848 onwards the Italian patriots were more or less openly supported by <!--del_lnk--> Vittorio Emanuele II, the <!--del_lnk--> king of Sardinia, who put his arms in the Italian tricolor dedicating the <!--del_lnk--> House of Savoy to the Italian unity.<p><a id="Unification" name="Unification"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Unification</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> unification of Italy was obtained on <!--del_lnk--> March 17 1861, after a successful war (the <!--del_lnk--> Second War of Independence) against Austria with the support of France, and the successive invasion of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (Naples and Sicily), led in 1860 by <!--del_lnk--> Giuseppe Garibaldi. <!--del_lnk--> Vittorio Emanuele II became the first king of the united Italy.<p>The national territory was enlarged to <!--del_lnk--> Veneto with Venice in 1866 after the <!--del_lnk--> Third War of Independence, fought by allied Italy and <!--del_lnk--> Prussia against Austria. <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> with <!--del_lnk--> Lazio, thanks to French protection remained for a little less than a decade under the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Papacy">Papacy</a> and became part of the Kingdom of Italy on <!--del_lnk--> September 20 1870, after Italian troops stormed the city.<p>The first unified state was plagued by a gruesome rebellion of the Southern populations opposed to the new domination, by economic stagnation, misery, illiteracy and a weak national consciousness.

The south, in the meanwhile, stagnated under overpopulation and underdevelopment, so forcing millions of people to search for employment and better conditions of life abroad.

The <!--del_lnk--> Statuto Albertino of <!--del_lnk--> 1848 provided for basic freedoms, but the electoral laws excluded the disposed and the uneducated from voting. Only in <!--del_lnk--> 1913 male universal suffrage was allowed. The <!--del_lnk--> Socialist Party resulted the main political party, outclassing the traditional liberal and conservative organizations. The path to a modern liberal democracy was interrupted by the tragedy of the <!--del_lnk--> First World War (1915-1918), which Italy fought along with France and <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. Italy was able to beat the <!--del_lnk--> Austrian-Hungarian Empire in November 1918. It obtained <!--del_lnk--> Trentino, <!--del_lnk--> South Tyrol, <!--del_lnk--> Trieste and <!--del_lnk--> Istria, besides <!--del_lnk--> Fiume and few territories on the <!--del_lnk--> Dalmatian coast (<!--del_lnk--> Zara), gaining respect as an international power, but the population had to pay a heavy human and social price. The war produced more than 600,000 dead, <!--del_lnk--> inflation and <!--del_lnk--> unemployment, economic and political instability, which in the end favoured the <!--del_lnk--> Fascist movement to seize power in 1922 with the tacit support of King <!--del_lnk--> Vittorio Emanuele III, who feared <!--del_lnk--> civil war and <a href="../../wp/r/Revolution.htm" title="Revolution">revolution</a>.<p>The fascist dictatorship of <a href="../../wp/b/Benito_Mussolini.htm" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> lasted from 1922 to 1943 but in the first years Mussolini maintained the appearance of a liberal democracy. After rigged elections in 1924 gave to Fascism and its conservative allies an absolute majority in <!--del_lnk--> Parliament, Mussolini cancelled all democratic liberties on <!--del_lnk--> January 3 1925. He then proceeded to establish a totalitarian state, imposing the control of the state upon all single social and political activity. Political parties were banned, independent trade unions were closed. The only permitted party was the <!--del_lnk--> National Fascist Party. A <!--del_lnk--> secret police (<!--del_lnk--> OVRA) and a system of quasi-legal repression (Tribunale Speciale) ensured the total control of the regime upon Italians who, in their majority, either resigned or welcomed the dictatorship, many considering it a last resort to stop the spread of communism. While relatively benign in comparison with Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia, several thousands people were incarcerated or exiled for their opposition and several dozens were killed by fascist thugs (Carlo Rosselli) or died in prison (<!--del_lnk--> Antonio Gramsci). Mussolini tried to spread his authoritarian ideology to other European countries and dictators such as <!--del_lnk--> Salazar in Portugal, <!--del_lnk--> Franco in Spain and <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> in Germany were heavily influenced by the Italian examples. Conservative but democratic leaders in Great Britain and United States were at the beginning favourable to Mussolini. Mussolini tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to spread fascism amongst the millions on Italians living abroad.<p>In 1929 Mussolini realised a pact with the <!--del_lnk--> Holy See, resulting in the rebirth of an independent state of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vatican_City.htm" title="Vatican City">Vatican</a> for the Catholic Church in the heart of Rome. In 1935 he declared war on <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> on a pretext. Ethiopia was subjugated in few months. This resulted in the alienation of Italy from its traditional allies, France and Great Britain, and its nearing to Nazi Germany. A first pact with Germany was concluded in 1936 and then in 1938 (the <!--del_lnk--> Pact of Steel). Italy supported Franco&#39;s revolution in Spanish civil war and Hitler&#39;s pretensions in central Europe, accepting the annexation of Austria to Germany in 1938, although the disappearance of a buffer state between mighty Germany and Italy was unfavourable for the country. In October 1938 Mussolini managed to avoid the eruption of another war in Europe, bringing together Great Britain, France and Germany at the expense of Czechoslovakia&#39;s integrity.<p>In April 1939 Italy occupied <a href="../../wp/a/Albania.htm" title="Albania">Albania</a>, a <i>de-facto</i> protectorate for decades, but in September 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Mussolini wisely decided not to intervene on Germany&#39;s side, due to the poor preparation of the armed forces. Italy entered in war in June 1940 when France was almost defeated. Mussolini hoped for a quick victory but Italy showed from the very beginning the poor nature of its army and the scarce ability of its generals. Italy invaded Greece in October 1940 via Albania but after a few days was forced to withdraw. After conquering British Somalia in 1940, a counter-attack by the Allies led to the loss of the whole Italian empire in the Horn of Africa. Italy was also defeated in Northern Africa and saved only by the German armed forces led by Rommel.<p>After several defeats, Italy was invaded in May 1943. In July 1943 King Vittorio Emanuele III staged a coup d&#39;etat against Mussolini, having him arrested. In September 1943 Italy surrendered. It was immediately invaded by Germany and for nearly two years the country was divided and became a battlefield. The Nazi-occupied part of the country, where a puppet fascist state under Mussolini was reconstituted, was the theatre of a savage civil war between freedom fighters (<i>&quot;<!--del_lnk--> partigiani&quot;</i>) and Nazi and fascist troops. The country was liberated by a national uprising on <!--del_lnk--> 25 April, 1945 (the <i><!--del_lnk--> Liberazione</i>).<p>Particularly in the north agitation against the king ran high, left wing and communist armed partisans wanting to depose him as being responsible for the fascist regime. Vittorio Emanuele gave up the throne to his son <!--del_lnk--> Umberto II who again faced the possibility of civil war. <!--del_lnk--> Italy became a Republic after the result of a popular <!--del_lnk--> referendum held on <!--del_lnk--> 2 June 1946, a day since then celebrated as <!--del_lnk--> Republic Day. The republic won with a 9% margin; the north of Italy voted prevalently for a republic, the south for the monarchy. The Republican Constitution was approved and entered into force on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January 1948, including a provisional measure banning all male members of the house of Savoy from Italy. This stipulation was redressed in 2002.<p><a id="Italian_Republic" name="Italian_Republic"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Italian Republic</span></h3>

      <p>The 1948 <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Italy established a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral <!--del_lnk--> parliament (<i><!--del_lnk--> Parlamento</i>), consisting of a <!--del_lnk--> Chamber of Deputies (<i>Camera dei Deputati</i>) and a <!--del_lnk--> Senate (<i>Senato della Repubblica</i>), a separate <!--del_lnk--> judiciary, and an <!--del_lnk--> executive branch composed of a Council of Ministers (<!--del_lnk--> cabinet) (<i>Consiglio dei ministri</i>), headed by the <!--del_lnk--> prime minister (<i>Presidente del consiglio dei ministri</i>).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> President of the Republic (<i>Presidente della Repubblica</i>) is elected for seven years by the parliament sitting jointly with a small number of regional delegates. The president nominates the prime minister, who proposes the other ministers (formally named by the president). The Council of Ministers must retain the support (<i>fiducia</i>) of both houses.<p>The houses of <!--del_lnk--> parliament are popularly and directly elected through a complex electoral system (latest amendment in 2005) which combines proportional representation with a majority prize for the largest coalition (Chamber). The electoral system in the Senate is based upon regional representation. In fact in 2006 elections the two competing coalitions were separated by few thousand votes, and in the Chamber the center-left coalition (L&#39;Ulivo) got 345 Deputies against 277 for the centre-right one (Casa delle Libert&agrave;), while in the Senate l&#39;Ulivo got only two Senators more than absolute majority. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 members, the Senate 315 elected senators; in addition, the Senate includes former presidents and other persons (no more than five) appointed senators for life by the President of the Republic according to special constitutional provisions. As of <!--del_lnk--> 15 May 2006, there are seven <!--del_lnk--> life senators (of which three are former Presidents). Both houses are elected for a maximum of five years, but both may be dissolved by the President of the Republic before the expiration of their normal term if the Parliament is unable to elect a stable government.<p>In the post war history, that happened in 1972, 1976, 1979, 1983, 1994 and 1996. A peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italians permanently living abroad (more than 2 million). Among the 630 Deputies and the 315 Senators there are respectively 12 and 6 elected in four distinct foreign constituencies. Those members of Parliament were elected for the first time in April 2006 and they enjoy the same rights as members elected in Italy. Legislative bills may originate in either house and must be passed by a majority in both. The Italian judicial system is based on Roman law modified by the Napoleonic code and later statutes. A constitutional court, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Corte Costituzionale</i>, passes on the constitutionality of laws, and is a post-World War II innovation.<p>All Italian citizens older than 18 can vote. However, to vote for the senate, the voter must be at least 25 or older.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>The Italian climate is uniquely diverse and can be far from the stereotype of a &quot;land of sun&quot;, depending on the region. The north of Italy (Turin, Milan, and Bologna) has a true continental climate, while below Florence it becomes more and more Mediterranean. The climate of the coastal areas of the Peninsula is very different from that of the interior, particularly during the winter months. The higher areas are cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions, where most of the large towns are located, have a typical <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> climate with mild winters and hot and generally dry summers. The length and intensity of the summer dry season increases southwards (compare the tables for <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Naples, and <!--del_lnk--> Brindisi).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Between the north and south there is a quite remarkable difference in the temperatures, above all during the winter: in some days of December or January it can be -2&deg;C and snowing in Milan while it is +17&deg;C in Palermo or Naples. Temperature differences are less extreme in the summer. (<i>See how Po valley can be frosty in winter <!--del_lnk--> </i>)<p>The east coast of the <!--del_lnk--> peninsula is not as wet as the west coast, but is usually colder in the winter. The east coast north of <!--del_lnk--> Pescara is occasionally affected by the cold <!--del_lnk--> bora winds in winter and spring, but the wind is less strong here than around <!--del_lnk--> Trieste. During these frosty spells from E-NE cities like Rimini, Ancona, Pescara and the entire eastern hillside of the Apennines can be affected by true &quot;blizzards&quot;. The town of Fabriano, located just around 300 mt a.s.l., can often see 0.50-0.60 m of fresh snow fall in 24 hours during these episodes.<p>Italy is subject to highly diverse weather conditions in autumn, winter, and spring, while summer is usually more stable, although the northern regions often experience thunderstorms in the afternoon/night hours. So, while south of Florence the summer is typically dry and sunny, the north is tends to be more humid and cloudy.<p>The least number of rainy days and the highest number of hours of sunshine occur in the extreme south of the mainland and in <!--del_lnk--> Sicily and <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia. Here sunshine averages from four to five hours a day in winter and up to ten or eleven hours in summer. In the north precipitation is more evenly distributed during the year, although the summer is usually slightly wetter.

      <p>Italy is largely homogeneous in language and religion but is diverse culturally, economically, and politically. The country has the fifth-highest population density in Europe at 193 persons per square kilometre (499/<!--del_lnk--> sq.&nbsp;mi). However, like Germany, Italy&#39;s main population centers fall among several cities, mainly Turin, Rome, Milan, and Naples, with no single large city to rival the size of cities such as London, Paris or Moscow. As with many other nations in Europe, Italy is currently facing a natural population decline, supplemented only by immigration. Italy receives roughly 300,000 immigrants a year, second only to the United States.  Population estimates place Italy&#39;s population at roughly 41 million in 2050 if the current population trend continues. <p>Since the beginning of Roman civilisation, important influences have been exerted by ethnic groups like <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greek</a> settlers, <!--del_lnk--> Germanic and <!--del_lnk--> Celtic invaders and plunderers, and <!--del_lnk--> Norman colonisers.<p>The number of immigrants or foreign residents in Italy has steadily increased to reach 2,402,157, according to the latest figures (1/2005) of <!--del_lnk--> ISTAT.

Although the Catholic Church has never been the state religion, it still plays a role in the nation&#39;s political affairs, partly due to the <!--del_lnk--> Holy See&#39;s location in Rome. 87.8% of Italians identified as <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic <!--del_lnk--> , although only about one-third of these described themselves as active members (36.8%).<p>Other <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> groups in Italy include 500,000 <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses (0.9%)<sup>[<i><!--del_lnk--> citations needed</i>]</sup>, more than 700,000 <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> (1.2%) <!--del_lnk--> , including 470,000 newcomers <!--del_lnk-->  and some 180,000 <!--del_lnk--> Greek Orthodoxes, 450,000 <!--del_lnk--> Pentecotalists and <!--del_lnk--> Evangelicals (0.8%), of which 300,000 members of the <!--del_lnk--> Assemblies of God, 30,000 <!--del_lnk--> Waldensians <!--del_lnk--> , 25,000 <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventists, 22,000 <!--del_lnk--> Mormons, 15,000 <!--del_lnk--> Baptists (plus some 5,000 Free Baptists), 7,000 <!--del_lnk--> Lutherans, 5,000 <!--del_lnk--> Methodists (affiliated to the Waldensian Church) <!--del_lnk--> .<p>However the most historical religious minority is the <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> community, comprising roughly 45,000 Jews. It is no longer the strongest non-Christian group. Indeed, in the past two decades, Italy has been receiving many waves of immigrants from all over the world, especially eastern Europe and North Africa. As a result some 825,000 <!--del_lnk--> Muslims <!--del_lnk-->  (1.4%), of which only 50,000 are Italian citizens, live in Italy, as well as 110,000 <!--del_lnk--> Buddhists (0.2%) <!--del_lnk--> , <!--del_lnk-->  and <!--del_lnk--> , 70,000 <!--del_lnk--> Sikhs <!--del_lnk--> , 70,000 <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a> (0.1%).<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>According to GDP calculations, as measured by purchasing power parity (PPP), Italy is ranked as the 8th largest economy in the world in 2006, behind the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <!--del_lnk--> China, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, and the fourth largest in Europe. According to the OECD, in 2004 Italy was the world&#39;s sixth-largest exporter of manufactured goods. This <a href="../../wp/c/Capitalism.htm" title="Capitalism">capitalistic</a> economy remains divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a less developed <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agricultural</a> south. Italy&#39;s economy has deceptive strength because it is supported by a substantial &quot;underground&quot; economy that functions outside government controls.<p>Most new materials needed by industry and more than 75% of energy requirements are imported. Over the past decade, Italy has pursued a tight fiscal policy in order to meet the requirements of the <!--del_lnk--> Economic and Monetary Union and has benefited from lower interest and inflation rates. Italy joined the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">Euro</a> from its conception in 1999.<p>Italy&#39;s economic performance has at times lagged behind that of its <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">EU</a> partners, and the current government has enacted numerous short-term reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and long-term growth. It has moved slowly, however, on implementing certain structural reforms favoured by economists, such as lightening the high tax burden and overhauling Italy&#39;s rigid labour market and expensive <!--del_lnk--> pension system, because of the current economic slowdown and opposition from <!--del_lnk--> labour unions.<p>Italy has a smaller number of world class multinational corporations than other economies of comparable size. Instead, the country&#39;s main economic strength has been its large base of small and medium size companies. Many of these companies manufacture products that are technologically moderately advanced and therefore face increasing competition from China and other emerging Asian economies which are able to undercut them on labor costs. Italian companies are responding to this by concentrating on products with a higher technological content, while moving lower-tech manifacturing to plants in countries where labor is less expensive. The small average size of Italian companies remains a limiting factor, and the government has been working to encourage integration and mergers and to reform the rigid regulations that have traditionally been an obstacle to the development of larger corporations in the country.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h2>

      <p>The official language of Italy is <!--del_lnk--> Standard Italian, descendant of <!--del_lnk--> Tuscan dialect and a direct descendant of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>. (Some 75% of Italian words are of Latin origin.) However, when Italy was unified, in 1861, Italian existed mainly as a <!--del_lnk--> literary language, and was spoken by less than 3% of the population. Different languages were spoken throughout Italian peninsula, many of which were <!--del_lnk--> Romance languages which had developed in every region, due to political fragmentation of Italy<sup id="ref_dialects"><small>2</small></sup>. Indeed, each historical region of Italy had its own so-called &lsquo;dialetto&rsquo; (with &lsquo;<!--del_lnk--> dialect&rsquo; usually meaning, improperly, a non-Italian Romance language), with variants existing at the township-level.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Massimo d&#39;Azeglio, one of Cavour&#39;s ministers, is said to have stated, following Italian unification, that having created Italy, all that remained was to create Italians. Given the high number of languages spoken throughout the peninsula, it was quickly established that &#39;proper&#39; or &#39;standard&#39; Italian would be based on the <!--del_lnk--> Florentine dialect spoken in most of <!--del_lnk--> Tuscany (given that it was the first region to produce authors such as <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>, who between 1308 and 1321 wrote the <i><!--del_lnk--> Divina Commedia</i>). A national education system was established - leading to a decrease in variation in the languages spoken throughout the country over time. But it was not until the 1960s, when economic growth enabled widespread access to the television programmes of the state television broadcaster, <!--del_lnk--> RAI, that Italian truly became broadly-known and quite standardised.<p>Today, despite regional variations in the form of accents and vowel emphasis, Italian is fully comprehensible to most throughout the country. Nevertheless certain <!--del_lnk--> local idioms have become cherished beacons of regional variation&mdash;the <!--del_lnk--> Neapolitan which is extensively used for the singing of popular folk-songs, for instance&mdash;and in recent years many people have developed a particular pride in their local dialects.<p>In addition to the various regional linguistic varieties and dialects of standard Italian, a number of languages enjoying some form of official recognition are spoken:<ul>
       <li>In the north, the province of <!--del_lnk--> Bolzano has a majority <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>-speaking population; the area was awarded to Italy following the First World War and her defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Pockets of German speakers also persist in other north Italian regions: the <!--del_lnk--> Cimbrians in Veneto (<!--del_lnk--> Asiago, <!--del_lnk--> Luserna, etc.) and the <!--del_lnk--> Walsers in Val&#39;Aosta (<!--del_lnk--> Gressoney). In total some 300,000 or so Italians speak German as their first language and indeed many identify themselves as ethnic Austrians.<li>Some 120,000 or so people live in the <!--del_lnk--> Aosta Valley region, where a dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Franco-Proven&ccedil;al is spoken that is similar to dialects spoken in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. About 1,400 people living in two isolated towns in <!--del_lnk--> Foggia speak another dialect of Franco-Proven&ccedil;al.<li>About 80,000 <!--del_lnk--> Slovene-speakers live in the north-eastern region of <!--del_lnk--> Friuli-Venezia Giulia near the border with Slovenia.<li>In the <!--del_lnk--> Dolomite mountains of <!--del_lnk--> Trentino-South Tyrol and <!--del_lnk--> Veneto there are some 40,000 speakers of the <!--del_lnk--> Rhaetian language <!--del_lnk--> Ladin.<li>A very large community of some 700,000 people in <!--del_lnk--> Friuli speak <!--del_lnk--> Friulian&mdash;another Rhaetian language.<li>In the <!--del_lnk--> Molise region of central-south Italy some 4,000 people speak <!--del_lnk--> Molise Croatian. These are the <!--del_lnk--> Molise Croats, descendants of a group of people who migrated from the Balkans in the Middle Ages.<li>Scattered across <!--del_lnk--> southern Italy (<!--del_lnk--> Salento and <!--del_lnk--> Calabria) are a number of some 30,000 <!--del_lnk--> Greek-speakers&mdash;considered to be the last surviving traces of the region&#39;s Greek heritage. (Ancient Greek colonists reached southern Italy and Sicily about 1500 BC.) They speak a Greek dialect, <!--del_lnk--> Griko.<li>Some 15,000 <!--del_lnk--> Catalan speakers reside around the area of <!--del_lnk--> Alghero in the north-west corner of <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia&mdash;believed to be the result of a migration of a large group of Catalans from <a href="../../wp/b/Barcelona.htm" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> in ages past.<li>The <!--del_lnk--> Arb&euml;resh&euml;, of whom there are around 100,000 in southern Italy and in central <!--del_lnk--> Sicily&mdash;the result of past migrations&mdash;are speakers of the Arb&euml;resh dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Albanian.<li><!--del_lnk--> Sicilianu is spoken in Sicily by 4,832,520 people, nearly the entire population of the island. Again, it is commonly assumed to be a dialect, though it is distinct enough from Italian to be classified separately by <!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue. <!--del_lnk--> <li>Finally, the largest group of non-Italian speakers, some 1.6 million people, are those who speak <!--del_lnk--> Sardinian, a Romance language which retains many pre-Latin words.</ul>
