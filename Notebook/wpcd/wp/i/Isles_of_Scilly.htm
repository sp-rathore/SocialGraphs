      <p>The <b>Isles of Scilly</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Cornish: <i>Ynysek Syllan</i>) form an <!--del_lnk--> archipelago of islands off the southwesternmost tip of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Traditionally part of <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall, they now have their own <!--del_lnk--> local government. The islands are designated the <b>Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</b>. Scilly was also the name of one of ten ancient administrative shires of Cornwall - see &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Hundreds of Cornwall&quot;.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> county flower of the Isles of Scilly is <!--del_lnk--> Thrift.<p>The islands are correctly referred to as the Isles of Scilly, or simply as Scilly; the terms &quot;Scillies&quot; and &quot;Scilly Isles&quot; are considered incorrect by locals.<p>

      <p>The Isles of Scilly form an archipelago of six inhabited islands and numerous other small rocky islets (around 140 in total) lying 28 miles (45 km) off <!--del_lnk--> Land&#39;s End &ndash; the <!--del_lnk--> most southwesterly point of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. The six inhabited islands are <!--del_lnk--> St Mary&#39;s (2001 census population: 1,666), <!--del_lnk--> Tresco (180), <!--del_lnk--> St Martin&#39;s (142), <!--del_lnk--> St Agnes (70), <!--del_lnk--> Bryher (92) and <!--del_lnk--> Gugh (3); the total population was 2,153. Until 1855, <!--del_lnk--> Samson was also inhabited. There are many smaller uninhabited islands and rocky islets.<p>The islands&#39; position produces a place of great contrast &ndash; the ameliorating effect of the sea means they rarely have frost or snow, which allows local farmers to grow flowers well ahead of those on the island of Britain. The largest agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly <!--del_lnk--> daffodils. Exposure to <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> winds means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.<p>This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush sub-tropical <!--del_lnk--> Abbey Gardens on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low <!--del_lnk--> heather and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.<p>It was featured on the TV programme <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Natural Wonders</i> as one of the wonders of South west England.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Scilly has been inhabited since <a href="../../wp/s/Stone_Age.htm" title="Stone Age">Stone Age</a> times and its history has been one of <!--del_lnk--> subsistence living until the 20th century with people living off the land and the sea. <!--del_lnk--> Farming and <a href="../../wp/f/Fishing.htm" title="Fishing">fishing</a> continue today, but the main industry now is <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>.<p>The islands may correspond to the <!--del_lnk--> Cassiterides (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Tin Isles&quot;) visited by the <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians and mentioned by the <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Greece.htm" title="Ancient Greece">Greeks</a>.<p>It is likely that until relatively recently the Isles were much larger with many of them joined into one island and that the land has subsided. Evidence for this includes:<ul>
       <li>A description in <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">Roman times</a> describes Scilly as &quot;Scillonia insula&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> singular, as if there was an island much bigger than any of the others.<li>Remains of a prehistoric farm have been found on <!--del_lnk--> Nornour, which is now a small rocky <!--del_lnk--> skerry far too small for farming.<li>At certain low tides the sea becomes shallow enough for people to walk between some of the islands. This is possibly one of the sources for stories of drowned lands, e.g., <!--del_lnk--> Lyonesse.<li>Ancient field walls are visible below the high tide line off some of the islands (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Samson).</ul>
      <p>It is not known at exactly which point the islands stopped speaking <!--del_lnk--> Cornish, but it seems to have gone into decline during the <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and lost the language before parts of <!--del_lnk--> Penwith. The islands thus appeared to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of the mainland, in contrast to the situation of <!--del_lnk--> Irish or <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic.<p>During the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War, the isles were a stronghold for the <!--del_lnk--> Royalists. It was during this period that the <!--del_lnk--> Three Hundred and Thirty Five Years&#39; War started between the isles and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. In June <!--del_lnk--> 1651, the isles were captured from the Royalists by <!--del_lnk--> Admiral Robert Blake for the <!--del_lnk--> Parliamentarians.<p>Scilly is famous for its danger to shipping and <!--del_lnk--> its many shipwrecks. The wreck of <!--del_lnk--> Sir Cloudesley Shovell&#39;s ship <!--del_lnk--> HMS <i>Association</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1707 off the Isles of Scilly due to inaccuracies in navigation led to the development of the <!--del_lnk--> method of lunar distances, and to the invention of the <!--del_lnk--> chronometer by <!--del_lnk--> John Harrison, the first reliable methods of determining <!--del_lnk--> longitude at sea.<p>The sea has always played a huge part in Scillonian history but it was in the 19th century that Scilly had its maritime heyday. Beaches which are now enjoyed by sunbathers were then factories for <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding; the harbours now full of pleasure boats were once packed with local and visiting fishing and trading boats.<p>One continuing legacy of the isles&#39; past is <!--del_lnk--> gig racing, wherein fast rowing boats (&quot;gigs&quot;) with crews of six (or in one case, seven) race between the main islands. Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect <!--del_lnk--> salvage from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a <!--del_lnk--> pilot onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed &quot;pilot gigs&quot;.)<p>Former <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="../../wp/h/Harold_Wilson.htm" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> regularly holidayed on the Isles and eventually bought a cottage there as a holiday home. He is buried on St Mary&#39;s. His widow <!--del_lnk--> Mary Wilson is still a frequent visitor.<p><a id="Flag" name="Flag"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Flag</span></h2>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>There are primarily two flags used to represent Scilly:<ul>
       <li>The flag of the Council of the Isles of Scilly, which incorporates their logo.<li>The unofficial <i>Scillonian Cross</i>, voted for by readers of <i>Scilly News</i> <!--del_lnk--> .</ul>
      <p>An adapted version of the old Board of Ordnance flag <!--del_lnk-->  has also been used, after it was left behind when munitions were removed from the isles. The Cornish Ensign <!--del_lnk-->  has also been used.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>The principal current economic activity is <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. The tourist season has been extended into October when many <!--del_lnk--> birdwatchers (or birders) arrive. Because of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>, including extreme rarities from <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Siberia.<p>The main transport links with the mainland are currently:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Helicopter services between <!--del_lnk--> Penzance Heliport and St Mary&#39;s and Tresco (<!--del_lnk--> British International)<li><!--del_lnk--> Aeroplane services to St Mary&#39;s from various UK airports (Land&#39;s End, Newquay, Exeter, Bristol and Southampton - <!--del_lnk--> Skybus operated by the Isles of Scilly Steamship Group)<li>By sea on the <i>Scillonian III</i>, sailing from <!--del_lnk--> Penzance harbour (<!--del_lnk--> Isles of Scilly Travel part of the Isles of Scilly Steamship Group)</ul>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> freehold of the islands is the property of the British Crown (except for <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Town on St Mary&#39;s, which was sold to the inhabitants in <!--del_lnk--> 1949). The crown estate in the islands is administered by the <!--del_lnk--> Duchy of Cornwall. The duchy also holds 3,921 acres as duchy property, part of the duchy&#39;s landholding. <p>The sea around Scilly is very clear and there is much rocky seabed, and <!--del_lnk--> scuba diving is popular there.<p><a id="Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty" name="Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</span></h2>
      <p>In 1975, the islands were designated as an <!--del_lnk--> Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large <a href="../../wp/t/Tern.htm" title="Tern">terneries</a> and the islands are well populated by <!--del_lnk--> seals. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the <!--del_lnk--> White-toothed Shrew.<p>The islands are famous amongst birdwatchers, especially <!--del_lnk--> twitchers for their almost magnetic ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but island archipelagos are favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.<p><a id="Football_.28Soccer.29" name="Football_.28Soccer.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Football (Soccer)</span></h2>
      <p>The Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest national <!--del_lnk--> football(soccer) league in the world. The league&#39;s two clubs, <!--del_lnk--> Woolpack Wanderers and <!--del_lnk--> Garrison Gunners, play each other around twenty times a season and compete for two cups as well as the league title. The two share a ground, Garrison Field, but travel to the mainland for part of the year to play other non-professional clubs.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isles_of_Scilly&quot;</div>
