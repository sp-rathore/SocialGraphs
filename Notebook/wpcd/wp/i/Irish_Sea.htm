      <p>The <b>Irish Sea</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <b>Muir &Eacute;ireann</b>) separates the islands of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. It is connected to the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> by <!--del_lnk--> St George&#39;s Channel between the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_Ireland.htm" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall to the south and by the <!--del_lnk--> North Channel between <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to the north-east. The <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> lies in the middle of the Irish Sea. The sea is of high economic importance to regional trade, shipping and transport, fishing and power generation in the form of wind power and nuclear plants. There has been long discussion of building a 80 km (50 mile) rail tunnel to link Britain and Ireland; annual traffic between the two islands amounts to over 12 million passengers and 17 <!--del_lnk--> megatonnes of trade.<p>

      <p>Ireland has no tunnel or bridge connection to a continent. Thus the vast majority of heavy goods trade is done by sea. Northern Irish ports handle 10 megatonnes of goods trade with Britain annually, while ports in the south handle 7.6 Mt, representing 50% and 40% respectively of total trade by weight.<p><!--del_lnk--> Liverpool and Birkenhead port handles 32 Mt cargo and 734 thousand passengers a year . Holyhead port handles most of the passenger traffic from Dublin and Dun Laoghaire port, as well as 3.3 million tonnes of freight. <p>Ports in the Republic handle 3,600,000 travelers crossing the Irish sea each year, amounting to 92% of all sea travel . This has been steadily dropping for a number of years (20% since 1999), probably as a result of low cost airlines.<p>Ferry connections between Britain to Ireland via the Irish Sea include the routes from <!--del_lnk--> Swansea to <!--del_lnk--> Cork, <!--del_lnk--> Fishguard and <!--del_lnk--> Pembroke to <!--del_lnk--> Rosslare, <!--del_lnk--> Holyhead to <!--del_lnk--> D&uacute;n Laoghaire, <!--del_lnk--> Stranraer to <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Larne, and <!--del_lnk--> Cairnryan to <!--del_lnk--> Larne.

      <p>The Irish Sea has undergone a series of dramatic changes over the last 20,000 years as the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a> ended and was replaced by warmer conditions. At the height of the ice age the central part of the modern sea was probably a long freshwater lake. As the ice retreated 10,000 years ago the lake reconnected to the sea, becoming brackish and then fully saline once again.<p><a id="Environment" name="Environment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Environment</span></h2>
      <p>The Irish Sea has been subject to heavy <!--del_lnk--> radioactive contamination by the first British weapons grade <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium"><sup>239</sup>Pu</a> nuclear production plant and power station at <!--del_lnk--> Sellafield, also known as Windscale. (See the <!--del_lnk--> Sellafield page about the naming of this site.) An estimated 250 kg of <a href="../../wp/p/Plutonium.htm" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> have been deposited in marine sediments during the first decades of production. Another source of radioactive pollution may be the <!--del_lnk--> Dundrennan Range on the <!--del_lnk--> Solway Firth. Further north are the <!--del_lnk--> Holy Loch (the location of a United States Navy base [1960 to 1991]) and <!--del_lnk--> Faslane bases, where nuclear submarines were serviced during the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold war">cold war</a>. After the <a href="../../wp/c/Chernobyl_disaster.htm" title="Chernobyl disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, rain containing <!--del_lnk--> Cs-137 and other radioactive material fell in the area. The area of the <!--del_lnk--> Beaufort&#39;s Dyke has been used as a dump for chemical weapons and possibly more nuclear waste.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Irish Sea Forum is an environmental forum concerned with the Irish Sea. Some elements of the Irish Sea fishery are subject to collapse, due to <!--del_lnk--> overfishing from <!--del_lnk--> worldwide population growth, and also due to <!--del_lnk--> marine pollution. In response, the UK government has created <!--del_lnk--> Biodiversity Action Plans related to the <i>solea solea</i> and other fishes.<p><a id="U-boat_Alley" name="U-boat_Alley"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">U-boat Alley</span></h2>
      <p>During the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">Great War</a> the Irish Sea became known as &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> U-boat Alley&rdquo;. After the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> entered the war in <!--del_lnk--> 1917, the U-boats moved their emphasis from the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> to the Irish Sea. <p><a id="Oil_and_gas_exploration" name="Oil_and_gas_exploration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Oil and gas exploration</span></h2>
      <p><a id="East_Irish_Sea_Basin" name="East_Irish_Sea_Basin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">East Irish Sea Basin</span></h3>
      <p>With 7.5 trillion cubic feet (210 km&sup3;) of gas and 176 million barrels (28,000,000 m&sup3;) of oil estimated by the field operators as initially recoverable reserves from eight producing fields (DTI, 2001), the East Irish Sea Basin is at a mature exploration phase. Early <!--del_lnk--> Namurian basinal mudstones are the source rocks for these hydrocarbons. Production from all fields is from fault-bounded traps of the Lower <a href="../../wp/t/Triassic.htm" title="Triassic">Triassic</a> <!--del_lnk--> formation, principally aeolian <!--del_lnk--> Sherwood Sandstone reservoir, top-sealed by younger Triassic continental mudstones and evaporites. Future exploration will initially concentrate on extending this play, but there remains largely untested potential also for gas and oil within widespread <a href="../../wp/c/Carboniferous.htm" title="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> fluvial sandstone reservoirs. This play requires intraformational mudstone seal units to be present, as there is no top-seal for reservoirs subcropping the regional base <a href="../../wp/p/Permian.htm" title="Permian">Permian</a> unconformity in the east of the basin, and Carboniferous <!--del_lnk--> strata crop out at the sea bed in the west.<p><a id="Caernarfon_Bay_Basin" name="Caernarfon_Bay_Basin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Caernarfon Bay Basin</span></h3>
      <p>The Caernarfon Bay Basin contains up to 7 km of Permian and Triassic syn-rift sediments in an asymmetrical <!--del_lnk--> graben that is bounded to the north and south by Lower Paleozoic massifs. Only two exploration wells have been drilled so far, and there remain numerous undrilled targets in tilted fault block plays. As in the East Irish Sea Basin, the principal target reservoir is the Lower Triassic, Sherwood Sandstone, top-sealed by younger Triassic mudstones and evaporites. Wells in the Irish Sector to the west have demonstrated that pre-rift, <!--del_lnk--> Westphalian <!--del_lnk--> coal measures are excellent hydrocarbon source rocks, and are at peak maturity for gas generation (Maddox et al., 1995). <!--del_lnk--> Seismic profiles clearly image these strata continuing beneath a basal Permian unconformity into at least the western part of the Caernarfon Bay Basin. The timing of gas generation presents the greatest exploration risk. Maximum burial of, and primary gas migration from, the source rocks could have terminated as early as the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a>, whereas many of the tilted fault blocks were reactivated or created during <!--del_lnk--> Paleogene inversion of the basin. However, it is also possible that a secondary gas charge occurred during regional heating associated with intrusion of Paleogene dykes, such as those that crop out nearby on the coastline of north Wales. (Floodpage et al., 1999) have invoked this second phase of Paleogene hydrocarbon generation as an important factor in the charging of the East Irish Sea Basin&rsquo;s oil and gas fields. It is not clear as yet whether aeromagnetic anomalies in the south-east of Caernarfon Bay are imaging a continuation of the dyke swarm into this area too, or whether they are instead associated with deeply buried Permian syn-rift volcanics. Alternatively, the fault block traps could have been recharged by <!--del_lnk--> exsolution of <!--del_lnk--> methane from formation brines as a direct result of the <!--del_lnk--> Tertiary uplift (cf. Dor&eacute; and Jensen, 1996).<p><a id="The_Cardigan_Bay_Basin" name="The_Cardigan_Bay_Basin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Cardigan Bay Basin</span></h3>
      <p>The Cardigan Bay Basin forms a continuation into UK waters of Ireland&rsquo;s North Celtic Sea Basin, which has two producing gas fields. The basin comprises a south-easterly deepening half-graben near the Welsh coastline, although its internal structure becomes increasingly complex towards the south-west. Permian to Triassic, syn-rift sediments within the basin are less than 3 km thick and are overlain by up to 4 km of Jurassic strata, and locally also by up to 2 km of Paleogene fluvio-deltaic sediments. The basin has a proven petroleum system, with potentially producible gas reserves at the Dragon discovery near the UK/Ireland median line, and oil shows in a further three wells. The Cardigan Bay Basin contains multiple reservoir targets, which include the Lower Triassic (Sherwood Sandstone), Middle Jurassic shallow marine sandstones and limestone (Great <!--del_lnk--> Oolite), and Upper Jurassic fluvial sandstone, the reservoir for the Dragon discovery. The most likely hydrocarbon source rocks are early Jurassic marine mudstones (Lias Group). These are fully mature for oil generation in the west of the UK sector, and are mature for gas generation nearby in the Irish sector. Gas-prone, Westphalian pre-rift coal measures may also be present at depth locally. The Cardigan Bay Basin was subjected to two Tertiary phases of compressive uplift, whereas maximum burial that terminated primary hydrocarbon generation was probably around the end of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, or earlier if Cretaceous strata, now missing, were never deposited in the basin. Despite the Tertiary structuration, the Dragon discovery has proved that potentially commercial volumes of hydrocarbons were retained at least locally in Cardigan Bay. In addition to undrilled structural traps, the basin contains untested potential for stratigraphic entrapment of hydrocarbons near synsedimentary faults, especially in the Middle Jurassic section. <p><b>The Liverpool Bay Development</b> is <!--del_lnk--> BHP Billiton Petroleum&#39;s largest operated asset.

      <p>Discussions of linking Britain to Ireland began in 1895, with an application &pound;15,000 towards the cost of carrying out borings and soundings in the North Channel to see if a tunnel between Ireland and Scotland was viable. Sixty years later <!--del_lnk--> Harford Montgomery Hyde, <!--del_lnk--> Unionist MP for North Belfast, called for the building of such a tunnel. . A tunnel project has been discussed several times in the Irish Parliament,    <p>Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the &quot;Tusker Tunnel&quot; between the ports of <!--del_lnk--> Rosslare and <!--del_lnk--> Fishguard proposed by The Institute of Engineers of Ireland in 2004.  . A different proposed route is between <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Holyhead, proposed in 1997 by a leading British engineering firm, Symonds, for a rail tunnel from Dublin to Holyhead. Either tunnel, at 80 km, would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated &euro;20,000,000,000.<p>There could be an economic case for such a link. The Irish sea is one of the busiest shipping regions in the world and has the world&#39;s largest car <!--del_lnk--> ferry&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Irish Ferries <i>Ulysses</i> . In addition, half of the air traffic at <!--del_lnk--> Dublin Airport is to Britain, with 8,300,000 passengers per annum. The Dublin-London air route is the busiest in the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and the second busiest in the world, with about 50 daily flights and 4.5 million journeys per annum. The success of the 15 km <!--del_lnk--> Oresund Bridge, inaugurated in 2000 and linking <!--del_lnk--> Malm&ouml;, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, which has led to important economic integration between the two cities, suggests that the Dublin&ndash;Holyhead route may be the most promising.  With the addition of high speed rail, such a tunnel could cut journey times from the northern English cities of <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a> to Dublin to under an hour. The combined population of the three metropolitan areas is over 5 million. The question would have to be raised over what gauge to build a rail link as Ireland uses a different gauge to the UK.<p>Despite this, and possibly due to the failure of the <!--del_lnk--> Channel Tunnel to generate adequate passenger numbers, various Irish government studies have concluded that an Irish Sea tunnel is, as yet, economically unfeasible.<p><a id="Wind_power" name="Wind_power"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Wind power</span></h2>
