      <p><b>Indonesia</b>, officially the <b>Republic of Indonesia</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Indonesian: <i>Republik Indonesia</i>), is a <!--del_lnk--> nation of 18,110 islands in the <!--del_lnk--> South East Asian <!--del_lnk--> Archipelago, making it the world&#39;s largest archipelagic state. Its capital is <a href="../../wp/j/Jakarta.htm" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>. Indonesia is bordered by the nations of <a href="../../wp/p/Papua_New_Guinea.htm" title="Papua New Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. With a population of over 200 million, it is the world&#39;s fourth <!--del_lnk--> most populous country and the most populous <!--del_lnk--> Muslim-majority nation.<p>The Indonesian Archipelago, home of the <!--del_lnk--> Spice Islands, has been an important trade destination since early <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> sailors began to find profit in the <!--del_lnk--> spice trade during ancient times. Much of Indonesia&#39;s history has been influenced by the many foreign powers that have been drawn to the archipelago by its wealth of natural resources. These have included <!--del_lnk--> Classical Hindus and <!--del_lnk--> Buddhists from <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Muslim traders in <!--del_lnk--> medieval times, and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a> during the <!--del_lnk--> Age of Exploration, who fought for monopolization of the spice trade. Indonesia was <!--del_lnk--> colonized by the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> for over three centuries; however, the nation declared its <!--del_lnk--> independence in 1945, which was internationally recognized four years later. Since then, the region has had a turbulent history, including political instability and corruption, periods of rapid economic growth and decline, environmental catastrophe, and a recent <!--del_lnk--> democratization process.<p>Indonesia is a <!--del_lnk--> unitary state consisting of numerous distinct ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups spread across its numerous islands. The modern borders of Indonesia are based upon those of the Dutch East Indies colony, rather than on any preconceived notion of unity. However, a shared history of colonialism, rebellion against it, a national <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian language, and a religious majority of Islam help to define Indonesia as a state. Indonesia&#39;s national motto, <i>Bhinneka tunggal ika</i> (derived from <!--del_lnk--> Old Javanese for <i>unity in diversity</i>), reflects the amalgamation of the country&#39;s myriad cultures, languages, and ethnic groups. However, sectarian tensions have threatened political stability in some regions, leading to violent confrontations and the secession of <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>.<p>

</script><a id="Etymology" name="Etymology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Etymology</span></h2>
      <p>The name <i>Indonesia</i> was derived the from <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>indus</i>, meaning India, and <i>nesos</i>, meaning islands. Dating back to the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century, the name far predates the formation of the Indonesian nation. In <!--del_lnk--> 1849, an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> etymology expert, George Samuel Windsor Earl, writing in an annual science journal, suggested that the <i>Hindia</i> or Malaya archipelago choose a distinct name, suggesting either <i>Indunesia</i> or <i>Melayunesia</i>, although he favoured the latter. In a concurrent article in the same publication, another etymologist, James Richardson Logan, proposed using <i>Indunesia</i> over <i>Melayunesia</i>. He also changed the letter &quot;u&quot; to &quot;o&quot; to improve the pronunciation. The first Indonesian to use the name was <!--del_lnk--> Suwardi Suryaningrat (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when he established a <!--del_lnk--> press bureau with the name <i>Indonesisch Pers-bureau</i> in the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>Fossil evidence suggests the Indonesian archipelago was inhabited by <i><!--del_lnk--> Homo erectus</i>, popularly termed the <i><!--del_lnk--> Java Man</i>. Estimates of its existence range from 500,000 to 2 million years ago. The modern peoples of <!--del_lnk--> Malay people origin are descendants of immigrants from mainland South East Asia beginning around 6,000 years ago. Ideal agricultural conditions, and in particular the mastering of <!--del_lnk--> wet-field <a href="../../wp/r/Rice.htm" title="Rice">rice</a> cultivation as early as the seventh century BC, allowed villages, towns and eventually small kingdoms to flourish by the first century AD. Around the same time, trade was established between both <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, fostered by Indonesia&rsquo;s strategic sea lane position which would continue to be one of the most important influences on the country&rsquo;s history.<p>It was upon this trade, and the <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> that was brought with it, that the <!--del_lnk--> Sriwijaya kingdom flourished from the 7th century AD. It became a powerful naval state, which grew wealthy on the international trade it controlled through the region until its decline in the 12th century. During the 8th and 10th centuries AD, the agriculturally-based Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> Sailendra and Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java with great monuments built, including <!--del_lnk--> Borobudur and <!--del_lnk--> Prambanan respectively. The Hindu <!--del_lnk--> Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java in 1294, and under its military commander <!--del_lnk--> Gajah Mada stretched over much of modern day Indonesia. This period is referred to as a Golden Age in the country&rsquo;s history.<p><!--del_lnk--> Arab traders first brought Islam to Indonesia in the late 12th century, establishing settlements in the <!--del_lnk--> Aceh region. It spread across the Indonesian archipelago, following trade routes. Rather than a violent conquest, it was, for the most part, peacefully laid over and mixed with existing cultural (and even religious) influences to form what is still the predominant form of <!--del_lnk--> Islam in Indonesia today, particularly in Java.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>European traders first arrived in the early <!--del_lnk--> sixteenth century seeking to monopolize the sources of <a href="../../wp/n/Nutmeg.htm" title="Nutmeg">nutmeg</a>, <!--del_lnk--> cloves, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cubeb.htm" title="Cubeb">cubeb pepper</a> in <!--del_lnk--> The Moluccas. In 1506 the <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>, led by <a href="../../wp/f/Ferdinand_Magellan.htm" title="Ferdinand Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>, were the first Europeans to arrive in Indonesia; the Dutch and <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">British</a> followed. The Dutch became the dominant traders in Indonesia, establishing the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602. The VOC, however, was dissolved in 1798 and the government of the Netherlands established the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch East Indies as a fully-fledged colony.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Dutch colonial presence in Indonesia existed in various forms for over 300 years until the <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> <!--del_lnk--> occupation in the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">second World War</a>. During the war, <!--del_lnk--> Sukarno, a popular leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian Nationalist Party, cooperated with the occupying Japanese with the intention of strengthening the independence movement. On <!--del_lnk--> August 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Sukarno, with the Japanese organized National Committee of Independence (BPUPKI) unilaterally declared <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian independence. Sukarno then became the first <!--del_lnk--> president, while <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Hatta became the <!--del_lnk--> vice-president. Over the next four years, the Netherlands mounted <!--del_lnk--> military campaigns to reoccupy Indonesia, but in the face of international pressure acknowledged Indonesian independence in 1949.<p>Increasing tensions between the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) and the Indonesian military culminated in an abortive coup on <!--del_lnk--> 30 September <!--del_lnk--> 1965 which saw six top-ranking generals murdered in <!--del_lnk--> circumstances that remain contentious even today. A quick counter-coup led by <!--del_lnk--> Major General Suharto resulted in an violent anti-communist purge centered mainly in Java and Bali. Hundreds of thousands were killed  - some sources say as many as a million  - in an event that went largely unreported in international media. Politically, Suharto capitalized on Sukarno&#39;s gravely weakened position in a drawn out power play between the two, and by March 1967 had <!--del_lnk--> maneuvered himself into the presidency. Commonly referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> <i>New Order</i>, Suharto&#39;s administration encouraged major foreign <!--del_lnk--> investment in Indonesia, which was to become a major factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1997 to <!--del_lnk--> 1998, however, Indonesia became the country hardest hit by the <!--del_lnk--> East Asian Financial Crisis, aggravating popular discontent with Suharto, who already faced accusations of <!--del_lnk--> corruption, and further inflaming <!--del_lnk--> popular protests in early 1998. On <!--del_lnk--> 21 May <!--del_lnk--> 1998, President Suharto announced his resignation, ushering in the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Reformasi</i> era in Indonesia. A wide range of reforms have been introduced since then, including Indonesia&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> direct presidential election in <!--del_lnk--> 2004, but progress has been slowed by political and economic instability, social unrest, terrorism and recent natural disasters. Although relations between different religious and ethnic groups are largely harmonious, acute sectarian discontent, even violence, remains a problem in some areas. Political settlements relating to separatism issues have been achieved in <!--del_lnk--> Aceh and <a href="../../wp/e/East_Timor.htm" title="East Timor">East Timor</a>, the latter having seceded from Indonesia in <!--del_lnk--> 1999.<p><a id="Government_and_politics" name="Government_and_politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Government and politics</span></h2>

      <p>Indonesia is a <!--del_lnk--> republic and a <!--del_lnk--> unitary state with a <!--del_lnk--> presidential system and power concentrated with the national government. The <!--del_lnk--> President of Indonesia is directly elected for a term of five years, and is the <!--del_lnk--> head of state, <!--del_lnk--> commander-in-chief of the <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian armed forces, and responsible for domestic governance, policy-making and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature.<p>The highest legislative body is the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Consultative Assembly (MPR), an umbrella organization that consists of the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Representative Council (DPR), and the <!--del_lnk--> Regional Representatives Council (DPD). The DPR is the lower house and its 550 members are elected for five-year terms on a <!--del_lnk--> proportional representation basis from each of Indonesia&#39;s 33 provinces. The DPD is a new chamber coming into effect in 2004 and is charged with managing regional representation within the central national government.  Each province elects 4 members on a non-partisan basis. The DPD does not have, however, the revising powers of an upper house such as the United States Senate, rather it is restricted to bills concerning matters of regional management.<p>The Supreme Court is the highest level of the judicial branch. Its judges are appointed by the president. Each province has its own High Court.<p>Indonesia is a founding member of the <!--del_lnk--> Association of South East Asian Nations, and is therefore a member of both <!--del_lnk--> ASEAN+3 and the <!--del_lnk--> East Asia Summit. Since the 1980s, Indonesia has worked to develop close political and economic ties between South East Asian nations, and is influential in the <!--del_lnk--> Organization of Islamic Conference.

Originally part of the Australian landmass, the highlands of Papua enclose a number of unique environments, including over 600 bird species, with fauna closely related to Australia&rsquo;s.

      <p>Surrounding a vast number of islands with over 80,000km of coastline, the warm, tropical seas of Indonesia also boast a high level of biodiversity, corresponding with a diverse range of <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems including <!--del_lnk--> beaches, <!--del_lnk--> sand dunes, <!--del_lnk--> estuaries, <!--del_lnk--> mangroves, <!--del_lnk--> coral reefs, <!--del_lnk--> sea grass beds, <!--del_lnk--> coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.<p>The British naturalist <!--del_lnk--> Alfred Wallace described a dividing line between the distribution of Indonesia&#39;s Asian and Australasian species, Known as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Wallace Line</i>, it runs along the edge of the <!--del_lnk--> Sunda shelf, between Kalimantan and Sulawesi, and along the deep <!--del_lnk--> Lombok Strait, between <!--del_lnk--> Lombok and <!--del_lnk--> Bali. West of the line, the flora and fauna are more Asian, and as one travels east from Lombok they are increasingly Australian. Wallace described not only the transition between Asian and Australasian species, but also numerous species unique to the surrounding area, which is now known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Wallacea</i>.<p>As a highly populous country part way through a rapid <!--del_lnk--> industrialisation process, Indonesia faces some grave ecological issues, which are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.

Indonesia is the world&rsquo;s largest <!--del_lnk--> LNG producer, exporting about 20% of the world&rsquo;s total volume in 2002.

Indonesia&#39;s imports commodities include <!--del_lnk--> machinery and <!--del_lnk--> equipment, <!--del_lnk--> chemicals, <!--del_lnk--> fuels, and <!--del_lnk--> foodstuffs.<p>Despite being the only East Asian member of <!--del_lnk--> OPEC, Indonesia&#39;s fuel production has declined significantly over the years, owing to aging oil fields and lack of investment in new equipment. As a result, despite being an exporter of crude oil, Indonesia is now a net importer of oil and had previously subsidized fuel prices to keep prices low, costing <!--del_lnk--> US$ 7 billion in 2004. The current president has mandated a significant reduction of government subsidy of fuel prices in several stages. In order to alleviate economic hardships, the government has offered one-time subsidies to qualified citizens. The government has stated to reduce subsidies, aiming to reduce the budget deficit to 1% of <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product (GDP) this year, down from around 1.7% last year. The real <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product (GDP) of Indonesia is projected to reach 5.2% in the second half year of 2006.<p>In the late 1990s, Indonesia suffered a drastic economic downturn followed by a significant but at times patchy and only partial recovery. This was largely due to the <!--del_lnk--> financial crisis that struck much of east Asia at the time, but was exacerbated by perceptions of corruption at all levels and a perceived slow pace of economic reform.<p>Indonesia has received large amounts of economic aid from <!--del_lnk--> bilateral, <!--del_lnk--> multilateral and non-governmental organizations (<!--del_lnk--> NGOs). Although Indonesia finished its <!--del_lnk--> IMF program in December 2003, the country still receives bilateral aid through the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) which reached $2.8 billion for 2004 and 2005.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Transmigration program contributed to the spread of people from highly populated Java and <!--del_lnk--> Madura to eastern Indonesia.

Although the Chinese make up 2% of the population, the majority of the country&rsquo;s businesses and wealth is Chinese-controlled. This has caused considerable resentment despite the fact that it is only a small proportion of Chinese that hold great wealth, and there are now large numbers of prosperous, middle class non-Chinese.

      <p>Islam was first brought to northern Sumatra by <!--del_lnk--> Arab traders in the 13th century and had become <!--del_lnk--> Indonesia&rsquo;s dominant religion by the 15th century. Although Islam was once mainly practiced in Java and Sumatra, emigration, largely from Java, has increased the number of Muslims living in <!--del_lnk--> Bali, <!--del_lnk--> Borneo, <!--del_lnk--> Sulawesi, <!--del_lnk--> Maluku, and <!--del_lnk--> Papua. Like other religions in Indonesia, Islam has blended with local traditional beliefs such as those practiced by the <i><!--del_lnk--> Abangan</i> Muslims on Java  and with other belief systems in northern Sumatra and Kalimantan. Such <!--del_lnk--> syncretic practises draw on distinctly Indonesian customs and typically differ from more <!--del_lnk--> Orthodox Islam by favoring local customs over <!--del_lnk--> Islamic law. One notable difference includes a generally greater level of freedom and higher social status for women. The majority of Indonesian Muslims are generally accepting of differing religious practices and interpretations within their own faith. At the same time, Muslims in Indonesia are typically devout; many have made the <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage to <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>, for example. More Orthodox Muslims who believe in a strict adherence to <!--del_lnk--> Sharia make up a significantly smaller but growing percentage of the population; for example, the wearing of a <i>jilbab</i> is becoming more common. There is also a small but outspoken hard-line <!--del_lnk--> Islamist presence in Indonesia, including movements such as <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian Mujahedeen Council. Most Indonesian Muslims are wary of these movements, some of which seek to supplant the Indonesian government and establish an Islamic state.<p><!--del_lnk--> Catholicism was first brought to Indonesia by early Portuguese colonialists and missionaries, and the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant denominations are largely a result of Dutch <!--del_lnk--> Calvinist and <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran missionary efforts during its colonial time, although these efforts did not extend to Java or other predominantly Muslim areas. As with Islam and Hinduism, many Christian beliefs in Indonesia are <!--del_lnk--> combined with animism and other traditional beliefs and cultural practices.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Indonesia has around 300 ethnic groups each with cultural differences which have shifted over the centuries and the concept of Indonesian culture is a fusion of this diversity. One example is the <!--del_lnk--> Borobudur temple, which is a mix of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Javanese culture, as it was built by a Javanese dynasty, the <!--del_lnk--> Sailendra. Indonesia has also imported cultural aspects from <!--del_lnk--> Arabic, Chinese, Malay and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> sources.<p>Art forms in Indonesia have been influenced by several cultures. Traditional <!--del_lnk--> Javanese and <!--del_lnk--> Balinese dances, for example, contain aspects of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu culture and mythology as does the Javanese and Balinese <!--del_lnk--> wayang kulit shadow puppet shows, depicting several mythological events. Cloth such as <!--del_lnk--> batik, <!--del_lnk--> ikat and <!--del_lnk--> songket are created across Indonesia with different areas having different styles and specialisations. The most dominant influences on <!--del_lnk--> Indonesian architecture have traditionally been <!--del_lnk--> Indian, however, European architecture has had a significant influence, particularly from the 19th century. <i><!--del_lnk--> Pencak Silat</i> is a unique martial art originating from the archipelago.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Indonesian music varies within cities and groups as people who live in the countryside would listen to a different kind of music than people in the city. Although rock was introduced in Indonesia by Indonesian <!--del_lnk--> rock band, God Bless (see <!--del_lnk--> Ian Antono), native Indonesian music is still preserved. Examples of Indonesian traditional music are <!--del_lnk--> Gamelan and Keroncong. A more modern form of Indonesian native music is <!--del_lnk--> Dangdut. The movie industry&#39;s popularity peaked in the 1980s and dominated cinemas in Indonesia, although it fell significantly in the early 1990s. For instance, in 1990, 115 local movies were produced while only 37 movies produced in 1993. However, as of the year 2000, the movie industry has improved gradually with a number of successful movies.<p><!--del_lnk--> Media freedom in Indonesia increased considerably after the end of President <!--del_lnk--> Suharto&#39;s rule, during which the now-defunct Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted foreign media. The <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">TV</a> market includes 10 national commercial networks, which compete with public <!--del_lnk--> TVRI. Some provinces also operate their own stations. Private <!--del_lnk--> radio stations carry their own news bulletins and foreign broadcasters can supply programmes.
