Asimov is widely considered a master of the science-fiction <!--del_lnk--> genre and, along with <!--del_lnk--> Robert A. Heinlein and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur C. Clarke, was considered one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; science-fiction writers during his lifetime. Asimov&#39;s most famous work is the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Foundation</i> Series; his other major series are the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Galactic Empire</i> series and the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Robot</i> series, both of which he later tied into the Foundation Series. He also wrote <!--del_lnk--> mysteries and <!--del_lnk--> fantasy, as well as a great amount of non-fiction. Asimov wrote the <!--del_lnk--> <i>Lucky Starr</i> series of <!--del_lnk--> juvenile science-fiction novels using the <!--del_lnk--> pen name <!--del_lnk--> Paul French.<p>Most of Asimov&#39;s popularized science books explain scientific concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. He often provides nationalities, birth dates, and death dates for the scientists he mentions, as well as <!--del_lnk--> etymologies and pronunciation guides for technical terms. Examples include his <i>Guide to Science,</i> the 3-volume set <i>Understanding Physics,</i> and <i>Asimov&#39;s Chronology of Science and Discovery.</i><p>Asimov was a long-time member and Vice President of <!--del_lnk--> Mensa International, albeit reluctantly; he described the members of that organization as &quot;intellectually combative&quot;. He took more joy in being President of the <!--del_lnk--> American Humanist Association. The <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> <!--del_lnk--> 5020 Asimov, the magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> Asimov&#39;s Science Fiction,</i> and two different <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Asimov Awards are named in his honour.<p>

      <p>Asimov was born around <!--del_lnk--> January 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1920 (his date of birth for official purposes&mdash;the precise date is not certain) in <!--del_lnk--> Petrovichi <i><!--del_lnk--> shtetl</i> of <!--del_lnk--> Smolensk Oblast, <!--del_lnk--> RSFSR (now <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>) to Anna Rachel Berman Asimov and Judah Asimov, a <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a> family of <!--del_lnk--> millers. They immigrated to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> when he was 3 years old. Since his parents always spoke <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> with him, he never learned <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>. Growing up in <!--del_lnk--> Brooklyn, New York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of 5, and remained fluent in Yiddish as well as English. His parents owned a succession of <!--del_lnk--> candy stores, and everyone in the family was expected to work in them. Science fiction <!--del_lnk--> pulp magazines were sold in the stores, and he began reading them. Around the age of 11 he began to write his own stories, and by age 19 he was selling them to the science fiction magazines.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Asimov attended <!--del_lnk--> New York City Public Schools, including Boys High School, in Brooklyn, New York. From there he went on to <!--del_lnk--> Columbia University, from which he graduated in <!--del_lnk--> 1939, later returning to earn a <!--del_lnk--> Ph.D. in <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry in <!--del_lnk--> 1948. In between, he spent 3 years during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> working as a civilian at the <!--del_lnk--> Philadelphia Navy Yard&#39;s Naval Air Experimental Station. After the war ended, he was drafted into the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army, serving for just under 9 months before receiving an honorable discharge. In the course of his brief military career, he rose to the rank of <!--del_lnk--> corporal on the basis of his typing skills, and narrowly avoided participating in the <!--del_lnk--> 1946 <!--del_lnk--> atomic bomb tests at <!--del_lnk--> Bikini Atoll.<p>After completing his doctorate, Asimov joined the faculty of the <!--del_lnk--> Boston University Medical School, with which he remained associated thereafter. From <!--del_lnk--> 1958, this was in a non-teaching capacity, as he became a full-time writer (his writing income had already exceeded his academic salary). Being <!--del_lnk--> tenured meant that he retained the title of <!--del_lnk--> associate professor and, in <!--del_lnk--> 1979, the university honored his writing by promoting him to full <!--del_lnk--> professor of biochemistry. Asimov&#39;s personal papers from <!--del_lnk--> 1965 on are archived at the university&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mugar Memorial Library, to which he donated them at the request of <!--del_lnk--> curator Howard Gottlieb. The collection fills 464 boxes, on 71 <!--del_lnk--> metres of shelf space.<p>Asimov married Gertrude Blugerman (1917, Canada&ndash;1990, Boston) on <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1942. They had two children, David (b. 1951) and <!--del_lnk--> Robyn Joan (b. 1955). After a separation in 1970, he and Gertrude divorced in 1973, and Asimov married <!--del_lnk--> Janet O. Jeppson later that year.<p>Asimov was a <!--del_lnk--> claustrophile; he enjoyed small, enclosed spaces. In the first volume of his autobiography, he recalls a childhood desire to own a magazine stand in a <!--del_lnk--> New York City Subway station, within which he could enclose himself and listen to the rumble of passing trains while reading.<p>Asimov was <!--del_lnk--> afraid of flying, only doing so twice in his entire life (once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station, and once returning home from the army base in <!--del_lnk--> Oahu in 1946). He seldom traveled great distances, partly because his aversion to aircraft complicated the logistics of long-distance travel; this phobia influenced several of his fiction works, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Wendell Urth mystery stories and the Robot novels featuring <!--del_lnk--> Elijah Baley. In his later years, he found he enjoyed traveling on <!--del_lnk--> cruise ships, and on several occasions he became part of the cruises&#39; &quot;entertainment,&quot; giving science-themed talks on ships such as the <!--del_lnk--> RMS <i>Queen Elizabeth 2</i>. Asimov was an enormously entertaining, prolific, and sought-after public speaker. His sense of timing was exquisite; he never looked at a clock, but invariably spoke for precisely the time allocated.<p>Asimov was a frequent fixture at <!--del_lnk--> science fiction conventions, where he remained friendly and approachable. As noted above, he patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards, and was pleased to give autographs. Although he was glad to show his talent, he also rarely seemed to take himself too seriously.<p>He was of medium height, stocky, with muttonchop whiskers and a distinct Brooklyn-Yiddish accent. His physical dexterity was very poor. He never learned how to swim or ride a <a href="../../wp/b/Bicycle.htm" title="Bicycle">bicycle</a>; however, he did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston. In his humor book <i>Asimov Laughs Again,</i> he describes Boston driving as &quot;anarchy on wheels.&quot;<p>Asimov&#39;s wide interests included his participation in his later years in organizations devoted to the <!--del_lnk--> operettas of <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert and Sullivan and in The Wolfe Pack, a group of devotees of the <!--del_lnk--> Nero Wolfe mysteries authored by <!--del_lnk--> Rex Stout. He was a prominent member of the <!--del_lnk--> Baker Street Irregulars, the leading <!--del_lnk--> Sherlock Holmes society. From 1985 until his death in 1992, he was president of the <!--del_lnk--> American Humanist Association; his successor was his friend and fellow writer <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Vonnegut. He was also a close friend of <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> creator <!--del_lnk--> Gene Roddenberry, and earned a screen credit on <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i> for advice he gave during production (generally, confirming to <!--del_lnk--> Paramount Pictures that Roddenberry&#39;s ideas were legitimate science-fictional extrapolation).<p>Asimov died on <!--del_lnk--> April 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1992. He was survived by his second wife, Janet, and his children from his first marriage. Ten years after his death, Janet Asimov&#39;s edition of Asimov&#39;s autobiography, <i><!--del_lnk--> It&#39;s Been a Good Life</i>, revealed that his death was caused by <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>; he had contracted <a href="../../wp/h/HIV.htm" title="HIV">HIV</a> from a blood transfusion received during a heart bypass operation <!--del_lnk--> . The specific cause of death was heart and renal failure as complications of AIDS. Janet Asimov wrote in the epilogue of <i>It&#39;s Been a Good Life</i> that Asimov had wanted to &quot;go public,&quot; but his doctors convinced him to remain silent, warning that anti-AIDS <!--del_lnk--> prejudice would extend to his family members. Asimov&#39;s family considered disclosing his AIDS infection after he died, but the controversy which erupted when <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Ashe announced that <i>he</i> had contracted AIDS convinced them otherwise. Ten years later, after Asimov&#39;s doctors had died, Janet and Robyn agreed that the AIDS story could be made public.<p><a id="Intellectual_positions" name="Intellectual_positions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Intellectual positions</span></h2>
      <p>Isaac Asimov was a <!--del_lnk--> Humanist and a <!--del_lnk--> rationalist. He did not oppose genuine religious conviction in others, but vocally opposed <!--del_lnk--> superstitious or unfounded beliefs. During his childhood, his father and mother observed Orthodox Jewish traditions, but did not force this belief upon Asimov. Thus he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> represented Hebrew mythology in the same way that the <i><!--del_lnk--> Iliad</i> recorded <a href="../../wp/g/Greek_mythology.htm" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>. (For a brief while his father worked in the local <!--del_lnk--> synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and &quot;shine as a learned scholar&quot; versed in the sacred writings. This experience had little effect upon Isaac beyond teaching him the <!--del_lnk--> Hebrew alphabet.) For many years, Asimov called himself an <a href="../../wp/a/Atheism.htm" title="Atheism">atheist</a>, though he felt the term was somewhat inadequate, describing more what he did not believe than what he did. Later, he found the term &quot;humanist&quot; a useful substitute.<p>In his last autobiographical book, Asimov wrote, &quot;If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.&quot; The same memoir states his belief that <!--del_lnk--> Hell is &quot;the drooling dream of a <!--del_lnk--> sadist&quot; crudely affixed to an all-merciful God; if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments, wondered Asimov, why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term? Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife of just deserts existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who &quot;slandered God by inventing Hell&quot;. As his <i>Treasury of Humor</i> and <i>Asimov Laughs Again</i> record, he was amply willing to tell <!--del_lnk--> jokes involving the <!--del_lnk--> Judeo-Christian God, <!--del_lnk--> Satan, <!--del_lnk--> Garden of Eden, and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.<p>Asimov referred to himself as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Progressive&quot; on most political issues, and was a staunch supporter of the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic Party. He was a vocal opponent of the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> in the 1960s, and in a television interview in the early 1970s he publicly endorsed <!--del_lnk--> George McGovern. He was unhappy at what he saw as an irrationalist track taken by many liberal political activists from the late 1960s onwards. In his autobiography <i>In Joy Still Felt,</i> he recalls meeting the counterculture figure <!--del_lnk--> Abbie Hoffman; Asimov&#39;s impression was that the 1960s&#39; counterculture heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a &quot;no-man&#39;s land of the spirit&quot; from which he wondered if they would ever return. (This attitude is echoed by a famous passage in <!--del_lnk--> Hunter S. Thompson&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</i>) His defense of civil applications of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_power.htm" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> even after the <!--del_lnk--> Three Mile Island incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals. In a letter reprinted in <i>Yours, Isaac Asimov,</i> he states that though he would prefer living in &quot;no danger whatsoever&quot; than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum, on <!--del_lnk--> Love Canal or near &quot;a <!--del_lnk--> Union Carbide plant producing <!--del_lnk--> methyl isocyanate&quot; (referring to the <!--del_lnk--> Bhopal disaster). He issued many appeals for <!--del_lnk--> population control, reflecting a perspective articulated by people from <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> through <!--del_lnk--> Paul R. Ehrlich. Asimov considered himself a <!--del_lnk--> feminist even before <!--del_lnk--> Women&#39;s Liberation became a widespread movement; he joked that he wished women to be free &quot;because I hate it when they charge&quot;. More seriously, he argued that the issue of women&#39;s rights was closely connected to that of population control. Furthermore, he believed that <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality must be considered a &quot;moral right&quot; on population grounds, as must all <!--del_lnk--> consenting adult sexual activity which does not lead to reproduction (<i>Yours, Isaac Asimov</i>).<p>In the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> on the shrinking <!--del_lnk--> tax base caused by <!--del_lnk--> middle class flight to the <!--del_lnk--> suburbs. His last non-fiction book, <i>Our Angry Earth</i> (1991, co-written with his long-time friend science fiction author <!--del_lnk--> Frederik Pohl), deals with elements of the <!--del_lnk--> environmental crisis such as <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> and the destruction of the <!--del_lnk--> ozone layer.<p><a id="Writing" name="Writing"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Writing</span></h2>

      <p>Asimov&#39;s career can be divided into several time periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in <!--del_lnk--> 1939 and novels in <!--del_lnk--> 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Naked Sun</i>. He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called <i>Biochemistry and Human Metabolism</i>. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite <!--del_lnk--> Sputnik I by the <!--del_lnk--> USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly <!--del_lnk--> popular science books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation&#39;s Edge</i>. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series.<p>Asimov believed that his most enduring contributions would be his &quot;<a href="../../wp/t/Three_Laws_of_Robotics.htm" title="Three Laws of Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> Foundation Series (see <i>Yours, Isaac Asimov,</i> p. 329). Furthermore, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary</i> credits his science fiction for introducing the words <i><!--del_lnk--> positronic</i> (an entirely fictional technology), <i><!--del_lnk--> psychohistory</i> (frequently used in a different sense than the imaginary one Asimov employed) and <i><!--del_lnk--> robotics</i> into the English language. Asimov coined the term <i>robotics</i> without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of <!--del_lnk--> mechanics, <!--del_lnk--> hydraulics, and so forth. (The original word <i><!--del_lnk--> robot</i> derives from the <!--del_lnk--> Czech word for &quot;forced labor&quot;, <i>robotovat, robota</i> and was first employed by the playwright <!--del_lnk--> Karel &#x10C;apek in <!--del_lnk--> R.U.R.(Rossum&#39;s Universal Robots).) Unlike his word <i>psychohistory</i>, the word <i>robotics</i> continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov&#39;s original definition. <i><!--del_lnk--> Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> featured <!--del_lnk--> androids with &quot;<!--del_lnk--> positronic brains&quot;, namely <!--del_lnk--> Data and <!--del_lnk--> Lore, giving Asimov full credit for inventing this (fictional) technology.<p><a id="Science_fiction" name="Science_fiction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Science fiction</span></h3>
      <p>Asimov began contributing stories to science fiction magazines in 1939, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Marooned Off Vesta&quot; being his first published story, written when he was 18. Two and a half years later, he published his 32nd short story, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Nightfall&quot; (1941), which has been described as one of &quot;the most famous science-fiction stories of all time&quot;. In 1968 the Science Fiction Writers of America voted &quot;Nightfall&quot; the best science fiction short story ever written. In his short story collection <i><!--del_lnk--> Nightfall and Other Stories</i> he wrote, &quot;The writing of &#39;Nightfall&#39; was a <!--del_lnk--> watershed in my professional career ... I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a &#39;classic&#39;&quot;.<p>&quot;Nightfall&quot; is an archetypical example of <!--del_lnk--> social science fiction, a term coined by Asimov to describe a new trend in the <!--del_lnk--> 1940s, led by authors including Asimov and <!--del_lnk--> Heinlein, away from <!--del_lnk--> gadgets and <!--del_lnk--> space opera and toward speculation about the <!--del_lnk--> human condition.<p>In 1942 he began his <i>Foundation</i> stories&mdash;later collected in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation Trilogy</i>: <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation</i> (1951), <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation and Empire</i> (1952), and <i><!--del_lnk--> Second Foundation</i> (1953)&mdash;which recount the collapse and rebirth of a vast <!--del_lnk--> interstellar empire in a universe of the future. Taken together, they are his most famous work of science fiction, along with the <!--del_lnk--> Robot Series. Many years later, he continued the series with <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation&#39;s Edge</i> (1982) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation and Earth</i> (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with <i><!--del_lnk--> Prelude to Foundation</i> (1988) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Forward the Foundation</i> (1992). The series features his fictional science of <!--del_lnk--> Psychohistory in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.<p>His <!--del_lnk--> robot stories&mdash;many of which were collected in <i><!--del_lnk--> I, Robot</i> (1950)&mdash;were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a> for robots (see <a href="../../wp/t/Three_Laws_of_Robotics.htm" title="Three Laws of Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. One such short story, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Bicentennial Man&quot;, was made into a <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> starring <!--del_lnk--> Robin Williams.<p>The recent film <i><!--del_lnk--> I, Robot</i>, starring <!--del_lnk--> Will Smith, was based on the <i><!--del_lnk--> Hardwired</i> script by Jeff Vintar with Asimov&#39;s ideas incorporated later after acquiring the rights to the <i>I, Robot</i> title. It is not related to the <i>I, Robot</i> script by <!--del_lnk--> Harlan Ellison, who collaborated with Asimov himself to create a version that captured the spirit of the original. Asimov is quoted as saying that Ellison&#39;s screenplay would lead to &quot;the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction movie ever made&quot;. The screenplay was published in book form in 1994, after hopes of seeing it in film form were becoming slim. See: <i><!--del_lnk--> I, Robot</i>, <!--del_lnk--> <p>Besides movies, his <!--del_lnk--> Foundation and <!--del_lnk--> Robot stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as <!--del_lnk--> Roger MacBride Allen, <!--del_lnk--> Greg Bear, <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Benford and <!--del_lnk--> David Brin. These appear to have been done with the blessing, and often at the request of, Asimov&#39;s widow <!--del_lnk--> Janet Asimov.<p>In 1948 he also wrote a <!--del_lnk--> spoof science article, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline&quot;. At the time, Asimov was preparing for his own doctoral <!--del_lnk--> dissertation. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his Ph.D. evaluation board, he asked his editor that it be released under a <!--del_lnk--> pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. During his oral examination shortly thereafter, Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he received. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said &quot;Mr. Asimov, tell us something about the thermodynamic properties of the compound thiotimoline&quot;. After a 20-minute wait, he was summoned back into the Examination Room and congratulated as &quot;Dr. Asimov.&quot;<p>He continued writing short stories for science fiction magazines in the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s, which he referred to as his golden decade. A number of these are included in his <i><!--del_lnk--> Best of</i> anthology, including &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Last Question&quot; (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and reverse <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a>. It was his personal favorite and considered by many to be a contender to &quot;Nightfall&quot;. Asimov wrote of it in 1973:<table align="center" style="border-collapse:collapse;border-style:none;background-color:transparent;max-width:40em;width:80%;">

      <p>In December 1974, the former <!--del_lnk--> Beatle <a href="../../wp/p/Paul_McCartney.htm" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their imposters would likely be played by McCartney&#39;s group <!--del_lnk--> Wings, then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of <!--del_lnk--> rock music, Asimov quickly produced a &quot;treatment&quot; or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney&#39;s overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney&#39;s brief scrap of dialogue, and probably in consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in Boston University&#39;s archives.<p>Beginning in 1977, he lent his name to <i><!--del_lnk--> Isaac Asimov&#39;s Science Fiction Magazine</i> (now <i><!--del_lnk--> Asimov&#39;s Science Fiction</i>) and penned an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived <i>Asimov&#39;s SF Adventure Magazine</i> and a companion <i>Asimov&#39;s Science Fiction Anthology</i> reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as stablemates <i><!--del_lnk--> Ellery Queen&#39;s Mystery Magazine</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Mystery Magazine&#39;</i>s &quot;anthologies&quot;).<p><a id="Popular_science" name="Popular_science"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Popular science</span></h3>
      <p>During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov shifted gears somewhat, and substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Naked Sun</i> and 1982&#39;s <i>Foundation&#39;s Edge</i>, two of which were mysteries). At the same time, he greatly increased his non-fiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of <!--del_lnk--> Sputnik in 1957 engendered public concern over a &quot;science gap&quot;, which Asimov&#39;s publishers were eager to fill with as much material as he could write.<p>Meanwhile, the monthly <i><!--del_lnk--> Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</i> invited him to continue his regular non-fiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> Venture Science Fiction</i>, ostensibly dedicated to <!--del_lnk--> popular science, but with Asimov having complete editorial freedom. The first of the <i>F&amp;SF</i> columns appeared in November of 1958, and they followed uninterrupted thereafter, with 399 entries, until Asimov&#39;s terminal illness took its toll. These columns, periodically collected into books by his principal publisher, <!--del_lnk--> Doubleday, helped make Asimov&#39;s reputation as a &quot;Great Explainer&quot; of science, and were referred to by him as his only pop-science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects at hand on the part of his readers. The popularity of his first wide-ranging reference work, <i>The Intelligent Man&#39;s Guide to Science</i>, also allowed him to give up most of his academic responsibilities and become essentially a full-time <!--del_lnk--> freelance writer.<p>Asimov wrote several essays on the social contentions of his time, including &quot;Thinking About Thinking&quot; and &quot;Science: Knock Plastic&quot; (1967).<p>The great variety of information covered in Asimov&#39;s writings once prompted <!--del_lnk--> Kurt Vonnegut to ask, &quot;How does it feel to know everything?&quot; Asimov replied that he only knew how it felt to have the <i>reputation</i> of omniscience&mdash;&quot;Uneasy&quot;. (See <i>In Joy Still Felt,</i> chapter 30.) In the introduction to his story collection <i><!--del_lnk--> Slow Learner,</i> <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Pynchon.htm" title="Thomas Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> admitted that he relied upon Asimov&#39;s science popularizations (and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary</i>) to provide his knowledge of <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a>.<p>It is a mark of the friendship and respect accorded Asimov by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur C. Clarke that the so-called &quot;Asimov-Clarke Treaty of Park Avenue&quot;, put together as they shared a cab ride along <!--del_lnk--> Park Avenue in <!--del_lnk--> New York, stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second best for himself). Thus the dedication in Clarke&#39;s book <i>Report on Planet Three</i> (1972) reads: <i>&quot;In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.&quot;</i><p><a id="Other" name="Other"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other</span></h3>
      <p>In addition to his interest in science, Asimov was also greatly interested in history. Starting in the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, most notably <i>The Greeks: A Great Adventure</i> (1965), <i>The <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic</i> (1966), <i>The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a></i> (1967), &quot;The Egyptians&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Near East: 10,000 Years of History&quot; (1968).<p>He published <i><!--del_lnk--> Asimov&#39;s Guide to the Bible</i> in two volumes&mdash; covering the <!--del_lnk--> Old Testament in 1967 and the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament in 1969&mdash; and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Replete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.<p>Never entirely lacking wit and humor, towards the end of his life Asimov published a series of collections of <!--del_lnk--> limericks, mostly written by himself, starting with <i><!--del_lnk--> Lecherous Limericks</i>, which appeared in 1975. <i>Limericks: Too Gross,</i> whose title displays Asimov&#39;s love of <!--del_lnk--> puns, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by <!--del_lnk--> John Ciardi. He even created a slim volume of <!--del_lnk--> Sherlockian limericks (and embarrassed one fan by autographing her copy with an impromptu limerick that rhymed &#39;Nancy&#39; with &#39;romancy&#39;). Asimov&#39;s best attempt at <!--del_lnk--> Yiddish humor is found in <i><!--del_lnk--> Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon</i> in which the two characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, the anecdotes of &quot;George&quot; and his friend Azazel. Asimov&#39;s <i>Treasury of Humor</i> is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on humor theory. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<p>Particularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sensuous Woman</i> (by &quot;J&quot;) and <i>The Sensuous Man</i> (by &quot;M&quot;), Asimov published <i>The Sensuous Dirty Old Man</i> under the byline &quot;Dr. &#39;A&#39;&quot;, but with his full name prominently displayed on the cover.<p>Asimov published two volumes of autobiography: <i><!--del_lnk--> In Memory Yet Green</i> (1979) and <i><!--del_lnk--> In Joy Still Felt</i> (1980). A third autobiography, <i>I. Asimov: A Memoir</i>, was published in April 1994. The epilogue was written by his widow <!--del_lnk--> Janet Asimov a decade after his death. <i><!--del_lnk--> It&#39;s Been a Good Life</i> (2002), edited by Janet, is a condensed version of his three autobiographies.<p>Asimov and <a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> creator <!--del_lnk--> Gene Roddenberry developed a rather unique relationship during Star Trek&#39;s initial launch in the late 60&#39;s. Asimov wrote a critical essay on Star Trek&#39;s scientific accuracy for TV guide magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to TV Guide claiming despite it&#39;s inaccuracies, that Star Trek was a fresh and intellectually challenging science fiction television show. The two remained friends since to where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of Star Trek projects.<p><a id="Literary_themes" name="Literary_themes"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Literary themes</span></h3>

      <p>Much of Asimov&#39;s fiction dealt with themes of <!--del_lnk--> paternalism. His first robot story, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Robbie&quot;, concerned a robotic <!--del_lnk--> nanny. <i>Lenny</i> deals with the capacity of <!--del_lnk--> robopsychologist Susan Calvin to feel <!--del_lnk--> maternal love towards a robot whose positronic brain capacities are those of a 3-year-old. As the robots grew more sophisticated, their interventions became more wide-reaching and subtle. In &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Evidence&quot;, a robot masquerading as a human successfully runs for elective office. In &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Evitable Conflict&quot;, the robots run humanity from behind the scenes, acting as nannies to the whole species.<p>Later, in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Robots of Dawn</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Robots and Empire</i>, a robot develops what he calls the <!--del_lnk--> Zeroth Law of Robotics, which states that: &quot;A robot may not injure humanity, nor, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm&quot;. He also decides that robotic presence is stifling humanity&#39;s freedom, and that the best course of action is for the robots to phase themselves out. A non-robot, <!--del_lnk--> time travel novel, <i><!--del_lnk--> The End of Eternity</i>, features a similar conflict and resolution. The significance of the Zeroth Law is that it outweighs and supersedes all other Laws of Robotics: if a robot finds himself in a situation whereby he must <!--del_lnk--> murder one or more humans (a direct violation of the <!--del_lnk--> First Law of Robotics) in order to protect all of humanity (and preserve the Zeroth Law), then the robot&#39;s positronic programming will require him to commit murder for humanity&#39;s sake.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> The Foundation Series (which did not originally have robots), a scientist implements a semi-secret plan to create a new <!--del_lnk--> galactic empire over the course of 1,000 years. This series has its version of <!--del_lnk--> Platonic guardians, called the Second Foundation, to perfect and protect the plan. When Asimov stopped writing the series in the 1950s, the Second Foundation was depicted as benign protectors of humanity. When he revisited the series in the 1980s, he made the paternalistic themes even more explicit.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation&#39;s Edge</i> introduced the planet <!--del_lnk--> Gaia, obviously based on the <!--del_lnk--> Gaia hypothesis. Every animal, plant, and mineral on Gaia participated in a shared consciousness, forming a single super-mind working together for the greater good. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Foundation and Earth</i>, the protagonist must decide whether or not to allow the development of <!--del_lnk--> Galaxia, a larger version of Gaia, encompassing the entire galaxy. <!--del_lnk--> Gaia is one of Asimov&#39;s best attempts at exploring the possibility of a collective awareness, and is compounded further in <i><!--del_lnk--> Nemesis</i>, in which the planet <i>Erythro</i> composed primarily of <!--del_lnk--> prokaryotic life has a mind of its own and seeks communion with human beings.<p><i>Foundation and Earth</i> introduces robots to the Foundation universe. Two of Asimov&#39;s last novels, <i><!--del_lnk--> Prelude to Foundation</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Forward the Foundation</i>, explore their behaviour in fuller detail. The robots are depicted as <!--del_lnk--> covert operatives, acting for the benefit of humanity.<p>Another frequent theme, perhaps the reverse of paternalism, is social oppression. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Currents of Space</i> takes place on a planet where a unique plant fibre is grown; the agricultural workers there are exploited by the aristocrats of a nearby planet. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Stars, Like Dust</i>, the hero helps a planet that is oppressed by an arrogant interplanetary empire, the Tyranni.<p>Often the victims of oppression are either Earth people (as opposed to colonists on other planets) or robots. In &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot;, a robot fights prejudice to be accepted as a human. In <i><!--del_lnk--> The Caves of Steel</i>, the people of Earth resent the wealthier &quot;Spacers&quot; and in turn treat robots (associated with the Spacers) in ways reminiscent of how whites treated blacks, such as addressing robots as &quot;boy&quot;. <i><!--del_lnk--> Pebble in the Sky</i> shows an analogous situation: the Galactic Empire rules Earth and its people use such terms as &quot;Earthie-<!--del_lnk--> squaw&quot;, but Earth is a theocratic dictatorship that enforces <!--del_lnk--> euthanasia of anyone older than 60. One hero is Bel Arvardan, an upper-class Galactic archeologist who must overcome his prejudices. The other is Joseph Schwartz, a 62-year-old 20th-century American who had emigrated from <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, where his people were persecuted (he is quite possibly <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a>), and is accidentally transported forward in time to Arvardan&#39;s period. He must decide whether to help a downtrodden society that thinks he should be dead.<p>Yet another frequent theme in Asimov is <!--del_lnk--> rational thought. He invented the science-fiction <!--del_lnk--> mystery with the novel <i>The Caves of Steel</i> and the stories in <i><!--del_lnk--> Asimov&#39;s Mysteries</i>, usually playing fair with the reader by introducing early in the story any science or technology involved in the solution. Later, he produced non-SF mysteries, including the novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Murder at the ABA</i> (1976) and the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Black Widowers&quot; and &quot;Union Club&quot; short stories, in which he followed the same rule. In his fiction, important scenes are often essentially debates, with the more rational, humane&mdash;or persuasive&mdash;side winning.<p><a id="Awards" name="Awards"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Awards</span></h3>

      <p><a id="Criticisms" name="Criticisms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Criticisms</span></h2>
      <p>One of the most common impressions of Asimov&#39;s fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamental. In 1980, SF scholar <!--del_lnk--> James Gunn wrote of <i>I, Robot</i> that:<dl>
       <dd>Except for two stories&mdash;&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Liar!&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Evidence&quot;&mdash;they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local colour or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent.... The robot stories&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction&mdash;play themselves on a relatively bare stage.</dl>
      <p>This description applies to a large proportion of Asimov&#39;s fiction, including that written after 1980. However, it is worth noting that this applies to the majority of science fiction produced during the so-called &quot;Golden Age&quot; of science fiction. It has been argued that early science fiction authors were deliberately more focused on imagining future technologies rather than in-depth characterization. While this trend appears to have played itself out, it is still apparent even in modern-day science fiction that the interactions of the character with the technology and future social situations are frequently of greater importance than the characters themselves.<p>Gunn observes that there are places where Asimov&#39;s style rises to the demands of the situation; he cites the climax of &quot;Liar!&quot; as an example. Sharply-drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: in addition to <!--del_lnk--> Susan Calvin in &quot;Liar!&quot; and &quot;Evidence&quot;, we find <!--del_lnk--> Arkady Darell in <i><!--del_lnk--> Second Foundation,</i> <!--del_lnk--> Elijah Baley in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Caves of Steel</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Hari Seldon in the Foundation prequels. (In <i><!--del_lnk--> Forward the Foundation,</i> Seldon becomes a partial mirror of Asimov himself.)<p>These criticisms are to some extent the flip side of Asimov&#39;s aforementioned rationalism: his books, like his characters, tend to be <!--del_lnk--> cerebral and more interested in ideas and puzzles than in character and feeling. His idea of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> psychohistory,&quot; where the individual quirks of human beings could be averaged out at the statistical level of an entire galaxy&#39;s population, is perhaps revealing in that regard. What helps keep Asimov&#39;s fiction readable is the charm of the author, which is conveyed to his characters.<p>Asimov was also criticised for the lack of sex and aliens in his science fiction. Asimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when <i>Astounding&#39;</i>s editor <a href="../../wp/j/John_W._Campbell.htm" title="John W. Campbell">John Campbell</a> rejected one of his early science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. He decided that, rather than write weak alien characters, he would not write about aliens at all. Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms he wrote <i><!--del_lnk--> The Gods Themselves</i>, which contains aliens, sex, and alien sex. Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of <i>The Gods Themselves</i>.<p>Others have criticised him for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings he acknowledges this, and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early SF stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. One of the most notable of these female characters could be said to be <!--del_lnk--> Dors Venabili, even though it is acknowledged she was a humaniform robot. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> 25 August <!--del_lnk--> 1985 <i>Washington Post</i>&#39;s &quot;Book World&quot; section reports of <i>Robots and Empire</i> as follows:<dl>
       <dd>In 1940, Asimov&#39;s humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from <!--del_lnk--> 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old <!--del_lnk--> Studebaker, and still are; the Robot tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligences, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no <!--del_lnk--> genetic engineering, aliens, <!--del_lnk--> arcologies, <!--del_lnk--> multiverses, <!--del_lnk--> clones, sin or sex; his heroes (in this case <!--del_lnk--> R. Daneel Olivaw, whom we first met as the robot protagonist of <i>The Caves of Steel</i> and its sequels) feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.</dl>
      <p>This is perhaps slightly overstating the issue given that, for example, <i>The Naked Sun</i> (1957) deals with <!--del_lnk--> social issues as a core part of its central setting and motivation, depicts genetic engineering in the guise of <!--del_lnk--> eugenics as a fundamental part of that society, presents the reader with inverted arcologies where a single person is the focal point of the artificial environment as well as a hero who hails from a &quot;normal&quot; <!--del_lnk--> archology on earth. Meanwhile, totally artificial birth, although not specifically cloning, is the aim of the leaders of the society, sexual want is the major driving force of the main female character albeit veiled in 1950s sensibilities, and the entire story is used to make the point that too much order is ultimately a stagnant dead end to be avoided.<p>Be that as it may, a considerable portion of such criticism boils down to the charge that Asimov&#39;s works are simply dated. In fact, some details of Asimov&#39;s imaginary future technology as he described more than 50 years ago have not aged well. He, for example, described powerful robots and computers from the distant future as still using <!--del_lnk--> punch cards or <!--del_lnk--> punched tape and engineers using <!--del_lnk--> slide rules. In one dramatic scene in <!--del_lnk--> Foundation and Empire a character gets the news by buying a paper at a <!--del_lnk--> vending machine. His knowledge of a newborn&#39;s psychology (in <!--del_lnk--> Second Foundation) is also incorrect .<p>In addition, his stories also have occasional internal contradictions: names and dates given in <!--del_lnk--> The Foundation Series do not always agree with one another, for example. Some such errors may plausibly be due to mistakes the characters make, since characters in Asimov stories are seldom fully informed about their own situations. Other contradictions resulted from the many years elapsed between the time Asimov began the Foundation series and when he resumed work on it; occasionally, advances in scientific knowledge forced him to revise his own fictional history.<p>Other than books by Gunn and Patrouch, there is a relative dearth of &quot;literary&quot; criticism on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer&#39;s <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i> (1981) gives a possible reason:<dl>
       <dd>His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional <!--del_lnk--> literary criticism because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.</dl>
      <p>In fairness, Gunn and Patrouch&#39;s respective studies of Asimov both take the stand that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn&#39;s 1982 book goes into considerable depth commenting upon each of Asimov&#39;s novels published to that date. He does not praise all of Asimov&#39;s fiction (nor does Patrouch), but he does call some passages in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Caves of Steel</i> &quot;reminiscent of <a href="../../wp/m/Marcel_Proust.htm" title="Marcel Proust">Proust</a>&quot;. When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Gunn says that Asimov&#39;s prose &quot;need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society&quot;.<p>Although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited <!--del_lnk--> Clifford Simak as an early influence), Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated <!--del_lnk--> narrative structures, often by arranging chapters in non-<!--del_lnk--> chronological ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the <!--del_lnk--> nonlinearity is not worth the trouble and adversely impacts the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of <i>The Gods Themselves</i> begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material. (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Reason,&quot; one of the early Robot stories. See <i>In Memory Yet Green</i> for details of that time period.) Asimov&#39;s tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Nemesis,</i> in which one group of characters live in the &quot;present&quot; and another group starts in the &quot;past&quot;, beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.<p>In 2002, <!--del_lnk--> Donald Palumbo, an English professor at <!--del_lnk--> East Carolina University, published <i>Chaos Theory, Asimov&rsquo;s Foundations and Robots, and Herbert&rsquo;s Dune: The <a href="../../wp/f/Fractal.htm" title="Fractal">Fractal</a> Aesthetic of Epic Science Fiction</i>. This includes a review of Asimov&#39;s narrative structures that compares them with the scientific concepts of <!--del_lnk--> fractals and <!--del_lnk--> chaos. Palumbo finds that a fascination with the <!--del_lnk--> Foundation and <!--del_lnk--> Robot <!--del_lnk--> metaseries remains, and he determines that the purposeful complexities of the narrative build unusual symmetric and <!--del_lnk--> recursive structures to be perceived by the mind&#39;s eye. This volume contains some of the most scholarly and in-depth criticism of Asimov to date.<p>John Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov&#39;s written output, once observed,<dl>
       <dd>It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.</dl>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Award-winning novella, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gold&quot;, Asimov describes an author clearly based on himself who has one of his books (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Gods Themselves</i>) adapted into a &quot;compu-drama&quot;, essentially <!--del_lnk--> photo-realistic <!--del_lnk--> computer animation. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (&quot;Gregory Laborian&quot;) for having an extremely non-visual style making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across. Ironically, the story mimics the same style the author in it uses to describe his work, and one can see it as Asimov&#39;s reply to his critics.<p><a id="Quotations" name="Quotations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Quotations</span></h2>
