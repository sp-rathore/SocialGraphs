However, he is best known as an extensive traveler or <!--del_lnk--> explorer, whose account documents his travels and side-excursions over a period of almost thirty years, covering some 73,000 miles (117,000 km). These journeys covered almost the entirety of the known Islamic world, extending also to present-day <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, the <a href="../../wp/m/Maldives.htm" title="Maldives">Maldives</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, a distance readily surpassing that of his predecessor, near-contemporary and traveler <a href="../../wp/m/Marco_Polo.htm" title="Marco Polo">Marco Polo</a>.<p>At the instigation of the Sultan of Morocco, <!--del_lnk--> Abu Inan Faris, several years after his return, Ibn Battuta dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar named <!--del_lnk--> Ibn Juzayy, whom he had met while in <!--del_lnk--> Granada. This account, recorded by Ibn Juzayy and interspersed with the latter&#39;s own comments, is the primary source of information for his adventures. The title of this initial manuscript may be translated as <i>A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling</i>, but is often simply referred to as the <i>Rihla</i>, or &quot;Journey&quot;. Whilst apparently fictional in places, the <i>Rihla</i> still gives as complete an account as exists of some parts of the world in the <a href="../../wp/1/14th_century.htm" title="14th century">14th century</a>.<p>Almost all that is known about Ibn Battuta&#39;s life comes from one source &ndash; Ibn Battuta himself (via Ibn Juzayy). In places the things he claims he saw or did are probably fanciful, but in many others there is no way to know whether he is reporting or story-telling. The following account assumes the latter where it is not obviously the former.<p>

</script><a id="The_Hajj" name="The_Hajj"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Hajj</span></h2>
      <p>Ibn Batuta was born in <!--del_lnk--> Tangier, <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> some time between <!--del_lnk--> 1304 and <!--del_lnk--> 1307, during the time of <!--del_lnk--> Merinid Sultanate rule in the <!--del_lnk--> Hijri calender year 703, into a <!--del_lnk--> Berber family. At the age of (approximately) twenty Ibn Battuta went on a <i><!--del_lnk--> hajj</i> &mdash; a pilgrimage to <a href="../../wp/m/Mecca.htm" title="Mecca">Mecca</a>. Once done, however, he continued traveling, eventually covering about 75,000 miles over the length and breadth of the Muslim world, and beyond (about 44 modern countries). Batutta started his journeys in <!--del_lnk--> 1325.<p>Returning to Cairo he took a second side trip, to <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> (then also controlled by the Mameluks), having encountered a holy man during his first trip who prophesied that Ibn Battuta would only reach Mecca after a journey through <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>. An additional advantage to the side journey was that other holy places were along the route &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Hebron, <a href="../../wp/j/Jerusalem.htm" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Bethlehem, for example &ndash; and the Mameluke authorities put special effort into keeping the journey safe for pilgrims.<p>After spending <!--del_lnk--> Ramadan in Damascus, Ibn Battuta joined up with a caravan travelling the 800 miles from Damascus to <!--del_lnk--> Medina, burial place of <a href="../../wp/m/Muhammad.htm" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>. After four days, he then journeyed on to Mecca. There he completed the usual rituals of a Muslim pilgrim, and having graduated to the status of <i><!--del_lnk--> al-Hajji</i> as a result, now faced his return home. Upon reflection, he decided to continue journeying instead. His next destination was the <!--del_lnk--> Il-Khanate in modern-day <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>.<p><a id="To_Iran_and_the_Silk_Roads" name="To_Iran_and_the_Silk_Roads"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">To Iran and the Silk Roads</span></h2>
      <p>Once again joining up with a caravan he crossed the border into <a href="../../wp/m/Mesopotamia.htm" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and visited <!--del_lnk--> al-Najaf, the burial place of the fourth Caliph <!--del_lnk--> Ali. From there he journeyed to <!--del_lnk--> Basra, then <!--del_lnk--> Isfahan, which was only a few decades away from being nearly destroyed by <!--del_lnk--> Central Asian <!--del_lnk--> warlord <a href="../../wp/t/Timur.htm" title="Timur">Timur</a>. Next were <!--del_lnk--> Shiraz and <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, the latter of which was in bad shape after <!--del_lnk--> being sacked by <!--del_lnk--> Hulagu Khan.<p>There he met <!--del_lnk--> Abu Sa&#39;id, the last ruler of the unified Il-Khanate. Ibn Battuta travelled with the royal caravan for a while, then turned north to <!--del_lnk--> Tabriz on the <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road. The first major city in the region to open its gates to the <!--del_lnk--> Mongols, it had become an important trading centre after most of its nearby rivals were razed.<p><a id="Second_Hajj_and_East_Africa" name="Second_Hajj_and_East_Africa"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Second Hajj and East Africa</span></h2>
      <p>After this trip, Ibn Battuta returned to Mecca for a second <i><!--del_lnk--> hajj</i>, and lived there for a year before embarking on a second great trek, this time down the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Eastern African coast. His first major stop was <!--del_lnk--> Aden, where his intention was to make his fortune as a trader of the goods that flowed into the Arabian Peninsula from around the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Before doing so, however, he determined to have one last adventure, and signed on for a trip down the coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>.<p>Spending about a week in each of his destinations, he visited <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mogadishu, <!--del_lnk--> Mombassa, <!--del_lnk--> Zanzibar, and <!--del_lnk--> Kilwa, among others. With the change of the monsoon, he and the ship he was aboard then returned to south Arabia. Having completed his final adventure before settling down, he then immediately decided to go visit <a href="../../wp/o/Oman.htm" title="Oman">Oman</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Straits of Hormuz. This done, he journeyed to Mecca again.<p><a id="Byzantine_Empire.2C_Anatolia.2C_Central_Asia_and_India" name="Byzantine_Empire.2C_Anatolia.2C_Central_Asia_and_India"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Byzantine Empire, Anatolia, Central Asia and India</span></h2>
      <p>Spending another year there, he then resolved to seek employment with the Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Sultan of <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. Needing a guide and translator if he was to travel there, he went to <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia, then under the control of the <!--del_lnk--> Seljuk Turks, to join up with one of the caravans that went from there to <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. A sea voyage from Damascus on a Genoese ship landed him in <!--del_lnk--> Alanya on the southern coast of modern-day <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>. From there he travelled by land to <!--del_lnk--> Konya and then <!--del_lnk--> Sinope on the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Sea.htm" title="Black Sea">Black Sea</a> coast.<p>Crossing the Black Sea, Ibn Battuta landed in Caffa (now <!--del_lnk--> Theodosia), in the Crimea, and entered the lands of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horde. There he bought a wagon and fortuitously joined the caravan of <!--del_lnk--> Ozbeg, the Golden Horde&#39;s Khan, on a journey as far as <!--del_lnk--> Astrakhan on the <a href="../../wp/v/Volga_River.htm" title="Volga River">Volga River</a>.<p>Upon reaching Astrakhan, the Khan allowed one of his pregnant wives to go give birth back in her home city &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Constantinople. It is perhaps of no surprise to the reader that Ibn Battuta talked his way into this expedition, his first beyond the boundaries of the Islamic world.<p>Arriving there towards the end of <!--del_lnk--> 1332, he met the emperor <!--del_lnk--> Andronicus III Palaeologus and saw the outside of <!--del_lnk--> Hagia Sophia. After a month in the city, he retraced his route to Astrakhan, then carried on past the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aral_Sea.htm" title="Aral Sea">Aral Seas</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Bokhara and <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand. From there he journeyed south to <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, the mountain passes of which he used to cross into India.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sultanate of Delhi was a relatively new addition to <i><!--del_lnk--> Dar al-Islam</i>, and Sultan <!--del_lnk--> Muhammed Tughlaq had resolved to import as many Muslim scholars and other functionaries as possible to consolidate his rule. On the strength of his years of studies while in Mecca, Ibn Battuta was employed as a <i><!--del_lnk--> qadi</i> (&quot;judge&quot;) by the sultan.<p>Tughlaq was erratic even by the standards of the time, and Ibn Battuta veered between living the high life of a trusted subordinate, aiding in the converting of the people that lived along the trade routes that he travelled, and being under suspicion for a variety of reasons against the chinese government. Eventually he resolved to leave on the pretext of taking another <i>hajj</i>, but the Sultan offered the alternative of being ambassador to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>. Given the opportunity to both get away from the Sultan and visit new lands, Ibn Battuta took it.<p><a id="Southeast_Asia_and_China" name="Southeast_Asia_and_China"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Southeast Asia and China</span></h2>
      <p>En route to the coast, he and his party were attacked by <!--del_lnk--> Hindus, and separated from the others he was robbed and nearly lost his life. Nevertheless, he managed to catch up with his group within two days, and continued the journey to <!--del_lnk--> Cambay. From there they sailed to <!--del_lnk--> Calicut. While Ibn Battuta visited a mosque on shore, however, a storm blew up and two of the ships of his expedition were sunk. The third then sailed away without him, and ended up seized by a local king in a Kingdom of <i>Samudra</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Aceh province of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> a few months later, local myth says he was the one who always referred to the kingdom of <i>Samudra</i> but pronounced in a way that sounded more like the modern day <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, which then became the name of the whole island, previously the island was called <i>Andalas</i>.<p>Fearful of returning to Delhi as a failure, he stayed for a time in the south under the protection of <!--del_lnk--> Jamal al-Din, but when that worthy was overthrown it became necessary for Ibn Battuta to leave India altogether. He resolved to carry on to China, with a detour near the beginning of the journey to the <a href="../../wp/m/Maldives.htm" title="Maldives">Maldives</a>.<p>In the Maldives he spent nine months, much more time than he had intended to. As a <i>qadi</i> his skills were highly desirable in the backwards islands and he was half-bribed, half-kidnapped into staying. Appointed chief judge and marrying into the royal family, he became embroiled in local politics, and ended up leaving after wearing out his welcome by imposing strict judgments in the laissez-faire island kingdom. From there he carried on to <!--del_lnk--> Ceylon for a visit to <!--del_lnk--> Sri Pada (Adam&#39;s Peak).<p>Setting sail from Ceylon, his ship nearly sank in a storm, then the ship that rescued him was attacked by pirates. Stranded on shore, Ibn Battuta once again worked his way back to Calicut, from where he then sailed to the Maldives again before getting onboard a Chinese junk and trying once again to get to China.<p>This time he succeeded, reaching in quick succession <!--del_lnk--> Chittagong, Sumatra, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and then finally <!--del_lnk--> Quanzhou in <!--del_lnk--> Fujian Province, China. From there he went north to <!--del_lnk--> Hangzhou, not far from modern-day <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. He also travelled even further north, through the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canal_of_China.htm" title="Grand Canal of China">Grand Canal</a> to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, although there has been some doubt about whether this actually occurred.<p><a id="Return_home_and_the_Black_Death" name="Return_home_and_the_Black_Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Return home and the Black Death</span></h2>
      <p>Returning to Quanzhou, Ibn Battuta decided to return home &ndash; though exactly where &quot;home&quot; was a bit of a problem. Returning to Calicut once again, he pondered throwing himself on the mercy of Muhammed Tughlaq, but thought better of it and decided to carry on to Mecca once again. Returning via Hormuz and the Il-Khanate, he saw that state dissolved into civil war, Abu Sa&#39;id having died since his previous trip there.<p>Returning to Damascus with the intention of retracing the route of his first <i>Hajj</i>, he learned that his father had died. Death was the theme of the next year or so, for the <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> had begun, and Ibn Battuta was on hand as it spread through Syria, Palestine, and Arabia. After reaching Mecca, he decided to return to Morocco, nearly a quarter century after leaving it. During the trip he made one last detour to <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia, then returned to Tangier to discover that his mother had also died, a few months before.<p><a id="Andalus_and_North_Africa" name="Andalus_and_North_Africa"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Andalus and North Africa</span></h2>
      <p>Having settled in Tangier for all of a few days, Ibn Battuta then set out for a trip to <i>al-Andalus</i> &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Spain. <!--del_lnk--> Alfonso XI of Castile was threatening the conquest of <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, and Ibn Battuta joined up with a group of Muslims leaving Tangier with the intention of defending the port. By the time he arrived the Black Death had killed Alfonso and the threat had receded, so Ibn Battuta decided to visit for pleasure instead. He travelled through <!--del_lnk--> Valencia, and ended up in <!--del_lnk--> Granada.<p>Leaving Spain he decided to travel through one of the few parts of the Muslim world that he had never explored: Morocco. On his return home he stopped for a while in <!--del_lnk--> Marrakesh, which was nearly a ghost town after the recent plague and the transfer of the capital to <!--del_lnk--> Fez.<p>Once more he returned to Tangier, and once more he moved on. Two years before his own first visit to Cairo, the <!--del_lnk--> Malian king <!--del_lnk--> Mansa Musa had passed through the same city on his own <i>Hajj</i> and had caused a sensation with his extravagant riches -- <!--del_lnk--> West Africa contained vast quantities of gold, previously unknown to the rest of the world. While Ibn Battuta never mentions this specifically, hearing of this during his own trip must have planted a seed in his mind, for he decided to set out and visit the Muslim kingdom on the far side of the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert.<p><a id="Mali" name="Mali"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mali</span></h2>
      <p>In the fall of 1351, Ibn Battuta set out from Fez, reaching the last Moroccan town (<!--del_lnk--> Sijilmasa) a bit more than a week later. When the winter caravans began a few months later, he joined one, and within a month he was in the Central Saharan town of <!--del_lnk--> Taghaza. A centre of the salt trade, Taghaza was awash with salt and Malian gold, though Ibn Battuta did not have a favorable impression of the place. Another 500 miles through the worst part of the desert brought him to Mali, particularly the town of Walata.<p>From there he travelled southwest along a river he believed to be the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> (it was actually the <a href="../../wp/n/Niger_River.htm" title="Niger River">Niger River</a>) until he reached the capital of the Mali Empire. There he met Mansa <!--del_lnk--> Suleyman, king since <!--del_lnk--> 1341. Dubious about the miserly hospitality of the king, he nevertheless stayed for eight months before journeying back up the Niger to <a href="../../wp/t/Timbuktu.htm" title="Timbuktu">Timbuktu</a>. Though in the next two centuries it would become the most important city in the region, at the time it was small and unimpressive, and Ibn Battuta soon moved on. Partway through his journey back across the desert he received a message from the Sultan of Morocco commanding him to return home. This he did, and this time it lasted.<p>After the publication of the <i>Rihla</i>, little is known about Ibn Battuta&#39;s life. He may have been appointed a <i>qadi</i> in <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Ibn Battuta died in Morocco some time between <!--del_lnk--> 1368 and <!--del_lnk--> 1377 from the same diesease that claimed his mother&#39;s life, the Black Plague. For centuries his book was obscure, even within the Muslim world, but in the <!--del_lnk--> 1800s it was rediscovered and translated into several European languages. Since then Ibn Battuta has grown in fame, and is now a well-known figure in the Middle East, not only for being a extensive traveller and author but also for aiding in the conversion of the people along the trade routes that he took.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
