      <p>Human settlement in Estonia became possible 11,000&ndash;13,000 years ago, when the ice from the last <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">glacial era</a> melted away. The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the <!--del_lnk--> Pulli settlement, which was located on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> river P&auml;rnu, near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Sindi, in southern Estonia. According to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11,000 years ago, at the beginning of the 9th millennium BC.<p>Evidence has been found of hunting and fishing communities existing around 6500 BC near the town of Kunda in northern Estonia. Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and in southern Finland. The <!--del_lnk--> Kunda culture belongs to the middle stone age, or <!--del_lnk--> mesolithic period.<p>The end of the <a href="../../wp/b/Bronze_Age.htm" title="Bronze Age">Bronze Age</a> and the early <a href="../../wp/i/Iron_Age.htm" title="Iron Age">Iron Age</a> were marked by great cultural changes. The most significant was the transition to farming, which has remained at the core of Estonian economy and culture. From approximately the 1st to 5th centuries AD, resident farming was widely established, the population grew, and settlement expanded. Cultural influences from the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> reached Estonia, and this era is therefore also known as the <!--del_lnk--> Roman Iron Age.<p>A more troubled and war-ridden middle Iron Age followed with external dangers coming both from the Baltic tribes, who attacked across the southern land border, and from overseas. Several <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian <!--del_lnk--> sagas refer to campaigns against Estonia. <!--del_lnk--> Estonian pirates conducted similar raids in the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Viking</a> age and sacked and burned the Scandinavian capital of <!--del_lnk--> Sigtuna in <!--del_lnk--> 1187.<p>By the early 13th century, Estonia was divided into eight large counties &mdash; Saaremaa, L&auml;&auml;nemaa, R&auml;vala, Harju, Viru, J&auml;rva, Sakala, and Ugandi. Annual consultations were held by representatives of several counties and developments took the direction of establishing a state. Estonia until this time retained a <!--del_lnk--> pagan religion centered around a deity called <!--del_lnk--> Tharapita.<p>Estonia was <!--del_lnk--> christianised when the <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Livonian Brothers of the Sword&quot; invaded southern Estonia as part of the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Crusades in the early 13th century. At the same time, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> attempted to take possession of northern Estonia. Estonia was consolidated under the two forces by <!--del_lnk--> 1227. Northern Estonia remained a possession of Denmark until <!--del_lnk--> 1346. <!--del_lnk--> Tallinn (known as Reval at the time) was given its <!--del_lnk--> L&uuml;beck Rights in 1248 and joined the <!--del_lnk--> Hanseatic League at the end of the 13th century. In 1343, the people of northern Estonia and <!--del_lnk--> Saaremaa rebelled against the rule of the Germans in the <!--del_lnk--> St. George&#39;s Night Uprising, which was put down by 1344. There were unsuccessful Russian invasions in 1481 and 1558. After 1524, during the <!--del_lnk--> Protestant Reformation, Estonia converted to <!--del_lnk--> Lutheranism.<p>During the Livonian War in 1561, northern Estonia submitted to Swedish control, while southern Estonia briefly came under the control of <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a> in the 1580s. In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of <!--del_lnk--> Estonia in the north and <!--del_lnk--> Livonia in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>.<p>In 1631, the Swedish king <!--del_lnk--> Gustavus Adolphus forced the nobility to grant the peasantry greater rights, although serfdom was retained. In 1632 a printing press and <!--del_lnk--> university were established in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Tartu (known as Dorpat at the time). This period is known in Estonian history as the &quot;Good Old Swedish Times.&quot;<p>Following the <!--del_lnk--> Great Northern War, the Swedish empire lost Estonia to <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> (<!--del_lnk--> 1710 de facto, and <!--del_lnk--> 1721 de jure, by the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Nystad). However, the upper classes and the higher middle class remained primarily <!--del_lnk--> Baltic German. The war devastated the population of Estonia, but it recovered quickly. Although the rights of peasants were initially weakened, serfdom was abolished in 1816 in the province of Estonia and in 1818 in Livonia.<p>As a result of the abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the natives, an active Estonian nationalist movement started in the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>. It began on a cultural level, resulting in the establishment of Estonian language literature, theatre and professional music and the formation of the Estonian national identity. Among the leaders of this movement were <!--del_lnk--> Johann Voldemar Jannsen, <!--del_lnk--> Jakob Hurt and <!--del_lnk--> Carl Robert Jakobson. Significant accomplishments were the publication of the national epic, <!--del_lnk--> Kalevipoeg, in 1862, and the organization of the first national song festival in 1869.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In response to a period of <!--del_lnk--> Russification initiated by the Russian empire in the 1890s, Estonian nationalism took on more political tones, with intellectuals first calling for greater autonomy, and later, complete independence from the Russian empire. Following the <!--del_lnk--> October Revolution, Estonia declared itself an independent republic on <!--del_lnk--> February 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1918. After winning the <!--del_lnk--> Estonian Liberation War against Soviet Russia (the <!--del_lnk--> Treaty of Tartu was signed in <!--del_lnk--> February 2, <!--del_lnk--> 1920), Estonia maintained its independence for twenty-two years. Initially a parliamentary democracy, the parliament (<!--del_lnk--> Riigikogu) was disbanded in <!--del_lnk--> 1934, following political unrest caused by the <!--del_lnk--> global economic crisis. Subsequently the country was ruled by decree by <!--del_lnk--> Konstantin P&auml;ts, who became President in 1938, the year parliamentary elections resumed.<p>Estonia was occupied by Soviet troops in June <!--del_lnk--> 1940, as a consequence of the secret amendment to the August <!--del_lnk--> 1939 <!--del_lnk--> Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Estonia was formally annexed into the Soviet Union in August 1940 as the <!--del_lnk--> Estonian SSR. Many of the country&#39;s political and intellectual leaders were killed or deported to remote areas of Russia and other parts of the USSR by the Soviet authorities during 1940 to 1941. The repressions also included thousands of ordinary people. When German operation Barbarossa started against the Soviet Union thousands of young men were also forcibly drafted into the Red Army. Hundreds of political prisoners whom the retreating Soviets had no time to move, were massacred. The country was occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Third Reich from <!--del_lnk--> 1941 to <!--del_lnk--> 1944, when Soviet forces reconquered it after fierce battles in the northeast of the country on the Narva river and on the Tannenberg Line (Sinim&auml;ed). Such was the fear and disgust of the general population against the Soviet oppressors that in the face of imminent re-occupation by the Red Army, tens of thousands of people chose to either flee the country to Finland or Sweden or retreat together with the Germans. In 1949, in response to slow progress in forming collective farms (as prescribed by the Soviet ideology), tens of thousands of people were forcibly deported in a few days either to labor camps or Siberia where half of them perished and the other half was not allowed to return until early 1960s (several years after <!--del_lnk--> Stalin&#39;s death). That and previous repressions in 1940-1941 sparked a <!--del_lnk--> guerilla war against the Soviet authorities in Estonia which was waged into the early 1950s by the so called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> forest brothers&quot; (<i>metsavennad</i>) consisting mostly of Estonian veterans of both the German and Finnish armies as well as some civilians.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Soviet era in Estonia which lasted from 1944 to 1991 was in general detrimental to the country as a whole. In addition to the usual Soviet-style forced collectivization of the agriculture, Estonia was also forced to go through with industrialization which was inefficient, and sometimes very destructive environmentally.<p>Militarization was another aspect of the Soviet regime. Estonia was located very close to capitalist countries (Sweden, Finland) and therefore was heavily militarized. Large part of the country (5-10%) and especially the coastal areas were restricted to anyone but the Soviet military. Most of the northern, northwestern and western sea shore and all of the islands (including Saaremaa and Hiiumaa) were declared as &quot;border zones&quot; and Estonian population not directly living there was restricted from travelling there without permit and could be punished if they did so. Travelling in Estonia today it is not very difficult to find an abandoned former Soviet military installation in coastal regions. Even several former large airfields (notably the former strategic bomber/fighter bases in <!--del_lnk--> Tartu and <!--del_lnk--> Haapsalu) are abandoned today. Probably most notable of all closed military installations was the city of <!--del_lnk--> Paldiski which was in its entirety closed to all public access. The reason for it was simple - the city had a support base for the Soviet Navy&#39;s submarines, and several large military bases including a nuclear submarine training centre complete with a full-scale model of a nuclear submarine with working nuclear reactors. The reactor is decommissioned today and its fuel was removed by a special task force as the Soviet troops left, but the conserved radioactive reactors are there under state supervision to this day. The reactor building was passed into Estonian control a year later than the Soviet troops left Estonia in 1994.<p><!--del_lnk--> Russification was another effect brought by the Soviet occupation. Hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking migrants (mostly from Russian Federation or Ukraine) were relocated to Estonia by the Soviet administration and Communist Party to conduct the aforementioned industrialization and militarization. The immigrants stayed on to form part of the population. By 1980, when part of the <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> <a href="../../wp/o/Olympic_Games.htm" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> were also held in Tallinn (The Olympic Regatta part), the <!--del_lnk--> Russification (and the state-orchestrated immigration) had achieved already such a level, that it started sparking popular protests. The official language which had been both Estonian and Russian started to be increasingly Russian.<p>The tides turned as the Soviet Union ran into major economic difficulties as a consequence of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> and begun to break up. The economic difficulties of the end of the 1980s were often very anecdotal and embarrassing to the Soviet system - even common household goods like light bulbs, toilet paper and soap were often difficult to purchase and required &#39;connections&#39;. Also food was beginning to be rationed. As the Soviet currency (the <!--del_lnk--> rouble) lost its value, these and other &#39;deficit&#39; goods were often barter-traded or sold in foreign currency on the black market.<p>As the situation developed, in Estonia a movement for more self-governance started. In the beginning, at the period of 1987-1989 it was partially for more economic independence but as the Soviet Union weakened and it became increasingly obvious that nothing short of full independence would do, and the country began a course towards self-determination.<p>In 1989 a major landmark demonstration was held for more independence, called <!--del_lnk--> The Baltic Way. During the demonstration a human chain consisting of more than two million people was formed through all of the three Baltic states - Estonia, <a href="../../wp/l/Latvia.htm" title="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Lithuania.htm" title="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> (the latter two former Baltic and then Soviet states had and continue to have similar fates and aspirations as Estonia).<p>Estonia regained its independence on <!--del_lnk--> August 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1991, with the <!--del_lnk--> Singing Revolution during the Soviet military coup attempt in Russia and the following <!--del_lnk--> collapse of the Soviet Union. The first country to diplomatically recognize Estonia&#39;s reclaimed independence was <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> closely followed by <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.<p>The last Russian troops left on <!--del_lnk--> August 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1994, and Estonia joined <a href="../../wp/n/NATO.htm" title="NATO">NATO</a> on <!--del_lnk--> March 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 and the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

There are about 160 to 180 rainy days a year, and average precipitation is biggest on the western slopes of the Sakala and Haanja Uplands.

      <p>As a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, Estonia is part of the world&#39;s largest economic zone. In <!--del_lnk--> 1999, Estonia experienced its worst year economically since it regained independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1991, largely because of the impact of the August <!--del_lnk--> 1998 Russian financial crisis. Estonia joined the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="World Trade Organization">WTO</a> in November 1999. It was the second Baltic state to join. With assistance from the European Union, the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank and the <!--del_lnk--> Nordic Investment Bank, Estonia completed most of its preparations for <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> membership by the end of <!--del_lnk--> 2002 and now has one of the strongest economies of the new member states of the European Union, which it joined on <!--del_lnk--> 1 May <!--del_lnk--> 2004. The Estonian economy is growing quickly, partly due to a number of Scandinavian companies relocating their routine operations to the country and <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> oil transit using Estonian ports. Estonia has a strong <!--del_lnk--> information technology (IT) sector.

      <p>In 1994, Estonia became one of the first countries in the world to adopt a <!--del_lnk--> flat tax, with a uniform rate of 26% regardless of personal income. In January 2005 the personal income tax rate was reduced to 24%. A subsequent reduction to 23% followed in January 2006. The income tax rate will be decreased by 1% annually to reach 20% by January 2009.<p>Since January 1, 2000, companies have not had to pay income tax on re-invested income. However, tax is due on profit distributions (including hidden distributions) at a rate of 24%. Despite the fact that only the moment of taxation was shifted from earning profits to their distribution, leaving the rest of the corporate taxation system mostly unchanged, the current legislation is said to be in violation of one of the fundamental freedoms of the European Union &mdash; free movement of capital. Estonia is to remove this hindrance by January 2009 when the temporary derogation expires.<p>In June 1992, Estonia replaced the <!--del_lnk--> ruble with its own freely convertible currency, the <!--del_lnk--> Kroon (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark at the rate at 8 EEK for 1 DEM. When Germany introduced the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">Euro</a>, the peg was changed to 15.6466 Kroon for 1 Euro. The Estonian government is intending to adopt the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">Euro</a> as the country&#39;s currency on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2008 due to continued high inflation, and finalised the design of Estonia&#39;s Euro coins in late 2004.<p><a id="Exports" name="Exports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exports</span></h3>

      <p>Indigenous Estonian-speaking ethnic Estonians constitute nearly 70 percent of the total population of about 1.3 million people. First and second generation immigrants from various parts of the former Soviet Union (mainly <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>) comprise most of the remaining 30 per cent. The latter, mostly Russian-speaking ethnic minorities, reside predominantly in the capital city (<!--del_lnk--> Tallinn) and the industrial urban areas in northeastern Estonia (Ida-Virumaa county). There is also a small group of <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finnish</a> descent, mainly from Ingermanland (Ingria). Historically, large parts of Estonia&rsquo;s north-western coast and islands have been populated by an indigenous ethnically Swedish population called &quot;rannarootslased&quot; (&quot;coastal Swedes&quot;). The majority of Estonia&#39;s Swedish population fled to Sweden in 1944, escaping the advancing Soviet Army. Only about a thousand Swedes were left.<p>The country&#39;s official language is <!--del_lnk--> Estonian, a <!--del_lnk--> Finno-Ugric language which is closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Finnish.
