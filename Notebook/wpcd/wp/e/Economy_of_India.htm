      <p>The <b>economy of India</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> fourth largest in the world as measured by <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity (PPP), with a <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product (GDP) of US $3.611 <!--del_lnk--> trillion. When measured in <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">USD</a> <!--del_lnk--> exchange-rate terms, it is the <!--del_lnk--> twelfth largest in the world, with a GDP of US $719.8 billion (2005). India is the second fastest <!--del_lnk--> growing major economy in the world, with a GDP growth rate of 8.9%  at the end of the first quarter of 2006&ndash;2007. However, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>&#39;s huge <!--del_lnk--> population results in a <!--del_lnk--> per capita income of $3200 at PPP and $714 at nominal.<p>The economy is diverse and encompasses agriculture, handicrafts, textile, manufacturing, and a multitude of services. Although two-thirds of the Indian workforce still earn their livelihood directly or indirectly through agriculture, services are a growing sector and are playing an increasingly important role of India&#39;s economy. The advent of the digital age, and the large number of young and educated populace fluent in English, is gradually transforming India as an important &#39;back office&#39; destination for global companies for the <!--del_lnk--> outsourcing of their <!--del_lnk--> customer services and technical support. India is a major exporter of highly-skilled workers in software and financial services, and <!--del_lnk--> software engineering.<p>India followed a <!--del_lnk--> socialist-inspired approach for most of its independent history, with strict government control over <!--del_lnk--> private sector participation, <!--del_lnk--> foreign trade, and <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment. However, since the early 1990s, India has gradually opened up its markets through <!--del_lnk--> economic reforms by reducing government controls on foreign trade and investment. The <!--del_lnk--> privatisation of publicly owned industries and the opening up of certain sectors to private and foreign interests has proceeded slowly amid political debate.<p>India faces a burgeoning population and the challenge of reducing economic and social <a href="../../wp/e/Economic_inequality.htm" title="Economic inequality">inequality</a>. Poverty remains a serious problem, although it has declined significantly since independence, mainly due to the <!--del_lnk--> green revolution and economic reforms.<p>

      <p>India&#39;s economic history can be broadly divided into three eras, beginning with the pre-colonial period lasting up to the 17th century. The advent of British colonisation started the colonial period in the 17th century, which ended with the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">independence</a> in 1947. The third period stretches from independence in 1947 until the present.<p><a id="Pre-colonial" name="Pre-colonial"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-colonial</span></h3>
      <p>The citizens of the <!--del_lnk--> Indus Valley civilisation, a permanent and predominantly urban settlement that flourished between 2800 BC and 1800 BC, practised agriculture, domesticated animals, used uniform weights and measures, made tools and weapons, and traded with other cities. Evidence of well planned streets, a drainage system and water supply reveals their knowledge of <!--del_lnk--> urban planning, which included the world&#39;s first urban <!--del_lnk--> sanitation systems and the existence of a form of <!--del_lnk--> municipal government.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The 1872 census revealed that 91.3% of the population of the region constituting present-day India resided in villages, whose economies were largely isolated and self-sustaining, with agriculture the predominant occupation. This satisfied the food requirements of the village and provided raw materials for hand-based industries, such as <a href="../../wp/t/Textile.htm" title="Textile">textiles</a>, <!--del_lnk--> food processing and <!--del_lnk--> crafts. Although many kingdoms and rulers issued coins, <!--del_lnk--> barter was prevalent. Villages paid a portion of their agricultural produce as revenue to the rulers, while its craftsmen received a part of the crops at harvest time for their services.<p>Religion, especially <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> caste and the <!--del_lnk--> joint family systems, played an influential role in shaping economic activities. The caste system functioned much like medieval European <!--del_lnk--> guilds, ensuring the <!--del_lnk--> division of labour, providing for the training of apprentices and, in some cases, allowing manufacturers to achieve narrow specialisation. For instance, in certain regions, producing each variety of cloth was the speciality of a particular sub-caste.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Superstitions about foreign travel among Hindus meant that a large part of India&#39;s foreign trade was conducted by foreigners and <!--del_lnk--> Muslims. Textiles such as <!--del_lnk--> muslin, <!--del_lnk--> Calicos, <!--del_lnk--> shawls, and agricultural products such as <a href="../../wp/b/Black_pepper.htm" title="Black pepper">pepper</a>, <!--del_lnk--> cinnamon, <!--del_lnk--> opium and <!--del_lnk--> indigo were exported to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia in return for gold and silver.<p>Assessment of India&#39;s pre-colonial economy is mostly qualitative, owing to the lack of quantitative information. One estimate puts the revenue of <a href="../../wp/a/Akbar.htm" title="Akbar">Akbar</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Mughal Empire in 1600 at <!--del_lnk--> &pound;17.5 million, in contrast with the total revenue of Great Britain in 1800, which totalled &pound;16 million. India, by the time of the arrival of the British, was a largely traditional agrarian economy with a dominant subsistence sector dependent on primitive technology. It existed alongside a competitively developed network of commerce, manufacturing and credit. After the fall of the <!--del_lnk--> Mughals and the rise of <!--del_lnk--> Maratha Empire, the Indian economy was plunged into a state of political instability due to internecine wars and conflicts.<p><a id="Colonial" name="Colonial"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Colonial rule brought an institutional environment that guaranteed <!--del_lnk--> property rights, encouraged <!--del_lnk--> free trade, and created a single currency with <!--del_lnk--> fixed exchange rates, <!--del_lnk--> metric weights and measures, <!--del_lnk--> capital markets, a well developed system of <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport_in_India.htm" title="Rail transport in India">railways</a> and <!--del_lnk--> telegraphs, a civil service that aimed to be free from political interference, and a common-law, adversarial legal system. India&#39;s colonisation by the British coincided with major changes in the world economy&mdash;industrialisation, and significant growth in production and trade. However, at the end of colonial rule, India inherited an economy that was one of the poorest in the developing world, with industrial development stalled, agriculture unable to feed a rapidly growing population, one of the world&#39;s lowest <!--del_lnk--> life expectancies, and low rates of <!--del_lnk--> literacy.<p>An estimate by <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge University">Cambridge University</a> historian Angus Maddison reveals that India&#39;s share of the world income fell from 22.6% in 1700, comparable to Europe&#39;s share of 23.3%, to a low of 3.8% in 1952. While Indian leaders during the Independence struggle, and left-nationalist <!--del_lnk--> economic historians have blamed colonial rule for the dismal state of India&#39;s economy in its aftermath, a broader <!--del_lnk--> macroeconomic view of India during this period reveals that there were sectors of growth and decline, resulting from changes brought about by colonialism and a world that was moving towards industrialisation and <!--del_lnk--> economic integration.<p><a id="Post-independence" name="Post-independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-independence</span></h3>

      <p>Indian <!--del_lnk--> economic policy after <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_independence_movement.htm" title="Indian independence movement">independence</a> was influenced by the colonial experience (which was seen by Indian leaders as exploitative in nature) and by those leaders&#39; exposure to <!--del_lnk--> Fabian socialism. Policy tended towards <!--del_lnk--> protectionism, with a strong emphasis on <!--del_lnk--> import substitution, <!--del_lnk--> industrialisation, <!--del_lnk--> state intervention in labour and financial markets, a large public sector, business regulation, and <!--del_lnk--> central planning. <!--del_lnk--> Jawaharlal Nehru, the first <!--del_lnk--> prime minister, along with the statistician <!--del_lnk--> Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, formulated and oversaw economic policy. They expected favourable outcomes from this strategy, because it involved both public and private sectors and was based on direct and indirect state intervention, rather than the more extreme <!--del_lnk--> Soviet-style central command system. The policy of concentrating simultaneously on capital- and technology-intensive <!--del_lnk--> heavy industry and subsidising manual, low-skill <!--del_lnk--> cottage industries was criticised by economist <!--del_lnk--> Milton Friedman, who thought it would waste capital and labour, and retard the development of small manufacturerers.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>India&#39;s low average growth rate from 1947&ndash;80 was derisively referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu rate of growth, because of the unfavourable comparison with growth rates in other Asian countries, especially the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;East Asian Tigers&quot;. The economic reforms that caused a surge in economic growth after 1980 can be attributed to two stages of reform. The pro-business measures of 1980, initiated by <a href="../../wp/i/Indira_Gandhi.htm" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> and continued by <!--del_lnk--> Rajiv Gandhi, eased restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents, removed price controls and reduced corporate taxes. The economic liberalisation of 1991, initiated by then Indian prime minister <!--del_lnk--> P. V. Narasimha Rao and his finance minister <!--del_lnk--> Manmohan Singh in response to a balance-of-payments crisis, did away with the <!--del_lnk--> Licence Raj (investment, industrial and import licensing) and ended many public monopolies, allowing automatic approval of <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment in many sectors. Since then, the overall direction of liberalisation has remained the same, irrespective of the ruling party, although no party has yet tried to take on powerful lobbies such as the <!--del_lnk--> trade unions and farmers, or contentious issues such as reforming labour laws and reducing agricultural subsidies.<dl>

      <p>India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> mixed economy combines features of both capitalist market economy and the socialist command economy, but has shifted more towards the former over the past decade. The public sector generally covers areas which are deemed too important or not profitable enough to leave to the market, including such services as the railways and postal system.<p>Since independence, there have been phases of <!--del_lnk--> nationalising such areas as banking and, more recently, of privatisation.<p><a id="Public_expenditure" name="Public_expenditure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public expenditure</span></h3>
      <p>India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> public expenditure is classified as development expenditure, comprising central plan expenditure and central assistance and non-development expenditures; these categories can each be divided into <!--del_lnk--> capital expenditure and <!--del_lnk--> revenue expenditure. Central plan expenditure is allocated to development schemes outlined in the plans of the central government and public sector undertakings; central assistance refers to financial assistance and developmental loans given for plans of the state governments and <!--del_lnk--> union territories. Non-development capital expenditure comprises of capital <!--del_lnk--> defense expenditure, loans to public enterprises, states and union territories and foreign governments, while non-development revenue expenditure comprises revenue defence expenditure, administrative expenditure, <!--del_lnk--> subsidies, <!--del_lnk--> debt relief to farmers, <!--del_lnk--> postal <!--del_lnk--> deficit, <!--del_lnk--> pensions, social and economic services (education, health, agriculture, science and technology), grants to states and union territories and foreign governments.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>India&#39;s non-development revenue expenditure has increased nearly five-fold in 2003&ndash;04 since 1990&ndash;91 and more than ten-fold since 1985&ndash;1986. Interest payments are the single largest item of expenditure and accounted for more than 40% of the total non development expenditure in the 2003&ndash;04 budget. Defence expenditure increased four-fold during the same period and has been increasing due to growing tensions in the region, the expensive dispute with <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> over <!--del_lnk--> Jammu and Kashmir and an effort to modernise the military. Administrative expenses are compounded by a large <!--del_lnk--> salary and <!--del_lnk--> pension bill, which rises periodically due to revisions in <!--del_lnk--> wages, <!--del_lnk--> dearness allowance etc. <!--del_lnk--> subsidies on food, <!--del_lnk--> fertilizers, education and <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> and other merit and non-merit subsidies account are not only continuously rising, especially because of rising crude oil and food prices, but are also harder to rein in, because of political compulsions.<p><a id="Public_receipts" name="Public_receipts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Public receipts</span></h3>
      <p>India has a three-tier tax structure, wherein the <!--del_lnk--> constitution empowers the <!--del_lnk--> union government to levy <!--del_lnk--> Income tax, tax on capital transactions (<!--del_lnk--> wealth tax, <!--del_lnk--> inheritance tax, <!--del_lnk--> gift tax), <!--del_lnk--> sales tax, service tax, <!--del_lnk--> customs and <!--del_lnk--> excise duties and the <!--del_lnk--> state governments to levy sales tax on intra-state sale of goods, tax on <!--del_lnk--> entertainment and <!--del_lnk--> professions, excise duties on manufacture of <!--del_lnk--> alcohol, <!--del_lnk--> stamp duties on transfer of property and collect land revenue (levy on land owned). The <!--del_lnk--> local governments are empowered by the state government to levy <!--del_lnk--> property tax, <!--del_lnk--> Octroi and charge users for <!--del_lnk--> public utilities like <!--del_lnk--> water supply, <!--del_lnk--> sewage etc. More than half of the revenues of the union and state governments come from taxes, of which half come from <!--del_lnk--> Indirect taxes. More than a quarter of the union government&#39;s tax revenues is shared with the state governments. <p>The tax reforms, initiated in 1991, have sought to rationalise the tax structure and increase compliance by taking steps in the following directions:<ul>
       <li>Reducing the rates of individual and corporate income taxes, excises, customs and making it more progressive<li>Reducing exemptions and concessions<li>Simplification of laws and procedures<li>Introduction of <!--del_lnk--> Permanent account number to track monetary transactions<li>21 of the 29 states introduced <!--del_lnk--> Value added tax (VAT) on <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 to replace the complex and multiple sales tax system</ul>
      <p>The non-tax revenues of the central government come from <!--del_lnk--> fiscal services, interest receipts, public sector dividends, etc., while the non-tax revenues of the States are grants from the central government, interest receipts, dividends and income from general, economic and social services.<p>Inter-State share in the federal tax pool is decided by the recommendations of the <!--del_lnk--> Finance Commission to the President.<p><a id="General_budget" name="General_budget"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">General budget</span></h3>

In 1975, as per the <!--del_lnk--> floating exchange rate system, the value of the rupee was pegged to a basket of currencies and was tightly controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Reserve Bank of India. In recent years its value has depreciated with respect to most currencies with the exception of the U.S. dollar.<p>Since liberalisation, the rupee is fully <!--del_lnk--> convertible on trade and current account. The former has enabled Indian businessmen and workers to convert their earnings abroad into rupee at market rates, while the latter has removed all restrictions on <!--del_lnk--> foreign exchange for current business transactions as well as travel, education, medical expenses, etc. India has committed to gradually move towards full convertibility, albeit with some restrictions on capital accounts, in order to encourage two-way flow of capital and investment.<p><a id="Determinants" name="Determinants"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Determinants</span></h2>

      <p>India, with a <!--del_lnk--> population of 1.095 billion people, is the second most populous country in the world, accounting for one in six human beings of the Earth&#39;s population. Growth rate of population has decreased from a compound annual growth rate of 2.15 (1951&ndash;81) to 1.38% (2005&ndash;06), despite the decrease in the death rates owing to improvements in health care.<p>The large population puts further pressure on infrastructure and social services. A positive factor has been the large working-age population, which forms 45.33% of the population and is expected to increase substantially, because of the decreasing <!--del_lnk--> dependency ratio. Increased rates of literacy, better health care and self-sufficiency in food production in recent times have ensured that a large population has not caused any serious problems.

      <p>Since independence, India has allocated nearly half of the total outlay of the five-year plans for <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructural</a> development. Much of the total outlay was spent on large projects in the area of irrigation, energy, transport, communications and social overheads.

      <p>India <!--del_lnk--> ranks fifteenth worldwide in services&#39; output. Still, this sector, providing employment to 23% of the work force, is the fastest growing sector, with a growth rate of 7.5% in 1991&ndash;2000 up from 4.5% in 1951&ndash;80. It has the largest share in the GDP, accounting for 53.8% in 2005 up from 15% in 1950. Business services (<!--del_lnk--> information technology, <!--del_lnk--> information technology enabled services, <!--del_lnk--> business process outsourcing) services are among the fastest growing sectors contributing to one third of the total output of services in 2000. The growth in the IT sector is attributed to increased specialisation, availability of a large pool of low cost, but highly skilled, educated and fluent English-speaking workers on the <a href="../../wp/s/Supply_and_demand.htm" title="Supply and demand">supply side</a> and on the demand side, increased demand from foreign consumers interested in India&#39;s service exports or those looking to <!--del_lnk--> outsource their operations. <!--del_lnk--> India&#39;s IT industry, despite contributing significantly to its <!--del_lnk--> balance of payments, accounted for only about 1% of the total GDP or 1/50th of the total services. Excellent infrastructure in the service sector and the lowest communication cost has helped India to be a dominant player in these sectors.<p><a id="Banking_and_finance" name="Banking_and_finance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Banking and finance</span></h3>

      <p>The Indian <!--del_lnk--> money market is classified into: the organised sector (comprising private, public and foreign owned <!--del_lnk--> commercial banks and <a href="../../wp/c/Cooperative.htm" title="Cooperative">cooperative</a> banks, together known as <i>scheduled banks</i>); and the unorganised sector (comprising individual or family owned indigenous bankers or <!--del_lnk--> money lenders and <!--del_lnk--> non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)). The unorganised sector and <!--del_lnk--> microcredit are still preferred over traditional banks in rural and sub-urban areas, especially for non-productive purposes, like ceremonies and short duration loans.<p>Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/i/Indira_Gandhi.htm" title="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> <!--del_lnk--> nationalised 15 banks in 1969, followed by six others in 1980, and made it mandatory for banks to provide 40% (since reduced to 10%) of their net credit to priority sectors like agriculture, small-scale industry, retail trade, small businesses, etc. to ensure that the banks fulfill their social and developmental goals. Since then, the number of bank branches has increased from 10,120 in 1969 to 98,910 in 2003 and the population covered by a branch decreased from 63,800 to 15,000 during the same period. The total <!--del_lnk--> deposits increased 32.6 times between 1971 to 1991 compared to 7 times between 1951 to 1971. Despite an increase of rural branches, from 1,860 or 22% of the total number of branches in 1969 to 32,270 or 48%, only 32,270 out of 5 <!--del_lnk--> lakh (500,000) villages are covered by a scheduled bank.<p>Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks (like encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness), other reforms have opened up the banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign players.<p><a id="Socio-economic_characteristics" name="Socio-economic_characteristics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Socio-economic characteristics</span></h2>

      <p>The recent economic developments have primarily helped upper- and middle-class Indians. While poverty in India has reduced significantly, 22% of Indians still live below the poverty line. Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under <!--del_lnk--> planning, to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. All these programmes have improved upon the strategies of the <i>Food for work</i> programme and <i>National Rural Employment Programme</i> of the 1980s, which attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. In August 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> Indian parliament passed the <i>Rural Employment Guarantee Bill</i>, the largest programme of this type in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of <!--del_lnk--> India&#39;s 600 districts. The question of whether economic reforms have reduced poverty or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put political pressure on further economic reforms, especially those involving the downsizing of labour and cutting agricultural subsidies.<p><a id="Corruption" name="Corruption"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Corruption</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Corruption has been one of the pervasive problems affecting India. It takes the form of <!--del_lnk--> bribes, evasion of <!--del_lnk--> tax and <!--del_lnk--> exchange controls, <!--del_lnk--> embezzlement, etc. The economic reforms of 1991 reduced the <!--del_lnk--> red tape, bureaucracy and the <i>Licence Raj</i> that had strangled private enterprise and was blamed for the corruption and inefficiencies. Yet, a 2005 study by <!--del_lnk--> Transparency International (TI) India found that more than half of those surveyed had firsthand experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office.<p>The chief economic consequences of corruption are the loss to the <!--del_lnk--> exchequer, an unhealthy climate for investment and an increase in the cost of government-subsidised services. The TI India study estimates the monetary value of petty corruption in 11 basic services provided by the government, like education, healthcare, judiciary, police, etc., to be around Rs.21,068 crores. India still ranks in the bottom quartile of developing nations in terms of the ease of doing business, and compared to China, the average time taken to secure the clearances for a startup or to invoke bankruptcy is much greater.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Right to Information Act (2005) and equivalent acts in the states, that require government officials to furnish information requested by citizens or face punitive action, computerisation of services and various central and state government acts that established vigilance commissions have considerably reduced corruption or at least have opened up avenues to redress grievances. The latest report by Transparency International puts India at 70th place and states that significant improvements was made by India in reducing corruption. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Occupations_and_unemployment" name="Occupations_and_unemployment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Occupations and unemployment</span></h3>

      <p>Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for about 57% of the total workforce in 1999&ndash;2000, down from 60% in 1993&ndash;94. While agriculture has faced stagnation in growth, services have seen a steady growth. Of the total workforce, 8% is in the organised sector, two-thirds of which are in the public sector. The NSSO survey estimated that in 1999&ndash;2000, 106 million, nearly 10% of the population were unemployed and the overall unemployment rate was 7.32%, with rural areas doing marginally better (7.21%) than urban areas (7.65%).<p>Unemployment in India is characterised by chronic <!--del_lnk--> underemployment or <!--del_lnk--> disguised unemployment. Government schemes that target eradication of both poverty and unemployment, attempt to solve the problem, by providing financial assistance for setting up businesses, skill honing, setting up public sector enterprises, reservations in governments, etc. The decreased role of the public sector after liberalisation has further underlined the need for focusing on better education and has also put political pressure on further reforms.<p><a id="Regional_imbalance" name="Regional_imbalance"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Regional imbalance</span></h3>

      <p>One of the critical problems facing India&#39;s economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India&#39;s different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development.<p>The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities After liberalization, the more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.<p><a id="External_trade_and_investment" name="External_trade_and_investment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">External trade and investment</span></h2>

      <p>Until the liberalisation of 1991, India was largely and intentionally isolated from the world markets, to protect its fledging economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investment was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200M annually between 1985 and 1991; a large percentage of the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of <!--del_lnk--> non-resident Indians.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>India&#39;s exports were stagnant for the first 15 years after independence, due to the predominance of tea, jute and cotton manufactures, demand for which was generally <!--del_lnk--> inelastic. Imports in the same period consisted predominantly of machinery, equipment and raw materials, due to nascent industrialisation. Since liberalisation, the value of India&#39;s international trade has become more broad-based and has risen to Rs. 63,080,109 <!--del_lnk--> crores in 2003&ndash;04 from Rs.1,250 crores in 1950&ndash;51. India&#39;s major trading partners are China, the US, the UAE, the UK, Japan and the EU. The exports during August 2006 were $10.3 billion up by 41.14% and import were $13.87 billion with an increase of 32.16% over the previous year <!--del_lnk--> .<p>India is a founding-member of <!--del_lnk--> General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) since 1947 and its successor, the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Trade_Organization.htm" title="World Trade Organization">World Trade Organization</a>.

      <p>Since independence, India&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> balance of payments on its <!--del_lnk--> current account has been negative. Since liberalisation in the 1990s (precipitated by a balance of payment crisis), India&#39;s exports have been consistently rising, covering 80.3% of its imports in 2002&ndash;03, up from 66.2% in 1990&ndash;91. Although India is still a net importer, since 1996&ndash;97, its overall balance of payments (i.e., including the <!--del_lnk--> capital account balance), has been positive, largely on account of increased foreign direct investment and deposits from <!--del_lnk--> non-resident Indians; until this time, the overall balance was only occasionally positive on account of external assistance and commercial borrowings. As a result, India&#39;s foreign currency reserves stood at $141bn in 2005&ndash;06.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>India&#39;s reliance on external assistance and commercial borrowings has decreased since 1991&ndash;92, and since 2002&ndash;03, it has gradually been repaying these debts.

      <p>As the fourth-largest economy in the world, India is undoubtedly one of the most preferred destinations for <!--del_lnk--> foreign direct investments (FDI); India has strength in <!--del_lnk--> information technology and other significant areas such as auto components, chemicals, apparels, pharmaceuticals and jewellery. India has always held promise for global investors, but its rigid FDI policies were a significant hindrance in this regard. However, as a result of a series of ambitious and positive economic reforms aimed at deregulating the economy and stimulating foreign investment, India has positioned itself as one of the front-runners of the rapidly growing Asia Pacific Region. India has a large pool of skilled managerial and technical expertise. The size of the middle-class population at 300 million exceeds the population of both the US and the EU, and represents a powerful consumer market. <p>India&#39;s recently liberalised FDI policy (2005) allows up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures. Industrial policy reforms have substantially reduced industrial licensing requirements, removed restrictions on expansion and facilitated easy access to foreign technology and foreign direct investment FDI. The upward moving growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a booming economy and liberalized FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100 per cent FDI in the construction business. This automatic route has been permitted in townships, housing, built-up infrastructure and construction development projects including housing, commercial premises, hotels, resorts, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India&quot;</div>
