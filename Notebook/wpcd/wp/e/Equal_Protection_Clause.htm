      <p>The <b>Equal Protection Clause</b>, part of the <a href="../../wp/f/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution.htm" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Constitution.htm" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, provides that &quot;no <a href="../../wp/u/U.S._state.htm" title="U.S. state">state</a> shall&hellip; deny to any person within its <!--del_lnk--> jurisdiction the equal protection of the <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">laws</a>.&quot; The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>&#39; professed commitment to the proposition that &quot;<!--del_lnk--> all men are created equal&quot; by empowering the judicary to enforce that principle against the states.<p>More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the rest of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism. Before the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights protected individual rights only from invasion by the <!--del_lnk--> federal government. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments, even including some rights that arguably were not protected from abridgement by the federal government. In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, the states could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal protection of the laws. What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual explication of its meaning.<p>For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted relatively narrowly. During and after <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, however, the <!--del_lnk--> United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal government &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> executive and the <!--del_lnk--> legislative &mdash; joined in, as <!--del_lnk--> Congress and the <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President</a> passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure <!--del_lnk--> equality in <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Employment.htm" title="Employment">employment</a>, <!--del_lnk--> housing, <!--del_lnk--> lodging, and government benefits. While an expansive reading of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of <!--del_lnk--> U.S. constitutional law.<p>

      <p>The Fourteenth Amendment was enacted in 1868, shortly after the Union victory in the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Though the <!--del_lnk--> Thirteenth Amendment, which was proposed by Congress and <!--del_lnk--> ratified by the states in 1865, had <!--del_lnk--> abolished <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, many ex-<!--del_lnk--> Confederate states adopted <!--del_lnk--> Black Codes following the war.<p>These laws severely restricted the power of blacks to hold <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a> and form legally enforceable <!--del_lnk--> contracts. They also created harsher criminal penalties for blacks than for whites.<p>In response to the Black Codes, Congress enacted the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act of 1866, which provided that all those born in the United States were citizens of the United States (this provision was meant to overturn the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <i><!--del_lnk--> Dred Scott v. Sandford</i>), and required that &quot;citizens of every <a href="../../wp/r/Race.htm" title="Race">race</a> and colour ... [have] full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.&quot;<p>Doubts about whether Congress could legitimately enact such a law under the then-existing Constitution led Congress to begin to draft and debate what would become the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The effort was led by the <!--del_lnk--> Radical Republicans of both houses of Congress, including <!--del_lnk--> John Bingham, <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Sumner.htm" title="Charles Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Thaddeus Stevens. The most important among these, however, was Bingham, a Congressman from <!--del_lnk--> Ohio, who drafted the language of the Equal Protection Clause.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Southern states, of course, were opposed to the Civil Rights Act, but in 1865 Congress, exercising its power under Article I, section 5, clause 1 of the Constitution, to &quot;be the Judge of the &hellip; Qualifications of its own Members,&quot; had excluded Southerners from Congress, declaring that their states, having seceded from the Union, could therefore not elect members to Congress. It was this fact&mdash;the fact that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted by a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> rump&quot; Congress&mdash;that allowed the Equal Protection Clause, which white Southerners almost uniformly hated, to be passed by Congress and proposed to the states. Its ratification by the former Confederate states was made a condition of their reacceptance into the Union.<p>By its terms, the Clause restrains only state governments. However, the <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Amendment&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> due process guarantee, beginning with <i><!--del_lnk--> Bolling v. Sharpe</i> (1954), has been interpreted as imposing the same restrictions on the federal government.<p><a id="Post-Civil_War_interpretation_and_the_Plessy_decision" name="Post-Civil_War_interpretation_and_the_Plessy_decision"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Post-Civil War interpretation and the <i>Plessy</i> decision</span></h2>

      <p>Exclusion of blacks from juries, the Court concluded, was a denial of equal protection to black defendants, since the jury had been &quot;drawn from a panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [the defendant&#39;s] race.&quot;<p>The next important postwar case was the <i><!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Cases</i> (1883), in which the constitutionality of the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act of 1875 was at issue. The Act provided that all persons should have &quot;full and equal enjoyment of ... inns, <!--del_lnk--> public conveyances on land or water, theatres, and other places of public amusement.&quot; In its opinion, the Court promulgated what has since become known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> State Action Doctrine,&quot; which limits the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause only to acts done or otherwise &quot;sanctioned in some way&quot; by the state. Prohibiting blacks from attending plays or staying in inns was &quot;simply a private wrong,&quot; provided, of course, that the state&#39;s law saw it as a wrong. <!--del_lnk--> Justice <!--del_lnk--> John Marshall Harlan dissented alone, saying, &quot;I cannot resist the conclusion that the substance and spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism.&quot;<p>Harlan went on to argue that because (1) &quot;public conveyances on land and water&quot; use the public highways, and (2) innkeepers engage in what is &quot;a quasi-public employment,&quot; and (3) &quot;places of public amusement&quot; are licensed under the laws of the states, excluding blacks from using these services <i>was</i> an act sanctioned by the state.<p>In its most notorious post-war reinterpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, <i><!--del_lnk--> Plessy v. Ferguson</i> (1896), the Supreme Court upheld a <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana <!--del_lnk--> Jim Crow law that required the <!--del_lnk--> segregation of blacks and whites on <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">railroads</a> and mandated separate railway cars for members of the two races. The Court, speaking through Justice <!--del_lnk--> Henry B. Brown, ruled that the Equal Protection Clause had been intended to defend equality in <a href="../../wp/c/Civil_rights.htm" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a>, not equality in <!--del_lnk--> social arrangements. All that was therefore required of the law was reasonableness, and Louisiana&#39;s railway law amply met that requirement, being based on &quot;the established usages, <!--del_lnk--> customs and <!--del_lnk--> traditions of the people.&quot;<p>Justice Harlan again dissented. &quot;Every one knows,&quot; he wrote,<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Such &quot;arbitrary separation&quot; by race, Harlan concluded, was &quot;a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution.&quot;<p>Since <i><!--del_lnk--> Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas</i> (1954), Justice Harlan&#39;s dissent in <i>Plessy</i> has been vindicated as a matter of legal doctrine, and the Clause has been interpreted as imposing a general restraint on the government&#39;s power to <!--del_lnk--> discriminate against people based on their membership in certain classes, including those based on race and sex (see <a href="#Carolene_Products_and_the_various_levels_of_Equal_Protection_scrutiny" title="">below</a>).<p><a id="Between_Plessy_and_Brown" name="Between_Plessy_and_Brown"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Between <i>Plessy</i> and <i>Brown</i></span></h2>
      <p>Thus the <i>Plessy</i> majority&#39;s interpretation of the Clause stood until <i>Brown</i>. However, the holding of <i>Brown</i> was prefigured, to some extent, by several earlier cases.<p>The first of these was <i><!--del_lnk--> Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada</i> (1938), in which a black student at <!--del_lnk--> Missouri&#39;s all-black college sought admission to the law school at the all-white <!--del_lnk--> University of Missouri&mdash;there being no law school at the all-black college. Admission was denied him, and the Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of <i>Plessy</i>, held that a State&#39;s offering a legal education to whites but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Smith v. Allwright</i> (1944) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Shelley v. Kraemer</i> (1948), though not dealing with education, indicated the Court&#39;s increased willingness to find racial discrimination illegal. <i>Smith</i> declared that the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic <!--del_lnk--> primary in <!--del_lnk--> Texas, in which voting was restricted to whites alone, was unconstitutional, partly on equal protection grounds. <i>Shelley</i> concerned a privately made contract that prohibited &quot;people of the Negro or Mongolian race&quot; from living on a particular piece of land. Seeming to go against the spirit, if not the exact letter, of <i>The Civil Rights Cases</i>, the Court found that, although a discriminatory private contract could not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the courts&#39; <i>enforcement</i> of such a contract could: after all, the Supreme Court reasoned, courts were part of the state.<p>More important, however, were the companion cases <i><!--del_lnk--> Sweatt v. Painter</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents</i>, both decided in 1950. In <i>McLaurin</i>, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Oklahoma had admitted McLaurin, an African-American, but had restricted his activities there: he had to sit apart from the rest of the students in the classrooms and library, and could eat in the cafeteria only at a designated table. A unanimous Court, through <!--del_lnk--> Chief Justice <!--del_lnk--> Fred M. Vinson, said that Oklahoma had deprived McLaurin of the equal protection of the laws:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>The present situation, Vinson said, was the former.<p>In <i>Sweatt</i>, the Court considered the constitutionality of Texas&#39;s state system of <!--del_lnk--> law schools, which educated blacks and whites at separate institutions. The Court (again through Chief Justice Vinson, and again with no dissenters) invalidated the school system&mdash;not because it separated students, but rather because the separate facilities were not <i>equal</i>. They lacked &quot;substantial equality in the educational opportunities&quot; offered to their students.<p>All of these cases, including <i>Brown</i>, were litigated by the <!--del_lnk--> National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It was <!--del_lnk--> Charles Hamilton Houston, a <!--del_lnk--> Harvard Law School graduate and a law professor at <!--del_lnk--> Howard University, who in the 1930s first began to challenge racial discrimination in the federal courts. <!--del_lnk--> Thurgood Marshall, a former student of Houston&#39;s and the future <!--del_lnk--> Solicitor General and <!--del_lnk--> Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, joined him. Both men were extraordinarily skilled <!--del_lnk--> appellate advocates, but part of their shrewdness lay in their careful choice of <i>which</i> cases to litigate&mdash;of which situations would be the best legal proving grounds for their cause.<p><a id="Brown_and_its_consequences" name="Brown_and_its_consequences"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Brown</i> and its consequences</span></h2>
      <p>When <!--del_lnk--> Earl Warren became Chief Justice in 1953, <i>Brown</i> had already come before the Court. While Vinson was still Chief Justice, there had been a preliminary vote on the case at a conference of all nine justices. At that time, the Court had split, with a majority of the justices voting that school segregation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. Warren, however, through persuasion and good-natured cajoling&mdash;he had been an extremely successful <!--del_lnk--> Republican politician before joining the Court&mdash;was able to convince all eight associate justices to join his opinion declaring school segregation unconstitutional.

      <p>The Court then set the case for re-argument on the question of what the solution would be. In <i><!--del_lnk--> Brown II</i>, decided the next year, it was concluded that since the problems identified in the previous opinion were local, the solutions needed to be so as well. Thus the court devolved authority to local <!--del_lnk--> school boards and to the <!--del_lnk--> trial courts that had originally heard the cases. (<i>Brown</i> had actually been comprised of four different cases from four different states.) The trial courts and localities were told to desegregate with &quot;all deliberate speed&quot;.<p>Partly because of that enigmatic phrase, but mostly because of self-declared &quot;<!--del_lnk--> massive resistance&quot; in the South to the desegregation decision, <!--del_lnk--> integration did not begin in any significant way until the mid-1960s and then only to a small degree. In fact, much of the integration in the 1960s happened in response not to <i>Brown</i> but to the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court intervened a handful of times in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but its next major desegregation decision was <!--del_lnk--> Green v. New Kent County School Board (1968), in which Justice <!--del_lnk--> William J. Brennan, writing for a unanimous Court, rejected a &quot;freedom-of-choice&quot; school plan as inadequate. This was a significant act; freedom-of-choice plans had been very common responses to <i>Brown</i>. Under these plans, parents could choose to send their children to either a formerly white or a formerly black school. Whites almost never opted to attend black-identified schools, however, and blacks, from fear of violence or harassment, rarely attended white-identified schools.<p>In response to <i>Green</i>, many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; but because residential segregation was widespread, this had little effect, either. In 1971, the Court in <i><!--del_lnk--> Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education</i> approved busing as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, in the case of <i><!--del_lnk--> Milliken v. Bradley</i> (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students <i>between</i> <!--del_lnk--> districts, instead of merely <i>within</i> a district. <i>Milliken</i> basically ended the Supreme Court&#39;s major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in school desegregation cases, many of which had begun in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s. American public school systems, especially in large metropolitan areas, to a large extent are still de facto segregated. Whether due to <i>Brown</i>, to Congressional action or to societal change, the percentage of black students attending school districts a majority of whose students were black decreased somewhat until the early 1980s, at which point that percentage began to increase. By the late 1990s, the percentage of black students in mostly minority school districts had returned to about what it was in the late 1960s.<p>There are, very broadly speaking, two ways to explain America&#39;s marked lack of success in school integration in the five decades since <i>Brown</i>. One way, sometimes voiced by political <!--del_lnk--> conservatives, argues that <i>Brown&#39;</i>s relative failure is due to the inherent limitations of law and the courts, which simply do not have the institutional competence to supervise the desegregation of whole school districts. Moreover, the federal government&#39;s, and especially the Supreme Court&#39;s, hubris actually provoked the resistance of locals, since education in the United States is traditionally a matter for local control. The other way to explain what has happened since <i>Brown</i> often has political <!--del_lnk--> liberals as its proponents; it argues that the Court&#39;s decree in <i>Brown II</i> was insufficiently rigorous to force segregated localities into action, and that real success began only after the other two branches of the federal government got involved&mdash;the Executive Branch (under <a href="../../wp/j/John_F._Kennedy.htm" title="John F. Kennedy">Kennedy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Johnson) by encouraging the <!--del_lnk--> Department of Justice to pursue judicial remedies against resistant school districts, and Congress by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Rights Act of 1968. Liberals also point out that <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> southern strategy&quot; was premised on a tacit support of segregation that continued when Nixon came to office, so that after 1968 the Executive was no longer behind the Court&#39;s constitutional commitments.<p><a id="Carolene_Products_and_the_various_levels_of_Equal_Protection_scrutiny" name="Carolene_Products_and_the_various_levels_of_Equal_Protection_scrutiny"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Carolene Products</i> and the various levels of Equal Protection scrutiny</span></h2>

      <p>Despite the undoubted importance of <i>Brown</i>, much of modern equal protection jurisprudence stems from the <!--del_lnk--> fourth footnote in <i><!--del_lnk--> United States v. Carolene Products Co.</i> (1938), a <!--del_lnk--> Commerce Clause and <!--del_lnk--> substantive due process case. In 1937, the Court (in what was called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> switch in time that saved nine&quot;) had loosened its rules for deciding whether <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Congress.htm" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> could regulate certain commercial activities. In discussing the new presumption of constitutionality that the Court would apply to economic <!--del_lnk--> legislation, Justice <!--del_lnk--> Harlan Stone wrote:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Thus were born the &quot;more searching&quot; levels of scrutiny&mdash;&quot;strict&quot; and &quot;intermediate&quot;&mdash;with which the Court would examine legislation directed at racial minorities and women. Although the Court first articulated a &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard for laws based on race-based distinctions in <i><!--del_lnk--> Hirabayashi v. United States</i> (1943) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Korematsu v. United States</i> (1944), the Court did not apply strict scrutiny, by that name, until the 1967 case of <i><!--del_lnk--> Loving v. Virginia</i>, and that intermediate scrutiny did not command the approbation of a majority of the Court until the 1976 case of <i><!--del_lnk--> Craig v. Boren</i>.<p>The Supreme Court has defined these levels of scrutiny in the following way:<ul>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Strict scrutiny</b> (if the law categorizes on the basis of race): the law is unconstitutional unless it is &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to serve a &quot;compelling&quot; government interest. In addition, there cannot be a &quot;less restrictive&quot; alternative available to achieve that compelling interest.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Intermediate scrutiny</b> (if the law categorizes on the basis of sex): the law is unconstitutional unless it is &quot;substantially related&quot; to an &quot;important&quot; government interest. Note that in past decisions &quot;sex&quot; generally has meant <a href="../../wp/g/Gender.htm" title="Gender">gender</a>.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Rational-basis test</b> (if the law categorizes on some other basis): the law is constitutional so long as it is &quot;reasonably related&quot; to a &quot;legitimate&quot; government interest.</ul>
      <p>There is, arguably, a fourth level of scrutiny for equal protection cases. In <i><!--del_lnk--> United States v. Virginia</i> Justice <!--del_lnk--> Ruth Bader Ginsburg eschewed the language of intermediate scrutiny for sex-based discrimination and instead demanded that litigants demonstrate an &quot;exceedingly persuasive&quot; argument to justify gender discrimination. Whether this was simply a re-articulation of the doctrine of intermediate scrutiny or whether it created a new level of scrutiny between the intermediate and strict standards is unclear.<p><a id="Discriminatory_intent_or_disparate_impact.3F" name="Discriminatory_intent_or_disparate_impact.3F"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Discriminatory intent or disparate impact?</span></h2>
      <p>Another controversial area of equal protection theory&mdash;although it seems that the legal doctrine has been settled by the Supreme Court&mdash;is the issue of whether an equal protection violation requires purposeful discrimination, or whether it merely requires what is termed &quot;disparate impact.&quot;<p>In other words, does the Equal Protection Clause outlaw public policies that cause racial disparities&mdash;for example, a public school examination that more white students than black students pass? Or, on the other hand, does it merely outlaw intentional <!--del_lnk--> bigotry by public officials?<p>The Supreme Court has answered: It depends. In the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids job discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, sex or religion&mdash;and applies both to private and to public employers&mdash;the Supreme Court has answered (in <i><!--del_lnk--> Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</i> (1971)) that (1) if an employer&#39;s policy has disparate racial consequences, and (2) if the employer can&#39;t give a reasonable justification for such a policy on grounds of &quot;business necessity,&quot; then the employer&#39;s policy violates Title VII. In the years since <i>Griggs</i>, courts have defined &quot;business necessity&quot; as requiring the employer to prove that whatever is causing the racial disparity&mdash;be it a test, an educational requirement, a hiring practice&mdash;has a demonstrable factual relationship to making the company more profitable.<p>In most other situations, however, the Court&#39;s focus is on discriminatory intent. This was made clear in the seminal case of <i><!--del_lnk--> Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.</i> (1977). In that case, the plaintiff, a housing developer, sued a <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> suburb that had refused to <!--del_lnk--> rezone a plot of land in order to allow low-income, racially integrated housing to be built. There was no clear evidence of racially discriminatory intent on the part of <!--del_lnk--> Arlington Heights&#39;s planning commission; the result, however, was racially disparate, since the refusal prevented more African-Americans and Hispanics than whites from moving in. Justice <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Powell, writing for the Court, stated, &quot;Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.&quot; Disparate impact merely has an <!--del_lnk--> evidentiary value; absent a &quot;stark&quot; pattern, said the Court, &quot;impact is not determinative.&quot; (See also <i><!--del_lnk--> Washington v. Davis</i> (1976).)<p>Defenders of the Court&#39;s approach in <i>Arlington Heights</i> and <i>Washington v. Davis</i> argue that the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to guarantee <!--del_lnk--> equal outcomes, but rather <!--del_lnk--> equal opportunities; and that, therefore, we shouldn&#39;t be concerned with trying to fix every racially disparate effect&mdash;we should worry about only intentional bigotry. Others point out that the courts are merely enforcing the Equal Protection Clause, and that if the legislature wants to correct racially disparate effects, it may do so through further legislation. Critics of the approach, however, contend that focusing on intent and according only an evidentiary value to disparate racial impact misses the point. Racial bigotry, they say, is, especially nowadays, unconscious; giving much more weight to disparate impact can remedy the kind of <!--del_lnk--> unconscious <!--del_lnk--> racism that a requirement of conscious discriminatory intent cannot. This debate, though, goes on almost entirely in the academy, since the Supreme Court has not changed its basic approach as outlined in <i>Arlington Heights</i>.<p><a id="Suspect_classes" name="Suspect_classes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Suspect classes</span></h2>
      <p>The Supreme Court has seemed unwilling to extend &quot;suspect class&quot; status (i.e., status that makes a law that categorizes on that basis suspect, and therefore deserving of greater judicial scrutiny) to groups other than women and racial minorities. In <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Centre, Inc.</i> (1985), the Court refused to make the <!--del_lnk--> developmentally disabled a suspect class. Many commentators have noted, however&mdash;and Justice Marshall so notes in his partial concurrence&mdash;that the Court does appear to examine the City of Cleburne&#39;s denial of a permit to a group home for mentally retarded people with a significantly higher degree of scrutiny than is typically associated with the rational-basis test.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Lawrence v. Texas</i> (2003), the Court struck down a Texas statute prohibiting <!--del_lnk--> homosexual <!--del_lnk--> sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice <!--del_lnk--> Sandra Day O&#39;Connor&#39;s opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only <i>homosexual</i> sodomy, and not <i>heterosexual</i> sodomy as well, Texas&#39;s statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited <i>City of Cleburne</i>.<p>Notably, O&#39;Connor did not claim to apply a higher level of scrutiny than mere rational basis, and as a larger matter the Court has not extended suspect-class status to <!--del_lnk--> sexual orientation. Much as in <i>City of Cleburne</i>, though, the Court&#39;s decision in <i><!--del_lnk--> Romer v. Evans</i> (1996), on which O&#39;Connor also relied in her <i>Lawrence</i> opinion, and which struck down a <!--del_lnk--> Colorado constitutional amendment aimed at denying homosexuals &quot;minority status, quota preferences, protected status or [a] claim of discrimination,&quot; seemed to employ a markedly higher level of scrutiny than the nominally applied rational-basis test. It seems probable, therefore, that the Court, whatever it may decide about the constitutionality of laws that prohibit <!--del_lnk--> same-sex unions, will not explicitly apply heightened scrutiny to them; however, this question is unresolved. It has been argued that discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include discrimination based on <!--del_lnk--> sexual orientation, in which case intermediate scrutiny could apply to gay rights cases.<p><a id="Affirmative_action" name="Affirmative_action"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Affirmative action</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Affirmative action is the policy of consciously setting racial, ethnic, religious, or other kinds of <!--del_lnk--> diversity as a goal within an organization, and, in order to meet this goal, purposely selecting people from certain groups that have historically been oppressed or denied equal opportunities. In affirmative action, individuals of one or more of these minority backgrounds are preferred&mdash;<i><!--del_lnk--> ceteris paribus</i>&mdash;over those who do not have such characteristics; such a preferential scheme is sometimes effected through <!--del_lnk--> quotas, though this need not necessarily be so.<p>Although there were forms of what is now called affirmative action during the <!--del_lnk--> Reconstruction (most of which were implemented by the same persons who framed the Fourteenth Amendment) the modern history of affirmative action began with the Kennedy administration and started to flourish during the Johnson administration, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and two <!--del_lnk--> Executive Orders. These policies directed agencies of the federal government to employ a proportionate number of minorities whenever possible.<p>Several important affirmative action cases to reach the Supreme Court have concerned government <!--del_lnk--> contractors&mdash;for instance, <i><!--del_lnk--> Adarand Constructors v. Pe&ntilde;a</i> (1995) and <i><!--del_lnk--> City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</i> (1989). But the most famous cases have dealt with affirmative action as practiced by <!--del_lnk--> public universities: <i><!--del_lnk--> Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</i> (1978), and two companion cases decided by the Supreme Court in 2003, <i><!--del_lnk--> Grutter v. Bollinger</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Gratz v. Bollinger</i>.<p>In <i>Bakke</i>, the Court held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that educational institutions could legally use race as one of many factors to consider in their <!--del_lnk--> admissions process. In <i>Grutter</i> and <i>Gratz</i>, the Court upheld both <i>Bakke</i> as a precedent and the admissions policy of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Michigan law school. In <!--del_lnk--> dicta, however, Justice O&#39;Connor, writing for the Court, said she expected that in 25 years, racial preferences would no longer be necessary. In <i>Gratz</i>, the Court invalidated Michigan&#39;s undergraduate admissions policy, on the grounds that unlike the law school&#39;s policy, which treated race not as one of many factors in an admissions process that looked to the individual applicant, the undergraduate policy used a point system that was excessively mechanistic.<p>In these affirmative action cases, the Supreme Court has employed, or has said it employed, strict scrutiny, since the affirmative action policies challenged by the plaintiffs categorized by race. The policy in <i>Grutter</i>, and the Harvard College policy discussed by Justice Powell&#39;s opinion in <i>Bakke</i>, passed muster because the Court deemed that they were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest in diversity. On one side, critics have argued that the scrutiny the Court has applied is much less searching than true strict scrutiny, and that the Court has acted not as a principled legal institution but as a biased political one. On the other side, it is argued that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to prevent the socio-political subordination of some groups by others, not to prevent classification; since this is so, non-invidious classifications, such as those used by affirmative action programs, should not be subjected to heightened scrutiny.<p><a id="The_Equal_Protection_Clause_and_voting" name="The_Equal_Protection_Clause_and_voting"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Equal Protection Clause and voting</span></h2>
      <p>Although the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Nixon v. Herndon</i> (1927) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Gomillion v. Lightfoot</i> (1960) that the Constitution prohibited denial of the vote based on race, those decisions were based on the <!--del_lnk--> Fifteenth Amendment. The first significant application of the Equal Protection Clause to voting law came in <i><!--del_lnk--> Baker v. Carr</i> (1962), where the Court ruled that the districts that sent representatives to the <!--del_lnk--> Tennessee <!--del_lnk--> state legislature were so malapportioned (with some legislators representing ten times the number of residents as others) that they violated the Equal Protection Clause. This ruling was extended two years later in <i><!--del_lnk--> Reynolds v. Sims</i> (1964), in which a &quot;one man, one vote&quot; standard was laid down: in both houses of state legislatures, each resident had to be given equal weight in representation.<p>It may seem counterintuitive that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal <!--del_lnk--> voting rights; after all, it would seem to make the Fifteenth Amendment and the <!--del_lnk--> Nineteenth Amendment redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, as well as on the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice <!--del_lnk--> John M. Harlan (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from <i>Reynolds</i>. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>However, <i>Reynolds</i> and <i>Baker</i> do not lack a rationale, if seen in a broader perspective. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that voting is a &quot;fundamental right&quot; on the same plane as marriage (<i>Loving v. Virginia</i>), privacy (<i><!--del_lnk--> Griswold v. Connecticut</i> (1965)), or interstate travel (<i>Shapiro v. Thompson</i> (1969)). For any abridgment of those rights to be constitutional, the Court has held, the legislation must pass strict scrutiny. Thus, on this account, equal protection jurisprudence may be appropriately applied to voting rights.<p>A recent use of Equal Protection doctrine came in <i><!--del_lnk--> Bush v. Gore</i> (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> in the aftermath of the <!--del_lnk--> 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court decided that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the Equal Protection Clause. It was not this decision that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices <!--del_lnk--> Souter and <!--del_lnk--> Breyer joined the majority of five&mdash;but only, it should be emphasized, for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. What was controversial was, first, the <!--del_lnk--> remedy upon which the majority agreed&mdash;that even though there was an Equal Protection violation, there was not enough time for a recount&mdash;and second, the suggestion that the Equal Protection violation was true only on the facts of <i>Bush v. Gore</i>; commentators suggested that this meant that the Court did not wish its decision to have any <!--del_lnk--> precedential effect, and that this was evidence of its unprincipled decision-making.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause&quot;</div>
