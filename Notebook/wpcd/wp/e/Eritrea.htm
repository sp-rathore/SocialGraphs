      <p>The first detailed written source of the territory currently known as Eritrea is the chronicled expedition launched by the <!--del_lnk--> Ancient Egyptian <!--del_lnk--> Pharao <a href="../../wp/h/Hatshepsut.htm" title="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> to the fabled <i><!--del_lnk--> Punt</i> (or &quot;Ta Netjeru,&quot; meaning land of the Gods) in the 15th century BC in search of incense. Although, the oldest Egyptian expedition to Punt was made already in the 25th century BC under Pharao Suhure. The geographical description of the missions to Punt roughly correspond to the southern west coast of the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>.<p>The modern name Eritrea was first employed by the Italian colonialists in the late 19th century. It is the <!--del_lnk--> Italian form of the <!--del_lnk--> Greek name &Epsilon;&Rho;&Upsilon;&Theta;&Rho;&Alpha;&Iota;&Alpha; (<i>Erythra&icirc;a</i>; see also <!--del_lnk--> List of traditional Greek place names), which derives from the Greek term for the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&#x1F18;&rho;&upsilon;&theta;&rho;&#x1F70; &Theta;&#x3AC;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&sigma;&alpha;</span>).<p><a id="Pre_History" name="Pre_History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre History</span></h3>
      <p>In 1998 the cranium of a hominid, an intermediate between a <!--del_lnk--> Homo erectus and an archaic <!--del_lnk--> Homo Sapien, was found in Buya, Eritrea by <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> scientists. The cranium was dated to over 1 million years old (the oldest of its kind), providing a link between hominids and the earliest humans. Furthermore, the <i>Eritrean Research Project Team,</i> composed of Eritrean, <!--del_lnk--> Canadian, American, <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> scientists, discovered in 1999 a site with stone and obsidian tools dated to over 125 000 years old (from the <!--del_lnk--> paleolithic era) near the Bay of Zula south of <!--del_lnk--> Massawa along the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a> coast. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters. <!--del_lnk--> Epipaleolithic or <!--del_lnk--> mesolithic remains in the form of cave paintings in central and northern Eritrea attest to the early settlement of hunter-gatherers in this region.<p>A US paleontologist says that the fossil of a pig-sized creature found in East Africa represents the missing link between ancient and modern elephants. The dating of the new fossil, discovered in Eritrea, to 27 million years ago also pushes the origins of elephants and mastodons 5 million years further into the past than previous records, University of Michigan paleontologist William Sanders said.<p>The findings by an international team that included Sanders suggest that mastodons and the ancestors of modern elephants originated in Africa, in contrast to mammals such as rhinos that had their origins in Europe and Asia and migrated into Africa. &quot;In age and anatomy the newly discovered fossil is exactly the sort of intermediate evolutionists would expect to bridge the gap between archaic and advanced proboscideans,&quot; Sanders said.<p>In addition to Sanders, the research team included scientists from the University of Asmara in Eritrea; Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, PA, USA; the Eritrean ministry of mines and energy; Global Resources in Asmara, Eritrea; the Museum National d&#39;Histoire Naturelle in Paris; the Elephant Research Foundation; the National Museum of Eritrea; and Deutsches Primatenzentrum in Gottingen, Germany. <p><a id="Early_History" name="Early_History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early History</span></h3>
      <p>The earliest evidence of agricultural settlement, urbanism, trade and agriculture is found in the region inhabited by people dating back to 3500 to 2500 BC in the archaeological sites called the <i>Gash group</i>. Based on the archaeological evidence, there seems to have been a connection between the peoples of the Gash group and the civilizations of the <!--del_lnk--> Nile Valley namely <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Nubia. Ancient Egyptian sources also give references to cities and trading posts along the southwestern Red Sea coast, roughly corresponding to modern day Eritrea, calling this <i>the land of <!--del_lnk--> Punt</i> famed for its incense. An expedition to this very land was launched by the female <!--del_lnk--> pharao <a href="../../wp/h/Hatshepsut.htm" title="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> from the 15th century BC and was chronicled in detail.<p>In the highlands, in one of the capital city <!--del_lnk--> Asmara&#39;s suburbs <i>Sembel</i> at the mouth of the river <!--del_lnk--> Anseba, another site was found from the <!--del_lnk--> 9th century BC of another agricultural and urban settlement which traded both with the <!--del_lnk--> Sabeans across the Red Sea and with the civilizations of the Nile Valley further west along caravan routes that followed the <!--del_lnk--> Anseba River. Around this time, several cities with a high amount of Sabean remains (inscriptions, artifacts, monuments, architecture etc) seem to emerge in the central highlands and along the central coast including one called <i>Saba</i>. Some are undoubtedly built on top of older sites.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Around the 8th century BC, a kingdom known as <!--del_lnk--> D&#39;mt was established in what is today northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital at <!--del_lnk--> Yeha in northern Ethiopia and which had extensive relations with the <!--del_lnk--> Sabeans in present day <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> across the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. After D`mt&#39;s decline around the 5th century BC, the state of <!--del_lnk--> Aksum arose in the northern Abyssinian plateau. It grew during the 4th century BC and came into prominence during the first century AD, <a href="../../wp/a/Aksumite_currency.htm" title="Aksumite currency">minting its own coins</a> by the 3rd century, converting in the 4th century to Christianity, as the second official Christian state (after Armenia) and the first country to feature the cross on its coins. According to <!--del_lnk--> Mani, it grew to be one of the four greatest civilizations in the world, on a par with <!--del_lnk--> China, <a href="../../wp/s/Sassanid_Empire.htm" title="Sassanid Empire">Persia</a>, and <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Rome</a>. In the <!--del_lnk--> 7th century AD; with the advent of <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a> across the Red Sea in <!--del_lnk--> Arabia, Aksum&#39;s trade and power on the Red Sea began to decline and the centre moved farther inland to the Ethiopian highlands of what is today Ethiopia and the state was eventually defeated by Islamic as well as other internal forces circa 850 or 950 AD<p><a id="Medieval_History" name="Medieval_History"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medieval History</span></h3>
      <p>During the medieval period, the area which we now call Eritrea was the site of several states as well as tribal and clan lands. Between the 8th and 13th century, northern and western Eritrea had largely come under the domination of the <!--del_lnk--> Beja, an Islamic, <!--del_lnk--> Cushitic people from northeastern <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>. They formed five independent kingdoms known as: <i>Naqis</i>, <i>Baqlin</i>, <i>Bazin</i>, <i>Jarin</i> and <i>Qata</i>. The Beja brought Islam to large parts of Eritrea and connected the region to the greater Islamic world dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Ummayad Caliphate, followed by the <a href="../../wp/a/Abbasid.htm" title="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> (and <!--del_lnk--> Mamluk) and later the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The Ummayads were already in direct possession of small stretches of the Eritrean coastline and the <!--del_lnk--> Dahlak archipelago by the 8th century. The Beja imposed themselves as rulers but did not impose their cushitic language or culture on their subjects but rather adopted the local <!--del_lnk--> Ge&#39;ez based language. This language evolved over time into the <!--del_lnk--> Tigre language which to this day is the <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca of the predominantly Muslim lowlands and northern coast of Eritrea. Later, in the 15th and 16th centuries, nothern Eritrea and its coastline were taken over completely by the Ottomans who were to remain there for over 300 years and govern it from the port of <!--del_lnk--> Massawa. Meanwhile, the central highlands and adjacent coastline became the site of a Christian Kingdom called <i>Midre Bahri</i> or <i>Midre Bahr</i> meaning <i>sea-land</i> in Tigrinya and Tigre respectively, and ruled by the <i>Bahr Negash</i> or <!--del_lnk--> Bahr negus (meaning king of the sea) that was loosely affiliated with the <!--del_lnk--> Abyssinian kingdoms of the south (but at times also became involved in conflict with them in alliance with the Ottomans). The domain of the kingdom was for most of its history restricted to north of the perennial river <!--del_lnk--> Mareb and which still serves as a natural boundary between Eritrea and Ethiopia today. The other Abyssinian kingdoms south of the river therefor commonly referred to Midre Bahri as <i>Mareb Mellash</i> meaning &#39;beyond Mareb&#39; (in the <!--del_lnk--> Amharic language of the <!--del_lnk--> Amhara who had come to dominate Abyssinia since the 13th century). The feudal authority of the Bahr Negash later waned and was replaced by a Republic known as <!--del_lnk--> Hamasien, which was based on a land-owning peasantry (citizenry) in the central highlands who ruled by elders councils or <i>shimagile</i> and maintained it&#39;s entire young and able male population as a standing army. The southern coastline meanwhile was populated by the <!--del_lnk--> Afar and <!--del_lnk--> Saho speaking Islamic chiefdoms or clan lands which by the 16th century had evolved into the centralized <!--del_lnk--> Adal sultanate (along with territories currently in eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti and Northern Somalia).<p>An Ottoman invading force under <a href="../../wp/s/Suleiman_the_Magnificent.htm" title="Suleiman the Magnificent">Suleiman I</a> conquered <!--del_lnk--> Massawa in 1577, building what is now considered the &#39;old town&#39; of Massawa on Batsi island. They also conquered the towns of <!--del_lnk--> Hergigo, and <!--del_lnk--> Debarwa, the capital city of the contemporary <!--del_lnk--> Bahr negus (ruler), <!--del_lnk--> Yeshaq. Suleiman&#39;s forces fought as far south as southeastern <!--del_lnk--> Tigray before being repulsed. Yeshaq was able to retake much of what the Ottomans captured with Abyssinian (Ethiopian) assistance, but he later twice revolted against the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor of Abyssinia with Ottoman support in an attempt to take the Abyssinian throne.

      <p>An Italian <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic missionary and explorer by the name of <i>Giuseppe Sapetto</i> purchased the port of <!--del_lnk--> Assab from the <!--del_lnk--> Afar Sultanate on behalf of a Genovese (Italian) Shipping Company called <i>Rubattino</i> in 1869. This happened in the same year as the opening of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>. In the ongoing <a href="../../wp/s/Scramble_for_Africa.htm" title="Scramble for Africa">Scramble for Africa</a>, Italy as one of the European colonial powers began vying for a possession along the strategic coast of what was to become the world&#39;s busiest shipping lane. With the approval of the Italian parliament and King <!--del_lnk--> Umberto I of Italy (later succeeded by his son <!--del_lnk--> Victor Emmanuel III), the government of Italy bought the Rubattino Company&#39;s holdings and expanded its possessions northwards along the Red Sea coast towards and beyond Massawa, encroaching on and quickly expelling previously &#39;Egyptian&#39; possessions. The Italians met with stiffer resistance in the Eritrean highlands from the army of the Abyssinian Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Yohannes IV that also wanted a piece of these lands and an outlet to the sea. Nevertheless the Italians repulsed both Egyptians and Abyssinians and consolidated their possessions into one colony, henceforth known as Eritrea, territory of Italy as of <!--del_lnk--> New Years Day of <!--del_lnk--> 1890.<p>The Italians remained the colonial power in Eritrea until they were defeated by Allied forces in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> (1941), and Eritrea became a <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> protectorate. After the war, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> conducted a lengthy inquiry, including a faulty referendum in which only the male &quot;elders&quot; (shimagile) of the Eritrean communities participated, in order to find out the wishes of the Eritrean people. During this time, those under Imperial Ethiopia&#39;s influence (who wanted unity with Ethiopia) and those who wanted Eritrea&#39;s independence, lobbied the great powers and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">U.N.</a> extensively. Imperial Ethiopia itself meddled immensely in the process, through bribing certain influential officials, intimidating others and most importantly by attempting to sow discord between Eritrean Muslims and Christians through its primary instrument: the Orthodox Church, which was used to herald Ethiopia as a bastion of Christianity, a haven and motherland of Christians and to spread a fear among Eritrean Christians that an independent Eritrea would inevitably succumb to Islamic rule. Moreover voting church members who did not vote for unity with Ethiopia as well as clergy who did not comply with the mission of the church were excommunicated or threatened with such by the Orthodox Church. The superpowers were also involved in a wrestle for a stake in the Eritrean question. The communist bloc along with most non-aligned independent third world countries favored Eritrean independence. The western powers Britain, France and the United States on the other hand already had Imperial Ethiopia as a close ally in line with western interests in the region and favored Eritrea being united with Ethiopia, rather than risk an independent Eritrea becoming a communist anti-western state. John Foster Dulles, the secretary of state of the United States at the time uttered the famous words:<p><i>&quot;From the point of view of justice, the opinions of the Eritrean people must receive consideration. Nevertheless, the strategic interests of the United States in the Red Sea Basin and considerations of security and world peace make it necessary that the country (Eritrea) has to be linked with our ally, Ethiopia&quot;,</i> John Foster Dulles in 1952.<p>Eventually a compromise was reached under which the former Italian colony was to be <!--del_lnk--> federated with <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. Eritrea would have its own <!--del_lnk--> parliament and administration, and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and was now the federal parliament. The Emperor of Ethiopia predictably dissolved all semblance of the Federation by shutting down the parliament and declaring Eritrea the 14th province of Ethiopia in 1961. This led to the 30 year long <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean Struggle for Independence.<p><a id="Struggle_for_independence" name="Struggle_for_independence"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Struggle for independence</span></h3>

      <p>Eritreans formed the <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) and rebelled. The rebel movement was initially dominated by the ELF but became rivaled by the <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean People&#39;s Liberation Front in the 1970s. The ELF was a conservative grass roots movement dominated by <!--del_lnk--> Muslim lowlanders, and thus received backing from <!--del_lnk--> Arab governments, whereas the EPLF professed <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and was supported by a growing Eritrean Diaspora. The ELF was eventually overshadowed and eliminated by the EPLF. The struggle for independence neared victory in the mid-1970s but suffered reverses when the <!--del_lnk--> Derg, a <a href="../../wp/m/Marxism.htm" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> military junta, came to power in Ethiopia with backing from the Soviet Union and other countries.

      <p>The struggle for independence ended in 1991, when the EPLF expelled the Ethiopian Army from Eritrea and had also joined forces with Ethiopian resistance movements to overthrow the Derg regime which fell the same year. Two years later, a <!--del_lnk--> referendum was held supervised by the UN mission UNOVER, with universal suffrage and conducted both in and outside Eritrea (among Eritrean communities in the diaspora), on whether Eritreans wanted independence or unity with Ethiopia. Over 99% of the Eritrean people voted for independence which was declared on May 24 1993. The leader of the EPLF, <!--del_lnk--> Isaias Afewerki, became Eritrea&#39;s first Provisional <!--del_lnk--> President, and the Eritrean People&#39;s Liberation Front (later renamed the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Front for Democracy and Justice, or PFDJ) created a government.<p>In 1998, <!--del_lnk--> a border war with <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> over the town of <!--del_lnk--> Badme resulted in the deaths of thousands of Eritrean soldiers (19,000, according to the government; 20-50,000 by some estimates), massive population displacement, reduced economic development, and a severe <!--del_lnk--> land mine problem. During and after the war, the Ethiopian Government expelled Eritreans and those of Eritrean heritage from Ethiopia after confiscating their wealth and properties. The <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean-Ethiopian War ended in 2000 with a negotiated agreement known as the <!--del_lnk--> Algiers Agreement, which assigned an independent, UN-associated boundary commission known as the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC), whose task was to clearly identify the border between the two countries. The EEBC issued a final border ruling in April 2002 and awarded <!--del_lnk--> Badme to Eritrea. However, Ethiopia has not withdrawn all its troops from the town, which has led to fears for another war.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Eritrea is a member in good standing of the African Union (AU), the successor of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). But it has withdrawn its representative to the AU in protest of the AU&#39;s lack of leadership in facilitating the implementation of a binding border decision demarcating the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea&#39;s relationship with the United States is complicated. Although the two nations have a close working relationship regarding the on-going war on terror, there has been a growing tension in other areas. Eritrea&#39;s relationship with Italy and the EU has become equally strained in many areas in the last three years.<p>Within the region, Eritrea&#39;s relations with Ethiopia turned from that of close alliance to a deadly rivalry that lead to a war from May, 1998 to June 2000 in which 19,000 Eritreans were killed.<p>External issues include an undemarcated border with <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, a war with <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> over the <!--del_lnk--> Hanish Islands in 1996, and a recent border conflict with <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>.<p>The undemarcated border with Sudan poses a problem for Eritrean external relations. After a high-level delegation to Sudan from the Eritrean Ministry of Foreign Affairs ties are being normalized. While normalization of ties continues, Eritrea has been recognized as a broker for peace between the separate factions of the Sudanese civil war. &quot;It is known that Eritrea played a role in bringing about the peace agreement [between the Southern Sudanese and Government],&quot; while the Sudanese Government and Eastern Front rebels have requested Eritrea to mediate peace talks.<p>A dispute with <a href="../../wp/y/Yemen.htm" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> over the <!--del_lnk--> Hanish Islands in 1996 resulted in a brief war. As part of an agreement to cease hostilities the two nations agreed to refer the issue to the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Court of Arbitration at <a href="../../wp/t/The_Hague.htm" title="The Hague">the Hague</a>. At the conclusion of the proceedings, both nations acquiesced to the decision. Since 1996 both governments have remained wary of one another but relations are relatively normal.<p>The undemarcated border with Ethiopia is the primary external issue facing Eritrea. This led to a long and bloody border war between 1998 and 2000. As a result, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (<!--del_lnk--> UNMEE) is occupying a 25&nbsp;kilometres by 900&nbsp;kilometres area on the border to help stabilize the region. Disagreements following the war have resulted in stalemate punctuated by periods of elevated tension and renewed threats of war. Central to the continuation of the stalemate is Ethiopia&#39;s failure to abide by the border delimitation ruling and reneging on its commitment to demarcation. The stalemate has led the President of Eritrea to urge the UN to take action on Ethiopia. This request is outlined in the <!--del_lnk--> Eleven Letters penned by the President to the United Nations Security Council. The situation is further escalated by the continued effort of the Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders in supporting each other&#39;s opposition.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The attack prevented planting of crops in Eritrea&#39;s most productive region, causing food production to drop by over 60%.<p>Even during the war, Eritrea developed its transportation <a href="../../wp/i/Infrastructure.htm" title="Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges as a part of the <!--del_lnk--> Warsay Yika&#39;alo Program. The most remarkable of these projects has been the building of a coastal highway of more than 500 Kms connecting <!--del_lnk--> Massawa with <!--del_lnk--> Assab as well as the rehabilitation of the <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean Railway. The rail line now runs between the Port of Massawa and the capital Asmara. This feat of re-engineering was accomplished by local labor and ingenuity.<p>Eritrea&#39;s economic future remains mixed. The cessation of Ethiopian trade, which mainly used Eritrean ports before the war, leaves Eritrea with a large economic hole to fill. Eritrea&#39;s economic future depends upon its ability to master fundamental social problems like <!--del_lnk--> illiteracy, <!--del_lnk--> unemployment, and low skills, as well as the willingness to open its economy further to private enterprise so that the Diaspora&#39;s money and expertise can foster economic growth.<p><a id="Society" name="Society"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Society</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>Eritrean society is ethnically heterogeneous. The largest ethnic group are the <!--del_lnk--> Tigrinya who compose up to 50% of the population, while the <!--del_lnk--> Tigre people make up another 31.4%. The rest of the population is comprised of the smaller populations of the <!--del_lnk--> Saho, <!--del_lnk--> Nara, <!--del_lnk--> Hedareb, <!--del_lnk--> Beja, <!--del_lnk--> Afar, <!--del_lnk--> Bilen, <!--del_lnk--> Kunama, and the <!--del_lnk--> Rashaida. Each nationality speaks a different native tongue, but typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language. The <!--del_lnk--> Jebertis are <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Tigrinyas who consider themselves a separate ethnicity, however, in Eritrea ethnicity is determined by language and so they are not officially recognized as separate from the Tigrinya.<p>There exist minorities of <!--del_lnk--> Italians and Ethiopian Tigrayans. Neither is generally given citizenship unless through marriage or having it conferred upon them by the State.<p>The most recent addition to the nationalities of Eritrea is the Rashaida. The Rashaida came to Eritrea in the 19th century from the Arabian Coast. The Rashaida do not typically intermarry, are typically nomadic, and number approximately 61,000, less than 1% of the population.<p>The Kunama are one of the earliest settled peoples in Eritrea. They adopted rain-fed agriculture and settled into communal villages in the &#39;lowlands&#39; of Eritrea.<p>Between 900 and 500 BC Eritrea experienced massive migrations and cultural contacts from Saba in Southern Arabia. The Sabean area in Eritrea is mainly to be found in the Kebessa highlands surrounding the capital Asmara and extending southwards. There the Sabeans found the same geographical conditions as in their native Saba, suitable to terracing and their pre-existing agricultural modes of production.<p><a id="Languages" name="Languages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h3>

      <p>Many languages are spoken in Eritrea today. The two language families that most of the languages stem from are the <!--del_lnk--> Semitic and <!--del_lnk--> Cushitic families. The Semitic languages in Eritrea are <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> (spoken natively by the <!--del_lnk--> Rashaida Arabs), <!--del_lnk--> Tigrinya, <!--del_lnk--> Tigre, and the newly recognized <!--del_lnk--> Dahlik; these languages (primarily Tigrinya and Tigre) are spoken as a first language by over 80% of the population. The Cushitic languages in Eritrea are just as numerous, including <!--del_lnk--> Afar, <!--del_lnk--> Beja, <!--del_lnk--> Blin, and <!--del_lnk--> Saho. <!--del_lnk--> Kunama and <!--del_lnk--> Nara are also spoken in Eritrea and belong to the <!--del_lnk--> Nilo-Saharan language family. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Amharic are spoken to a degree by more educated Eritreans, and there are still some speakers of <!--del_lnk--> Italian leftover from colonial times.<p>The local Tigrinya and the wider Arabic language are the two predominant languages for official purposes, but a few Italian speakers can still be found. Along with Arabic (spoken natively only by the Rashaida), English is the most widely spoken non-African language.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>

      <p>There are five levels of education in Eritrea, pre-primary, primary, middle, secondary and post-secondary. There are nearly 238,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools in Eritrea and two Universities (University of Asmara and the Institute of Science and Technology) as well as several smaller colleges and technical schools.<p>One of the most important goals of Eritrea&#39;s educational policy is to provide basic education in each of Eritrea&#39;s mother tongues, as well as to develop a self-motivated and conscientious population to fight poverty and disease. Furthermore it is tooled to produce a society that is equipped with the necessary skills to function with a culture of self-reliance in the modern economy.<p>The education system in Eritrea is also designed to promote private sector schooling, equal access for all groups (<i>i.e.</i>, prevent gender discrimination, prevent ethnic discrimination, prevent class discrimination, etc.) and promote continuing education, both formally and informally.<p>Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional taboos, school fees (for registration and materials), and the opportunity costs of low-income households.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h3>

      <p>Eritrea has two dominant religions, <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, which each account for roughly half the population. The Christians consist primarily of the <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church, which is the local <!--del_lnk--> Oriental Orthodox church, but small groups of <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholics, <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, and other denominations also exist, while the Muslims predominantly follow <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam.<p>Members of the Eritrean Orthodox Church are sometimes described as <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Christians because it was formerly part of the <!--del_lnk--> Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which was until 1959 subject to the Coptic Pope. However, the word <i>Coptic</i> in modern usage refers primarily to the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Orthodox branch of Christianity. The Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox churches are still in <!--del_lnk--> full communion with the Coptic Church in Egypt. The Eritrean Orthodox Church was granted <!--del_lnk--> autocephaly in 1993 by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church when Eritrea became independent, and, in 1998 the Archbishop of <!--del_lnk--> Asmara, the capital, was elevated to the rank of patriarchate.<p>Since May 2002, the government of Eritrea has only officially recognized the <!--del_lnk--> Eritrean Orthodox Church, <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam, <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism and the Evangelical <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran church. All other faiths and denominations were required to undergo a registration process that was so stringent as to effectively be prohibitive. Amongst other things, the government&#39;s registration system requires religious groups to submit personal information on their membership in order to be allowed to <!--del_lnk--> worship. The few organisations that have met all of the registration requirements have still not received official recognition. Other faith groups like <!--del_lnk--> Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, <!--del_lnk--> Bahai&#39;s, the <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventist Church and numerous Protestant denominations are not registered and cannot worship freely. They have effectively been banned, and harsh measures have been taken against their adherents. Over twenty Protestant pastors and almost 2000 church members have so far been detained indefinitely and without charge. In addition several Orthodox priests have also been detained, and the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church has been replaced by the Eritrean Orthodox Synod and placed under stringent house arrest ostensibly for objecting to government interference in church affairs.<p>There is also one last native Jew left in Eritrea, formerly from a community of hundreds in Asmara, whose ancestors had crossed from Aden in the late 19th century.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geographic locale</span></h2>
