      <p><b>Electric charge</b> is a fundamental conserved property of some <!--del_lnk--> subatomic particles, which determines their <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic interaction. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic fields. The interaction between a moving charge and an electromagnetic field is the source of the <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic force, which is one of the four <!--del_lnk--> fundamental forces.<p>Electric charge is a characteristic of some subatomic particles, and is quantized when expressed as a multiple of the so-called <!--del_lnk--> elementary charge <i>e</i>. <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">Electrons</a> by convention have a charge of -1, while <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> have the opposite charge of +1. <a href="../../wp/q/Quark.htm" title="Quark">Quarks</a> have a fractional charge of &minus;1/3 or +2/3. The <!--del_lnk--> antiparticle equivalents of these have the opposite charge. There are other <!--del_lnk--> charged particles.<p>In general, same-sign charged particles repel one another, while different-sign charged particles attract. This is expressed quantitatively in <a href="../../wp/c/Coulomb%2527s_law.htm" title="Coulomb&#39;s law">Coulomb&#39;s law</a>, which states the magnitude of the repelling force is proportional to the product of the two charges, and weakens proportionately to the square of the distance.<p>The electric charge of a <!--del_lnk--> macroscopic object is the sum of the electric charges of its constituent particles. Often, the net electric charge is zero, since naturally the number of electrons in every <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atom</a> is equal to the number of the <!--del_lnk--> protons, so their charges cancel out. Situations in which the net charge is non-zero are often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> static electricity. Furthermore, even when the net charge is zero, it can be distributed non-uniformly (e.g., due to an external <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_field.htm" title="Electric field">electric field</a>), and then the material is said to be <!--del_lnk--> polarized, and the charge related to the polarization is known as <!--del_lnk--> bound charge (while the excess charge brought from outside is called <i>free charge</i>). An ordered motion of charged particles in a particular direction (in metals, these are the electrons) is known as <!--del_lnk--> electric current. The discrete nature of electric charge was proposed by <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Faraday.htm" title="Michael Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> in his electrolysis experiments, then directly demonstrated by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Millikan in his <!--del_lnk--> oil-drop experiment.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> SI unit for <!--del_lnk--> quantity of electricity or electric charge is the <!--del_lnk--> coulomb, which represents approximately 6.24 &times; 10<sup>18</sup> <!--del_lnk--> elementary charges (the charge on a single electron or proton). The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that has passed through the cross-section of an <!--del_lnk--> electrical conductor carrying one <!--del_lnk--> ampere within one second. The symbol <i>Q</i> is often used to denote a quantity of electricity or charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an <!--del_lnk--> electrometer, or indirectly measured with a <!--del_lnk--> ballistic galvanometer.<p>Formally, a measure of charge should be a multiple of the elementary charge <i>e</i> (charge is <!--del_lnk--> quantized), but since it is an average, <!--del_lnk--> macroscopic quantity, many orders of magnitude larger than a single elementary charge, it can effectively take on any <!--del_lnk--> real value. Furthermore, in some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of a charge; e.g. in the charging of a <!--del_lnk--> capacitor.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>As reported by the Ancient Greek philosopher <!--del_lnk--> Thales of Miletus around <!--del_lnk--> 600 BC, charge (or <i>electricity</i>) could be accumulated by rubbing <!--del_lnk--> fur on various substances, such as <a href="../../wp/a/Amber.htm" title="Amber">amber</a>. The Greeks noted that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as <!--del_lnk--> hair. They also noted that if they rubbed the <a href="../../wp/a/Amber.htm" title="Amber">amber</a> for long enough, they could even get a spark to jump. This property derives from the <!--del_lnk--> triboelectric effect.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1600 the English scientist <a href="../../wp/w/William_Gilbert.htm" title="William Gilbert">William Gilbert</a> returned to the subject in <i>De Magnete</i>, and coined the <!--del_lnk--> New Latin word <i>electricus</i> from <i>&eta;&lambda;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</i> (<i>elektron</i>), the Greek word for &quot;amber&quot;, which soon gave rise to the English words &quot;electric&quot; and &quot;electricity.&quot; He was followed in <!--del_lnk--> 1660 by <!--del_lnk--> Otto von Guericke, who invented what was probably the first <!--del_lnk--> electrostatic generator. Other European pioneers were <a href="../../wp/r/Robert_Boyle.htm" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a>, who in <!--del_lnk--> 1675 stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum; <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Gray, who in <!--del_lnk--> 1729 classified materials as <!--del_lnk--> conductors and <!--del_lnk--> insulators; and <!--del_lnk--> C. F. du Fay, who proposed in <!--del_lnk--> 1733 <!--del_lnk-->  that electricity came in two varieties which cancelled each other, and expressed this in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with <i>vitreous electricity</i>, and when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was said to be charged with <i>resinous electricity</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1839 Michael Faraday showed that the apparent division between static electricity, current electricity and bioelectricity was incorrect, and all were a consequence of the behaviour of a single kind of electricity appearing in opposite polarities.<p>One of the foremost experts on electricity in the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a> was <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Franklin.htm" title="Benjamin Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who argued in favour of a one-fluid theory of electricity. Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter; for example he believed that it was the <a href="../../wp/g/Glass.htm" title="Glass">glass</a> in a <!--del_lnk--> Leyden jar that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained too little of the fluid it was &quot;negatively&quot; charged, and when it had an excess it was &quot;positively&quot; charged. Arbitrarily (or for a reason that was not recorded) he identified the term &quot;positive&quot; with vitreous electricity and &quot;negative&quot; with resinous electricity. <!--del_lnk--> William Watson arrived at the same explanation at about the same time.<p>We now know that the Franklin/Watson model was close, but too simple. Matter is actually composed of several kinds of electricity (several kinds of electrically charged particles,) the most common being the positively charged <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">proton</a> and the negatively charged <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electron</a>. Rather than one possible <!--del_lnk--> electric current there are many: a flow of electrons, a flow of electron &quot;holes&quot; which act like positive particles, or in <!--del_lnk--> electrolytic <!--del_lnk--> solutions, a flow of both negative and positive particles called <!--del_lnk--> ions moving in opposite directions. To reduce this complexity, electrical workers still use Franklin&#39;s convention and they imagine that electric current (known as <i><!--del_lnk--> conventional current</i>) is a flow of exclusively positive particles. The conventional current simplifies electrical concepts and calculations, but it ignores the fact that within some conductors (electrolytes, semiconductors, and <a href="../../wp/p/Plasma_%2528physics%2529.htm" title="Plasma (physics)">plasma</a>), two or more species of electric charges flow in opposite directions. The flow direction for <i>conventional current</i> is also backwards compared to the actual electron drift taking place during electric currents in metals, the typical conductor of electricity. The true direction of electric current is a source of confusion for beginners in electronics, and a minority of educators ignore the standard and instead assume that moving charges are exclusively negative.<p><a id="Properties" name="Properties"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Properties</span></h2>
      <p>Aside from the properties described in articles about <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetism, charge is a <!--del_lnk--> relativistic <!--del_lnk--> invariant. This means that any particle that has charge <i>q</i>, no matter how fast it goes, always has charge <i>q</i>. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the charge of <i>one</i> <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> <!--del_lnk--> nucleus (two <a href="../../wp/p/Proton.htm" title="Proton">protons</a> and two <a href="../../wp/n/Neutron.htm" title="Neutron">neutrons</a> bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as <i>two</i> <!--del_lnk--> deuterium nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).<p><a id="Conservation_of_charge" name="Conservation_of_charge"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Conservation of charge</span></h2>
      <p>The total electric charge of an <!--del_lnk--> isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from <!--del_lnk--> gauge invariance of the <!--del_lnk--> wave function. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current <!--del_lnk--> continuity equation. More generally, the net change in <!--del_lnk--> charge density <span class="texhtml">&rho;</span> within a volume of integration <span class="texhtml"><i>V</i></span> is equal to the area integral over the <!--del_lnk--> current density <span class="texhtml"><i>J</i></span> on the surface of the area <span class="texhtml"><i>S</i></span>, which is in turn equal to the net <!--del_lnk--> current <span class="texhtml"><i>I</i></span>:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="- \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V \rho\, \mathrm{d}V = \int_S \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{S} = \int J S \cos\theta = I" class="tex" src="../../images/40/4005.png" /></dl>
      <p>Thus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="I = -\frac{dQ}{dt}" class="tex" src="../../images/40/4006.png" /></dl>
      <p>where <b>I</b> is the net outward current through a closed surface and <b>Q</b> is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge&quot;</div>
