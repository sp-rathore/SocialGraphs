      <p><b>Edward V</b> (<!--del_lnk--> 4 November <!--del_lnk--> 1470 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 1483?) was the <!--del_lnk--> King of England from <!--del_lnk--> 9 April <!--del_lnk--> 1483 until his deposition two months later. His reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who succeeded him as <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_III_of_England.htm" title="Richard III of England">Richard III</a>. Along with his younger brother <!--del_lnk--> Richard of Shrewsbury, Edward was one of the <!--del_lnk--> Princes in the Tower, who were never seen alive after being sent (ostensibly for their own safety) to the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>. Richard III has been widely blamed for their deaths, though it is not certain that he was responsible for them.<p>Along with <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_VIII_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Edward VIII of the United Kingdom">Edward VIII</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Lady Jane Grey, Edward V is one of only three post-1066 British monarchs never to have been <!--del_lnk--> crowned.<p>

      <p>Edward was born in <!--del_lnk--> sanctuary within <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> while his mother, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Woodville, was taking refuge from the <!--del_lnk--> Lancastrians who dominated the kingdom after his father, the <!--del_lnk--> Yorkist King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_IV_of_England.htm" title="Edward IV of England">Edward IV of England</a>, was removed from power. He was created <!--del_lnk--> Prince of Wales in June, <!--del_lnk--> 1471, following his father&#39;s restoration to the throne, and appeared with his parents on State occasions.<p>He was a younger brother of <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth of York, <!--del_lnk--> Mary of York, and <!--del_lnk--> Cecily of York. He was an older brother of <!--del_lnk--> Margaret Plantagenet (Princess of York); <!--del_lnk--> Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York; <!--del_lnk--> Anne of York; <!--del_lnk--> George Plantagenet, Duke of Bedford; <!--del_lnk--> Catherine of York; and <!--del_lnk--> Bridget of York.<p><a id="Reign" name="Reign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Reign</span></h2>
      <p>Edward IV, having established a <!--del_lnk--> Council of Wales and the Marches, sent his son to <!--del_lnk--> Ludlow Castle to be its nominal president. It was at <!--del_lnk--> Ludlow that the prince was staying when news came of his father&#39;s sudden death. Edward inherited the throne on <!--del_lnk--> 9 April <!--del_lnk--> 1483, at the age of twelve. His father&#39;s brother <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_III_of_England.htm" title="Richard III of England">Richard</a>, Duke of Gloucester, was entrusted with the role of protector to his young nephews, Edward V and <!--del_lnk--> Richard, Duke of York. He intercepted Edward&#39;s entourage on its return journey from <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> and escorted the princes to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. Less than three months later, Richard took the throne himself. On <!--del_lnk--> 25 June Parliament <!--del_lnk--> declared his nephews illegitimate after clergyman <!--del_lnk--> Ralph Shaa presented evidence that Edward had contracted to marry <!--del_lnk--> Lady Eleanor Butler before he married <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Woodville; this would have made his marriage to Elizabeth invalid. Richard&#39;s other brothers, Edmund and <!--del_lnk--> George, Duke of Clarence, had both died before Edward, leaving Richard next in line for the throne.<p><a id="Imprisonment" name="Imprisonment"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Imprisonment</span></h2>

      <p>After the princes&#39; disappearance, there was much uncertainty as to their fate. If they were killed, the secret was well kept; conversely, there was no evidence of their survival or of their having been shipped out of the country. When a <!--del_lnk--> pretender, <!--del_lnk--> Perkin Warbeck, turned up claiming to be Prince Richard, in 1495, William Stanley (younger brother of King Henry&#39;s stepfather, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby), who, despite his <!--del_lnk--> Yorkist sympathies, had turned against Richard III at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Bosworth Field and helped <!--del_lnk--> King Henry VII win it, said that, if the young man was really the prince, he would not fight against him, thus demonstrating that some Yorkists had not given up hope of the princes&#39; survival.<p>In 1674, some workmen remodelling the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a> dug up a box containing two small human skeletons. They threw them on a rubbish heap, but some days or weeks later someone decided they might be the bones of the two princes, so they gathered them up and put some of them in an urn that <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a> ordered interred in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. In 1933 the bones were taken out and examined and then replaced in the urn in the vault under the Abbey. The experts who examined them could not agree on what age the children would have been when they died or even whether they were boys or girls. (One skeleton was larger than the other, and many of the bones were missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one.)<p><a id="Ancestors" name="Ancestors"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Ancestors</span></h2>
