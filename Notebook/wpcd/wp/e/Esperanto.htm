      <p>Esperanto was developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s by <!--del_lnk--> ophthalmologist <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof, a <!--del_lnk--> Polish Jew from the West of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Empire (now Poland). After some ten years of development, which Zamenhof spent translating literature into the language as well as writing original <!--del_lnk--> prose and <!--del_lnk--> verse, the <!--del_lnk--> first Esperanto grammar was published in <a href="../../wp/w/Warsaw.htm" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> in July 1887. The number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades, at first primarily in the <!--del_lnk--> Russian empire and <!--del_lnk--> Eastern Europe, then in <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe and the <!--del_lnk--> Americas, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. In the early years speakers of Esperanto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and <!--del_lnk--> periodicals, but in 1905 the first <!--del_lnk--> world congress of Esperanto speakers was held in <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne-sur-Mer, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>. Since then world congresses have been held on five <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> every year except during the two <!--del_lnk--> World Wars, and have been attended by up to 6000 people (typically 2000-3000).<p>Esperanto has no official status in any country, but is an elective part of the <!--del_lnk--> curriculum in several state <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">educational</a> systems. There were plans at the beginning of the 20th century to establish <!--del_lnk--> Neutral Moresnet as the world&#39;s first Esperanto state, and the short-lived <!--del_lnk--> artificial island <!--del_lnk--> micronation of <!--del_lnk--> Rose Island used Esperanto as its official language in 1968. In China, there was talk in some circles after the 1911 <!--del_lnk--> Xinhai Revolution about officially replacing <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> with Esperanto as a means to dramatically bring the country into the twentieth century, though this policy proved untenable. In the summer of 1924, the <!--del_lnk--> American Radio Relay League adopted Esperanto as its official <!--del_lnk--> international auxiliary language, and hoped that the language would be used by <!--del_lnk--> radio amateurs in international communications, but actual use of the language for radio communications was negligible. Esperanto is the working language of several <!--del_lnk--> non-profit international organizations such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda</i>, but most others are specifically Esperanto organizations. The largest of these, the <!--del_lnk--> World Esperanto Association, has an official consultative relationship with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and <!--del_lnk--> UNESCO. The U.S. Army has published military phrasebooks in Esperanto, to be used in wargames by the enemy (i.e. non-U.S.) forces &ndash; an ironic contrast to the peace-loving idealism of the inventor Zamenhof.<p><a id="Linguistic_properties" name="Linguistic_properties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Linguistic properties</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Classification" name="Classification"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Classification</span></h3>
      <p>As a <!--del_lnk--> constructed language, Esperanto is not <a href="../../wp/g/Genealogy.htm" title="Genealogy">genealogically</a> related to any <a href="../../wp/e/Ethnic_group.htm" title="Ethnic group">ethnic</a> language. Esperanto can be described as &quot;a language <!--del_lnk--> lexically predominantly <!--del_lnk--> Romanic, <!--del_lnk--> morphologically intensively <!--del_lnk--> agglutinative and to a certain degree <!--del_lnk--> isolating in character&quot;. The <!--del_lnk--> phonology, <!--del_lnk--> grammar, <!--del_lnk--> vocabulary, and <!--del_lnk--> semantics are based on the western <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European languages. The <!--del_lnk--> phonemic inventory is essentially <!--del_lnk--> Slavic, as is much of the semantics, while the <!--del_lnk--> vocabulary derives primarily from the <!--del_lnk--> Romance languages, with a lesser contribution from <!--del_lnk--> Germanic. <!--del_lnk--> Pragmatics and other aspects of the language not specified by Zamenhof&#39;s original documents were influenced by the native languages of early speakers, primarily <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_language.htm" title="Russian language">Russian</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Polish, <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a>, and <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Typologically, Esperanto has <!--del_lnk--> prepositions and a <!--del_lnk--> pragmatic word order that by default is <i><!--del_lnk--> Subject Verb Object</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Adjective Noun</i>. New words are formed through extensive <!--del_lnk--> prefixing and <!--del_lnk--> suffixing.<p><a id="Phonology" name="Phonology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Phonology</span></h3>

      <p>Esperanto has 5 <a href="../../wp/v/Vowel.htm" title="Vowel">vowels</a> and 23 <!--del_lnk--> consonants, of which two are <!--del_lnk--> semivowels. It does not have <!--del_lnk--> tone. <!--del_lnk--> Stress is always on the penultimate vowel, unless a final vowel <i>o</i> is <!--del_lnk--> elided (which in practice occurs most in <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a>). For example, <i>familio</i> (family) is <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[fa.mi.&#x2C8;li.o]</span>, but <i>famili&rsquo;</i> is <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[fa.mi.&#x2C8;li]</span>.<p><a id="Consonants" name="Consonants"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Consonants</span></h4>

This is very regular, so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood. <!--del_lnk--> Compound words are formed with modifier-first, head-final order, i.e. the same way as in English <i>birdsong</i> vs. <i>songbird</i>.<p>The different <!--del_lnk--> parts of speech are marked by their own suffixes: all <!--del_lnk--> common nouns end in <i>-o,</i> all <!--del_lnk--> adjectives in <i>-a,</i> all derived adverbs in <i>-e,</i> and all <!--del_lnk--> verbs end in one of six <!--del_lnk--> tense and <!--del_lnk--> mood suffixes, such as <!--del_lnk--> present tense <i>-as.</i><p><!--del_lnk--> Plural nouns end in <i>-oj</i> (pronounced &quot;oy&quot;), whereas <!--del_lnk--> direct objects end in <i>-on</i>. Plural direct objects end in <i>-ojn</i> (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;coin&quot;). Adjectives <!--del_lnk--> agree with their nouns; their endings are plural <i>-aj</i> (pronounced &quot;eye&quot;), direct-object <i>-an,</i> and plural direct-object <i>-ajn</i> (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;fine&quot;).<table align="center" border="0">

      <p>Word order is comparatively free: adjectives may precede or follow nouns, and subjects, verbs and objects (marked by the suffix <i>-n)</i> can occur in any order. However, the <!--del_lnk--> article <i>la</i> (the) and the <!--del_lnk--> demonstratives almost always come before the noun, and a <!--del_lnk--> preposition <i>must</i> come before it. Similarly, the negative <i>ne</i> (not) and <!--del_lnk--> conjunctions such as <i>kaj</i> (both, and) and <i>ke</i> (that) must precede the <!--del_lnk--> phrase or <!--del_lnk--> clause they introduce. In <!--del_lnk--> copular (A = B) clauses, word order is just as important as it is in English clauses like <i>people are dogs</i> vs. <i>dogs are people.</i><p><a id="Vocabulary" name="Vocabulary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary</span></h3>
      <p>The core vocabulary of Esperanto was defined by <i>Lingvo internacia</i>, published by Zamenhof in 1887. It comprised 900 roots, which could be expanded into the tens of thousands of words with prefixes, suffixes, and compounding. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto <!--del_lnk--> dictionary, <i>Universala Vortaro</i>, with a larger set of roots. However, the rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international forms, and then derive related meanings from these.<p>Since then, many words have been borrowed, primarily but not solely from the western European languages. Not all proposed borrowings catch on, but many do, especially <!--del_lnk--> technical and <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">scientific</a> terms. Terms for everyday use, on the other hand, are more likely to be derived from existing roots&mdash;for example <i>komputilo</i> (a computer) from <i>komputi</i> (to compute) plus the suffix <i>-ilo</i> (tool)&mdash;or to be covered by extending the meanings of existing words (for example <i>muso</i> (a mouse), now also means a computer input device, as in English). There are frequent debates among Esperanto speakers about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether the need can be met by deriving from or extending the meaning of existing words.<p>In addition to the root words and the rules for combining them, a learner of Esperanto must learn some idiomatic compounds that are not entirely straightforward. For example, <i>eldoni</i>, literally &quot;to give out&quot;, is used for &quot;to publish&quot; (a <!--del_lnk--> calque of words in several European languages with the same derivation), and <i>vortaro</i>, literally &quot;a collection of words&quot;, means &quot;a glossary&quot; or &quot;a dictionary&quot;. Such forms are modeled after usage in the ethnic European languages, and speakers of other languages may find them illogical. Fossilized derivations inherited from Esperanto&#39;s source languages may be similarly obscure, such as the opaque connection the root word <i>centralo</i> &quot;power station&quot; has with <i>centro</i> &quot;centre&quot;. Compounds with <i>-um-</i> are overtly arbitrary, and must be learned individually, as <i>-um-</i> has no defined meaning. It turns <i>dekstren</i> &quot;to the right&quot; into <i>dekstrumen</i> &quot;clockwise&quot;, and <i>komuna</i> &quot;common/shared&quot; into <i>komunumo</i> &quot;community&quot;, for example.<p>Nevertheless, there are not nearly as many truly idiomatic or <!--del_lnk--> slang words in Esperanto as in ethnic languages, as these tend to make international communication difficult, working against Esperanto&#39;s main goal.<p>In modern times, conscious attempts have been made by Esperantists to eliminate sexism in the language. One example of this is <!--del_lnk--> Riism, which is one among several propositions to modify the language in a non-sexist manner.<p><a id="Writing_system" name="Writing_system"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Writing system</span></h3>

Esperanto is particularly prevalent in the northern and eastern countries of Europe; in China, <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, Japan, and <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> within Asia; in <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Argentina.htm" title="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> in the Americas; and in <a href="../../wp/t/Togo.htm" title="Togo">Togo</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in Africa.<p>An estimate of the number of Esperanto speakers was made by <!--del_lnk--> Sidney S. Culbert, a <!--del_lnk--> retired <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a> <!--del_lnk--> professor of the <!--del_lnk--> University of Washington and a longtime Esperantist, who tracked down and tested Esperanto speakers in sample areas of dozens of countries over a period of twenty years. Culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak Esperanto at <!--del_lnk--> Foreign Service Level 3, &quot;professionally proficient&quot; (able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation, and to follow speeches, radio broadcasts, etc.). Culbert&#39;s estimate was not made for Esperanto alone, but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of over 1 million speakers, published annually in the <!--del_lnk--> World Almanac and Book of Facts. Culbert&#39;s most detailed account of his methodology is found in a <!--del_lnk--> 1989 letter to David Wolff. Since Culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions, it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results.<p>In the Almanac, his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million, thus the number for Esperanto speakers is shown as 2 million. This latter figure appears in <i><!--del_lnk--> Ethnologue</i>. Assuming that this figure is accurate, that means that about 0.03% of the world&#39;s population speaks the language. This falls short of Zamenhof&#39;s goal of a <!--del_lnk--> universal language, but it represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language. Ethnologue also states that there are 200 to 2000 <!--del_lnk--> native Esperanto speakers (<i>denaskuloj</i>), who have learned the language from birth from their Esperanto-speaking parents (this happens when Esperanto is the family language in an international family or sometimes in a family of devoted Esperantists).<p>Marcus Sikosek has challenged this figure of 1.6 million as exaggerated. Sikosek estimated that even if Esperanto speakers were evenly distributed, assuming one million Esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of <!--del_lnk--> Cologne. Sikosek finds only 30 <!--del_lnk--> fluent speakers in that city, and similarly smaller than expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger-than-average concentration of Esperanto speakers. He also notes that there are a total of about 20,000 members of the various Esperanto organizations (other estimates are higher). Though there are undoubtedly many Esperanto speakers who are not members of any Esperanto organization, he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members. Others think such a <!--del_lnk--> ratio between members of the organized Esperanto movement and speakers of the language is not unlikely.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Finnish <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguist</a> Jouko Lindstedt, an expert on native-born Esperanto speakers, presented the following scheme to show the overall proportions of language capabilities within the Esperanto community:<ul>
       <li><i>1,000 have Esperanto as their native language</i><li><i>10,000 speak it fluently</i><li><i>100,000 can use it actively</i><li><i>1,000,000 understand a large amount passively</i><li><i>10,000,000 have studied it to some extent at some time.</i></ul>
      <p>In the absence of Dr. Culbert&#39;s detailed sampling data, or any other census data, it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty. Few observers, probably, would challenge the following statement from the <!--del_lnk--> website of the <!--del_lnk--> World Esperanto Association:<dl>
       <dd>Numbers of <!--del_lnk--> textbooks sold and membership of local societies put the number of people with some knowledge of the language in the hundreds of thousands and possibly millions. <!--del_lnk--> </dl>

      <p>Esperanto is often used to access an international <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, including a large corpus of original as well as translated <!--del_lnk--> literature. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed <!--del_lnk--> Esperanto magazines. Many Esperanto speakers use the language for free travel throughout the world using the <!--del_lnk--> Pasporta Servo. Others like the idea of having <!--del_lnk--> pen pals in many countries around the world using services like the Esperanto Pen Pal Service. Every year, 1500-3000 Esperanto speakers meet for the <!--del_lnk--> World Congress of Esperanto <i>(Universala Kongreso de Esperanto)</i>.<p>Historically most of the <!--del_lnk--> music published in Esperanto has been in various folk traditions; in recent decades more rock and other modern genres have appeared.<p>To some extent there are also shared <!--del_lnk--> traditions, like the <!--del_lnk--> Zamenhof Day, and shared <!--del_lnk--> behaviour patterns, like avoiding the usage of one&#39;s national language at Esperanto meetings unless there is good reason for its use.<p>Two full-length <!--del_lnk--> feature films have been produced with <!--del_lnk--> dialogue entirely in Esperanto, namely <i><!--del_lnk--> Angoroj</i> in 1964 and <i><!--del_lnk--> Incubus</i> starring <!--del_lnk--> William Shatner in 1965. Other amateur productions have been made, such as a dramatisation of the novel <i>Gerda Malaperis</i> (Gerda Has Disappeared). A number of &quot;mainstream&quot; films in national languages have used Esperanto in some way, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Gattaca</i>.<p>Esperanto is frequently criticized for &quot;having no culture&quot;. Proponents observe that Esperanto is culturally neutral by design, as it was intended to be a facilitator between cultures, not to be the carrier of any one culture.

      <p>Nearly from the beginning Esperanto was used for scientific papers; the <i>Fundamenta Krestomatio</i> of 1903 contains a section <i>El la vivo kaj sciencoj</i> (from life and sciences).

In articles on <!--del_lnk--> interlinguistics the use of Esperanto is not uncommon.<p>Esperanto is the first language for teaching and administration of the <!--del_lnk--> International Academy of Sciences San Marino, which is sometimes called an &quot;Esperanto University&quot;, although it does not teach the language, but <i>in</i> the language. It is not to be confused with the <!--del_lnk--> Akademio de Esperanto (Academy of Esperanto).<p><a id="Goals_of_the_Esperanto_movement" name="Goals_of_the_Esperanto_movement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Goals of the Esperanto movement</span></h3>
      <p>Zamenhof&#39;s intention was to create an easy-to-learn language to foster international understanding. It was to serve as an international auxiliary language, that is, as a universal second language, not to replace ethnic languages. This goal was widely shared among Esperanto speakers in the early decades of the movement. Later, Esperanto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves, even if Esperanto is never adopted by the United Nations or other international organizations.<p>Those Esperanto speakers who want to see Esperanto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called <i>finvenkistoj</i>, from <i>fina venko</i>, meaning &quot;final victory&quot;. Those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called <i>ra&#x16D;mistoj</i>, from <!--del_lnk--> Rauma, <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>, where a declaration on the near-term unlikelihood of the &quot;fina venko&quot; and the value of Esperanto culture was made at the International Youth Congress in 1980. These categories are, however, not mutually exclusive. (<i>See <!--del_lnk--> Finvenkismo</i>)<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Prague Manifesto (1996) presents the views of the mainstream of the Esperanto movement and of its main organisation, the World Esperanto Association (<!--del_lnk--> UEA).<p><a id="Symbols_and_flags" name="Symbols_and_flags"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Symbols and flags</span></h3>
      <p>In 1893, C. Rjabinis and P. Deullin designed and manufactured a lapel pin for Esperantists to identify each other. The design was a circular pin with a white background and a five pointed green star. The theme of the design was the hope of the five continents being united by a common language.<p>The earliest flag, and the one most commonly used today, features a green five-pointed star against a white canton, upon a field of green. In 1905, delegates to the first conference of Esperantists at Boulogne-sur-Mer, unanimously approved <!--del_lnk-->  a version, differing from the modern only by the superimposition of an &quot;E&quot; over the green star. Other variants <!--del_lnk-->  include that for Christian Esperantists, with a white Christian cross superimposed upon the green star, and that for Leftists, with the colour of the field changed from green to red.<p>In 1997, a second flag design was chosen in a contest by the UEA for the first centennial of the language. It featured a white background with two stylised curved &quot;E&quot;s facing each other. Dubbed the &quot;jubilea simbolo&quot; (jubilee symbol) <!--del_lnk--> , it attracted criticism from some Esperantists, who dubbed it &quot;melono&quot; (melon) because of the design&#39;s eliptical shape. It later fell into disuse, and the traditional flag, known as &quot;verda stelo&quot; (green star), is still in use today. <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Esperanto_and_education" name="Esperanto_and_education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Esperanto and education</span></h2>
      <p>Relatively few <!--del_lnk--> schools teach Esperanto officially outside of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, <a href="../../wp/h/Hungary.htm" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bulgaria.htm" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>; the majority of Esperanto speakers continue to learn the language through self-directed study or correspondence courses. Several Esperanto paper correspondence courses were early on adapted to <!--del_lnk--> e-mail and taught by corps of volunteer instructors. In more recent years, teaching websites like <i><!--del_lnk--> lernu!</i> have become popular. Various educators have estimated that Esperanto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages.<!--del_lnk-->  Some argue, however, that this is only true for native speakers of Western European languages.<!--del_lnk--> <p><!--del_lnk--> Claude Piron, a psychologist formerly at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Geneva and Chinese-English-Russian-Spanish translator for the United Nations, argued that it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many ethnic languages (see <!--del_lnk--> Sapir-Whorf hypothesis for an explanation on this theory). &quot;Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes [and] differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns. [...] The same <!--del_lnk--> neuropsychological law [&mdash; called by] <!--del_lnk--> Jean Piaget <i>generalizing assimilation</i> &mdash; applies to word formation as well as to grammar.&quot;<p>Several <!--del_lnk--> research <!--del_lnk--> studies demonstrate that studying Esperanto before another <!--del_lnk--> foreign language speeds and improves <!--del_lnk--> learning the other language. This is presumably because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one&#39;s first, while the use of a grammatically simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like Esperanto lessens the first-language learning hurdle. In one study, a group of European <!--del_lnk--> high school students studied Esperanto for one <!--del_lnk--> year, then French for three years, and ended up with a significantly better command of French than a control group, who studied French for all four years. Similar results were found when the second language was <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, or when the course of study was reduced to two years, of which six <!--del_lnk--> months was spent learning Esperanto. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> Propaedeutic value of Esperanto for other relevant studies.</i><p><a id="Esperanto_and_religion" name="Esperanto_and_religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Esperanto and religion</span></h2>

      <p>Common criticisms of the language are that its vocabulary and grammar are too European; that its vocabulary, accented letters, and grammar are not Western European enough (a critique addressed by <!--del_lnk--> Ido, <!--del_lnk--> Novial and <!--del_lnk--> Interlingua); that it is <!--del_lnk--> sexist, looks and sounds artificial, or has failed to meet the expectation that all people would one day use it as a second language.<p>Finally, proponents are often seen as exaggerating the success of Esperanto.

      <p>Esperanto has been used in a number of films and novels. Typically, this is done either to add the exoticness of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity, or to avoid going to the trouble of inventing a new language. Filmmaker <a href="../../wp/c/Charlie_Chaplin.htm" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> used Esperanto for signage on storefronts and buildings in his 1940 classic <i><!--del_lnk--> The Great Dictator</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> science fiction, Esperanto is often used to represent a future in which there is a more universally spoken language than exists today. Examples of this include the <i><!--del_lnk--> Riverworld</i> series by <!--del_lnk--> Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer, the UK sci-fi <!--del_lnk--> sitcom <i><!--del_lnk--> Red Dwarf</i>, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Stainless Steel Rat</i> series by <!--del_lnk--> Harry Harrison, and the 1997 sci-fi drama <i><!--del_lnk--> Gattaca</i>. It is also seen and heard in the 2004 <a href="../../wp/v/Vampire.htm" title="Vampire">vampire</a> film <i><!--del_lnk--> Blade Trinity</i>.<p>There are two instances of feature films being entirely performed in Esperanto. <i><!--del_lnk--> Angoroj</i>, (Esperanto for &quot;Agonies&quot;) 1964, was the first feature film to be produced entirely in Esperanto and <i><!--del_lnk--> Incubus</i> (with English and French subtitles), a 1965 black and white horror film, directed by <!--del_lnk--> Leslie Stevens and starring a pre- <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> <!--del_lnk--> William Shatner. The earliest film to incorporate Esperanto was the thriller &quot;State Secret&quot; <!--del_lnk--> 1950, with <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who starred as an American surgeon contacted by the authorities of Vosnia, an Eastern European dictatorship, to perform a rare operation on their leader. The language spoken in &quot;Vosnia&quot; is Esperanto. The earliest film (not of feature length, however) to utilize the language was titled Anta&#x16D;en! (Onwards!), a silent Esperanto publicity film before <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>.<p>More rarely, it is used jokingly, referred to as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> geek language&quot;, such as the usage seen on occasion in the animated series <i><!--del_lnk--> Danny Phantom</i>, where the only characters who speak it are either self-described &quot;geeks&quot;, or a particular ghost (who is apparently more fluent in the language than the human characters, as evidenced by the difficulty Tucker Foley had in translating said ghost&#39;s comments into English).<p>The name of the beverage <!--del_lnk--> Yakult is derived from <i>jahurto</i>, an archaic form of the Esperanto for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> yoghurt&quot; (the modern word is <i>jogurto</i>).<p>Esperanto has also been cited as a possible inspiration for <!--del_lnk--> George Orwell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Newspeak. Orwell had been exposed to Esperanto in <!--del_lnk--> 1927 when living in Paris with his aunt Nellie Limouzin, who was then living with Eug&egrave;ne Lanti, a prominent Esperantist. Esperanto was the language of the house, and Orwell, who had come to Paris in part to improve his French, was obliged to find other lodging.<p>The musician credits for <i><!--del_lnk--> Blood and Chocolate</i>, a 1986 album by <!--del_lnk--> Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions, were written in Esperanto.<p>Composer David Gaines&#39; (b. 1961) Symphony No. 1 is subtitled &quot;Esperanto&quot;, and features a mezzo-soprano soloist singing in Esperanto. It has been recorded by the Moravian Philharmonic.<p>The opening theme to <!--del_lnk--> Final Fantasy XI, &quot;FFXI Opening Theme&quot; ~Legend -The Crystal Theme, Memory of the People, Memoro de la &#x15C;tono, Memory of the Wind~ was sung in Esperanto.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto&quot;</div>
