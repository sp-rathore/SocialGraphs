      <p>Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by <a href="../../wp/p/Psychology.htm" title="Psychology">psychology</a>, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including <!--del_lnk--> instructional design, <!--del_lnk--> educational technology, curriculum development, <!--del_lnk--> organizational learning, <!--del_lnk--> special education and <!--del_lnk--> classroom management. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to <!--del_lnk--> cognitive science and the <!--del_lnk--> learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.<p>

      <p>To understand the characteristics of learners in <a href="../../wp/c/Child.htm" title="Child">childhood</a>, <!--del_lnk--> adolescence, <!--del_lnk--> adulthood, and <!--del_lnk--> old age, educational psychology develops and applies theories of human <!--del_lnk--> development. Often cast as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities (<!--del_lnk--> cognition), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.<p>For example, educational psychologists have researched the instructional applicability of <!--del_lnk--> Jean Piaget&#39;s theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget&#39;s most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.<p>Piaget proposed a developmental theory of <!--del_lnk--> moral reasoning in which children progress from a naive understanding of <!--del_lnk--> morality based on behaviour and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget&#39;s views of moral development were elaborated by <!--del_lnk--> Kohlberg into a <a href="../../wp/k/Kohlberg%2527s_stages_of_moral_development.htm" title="Kohlberg&#39;s stages of moral development">stage theory of moral development</a>. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behaviour. For example, other factors such as modeling (as described by the <!--del_lnk--> social cognitive theory of morality) are required to explain <!--del_lnk--> bullying.<p>Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of epistemological beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people&#39;s belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.<p><a id="Individual_differences_and_disabilities" name="Individual_differences_and_disabilities"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Individual differences and disabilities</span></h2>

      <p>Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in <!--del_lnk--> intelligence, <!--del_lnk--> creativity, <!--del_lnk--> cognitive style, <!--del_lnk--> motivation, and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are <a href="../../wp/a/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.htm" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD), <!--del_lnk--> learning disability, <!--del_lnk--> dyslexia, and <!--del_lnk--> speech disorder. Less common disabilities include <!--del_lnk--> mental retardation, <!--del_lnk--> hearing impairment, <!--del_lnk--> cerebral palsy, <!--del_lnk--> epilepsy, and <!--del_lnk--> blindness.<p>Although theories of intelligence have been discussed by philosophers since <a href="../../wp/p/Plato.htm" title="Plato">Plato</a>, intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether intelligence can be characterized by a single, scalar <!--del_lnk--> factor (<!--del_lnk--> Spearman&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> general intelligence), multiple factors (as in <!--del_lnk--> Sternberg&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> triarchic theory of intelligence and <!--del_lnk--> Gardner&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> theory of multiple intelligences), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the <!--del_lnk--> Stanford-Binet IQ test and the <!--del_lnk--> WISC are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as <!--del_lnk--> gifted are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as <!--del_lnk--> phonological awareness.<p><a id="Learning_and_cognition" name="Learning_and_cognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Learning and cognition</span></h2>
      <p>Two fundamental assumptions that underlie formal education systems are that students (a) retain knowledge and skills they acquire in school, and (b) can apply them in situations outside the classroom. But are these assumptions accurate? Research has found that, even when students report not using the knowledge acquired in school, a considerable portion is retained for many years and long term retention is strongly dependent on the initial level of mastery. One study found that university students who took a child development course and attained high grades showed, when tested 10 years later, average retention scores of about 30%, whereas those who obtained moderate or lower grades showed average retention scores of about 20%. There is much less consensus on the crucial question of how much knowledge acquired in school <!--del_lnk--> transfers to tasks encountered outside formal educational settings, and how such transfer occurs. Some psychologists claim that research evidence for this type of <i>far transfer</i> is scarce,  while others claim there is abundant evidence of far transfer in specific domains. Several perspectives have been established within which the theories of learning used in educational psychology are formed and contested. These include <!--del_lnk--> Behaviorism, <!--del_lnk--> Cognitivism, <!--del_lnk--> Social Cognitivism, and <!--del_lnk--> Constructivism. This section summarizes how educational psychology has researched and applied theories within each of these perspectives.<p><a id="Behavioral_perspective" name="Behavioral_perspective"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Behavioural perspective</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Applied behaviour analysis, a set of techniques based on the behavioural principles of <!--del_lnk--> operant conditioning, is effective in a range of educational settings. For example, teachers can improve student behaviour by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangable for sundry items. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behaviour, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of <!--del_lnk--> self-determination theory, who claim that praise and other rewards undermine <!--del_lnk--> intrinsic motivation. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behaviour. But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation.<p><a id="Cognitive_perspective" name="Cognitive_perspective"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cognitive perspective</span></h3>
      <p>Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioural perspective perhaps because it flexibly admits causally related mental constructs such as <!--del_lnk--> traits, <!--del_lnk--> beliefs, <!--del_lnk--> memories, <!--del_lnk--> motivations and <!--del_lnk--> emotions. Cognitive theories posit memory structures that are thought to determine how information is <!--del_lnk--> perceived, <!--del_lnk--> processed, stored, <!--del_lnk--> retrieved and <!--del_lnk--> forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Paivio&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and <!--del_lnk--> cognitive load theory to explain how people learn from <!--del_lnk--> multimedia presentations.<div class="thumb tright">

      </div>
      <p>The spaced learning effect, a cognitive phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within education.  For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure). Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using <!--del_lnk--> mnemonics for immediate and delayed retention of information.<p><!--del_lnk--> Problem solving, regarded by many cognitive psychologists as fundamental to learning, is an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a <!--del_lnk--> schema retrieved from long term memory. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student&#39;s attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema. The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of <!--del_lnk--> analogical thinking to problem solving.<p><a id="Social_cognitive_perspective" name="Social_cognitive_perspective"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social cognitive perspective</span></h3>
      <p>Social cognitive theory is a highly influential fusion of behavioural, cognitive and social elements that was initially developed by educational psychologist <!--del_lnk--> Albert Bandura. In its earlier, neo-behavioural incarnation called <i>social learning theory</i>, Bandura emphasized the process of <!--del_lnk--> observational learning in which a learner&#39;s behavior changes as a result of observing others&#39; behavior and its consequences. The theory identified several factors that determine whether observing a model will affect behavioural or cognitive change. These factors include the learner&#39;s developmental status, the perceived prestige and competence of the model, the consequences received by the model, the relevance of the model&#39;s behaviors and consequences to the learner&#39;s goals, and the learner&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> self-efficacy. The concept of self-efficacy, which played an important role in later developments of the theory, refers to the learner&#39;s belief in his or her ability to perform the modeled behaviour.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> experiment by Schunk and Hanson, that studied grade 2 students who had previously experienced difficulty in learning <!--del_lnk--> subtraction, illustrates the type of research stimulated by social learning theory. One group of students observed a subtraction demonstration by a teacher and then participated in an instructional program on subtraction. A second group observed other grade 2 students performing the same subtraction procedures and then participated in the same instructional program. The students who observed peer models scored higher on a subtraction post-test and also reported greater confidence in their subtraction ability. The results were interpreted as supporting the <!--del_lnk--> hypothesis that perceived similarity of the model to the learner increases self-efficacy, leading to more effective learning of modeled behaviour. It is supposed that peer modeling is particularly effective for students who have low self-efficacy.<p>Over the last decade, much research activity in educational psychology has focused on developing theories of <!--del_lnk--> self-regulated learning (SRL) and <!--del_lnk--> metacognition. These theories work from the central premise that effective learners are active agents who construct knowledge by setting goals, analysing tasks, planning strategies and monitoring their understanding. Research has indicated that learners&#39; who are better at goal setting and self-monitoring tend to have greater intrinsic task interest and <!--del_lnk--> self-efficacy; and that teaching learning strategies can increase academic achievement.<p><a id="Constructivist_perspective" name="Constructivist_perspective"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Constructivist perspective</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Constructivism refers to a category of learning theories in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior knowledge of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with Piaget&#39;s learning theory, from social constructivism. A dominant influence on the latter type is <!--del_lnk--> Lev Vygotsky&#39;s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky&#39;s theory, <!--del_lnk--> Jerome Bruner and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of <!--del_lnk--> instructional scaffolding, in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.<p>Vygotsky&#39;s version of <!--del_lnk--> constructivist theory has led to the view that behaviour, skills, attitudes and beliefs are inherently <!--del_lnk--> situated, that is, bound to a specific sociocultural setting. According to this view, the learner is enculturated through social interactions within a <!--del_lnk--> community of practice. The social constructivist view of learning has spawned approaches to teaching and learning such as <!--del_lnk--> cognitive apprenticeship, in which the tacit components of a complex skill are made explicit through conversational interactions occurring between expert and novice in the setting in which the skill is embedded.<p><a id="Motivation" name="Motivation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Motivation</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Motivation is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behaviour. Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the <!--del_lnk--> volition or <!--del_lnk--> will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and <!--del_lnk--> intrinsic motivation, the personally held <!--del_lnk--> goals that guide their behaviour, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure.<p>A form of <!--del_lnk--> attribution theory developed by <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Weiner describes how students&#39; beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of <!--del_lnk--> shame and <!--del_lnk--> embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of <!--del_lnk--> guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.<p>Motivational theories also explain how <!--del_lnk--> learners&#39; goals affect the way that they engage with academic tasks. Those who have <i>mastery goals</i> strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have <i>performance approach goals</i> strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have <i>performance avoidance</i> goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, <!--del_lnk--> creativity and <!--del_lnk--> intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor <!--del_lnk--> concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and <!--del_lnk--> test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.<p><a id="Research_methodology" name="Research_methodology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Research methodology</span></h2>
      <p>The research methods used in educational psychology tend to be drawn from psychology and other social sciences. There is also a history of significant methodological innovation by educational psychologists, and psychologists investigating educational problems. Research methods address problems in both <!--del_lnk--> research design and <!--del_lnk--> data analysis. Research design informs the planning of experiments and observational studies to ensure that their results have <!--del_lnk--> internal, <!--del_lnk--> external and <!--del_lnk--> ecological validity. Data analysis encompasses methods for processing both quantitive (numerical) and qualitative (non-numerical) research data. Although, historically, the use of quantitative methods was often considered an essential mark of scholarship, modern educational psychology research uses both <!--del_lnk--> quantitative and <!--del_lnk--> qualitative methods.<p><a id="Quantitative_methods" name="Quantitative_methods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Quantitative methods</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>Perhaps first among the important methodological innovations of educational psychology was the development and application of <!--del_lnk--> factor analysis by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Spearman. Factor analysis is mentioned here as one example of the many <!--del_lnk--> multivariate statistical methods used by educational psychologists. Factor analysis is used to summarize relationships among a large set of variables or test questions, develop theories about mental constructs such as self-efficacy or anxiety, and assess the reliability and validity of test scores. Over one hundred years after its introduction by Spearman, factor analysis has become a research staple figuring prominently in educational psychology journals.<p>Because educational <!--del_lnk--> assessment is fundamental to most quantitative research in the field, educational psychologists have made significant contributions to the field of <!--del_lnk--> psychometrics. For example, <!--del_lnk--> alpha, the widely used measure of test <!--del_lnk--> reliability was developed by educational psychologist <!--del_lnk--> Lee Cronbach. The reliability of assessments are routinely reported in quantitative educational research. Although, originally, educational measurement methods were built on <!--del_lnk--> classical test theory, <!--del_lnk--> item response theory and <!--del_lnk--> Rasch models are now used extensively in educational measurement worldwide. These models afford advantages over classical test theory, including the capacity to produce standard errors of measurement for each score or pattern of scores on assessments and the capacity to handle missing responses.<p><!--del_lnk--> Meta-analysis, the combination of individual research results to produce a quantitative <!--del_lnk--> literature review, is another methodological innovation with a close association to educational psychology. In a meta-analysis, <!--del_lnk--> effect sizes that represent, for example, the differences between treatment groups in a set of similar experiments, are averaged to obtain a single aggregate value representing the best <!--del_lnk--> estimate of the effect of treatment. Several decades after <!--del_lnk--> Pearson&#39;s work with early versions of meta-analysis, <!--del_lnk--> Glass published the first application of modern meta-analytic techniques and triggered their broad application across the social and biomedical sciences. Today, meta-analysis is among the most common types of literature review found in educational psychology research.<p><a id="Qualitative_methods" name="Qualitative_methods"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Qualitative methods</span></h3>
      <p>Qualitative methods are used in educational studies whose purpose is to describe events, processes and situations of theoretical significance. The qualitative methods used in educational psychology often derive from <!--del_lnk--> psycholinguistics, <a href="../../wp/a/Anthropology.htm" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> or <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociology</a>. For example, the anthropological method of <!--del_lnk--> ethnography has been used to describe teaching and learning in classrooms. In studies of this type, the researcher may gather detailed field notes as a <!--del_lnk--> participant observer or passive observer. Later, the notes and other data may be categorized and interpreted by methods such as <!--del_lnk--> grounded theory. <!--del_lnk--> Triangulation, the practice of cross-checking findings with multiple data sources, is highly valued in qualitative research.<p><!--del_lnk--> Case studies are forms of qualitative research focusing on a single person, organization, event, or other entity. In one case study, researchers conducted a 150-minute, semi-structured <!--del_lnk--> interview with a 20-year old woman who had a history of <!--del_lnk--> suicidal thinking between the ages of 14 to 18. They analyzed an audio-recording of the interview to understand the roles of cognitive development, identity formation and <!--del_lnk--> social attachment in ending her suicidal thinking.<p>Qualitative analysis is most often applied to verbal data from sources such as conversations, interviews, <!--del_lnk--> focus groups, and personal journals. Qualitative methods are thus, typically, approaches to gathering, processing and reporting verbal data. One of the most commonly used methods for qualitative research in educational psychology is <!--del_lnk--> protocol analysis. In this method the research participant is asked to <!--del_lnk--> <i>think aloud</i> while performing a task, such as solving a math problem. In protocol analysis the verbal data is thought to indicate which information the subject is attending to, but is explicitly not interpreted as an explanation or justification for behaviour. In contrast, the method of verbal analysis does admit learners&#39; explanations as a way to reveal their <!--del_lnk--> mental model or <!--del_lnk--> misconceptions (e.g., of the laws of motion). The most fundamental operations in both protocol and verbal analysis are segmenting (isolating) and categorizing sections of verbal data. <!--del_lnk--> Conversation analysis and <!--del_lnk--> discourse analysis, psycholinguistic methods that focus more specifically on the structure of conversational interchange (e.g., between a teacher and student), have been used to assess the process of conceptual change in science learning. Qualitative methods are also used to analyse information in a variety of media, such as students&#39; drawings and <!--del_lnk--> concept maps, video-recorded interactions, and computer log records.<p><a id="Applications_in_instructional_design_and_technology" name="Applications_in_instructional_design_and_technology"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Applications in instructional design and technology</span></h2>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Instructional design, the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a <!--del_lnk--> taxonomy of educational objectives created by <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched <!--del_lnk--> mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. <!--del_lnk--> Gagn&eacute;, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of <!--del_lnk--> task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relations.<ul>

      <p>Educational psychology cannot claim priority in the systematic analysis of educational processes. <!--del_lnk--> Philosophers of education such as <!--del_lnk--> Democritus, <!--del_lnk--> Quintilian, <!--del_lnk--> Vives and <!--del_lnk--> Comenius, had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the <!--del_lnk--> beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s. Instead, aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the <!--del_lnk--> scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. In his famous series of lectures <i>Talks to Teachers on Psychology</i>, published in 1899 and now regarded as the first educational psychology textbook, the pioneering American psychologist <!--del_lnk--> William James commented that:<blockquote>
       <p>Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality.</blockquote>
      <p>According to <!--del_lnk--> Berliner educational psychology theorists&#39; attitude to the world of educational practice has shifted from initial interest to disdain, and eventually to respect.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Charles Hubbard Judd</ul>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1912, Thorndike, who developed the theory of <!--del_lnk--> instrumental conditioning, presaged later work on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:<blockquote>
       <p>If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.</blockquote>

      <p>A person may be considered an educational psychologist if he or she has completed a graduate <!--del_lnk--> degree in educational psychology or a closely related field. Universities establish educational psychology graduate programs in either psychology departments or, more commonly, faculties of education. Psychologists who work in a k-12 school setting are usually trained at either the <!--del_lnk--> masters or doctoral (<!--del_lnk--> PhD or <!--del_lnk--> EdD) level. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioural intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention.<p><a id="Employment_outlook" name="Employment_outlook"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Employment outlook</span></h3>
      <p>Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18-26%. One in four psychologist are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the <!--del_lnk--> median <!--del_lnk--> salary for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is $58,360 as of May 2004.<p>In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North American</a> educational psychology has risen dramatically. The percentage of female authors of peer-reviewed journal articles doubled from 1976 (24%) to 1995 (51%), and has since remained constant. Female membership on educational psychology journal editorial boards increased from 17% in 1976 to 47% in 2004. Over the same period, the proportion of chief editor positions held by women increased from 22% to 70%.<p><a id="Research_journals" name="Research_journals"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Research journals</span></h2>
