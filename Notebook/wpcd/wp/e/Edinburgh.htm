       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The origin of the city&#39;s name is understood to come from the <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic <i>Din Eidyn</i> (Fort of Eidyn) from the time when it was a <!--del_lnk--> Gododdin <!--del_lnk--> hillfort.<p>In the 1st century the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> recorded the <!--del_lnk--> Votadini as a <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic tribe in the area, and about 600 the poem <!--del_lnk--> Y Gododdin, using the Brythonic form of that name, describes warriors feasting &quot;in Eidin&#39;s great hall&quot;.<p>After it was besieged by the <!--del_lnk--> Bernician <!--del_lnk--> Angles the name changed to <i>Edin-burh</i>, which some have argued derives from the Anglo-Saxon for &quot;Edwin&#39;s fort&quot;, possibly derived from the 7th century king <a href="../../wp/e/Edwin_of_Northumbria.htm" title="Edwin of Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>. However, since the name apparently predates King Edwin, this is highly unlikely. The <i><!--del_lnk--> burgh</i> element means &quot;fortress&quot; or &quot;group of buildings&quot;, i.e. a town or city and is akin to the <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> <i>burg</i>, <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>parcus</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>pyrgos</i> etc.<p>The first evidence of the existence of the town as a separate entity from the fort lies in an early 12th century <!--del_lnk--> royal charter, generally thought to date from 1124, by <!--del_lnk--> King David I granting land to the <!--del_lnk--> Church of the Holy Rood of Edinburgh. This suggests that the town came into official existence between 1018 (when <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_II_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm II of Scotland">King Malcolm II</a> secured the <!--del_lnk--> Lothians from the Northumbrians) and 1124.<p>The charter refers to the recipients (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">in Latin</a>) as &quot;Ecclisie Sancte Crucis <i>Edwin</i>esburgensi&quot;. This could mean that those who drafted the charter believed Edwin to be the original source of the name and decided to derive the Latinisation from what they believed to be the ancient name. It could also mean that at some point in the preceding 600 years the name had altered to include a <i>w</i>. If the latter scenario was the case then it was soon to change; by the 1170s <!--del_lnk--> King William the Lion was using the name &quot;<i>Edenesburch</i>&quot; in a charter (again in Latin) confirming the 1124 grant of David I.<p>Documents from the 14th century show the name to have settled into its current form; although other spellings (&quot;Edynburgh&quot; and &quot;Edynburghe&quot;) appear, these are simply spelling variants of the current name.<p><a id="Other_names" name="Other_names"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other names</span></h2>

      <p>The city is affectionately nicknamed <b>Auld Reekie</b>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> for <i>Old Smoky</i>. This is because when the only fuels available were <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">coal</a> and wood, all the chimneys would spew lots of smoke into the air. Auld Reekie also referred to the less than sanitary living conditions that would lead to a strong odour covering the city. &quot;Reek&quot; means &quot;smell&quot; in lowland Scots.<p>Some have called Edinburgh the <b>Athens of the North</b> for a variety of reasons. The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the Old Town of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athenian</a> <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a <!--del_lnk--> port several miles away (respectively <!--del_lnk--> Leith and <!--del_lnk--> Piraeus). Although this arrangement is common in <!--del_lnk--> Southern Europe, it is rare in <!--del_lnk--> Northern Europe. The 18th century intellectual life, referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Enlightenment, was a key influence in gaining the name. Such beacons as <a href="../../wp/d/David_Hume.htm" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Smith.htm" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the <!--del_lnk--> Union, some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar civilising influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later <a href="../../wp/n/Neoclassicism.htm" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> architecture, particularly that of <!--del_lnk--> William Henry Playfair, and the <!--del_lnk--> National Monument. <!--del_lnk--> Tom Stoppard&#39;s character Archie, of <!--del_lnk--> Jumpers, has said, facetiously, that the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Reykjav&iacute;k of the South&quot; would be more appropriate!<p>Edinburgh has also been known as <b>Dunedin</b>, deriving from the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic, <b>D&ugrave;n &Egrave;ideann</b>. <!--del_lnk--> Dunedin, New Zealand, was originally called &quot;New Edinburgh&quot; and is still nicknamed the &quot;Edinburgh of the South&quot;.<p>The Scots poets <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Fergusson sometimes used the city&#39;s Latin name, <b>Edina</b>, in their work. <!--del_lnk--> Ben Johnson described it as <b>Britaine&#39;s other eye</b>, and <!--del_lnk--> Sir Walter Scott referred to the city as <b>yon Empress of the North</b>.<p>Some Scots-speakers refer to the city informally as <b>Edinburrie</b> or <b>Embra</b>.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Some 320 million years ago, the cores of several <!--del_lnk--> volcanic vents in the area cooled and solidified to form tough <!--del_lnk--> basalt <!--del_lnk--> volcanic plugs, then, during the <!--del_lnk--> last ice age, <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciers</a> eroded the area, exposing the plug as a rocky <!--del_lnk--> crag to the west, and leaving a tail of material swept to the east. At the same time, the glacier gouged out ground to each side, leaving the ravine of the <!--del_lnk--> Grassmarket and <!--del_lnk--> Cowgate to the south, and the swampy valley of the <!--del_lnk--> Nor Loch to the north. The resulting <!--del_lnk--> crag and tail landform now forms the <!--del_lnk--> Castle Rock, and the narrow steep sided ridge which the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mile follows. The ridge declines in height over a mile, meeting general ground level at <!--del_lnk--> Holyrood.<p>This formed a natural <!--del_lnk--> fortress, and recent excavations at the castle found material dating back to the <!--del_lnk--> Late Bronze Age, as long ago as 850 BCE.<p>The map co-ordinates of the centre of Edinburgh are approximately <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 55&deg;57&prime;N 3&deg;11&prime;W</span>.<p><a id="Parts_of_the_city" name="Parts_of_the_city"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Parts of the city</span></h2>

      <p>The historic centre of Edinburgh is divided into two by the broad green swath of <!--del_lnk--> Princes Street Gardens. To the south the view is dominated by <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Castle, perched atop the extinct volcanic crag, and the long sweep of the <!--del_lnk--> Old Town trailing after it along the ridge. To the north lies <!--del_lnk--> Princes Street and the <!--del_lnk--> New Town. The gardens were begun in 1816 on <a href="../../wp/b/Bog.htm" title="Bog">bogland</a> which had once been the Nor Loch.<p>To the immediate west of the castle lies the financial district, housing insurance and banking buildings. Probably the most noticeable building here is the circular sandstone building that is the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh International Conference Centre.<p><a id="Old_Town" name="Old_Town"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Old Town</span></h3>

      <p>The Old Town has preserved its <!--del_lnk--> medieval plan and many <!--del_lnk--> Reformation-era buildings. One end is closed by the castle and the main artery, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mile, leads away from it; minor streets (called <i>closes</i> or <i>wynds</i>) lead downhill on either side of the main spine in a herringbone pattern. Large squares mark the location of markets or surround major public buildings such as <!--del_lnk--> St Giles Cathedral and the <!--del_lnk--> Law Courts. Other notable places of interest nearby include the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Museum of Scotland, <!--del_lnk--> Surgeons&#39; Hall, the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh, and numerous underground streets and vaults, relics of previous phases of construction. The street layout, typical of the old quarters of many northern European cities, is made especially picturesque in Edinburgh, where the castle perches on top of a rocky crag, the remnants of a dormant volcano, and the main street runs down the crest of a ridge from it.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Due to the space restrictions imposed by the narrowness of the &quot;tail&quot; the Old Town became home to some of the earliest &quot;high rise&quot; residential buildings. Multi-storey dwellings were the norm from the 1500s onwards.<p><a id="New_Town" name="New_Town"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">New Town</span></h3>

      <p>The New Town was an 18th century solution to the problem of an increasingly crowded Old Town. The city had remained incredibly compact, confined to the ridge running down from the castle. In 1766 a competition to design the New Town was won by <!--del_lnk--> James Craig, a 22-year-old architect. The plan that was built created a rigid, ordered grid, which fitted well with <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">enlightenment</a> ideas of rationality. The principal street was to be <!--del_lnk--> George Street, which follows the natural ridge to the north of the Old Town. Either side of it are the other main streets of <!--del_lnk--> Princes Street and <!--del_lnk--> Queen Street. Princes Street has since become the main shopping street in Edinburgh, and few <!--del_lnk--> Georgian buildings survive on it. Linking these streets were a series of perpendicular streets. At the east and west ends are <!--del_lnk--> St. Andrew&#39;s Square and <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte Square respectively. The latter was designed by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Adam and is often considered one of the finest Georgian squares in the world. <!--del_lnk--> Bute House, the official residence of the <!--del_lnk--> First Minister of Scotland, is on the north side of Charlotte Square.<p>Sitting in the <!--del_lnk--> glen between the Old and New Towns was the Nor&#39; Loch, which had been both the city&#39;s water supply and place for dumping <!--del_lnk--> sewage. By the 1820s it was drained. Some plans show that a <a href="../../wp/c/Canal.htm" title="Canal">canal</a> was intended, but the <!--del_lnk--> Princes Street Gardens were created instead. Excess soil from the construction of the buildings was dumped into the <a href="../../wp/l/Loch.htm" title="Loch">loch</a>, creating what is now <!--del_lnk--> The Mound. In the mid-19th century the <!--del_lnk--> National Gallery of Scotland and <!--del_lnk--> Royal Scottish Academy Building were built on The Mound, and tunnels to <!--del_lnk--> Waverley Station driven through it.<p>The New Town was so successful that it was extended greatly. The grid pattern was not maintained, but rather a more picturesque layout was created. Today the New Town is considered by many to be one of the finest examples of <!--del_lnk--> Georgian architecture and planning in the world.<p><a id="Leith" name="Leith"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Leith</span></h3>

      <p>Leith is the port of Edinburgh. It still retains a separate identity from Edinburgh, and it was a matter of great resentment when, in 1920, the <!--del_lnk--> burgh of Leith was merged into the <!--del_lnk--> county of Edinburgh. Even today the parliamentary seat is known as &#39;Edinburgh North <i>and</i> Leith&#39;. With the redevelopment of Leith, Edinburgh has gained the business of a number of <!--del_lnk--> cruise liner companies who now provide cruises to <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.

      <p>The varied <!--del_lnk--> terrain of the city includes several summits which command sweeping views over Edinburgh.<p>To the southeast of central Edinburgh stands the eminence known as <!--del_lnk--> Arthur&#39;s Seat, overlooking <!--del_lnk--> Holyroodhouse and the Old Town beside it. The crag is a collection of side vents of the main volcano on which Edinburgh is built. The volcano slipped and tipped sideways, leaving these vents as the highest points for miles around. Arthur&#39;s Seat is now part of <!--del_lnk--> Holyrood Park, originally owned by the monarch and part of the grounds of the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of Holyroodhouse. It contains the United Kingdom&#39;s largest concentration of <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geological</a> <!--del_lnk--> SSSIs, as well as providing the people of Edinburgh with spectacular views of and from Arthur&#39;s Seat and somewhere to relax after a long day in the city.<p>To the northeast, overlooking the New Town, is <!--del_lnk--> Calton Hill. It is topped by an assortment of buildings and monuments: two <!--del_lnk--> observatories, <!--del_lnk--> Nelson&#39;s Monument (a tower dedicated to Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Horatio Nelson), the old <!--del_lnk--> Royal High School (once almost the home of a devolved <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Assembly), and the unfinished <!--del_lnk--> National Monument, which is modelled on the <a href="../../wp/p/Parthenon.htm" title="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> from the Athenian <!--del_lnk--> Acropolis and is nicknamed &quot;Edinburgh&#39;s Disgrace&quot;. The nickname of the city, &quot;Athens of the North&quot;, also hails partly from this monument. Calton Hill plays host to the <!--del_lnk--> Beltane Fire Festival on <!--del_lnk--> May 1.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Observatory rests on <!--del_lnk--> Blackford Hill, the third and Southernmost viewpoint of the city.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>

      <p>Like much of the rest of Scotland, Edinburgh has a <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a> <!--del_lnk--> maritime climate, which is relatively mild despite its northerly <!--del_lnk--> latitude. Winters are especially mild given that <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Labrador in <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland lie on the same latitude, with daytime temperatures rarely falling below freezing, or 0C (32F). Summer temperatures are comparatively cool, with daily upper maxima rarely exceeding 23C (73F). The proximity of the city to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. Given Edinburgh&#39;s position between the coast and hills it is renowned as a <!--del_lnk--> windy city, with the prevailing wind direction coming from the south-west which is associated with warm, unstable air from the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream that gives rise to rainfall. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but colder. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Vigorous Atlantic depressions - sometimes called <!--del_lnk--> European windstorms can affect the city between October and March.<table class="wikitable" style="width: 75%; margin: 0 auto 0 auto;">

      <p>Culturally, Edinburgh is best known for the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Festival, although this is in fact a series of separate events, which run from the end of July until early September each year. The longest established festival is the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh International Festival, which first ran in 1947. The International Festival centres on a programme of high-profile theatre productions and classical music performances, featuring international directors, conductors, theatre companies and orchestras.<p>The International Festival has since been taken over in both size and popularity by the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Fringe. What began as a programme of marginal acts has become the largest arts festival in the world, with 1867 different shows being staged in 2006, in 261 venues. Comedy is now one of the mainstays of the Fringe, with numerous notable comedians getting their &#39;break&#39; here, often through receipt of the <!--del_lnk--> Perrier Award.<p>Alongside these major festivals, there is also the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh International Film Festival, the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Jazz Festival, and the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh International Book Festival. <!--del_lnk--> T on the Fringe, a popular music offshoot of the Fringe, began in 2000, replacing the smaller Flux and Planet Pop series of shows. Tigerfest is an independent music festival which ran concurrently with the Fringe in 2004 and 2005 before moving to a May slot in 2006.<p>Running concurrently with the festivals, the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Military Tattoo occupies the Castle Esplanade every night, with massed <!--del_lnk--> pipers and fireworks.<p><a id="Celebrations" name="Celebrations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Celebrations</span></h3>

      <p>Equally famous is the annual <!--del_lnk--> Hogmanay celebration. Originally simply a street party held on <!--del_lnk--> Princes Street and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Mile, the Hogmanay event has been officially organised since 1993. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years, with a limit of 100,000 tickets. Hogmanay now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, and the event regularly attracts thousands of people. On the night of <!--del_lnk--> 30 April, the <!--del_lnk--> Beltane Fire Festival takes place on Edinburgh&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Calton Hill. The festival involves a procession followed by the re-enactment of scenes inspired by <!--del_lnk--> pagan spring fertility celebrations.<p><a id="Music.2C_theatre_and_film" name="Music.2C_theatre_and_film"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Music, theatre and film</span></h3>
      <p>Outside festival season, Edinburgh continues to support a number of theatres and production companies. The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Lyceum Theatre has its own company, while the <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Theatre, <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Playhouse stage large touring shows. The <!--del_lnk--> Traverse Theatre presents a more contemporary programme of plays. <!--del_lnk--> Amateur theatre companies productions are staged at the <!--del_lnk--> Bedlam Theatre, <!--del_lnk--> Church Hill Theatre, and the <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Theatre amongst others.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Usher Hall is Edinburgh&#39;s premier venue for classical music, as well as the occasional prestige popular music gig. Other halls staging music and theatre include <!--del_lnk--> The Hub, the <!--del_lnk--> Assembly Rooms and the <!--del_lnk--> Queen&#39;s Hall. The <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Chamber Orchestra is based in Edinburgh.<p>Edinburgh has two <!--del_lnk--> repertory cinemas, the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Filmhouse, and the <!--del_lnk--> Cameo, as well as the usual range of <!--del_lnk--> multiplexes.<p>Edinburgh has a healthy popular music scene, despite the recent closure of The Venue and the attempted closure of Studio 24. Occasional large gigs are staged at <!--del_lnk--> Murrayfield, the Liquid Rooms, <!--del_lnk--> Meadowbank, as well as the relatively new <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Corn Exchange.<p><a id="Visual_arts" name="Visual_arts"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Visual arts</span></h3>

      <p>The economy of Edinburgh is largely based around the services sector centred around <!--del_lnk--> banking, financial services and <!--del_lnk--> tourism. <!--del_lnk--> Unemployment in Edinburgh is low at 2.2%, which has been consistently below the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> average. The city is one of the most prosperous parts of the country and has the strongest economy of any city in the UK except <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>.<p>Banking has been a part of the economic life of Edinburgh for over 300 years with the invention of capitalism in the city, with the establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Scotland by an act of the original <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of Scotland in <!--del_lnk--> 1695. Today, together with the burgeoning financial services industry, with particular strengths in <!--del_lnk--> insurance and <!--del_lnk--> investment underpinned by the presence Edinburgh based firms such as <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Widows and <!--del_lnk--> Standard Life, Edinburgh has emerged as Europe&rsquo;s sixth largest financial centre. The <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland, which is the fifth largest in the world by <!--del_lnk--> market capitalisation, opened their new global headquarters at <!--del_lnk--> Gogarburn in the west of the city in October 2005.<p>Manufacturing has never had as strong a presence in Edinburgh compared to <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>; however <!--del_lnk--> brewing, <a href="../../wp/p/Publishing.htm" title="Publishing">publishing</a>, and nowadays <a href="../../wp/e/Electronics.htm" title="Electronics">electronics</a> have maintained a foothold in the city. Whilst brewing has been in decline in recent years, with the closure of the <!--del_lnk--> McEwan&#39;s Brewery in 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian Brewery remains as the largest, with <!--del_lnk--> Scottish and Newcastle retaining their headquarters in the city.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">Tourism</a> is an important economic mainstay in the city. As a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Heritage_Site.htm" title="World Heritage Site">World Heritage Site</a> tourists come to visit such historical sites as <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Castle, the <!--del_lnk--> Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Georgian <!--del_lnk--> New Town. This is augmented in August of each year with the presence of the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Festivals, which bring in large numbers of visitors, generating in excess of &pound;100m for the Edinburgh economy.<p>As the centre of Scotland&rsquo;s devolved government, as well as its <!--del_lnk--> legal system, the public sector plays a central role in the economy of Edinburgh with many departments of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive located in the city.

      <p>Edinburgh constitutes one of the 32 <!--del_lnk--> council areas of Scotland and, as such, is represented by the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh City Council, a local authority composed of 58 elected <!--del_lnk--> councillors, each representing an <!--del_lnk--> electoral ward in the city.

In early 2007, construction will begin on the <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Tram Network, a <!--del_lnk--> light rapid transit system of trams that will connect the airport and western suburbs with the city centre. Another loop will connect the city centre and the northern waterfront areas of <!--del_lnk--> Leith and <!--del_lnk--> Granton &mdash; areas which are currently undergoing major regeneration and redevelopment.<p><!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh Waverley is the main railway station for the city.

The <!--del_lnk--> Old College on <!--del_lnk--> South Bridge opened in the 1820s. As the institution continued to expand, new buildings were constructed around George Square, where the heart of the university remains, and the King&#39;s Buildings campus in southern Edinburgh. Development of the college&#39;s buildings continues in the 21st century. The <!--del_lnk--> Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the <!--del_lnk--> Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh were also established by Royal Charter, in 1506 and 1681 respectively.
