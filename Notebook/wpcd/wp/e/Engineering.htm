      <p><b>Engineering</b> is the design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes. The <!--del_lnk--> Engineers&#39; Council for Professional Development, also known as ECPD, defines Engineering as: <i>&quot;The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.&quot;</i> One who practices engineering is called an <!--del_lnk--> <b>engineer</b>, and those licensed to do so have formal designations such as <!--del_lnk--> Professional Engineer , <!--del_lnk--> Chartered Engineer or <!--del_lnk--> Incorporated Engineer. The broad discipline of engineering encompasses a range of specialized <!--del_lnk--> subdisciplines that focus on the issues associated with developing a specific kind of product, or using a specific type of technology.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to produce a successful result. It is usually not enough to build a technically successful product; it must also meet further requirements. Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, marketability, producibility, and <!--del_lnk--> serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive <!--del_lnk--> specifications for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.<p><a id="Problem_solving" name="Problem_solving"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Problem solving</span></h3>
      <p>Engineers use their knowledge of <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> appropriate experience to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate <!--del_lnk--> mathematical model of a problem allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions. Usually multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different <!--del_lnk--> design choices on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. <!--del_lnk--> Genrich Altshuller, after gathering statistics on a large number of <!--del_lnk--> patents, suggested that <!--del_lnk--> compromises are at the heart of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> low-level&quot; engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.<p>Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: <!--del_lnk--> prototypes, <!--del_lnk--> scale models, <!--del_lnk--> simulations, <!--del_lnk--> destructive tests, <!--del_lnk--> nondestructive tests, and <!--del_lnk--> stress tests. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected. Engineers as professionals take seriously their responsibility to produce designs that will perform as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a <!--del_lnk--> factor of safety in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.<p><a id="Computer_use" name="Computer_use"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Computer use</span></h3>
      <p>As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business <!--del_lnk--> application software there are a number of computer aided applications (<!--del_lnk--> CAx) specifically for engineering.<p>One of the most widely used tools in the profession is <!--del_lnk--> computer-aided design (CAD) software which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with <!--del_lnk--> Digital mockup (DMU) and <!--del_lnk--> CAE software such as <!--del_lnk--> finite element method analysis allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes. These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of <!--del_lnk--> Product Data Management software.<p>There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as <!--del_lnk--> Computer-aided manufacture (CAM) software to generate <!--del_lnk--> CNC machining instructions; <!--del_lnk--> Manufacturing Process Management software for production engineering; <!--del_lnk--> EDA for <!--del_lnk--> printed circuit board (PCB) and circuit <!--del_lnk--> schematics for electronic engineers; <!--del_lnk--> MRO applications for maintenance management&nbsp;; and <!--del_lnk--> AEC software for civil engineering.<p>In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as <!--del_lnk--> Product Lifecycle Management (PLM).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The history of the concept of &quot;engineering&quot; stems from the earliest times when man began to make clever inventions, such as the <!--del_lnk--> pulley, <!--del_lnk--> lever, or <!--del_lnk--> wheel, etc. The exact etymology of the word engineer, however, is a person occupationally connected with the study, design, and implementation of <!--del_lnk--> engines. The word &quot;engine&quot;, derives from the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>ingenium</i> (c. 1250), meaning &quot;innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention.&quot; Hence, an engineer, essentially, is someone who makes useful or practical inventions.<p>From another perspective, a now obsolete meaning of engineer, dating from 1325, is &quot;a constructor of military engines&quot;. Engineering was originally divided into <!--del_lnk--> military engineering, which included construction of fortifications as well as military engines, and <!--del_lnk--> civil engineering, non-military construction of such as bridges.<p>The first <!--del_lnk--> electrical engineer is considered to be <a href="../../wp/w/William_Gilbert.htm" title="William Gilbert">William Gilbert</a>, with his 1600 publication of <!--del_lnk--> De Magnete, who was the originator of the term &quot;electricity&quot;.<p>The first <a href="../../wp/s/Steam_engine.htm" title="Steam engine">steam engine</a> was built in 1698 by <!--del_lnk--> mechanical engineer <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Savery.<p>With the rise of engineering as a <!--del_lnk--> profession in the nineteenth century the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering the fields then known as the <!--del_lnk--> mechanic arts became incorporated into engineering.<p>In 1990, with the rise of <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computer</a> technology, the first <!--del_lnk--> search engine was built by <!--del_lnk--> computer engineer <!--del_lnk--> Alan Emtage.<p><a id="Engineering_in_a_social_context" name="Engineering_in_a_social_context"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Engineering in a social context</span></h2>
      <p>Engineering is a subject that ranges from large collaborations to small individual projects. Almost all engineering projects are beholden to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government. The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are <!--del_lnk--> pro bono engineering and <!--del_lnk--> open design engineering.<p>By its very nature engineering is bound up with society and human behaviour. Every product or construction used by modern society will have been influenced by engineering design. Engineering design is a very powerful tool to make changes to environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a great responsibility, as represented by many of the <!--del_lnk--> Engineering Institutions codes of practice and <a href="../../wp/e/Ethics.htm" title="Ethics">ethics</a>. Whereas medical ethics is a well-established field with considerable consensus, engineering ethics is far less developed, and engineering projects can be subject to considerable controversy. Just a few examples of this from different engineering disciplines are the development of <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>, the <a href="../../wp/t/Three_Gorges_Dam.htm" title="Three Gorges Dam">Three Gorges Dam</a>, the design and use of <!--del_lnk--> Sports Utility Vehicles and the extraction of <!--del_lnk--> oil. There is a growing trend amongst western engineering companies to enact serious <!--del_lnk--> Corporate and Social Responsibility policies, but many companies do not have these.<p>Engineering is a key driver of human development. Sub-Saharan Africa in particular has a very small engineering capacity and as a result many African nations are unable to implement solutions to problems they face without outside intervention, even if the political and financial obstacles are overcome. The attainment of many of the <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Development Goals is primarily an engineering challenge and the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity is a prerequisite to achieving the MDGs. All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Engineers Without Borders<li><!--del_lnk--> Engineers Against Poverty<li><!--del_lnk--> Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief<li><!--del_lnk--> Engineers for a Sustainable World</ul>

      <p>Engineering is a well respected profession. For example, in Canada it ranks as one of the public&#39;s most trusted professions.<p>Sometimes engineering has been seen as a somewhat dry, uninteresting field in <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>, and has also been thought to be the domain of <!--del_lnk--> nerds. For example, the cartoon character <!--del_lnk--> Dilbert is an engineer. One difficulty in increasing public awareness of the profession is that average people, in the typical run of ordinary life, do not ever have any personal dealings with engineers, even though they benefit from their work every day. By contrast, it is common to visit a doctor at least once a year, the chartered accountant at tax time, and, occasionally, even a lawyer.<p>This has not always been so - most British school children in the 1950s were brought up with stirring tales of &#39;the Victorian Engineers&#39;, chief amongst whom were the Brunels, the Stephensons, Telford and their contemporaries.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> science fiction engineers are often portrayed as highly knowledgeable and respectable individuals who understand the overwhelming future technologies often portrayed in the genre. The <i><a href="../../wp/s/Star_Trek.htm" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a></i> characters <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery Scott and <!--del_lnk--> Geordi La Forge are famous examples.<p>Engineers are often respected and ridiculed for their intense beliefs and interests. Perhaps because of their deep understanding of the interconnectedness of many things, engineers such as Governor <!--del_lnk--> John H. Sununu, New York City Mayor <!--del_lnk--> Michael Bloomberg and Nuclear Physicist <!--del_lnk--> Edward Teller, are often driven into politics to &quot;fix things&quot; for the public good.<p>Occasionally, engineers may be recognized by the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Iron Ring&quot;--a stainless steel or iron ring worn on the little (fourth) finger of the dominant hand. This tradition was originally developed in Canada in <!--del_lnk--> the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer as a symbol of pride and obligation for the engineering profession. Some years later this practice was adopted in the United States. Members of the US <!--del_lnk--> Order of the Engineer accept this ring as a pledge to uphold the proud history of engineering. A <!--del_lnk--> Professional Engineer&#39;s name often has the <!--del_lnk--> post-nominal letters PE or P.Eng in North America. In much of Europe a professional engineer is denoted by the letters IR, while in the UK and much of the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth the term <!--del_lnk--> Chartered Engineer applies and is denoted by the letters CEng.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Relationships with other disciplines</span></h2>

      <p>There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations. Scientists are expected to interpret their observations and to make expert recommendations for practical action based on those interpretations. Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists.<p>In the book <i>What Engineers Know and How They Know It</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research. First, it often deals with areas in which the basic <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and/or <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner. Examples are the use of numerical approximations to the <!--del_lnk--> Navier-Stokes equations to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of <!--del_lnk--> Miner&#39;s rule to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-empirical methods that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the <!--del_lnk--> method of parameter variation.<p><a id="Medicine_and_biology" name="Medicine_and_biology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Medicine and biology</span></h3>
      <p>The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">Medicine</a> aims to sustain, enhance and even replace functions of the <!--del_lnk--> human body, if necessary, through the use of <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a>. Modern medicine can replace several of the body&#39;s functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, <!--del_lnk--> brain implants and <!--del_lnk--> pacemakers. The fields of <!--del_lnk--> Bionics and medical Bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems. Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying, and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a> with technology. This has led to fields such as <!--del_lnk--> artificial intelligence, <!--del_lnk--> neural networks, <!--del_lnk--> fuzzy logic, and <!--del_lnk--> robotics. There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.<p>Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and <!--del_lnk--> empirical knowledge is an integral part of both. Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using Engineering methods. The heart for example functions much like a pump, the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers, the brain produces <!--del_lnk--> electrical signals etc. These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of Engineering principles in Medicine, led to the development of the field of <!--del_lnk--> biomedical engineering that utilizes concepts developed in both disciplines.<p>Newly emerging branches of science, such as <!--del_lnk--> Systems biology, are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.<p><a id="Art" name="Art"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Art</span></h3>
      <p>There are connections between engineering and art; they are direct in some fields, for example, <a href="../../wp/a/Architecture.htm" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, <!--del_lnk--> landscape architecture and <!--del_lnk--> industrial design (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a University&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Faculty of Engineering); and indirect in others. The <!--del_lnk--> Art Institute of Chicago, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of <!--del_lnk--> NASA&#39;s aerospace design. <!--del_lnk--> Robert Maillart&#39;s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic. At the <!--del_lnk--> University of South Florida, an engineering professor, through a grant with the <!--del_lnk--> National Science Foundation, has developed a course that connects art and engineering. Among famous historical figures <!--del_lnk--> Leonardo Da Vinci is a well known <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> artist and engineer, and a prime example of the <!--del_lnk--> nexus between <a href="../../wp/a/Art.htm" title="Art">art</a> and engineering.<p><a id="Other_fields" name="Other_fields"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other fields</span></h3>
