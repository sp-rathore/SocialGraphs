      <p>The history of <b>English poetry</b> stretches from the middle of the 7th century to the present day. Over this period, English <!--del_lnk--> poets have written some of the most enduring poems in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a>, and the language and its poetry have spread around the globe. Consequently, the term <i>English poetry</i> is unavoidably ambiguous. It can mean poetry written in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, or poetry written in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>.<p>The oldest poetry written in the area currently known as England was composed in <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a>, a precursor to the English language that is not something a typical modern English-speaker could be expected to be able to read. In addition, there was a tradition of English poets writing also in <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> and classical <!--del_lnk--> Greek. Today&#39;s multicultural English society is likely to produce some interesting poetry written in a wide range of other languages, although such poetries are proving slow to emerge.<p>With the growth of <!--del_lnk--> trade and the British Empire, the English language had been widely used outside England. In the twenty-first century, only a small percentage of the world&#39;s native English speakers live in England, and there is also a vast population of non-native speakers of English who are capable of writing poetry in the language. A number of major national poetries, including the <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry_of_the_United_States.htm" title="Poetry of the United States">American</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Australian, <!--del_lnk--> New Zealand and <!--del_lnk--> Canadian poetry have emerged and developed. Since 1922, <a href="../../wp/i/Irish_poetry.htm" title="Irish poetry">Irish poetry</a> has also been increasingly viewed as a separate area of study.<p>This article focuses on poetry written in English by poets born or spending a significant part of their lives in England. However, given the nature of the subject, this guideline has been applied with common sense, and reference is made to poetry in other languages or poets who are not primarily English where appropriate.<p>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The earliest known English poem is a hymn on the creation; <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> attributes this to <a href="../../wp/c/C%25C3%25A6dmon.htm" title="C&aelig;dmon">C&aelig;dmon</a> (fl. 658&ndash;680), who was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced extemporaneous poetry at a monastery at <!--del_lnk--> Whitby. This is generally taken as marking the beginning of <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon poetry.<p>Much of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically; for example, estimates for the date of the great epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Beowulf</i> range from AD 608 right through to AD 1000, and there has never been anything even approaching a consensus. It is possible to identify certain key moments, however. <i><!--del_lnk--> The Dream of the Rood</i> was written before circa AD 700, when excerpts were carved in runes on the <!--del_lnk--> Ruthwell Cross. The works signed by the poet <!--del_lnk--> Cynewulf, namely <i><!--del_lnk--> Christ II</i>, <i>Elene</i>, <i>The Fates of the Apostles</i>, and <i>Juliana</i>, have been assigned with reasonable certainty to the eighth century. Some poems on historical events, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Battle of Brunanburh</i> (937) and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Battle of Maldon</i> (991), appear to have been composed shortly after the events in question, and can be dated reasonably precisely in consequence.<p>By and large, however, Anglo-Saxon poetry is categorised by the manuscripts in which it survives, rather than its date of composition. The most important manuscripts are the four great poetical codices of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Caedmon manuscript, the <!--del_lnk--> Vercelli Book, the <!--del_lnk--> Exeter Book, and the <!--del_lnk--> Beowulf manuscript.<p>While the poetry that has survived is limited in volume, it is wide in breadth. <i>Beowulf</i> is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others such as <!--del_lnk--> Waldere and the <!--del_lnk--> Finnsburg Fragment show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase; elegies such as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wanderer</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Seafarer</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ruin</i> (often taken to be a description of the ruins of <!--del_lnk--> Bath); and numerous proverbs, <!--del_lnk--> riddles, and <!--del_lnk--> charms.<p>With one notable exception (the aptly-named <!--del_lnk--> Rhyming Poem), Anglo-Saxon poetry is written in a form of <a href="../../wp/a/Alliterative_verse.htm" title="Alliterative verse">alliterative verse</a>.<p><a id="The_Anglo-Norman_period_and_the_Later_Middle_Ages" name="The_Anglo-Norman_period_and_the_Later_Middle_Ages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages</span></h2>
      <p>With the <!--del_lnk--> Norman conquest of England, beginning in 1066, the Anglo-Saxon language immediately lost its status; the new aristocracy spoke French, and this became the standard language of courts, parliament, and polite society. As the invaders integrated, their language and that of the natives mingled: the French dialect of the upper classes became <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman, and Anglo-Saxon underwent a gradual transition into <!--del_lnk--> Middle English.<p>While Anglo-Norman was thus preferred for high culture, English literature by no means died out, and a number of important works illustrate the development of the language. Around the turn of the thirteenth century, <!--del_lnk--> Layamon wrote his <i>Brut</i>, based on Wace&#39;s twelfth century Anglo-Norman epic of the same name; Layamon&#39;s language is recognisably Middle English, though his prosody shows a strong Anglo-Saxon influence remaining. Other transitional works were preserved as popular entertainment, including a variety of <!--del_lnk--> romances and <!--del_lnk--> lyrics. With time, the English language regained prestige, and in 1362 it replaced French and Latin in <!--del_lnk--> Parliament and courts of law.<p>It was with the fourteenth century that major works of English literature began once again to appear; these include the so-called <!--del_lnk--> Pearl Poet&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Pearl</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Patience</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Cleanness</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Langland&#39;s political and religious allegory <i><!--del_lnk--> Piers Plowman</i>; <!--del_lnk--> Gower&#39;s <i>Confessio Amantis</i>; and, of course, the works of <!--del_lnk--> Chaucer, the most highly regarded English poet of the middle ages, who was seen by his contemporaries as a successor to the great tradition of <a href="../../wp/v/Virgil.htm" title="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Dante_Alighieri.htm" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante</a>.<p>The reputation of Chaucer&#39;s successors in the 15th century has suffered in comparison with him, though <!--del_lnk--> Lydgate and <!--del_lnk--> Skelton are widely studied. However, the century really belongs to a group of remarkable <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> writers. The rise of Scottish poetry began with the writing of <i>The Kingis Quair</i> by <!--del_lnk--> James I of Scotland. The main poets of this Scottish group were <!--del_lnk--> Robert Henryson, <!--del_lnk--> William Dunbar and <!--del_lnk--> Gavin Douglas. Henryson and Douglas introduced a note of almost savage satire, which may have owed something to the <a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gaelic</a> <!--del_lnk--> bards, while Douglas&#39; version of Virgil&#39;s <i>Aeneid</i> is one of the early monuments of Renaissance literary humanism in English.<p><a id="The_Renaissance_in_England" name="The_Renaissance_in_England"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Renaissance in England</span></h2>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> was slow in coming to England, with the generally accepted start date being around 1509. It is also generally accepted that the English Renaissance extended until the Restoration in 1660. However, a number of factors had prepared the way for the introduction of the new learning long before this start date. A number of medieval poets had, as already noted, shown an interest in the ideas of Aristotle and the writings of European Renaissance precursors such as Dante.<p>The introduction of <!--del_lnk--> movable-block printing by <!--del_lnk--> Caxton in 1474 provided the means for the more rapid dissemination of new or recently rediscovered writers and thinkers. Caxton also printed the works of Chaucer and Gower and these books helped establish the idea of a native poetic tradition that was linked to its European counterparts. In addition, the writings of English humanists like <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_More.htm" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Elyot helped bring the ideas and attitudes associated with the new learning to an English audience.<p>Three other factors in the establishment of the English Renaissance were the <!--del_lnk--> Reformation, Counter Reformation, and the opening of the era of English naval power and overseas exploration and expansion. The establishment of the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in 1535 accelerated the process of questioning the Catholic world-view that had previously dominated intellectual and artistic life. At the same time, long-distance sea voyages helped provide the stimulus and information that underpinned a new understanding of the nature of the universe which resulted in the theories of <!--del_lnk--> Nicolas Copernicus and <a href="../../wp/j/Johannes_Kepler.htm" title="Johannes Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>.<p><a id="Early_Renaissance_poetry" name="Early_Renaissance_poetry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early Renaissance poetry</span></h3>
      <p>With a small number of exceptions, the early years of the 16th century are not particularly notable. The Douglas <i>Aeneid</i> was completed in 1513 and <!--del_lnk--> John Skelton wrote poems that were transitional between the late Medieval and Renaissance styles. The new king, <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_VIII_of_England.htm" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII</a>, was something of a poet himself. The most significant English poet of this period was <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Wyatt, who was among the first poets to write <!--del_lnk--> sonnets in English.<p><a id="The_Elizabethans" name="The_Elizabethans"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Elizabethans</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Elizabethan period in poetry is characterised by a number of frequently overlapping developments. The introduction and adaptation of themes, models and verse forms from other European traditions and classical literature, the Elizabethan song tradition, the emergence of a courtly poetry often centred around the figure of the monarch and the growth of a verse-based drama are among the most important of these developments.<p><a id="Elizabethan_song" name="Elizabethan_song"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Elizabethan song</span></h4>
      <p>A wide range of Elizabethan poets wrote songs, including <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Grimald, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Nashe and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Southwell. There are also a large number of extant anonymous songs from the period. Perhaps the greatest of all the songwriters was <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Campion. Campion is also notable because of his experiments with <!--del_lnk--> metres based on counting syllables rather than stresses. These quantitative metres were based on classical models and should be viewed as part of the wider Renaissance revival of Greek and Roman artistic methods.<p>The songs were generally printed either in miscellanies or anthologies such as <!--del_lnk--> Richard Tottel&#39;s 1557 <i>Songs and Sonnets</i> or in songbooks that included printed music to enable performance. These performances formed an integral part of both public and private entertainment. By the end of the 16th century, a new generation of composers, including <!--del_lnk--> John Dowland, <!--del_lnk--> William Byrd, <!--del_lnk--> Orlando Gibbons, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Weelkes and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Morley were helping to bring the art of Elizabethan song to an extremely high musical level.<p><a id="Courtly_poetry" name="Courtly_poetry"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Courtly poetry</span></h4>

       <div style="width:176px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/247/24735.jpg.htm" title="Edmund Spenser"><img alt="Edmund Spenser" height="205" longdesc="/wiki/Image:EdmundSpenser.jpg" src="../../images/247/24735.jpg" width="174" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>With the consolidation of Elizabeth&#39;s power, a genuine court sympathetic to poetry and the arts in general emerged. This encouraged the emergence of a poetry aimed at, and often set in, an idealised version of the courtly world.<p>Among the best known examples of this are <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Spenser&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Faerie Queene</i>, which is effectively an extended hymn of praise to the queen, and <!--del_lnk--> Philip Sydney&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Arcadia</i>. This courtly trend can also be seen in Spenser&#39;s <i>Shepheardes Calender</i>. This poem marks the introduction into an English context of the classical <!--del_lnk--> pastoral, a mode of poetry that assumes an aristocratic audience with a certain kind of attitude to the land and peasants. The explorations of love found in the <!--del_lnk--> sonnets of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and the poetry of <a href="../../wp/w/Walter_Raleigh.htm" title="Walter Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a> and others also implies a courtly audience.<p><a id="Elizabethan_verse_drama" name="Elizabethan_verse_drama"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Elizabethan verse drama</span></h4>
      <p>Elizabethan verse drama is widely considered to be one of the major achievements of literature in English, and its most famous exponent, <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, is revered as the greatest poet in the language. This drama, which served both as courtly masque and popular entertainment, deals with all the major themes of contemporary literature and life.<p>There are plays on <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a>, <!--del_lnk--> classical, and <!--del_lnk--> religious themes reflecting the importance of humanism and the Reformation. There are also a number of plays dealing with <!--del_lnk--> English history that may be read as part of an effort to strengthen the British <!--del_lnk--> national myth and as artistic underpinnings for Elizabeth&#39;s resistance to the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> and other foreign threats. A number of the comic works for the stage also use bucolic themes connected with the <!--del_lnk--> pastoral genre.<p>In addition to Shakespeare, other notable dramatists of the period include <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Marlowe, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Dekker and <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>.<p><a id="Classicism" name="Classicism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Classicism</span></h4>
      <p>Gavin Douglas&#39; <i>Aeneid</i>, Thomas Campion&#39;s metrical experiments, and Spenser&#39;s <i>Shepheardes Calender</i> and plays like Shakespeare&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Antony and Cleopatra</i> are all examples of the influence of classicism on Elizabethan poetry. It remained common for poets of the period to write on themes from <!--del_lnk--> classical mythology; Shakespeare&#39;s <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and the Christopher Marlowe/<!--del_lnk--> George Chapman <i>Hero and Leander</i> are examples of this kind of work.<p>Translations of classical poetry also became more widespread, with the versions of <!--del_lnk--> Ovid&#39;s <i>Metamorphoses</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Golding (1565&ndash;7) and <!--del_lnk--> George Sandys (1626), and Chapman&#39;s translations of <a href="../../wp/h/Homer.htm" title="Homer">Homer</a>&#39;s <i>Iliad</i> (1611) and <i>Odyssey</i> (c.1615), among the outstanding examples.<p><a id="Jacobean_and_Caroline_poetry" name="Jacobean_and_Caroline_poetry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Jacobean and Caroline poetry</span></h3>
      <p>English Renaissance poetry after the Elizabethan poetry can be seen as belonging to one of three strains; the <!--del_lnk--> Metaphysical poets, the <!--del_lnk--> Cavalier poets and the school of Spenser. However, the boundaries between these three groups are not always clear and an individual poet could write in more than one manner.<p><a id="The_Metaphysical_poets" name="The_Metaphysical_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Metaphysical poets</span></h4>

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The early 17th century saw the emergence of this group of poets who wrote in a witty, complicated style. The most famous of the <!--del_lnk--> Metaphysicals is probably <!--del_lnk--> John Donne. Others include <a href="../../wp/g/George_Herbert.htm" title="George Herbert">George Herbert</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Vaughan, <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Marvell and <!--del_lnk--> Richard Crashaw. <a href="../../wp/j/John_Milton.htm" title="John Milton">John Milton</a> in his <i>Comus</i> falls into this group. The Metaphysical poets went out of favour in the 18th century but began to be read again in the Victorian era. Donne&#39;s reputation was finally fully restored by the approbation of <a href="../../wp/t/T._S._Eliot.htm" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> in the early 20th century.<p><a id="The_Cavalier_poets" name="The_Cavalier_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Cavalier poets</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cavalier poets wrote in a lighter, more elegant and artificial style than the Metaphysical poets. Leading members of the group include <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Lovelace, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Herrick, <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Waller, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Carew and <!--del_lnk--> John Denham. The Cavalier poets can be seen as the forerunners of the major poets of the Augustan era, who admired them greatly.<p><a id="The_school_of_Spenser" name="The_school_of_Spenser"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The school of Spenser</span></h4>
      <p>The early 17th century also saw a group of poets who were interested in following Spenser&#39;s example in the area of long mythic poems. These include <!--del_lnk--> Michael Drayton, <!--del_lnk--> William Browne and the brothers <!--del_lnk--> Giles and <!--del_lnk--> Phineas Fletcher. Although these poets wrote against the literary fashion of their day and have since been much neglected, their tradition led directly to <a href="../../wp/j/John_Milton.htm" title="John Milton">John Milton</a>&#39;s great mythic long poem, <i><!--del_lnk--> Paradise Lost</i>.<p><a id="The_Restoration_and_18th_century" name="The_Restoration_and_18th_century"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Restoration and 18th century</span></h2>
      <p>It is perhaps ironic that <i>Paradise Lost</i>, a story of fallen pride, was the first major poem to appear in England after the Restoration. The court of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a> had, in its years in <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, learned a worldliness and sophistication that marked it as distinctively different from the monarchies that preceded the Republic. Even if Charles had wanted to reassert the divine right of kingship, the Protestantism and taste for power of the intervening years would have rendered it impossible.<p><a id="Satire" name="Satire"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Satire</span></h3>
      <p>It is hardly surprising that the world of fashion and <!--del_lnk--> scepticism that emerged encouraged the art of <!--del_lnk--> satire. All the major poets of the period, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Butler, <!--del_lnk--> John Dryden, <!--del_lnk--> Alexander Pope and <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Johnson, and the Irish poet <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Swift, wrote satirical verse. What is perhaps more surprising is that their satire was often written in defence of public order and the established church and government. However, writers such as Pope used their gift for satire to create scathing works responding to their detractors or to criticise what they saw as social atrocities perpetrated by the government. Pope&#39;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; is a satirical slaying of two of his literary adversaries (Lewis Theobald, and Colley Cibber in a later version), expressing the view that British society was falling apart morally, culturally, and intellectually.<p><a name="18th_century_classicism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">18th century classicism</span></h3>
      <p>The 18th century is sometimes called the <!--del_lnk--> Augustan age, and contemporary admiration for the classical world extended to the poetry of the time. Not only did the poets aim for a polished high style in emulation of the Roman ideal, they also translated and imitated Greek and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> verse. Dryden translated all the known works of Virgil, and Pope produced versions of the two Homeric epics. <!--del_lnk--> Horace and <!--del_lnk--> Juvenal were also widely translated and imitated, Horace most famously by <!--del_lnk--> John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester and Juvenal by Samuel Johnson&#39;s <i>Vanity of Human Wishes</i>.479<p><a id="Women_poets_in_the_18th_century" name="Women_poets_in_the_18th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Women poets in the 18th century</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>During the period of the restoration, two women poets of note emerged. These were <!--del_lnk--> Katherine Phillips and <!--del_lnk--> Aphra Behn. In addition to these two, a number of other women had plays performed on the London stage. Nevertheless, women poets were still relatively scarce and only two of them published collections during the first decade of the new century. By the 1790s, that number had grown to over thirty. It is evident that women poets had become more acceptable and this change is generally dated to the 1730s. Among the most successful of these women were <!--del_lnk--> Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Thomas, Lady <!--del_lnk--> Mary Wortley Montague, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Leapor, <!--del_lnk--> Susanna Blamire and <!--del_lnk--> Hannah More.<p><a id="The_late_18th_century" name="The_late_18th_century"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The late 18th century</span></h3>
      <p>Towards the end of the 18th century, poetry began to move away from the strict Augustan ideals and a new emphasis on sentiment and the feelings of the poet. This trend can perhaps be most clearly seen in the handling of nature, with a move away from poems about formal gardens and landscapes by urban poets and towards poems about nature as lived in. The leading exponents of this new trend include <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Gray, <!--del_lnk--> William Cowper, <!--del_lnk--> George Crabbe, <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Smart and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Burns as well as the Irish poet <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Goldsmith. These poets can be seen as paving the way for the <!--del_lnk--> Romantic movement.<p><a id="The_Romantic_movement" name="The_Romantic_movement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Romantic movement</span></h2>

      <p>The last quarter of the 18th century was a time of social and political turbulence, with revolutions in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and elsewhere. In <!--del_lnk--> Great Britain, movement for social change and a more inclusive sharing of power was also growing. This was the backdrop against which the Romantic movement in English poetry emerged.<p>The main poets of this movement were <!--del_lnk--> William Blake, <!--del_lnk--> William Wordsworth, <a href="../../wp/s/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge.htm" title="Samuel Taylor Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Percy Bysshe Shelley, <!--del_lnk--> Lord Byron, and <!--del_lnk--> John Keats. The birth of English Romanticism is often dated to the publication in 1798 of Wordsworth and Coleridge&#39;s <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. However, Blake had been publishing since the early 1780s. However, much of the focus on Blake only came about during the last century when Northrap Frye discussed his work in his book &quot;The Anatomy of Criticism.&quot;<p>In poetry, the <a href="../../wp/r/Romanticism.htm" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> movement emphasised the creative expression of the individual and the need to find and formulate new forms of expression. The Romantics, with the partial exception of Byron, rejected the poetic ideals of the eighteenth century, and each of them returned to Milton for inspiration, though each drew something different from Milton. They also put a good deal of stress on their own originality. To the Romantics, the moment of creation was the most important in poetic expression and could not be repeated once it passed. Because of this new emphasis, poems that were not complete were nonetheless included in a poet&#39;s body of work (such as Coleridge&#39;s &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; and &quot;Christabel&quot;).<p>Additionally, the Romantic movement marked a shift the use of language. Attempting to express the &quot;language of the common man&quot;, Wordsworth and his fellow Romantic poets focused on employing poetic language for a wider audience, countering the mimetic, tightly constrained Neo-Classic poems (although it&#39;s important to note that the poet wrote first and foremost for his own creative, expression). In Shelley&#39;s &quot;Defense of Poetry&quot;, he contends that poets are the &quot;creators of language&quot; and that the poet&#39;s job is to refresh language for their society.<p>The Romantics were not the only poets of note at this time. In the work of <!--del_lnk--> John Clare the late Augustan voice is blended with a peasant&#39;s first-hand knowledge to produce arguably some of the finest nature poetry in the English language. Another contemporary poet who does not fit into the Romantic group was <!--del_lnk--> Walter Savage Landor. Landor was a classicist whose poetry forms a link between the Augustans and <!--del_lnk--> Robert Browning, who much admired it.<p><a id="Victorian_poetry" name="Victorian_poetry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Victorian poetry</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Victorian era was a period of great political, social and economic change. The <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">Empire</a> recovered from the loss of the <!--del_lnk--> American colonies and entered a period of rapid expansion. This expansion, combined with increasing industrialisation and mechanisation, led to a prolonged period of economic growth. The <!--del_lnk--> Reform Act 1832 was the beginning of a process that would eventually lead to <!--del_lnk--> universal suffrage.<p><a id="High_Victorian_poetry" name="High_Victorian_poetry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">High Victorian poetry</span></h3>

      <p>The major High Victorian poets were <!--del_lnk--> Alfred, Lord Tennyson, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Browning, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Barrett Browning, <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Arnold and <!--del_lnk--> Gerard Manley Hopkins. Tennyson was, to some degree, the Spenser of the new age and his <i>Idylls of the Kings</i> can be read as a Victorian version of <i>The Faerie Queen</i>, that is as a poem that sets out to provide a mythic foundation to the idea of empire.<p>The Brownings spent much of their time out of England and explored European models and matter in much of their poetry. Robert Browning&#39;s great innovation was the <!--del_lnk--> dramatic monologue, which he used to its full extent in his long novel in verse, <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. Elizabeth Barrett Browning is perhaps best remembered for <i>Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> but her long poem <i>Aurora Leigh</i> is one of the classics of 19th century <!--del_lnk--> feminist literature.<p>Matthew Arnold was much influenced by Wordsworth, though his poem <i>Dover Beach</i> is often considered a precursor of the <!--del_lnk--> modernist revolution. Hopkins wrote in relative obscurity and his work was not published until after his death. His unusual style (involving what he called &quot;sprung rhythm&quot; and heavy reliance on rhyme and alliteration) had a considerable influence on many of the poets of the 1940s.<p><a id="Pre-Raphaelites.2C_arts_and_crafts.2C_Aestheticism.2C_and_the_.22Yellow.22_1890s" name="Pre-Raphaelites.2C_arts_and_crafts.2C_Aestheticism.2C_and_the_.22Yellow.22_1890s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pre-Raphaelites, arts and crafts, Aestheticism, and the &quot;Yellow&quot; 1890s</span></h3>

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/p/Pre-Raphaelite_Brotherhood.htm" title="Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a> was a mid-19th century arts movement dedicated to the reform of what they considered the sloppy <!--del_lnk--> Mannerist painting of the day. Although primarily concerned with the visual arts, two members, the brother and sister <!--del_lnk--> Dante Gabriel Rossetti and <!--del_lnk--> Christina Rossetti, were also poets of some ability. Their poetry shares many of the concerns of the painters; an interest in Medieval models, an almost obsessive attention to visual detail and an occasional tendency to lapse into whimsy.<p>Dante Rossetti worked with, and had some influence on, the leading <!--del_lnk--> Arts and Crafts painter and poet <!--del_lnk--> William Morris. Morris shared the Pre-Raphaelite interest in the poetry of the European Middle Ages, to the point of producing some illuminated manuscript volumes of his work.<p>Towards the end of the century, English poets began to take an interest in French <!--del_lnk--> symbolism and Victorian poetry entered a decadent <i>fin-de-siecle</i> phase. Two groups of poets emerged, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Yellow Book</i> poets who adhered to the tenets of <!--del_lnk--> Aestheticism, including <!--del_lnk--> Algernon Charles Swinburne, <!--del_lnk--> Oscar Wilde and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Symons and the <!--del_lnk--> Rhymer&#39;s Club group that included <!--del_lnk--> Ernest Dowson, <!--del_lnk--> Lionel Johnson and <!--del_lnk--> W.

      <p><a id="The_first_three_decades" name="The_first_three_decades"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The first three decades</span></h3>
      <p>The Victorian era continued into the early years of the 20th century and two figures emerged as the leading representative of the poetry of the old era to act as a bridge into the new. These were <!--del_lnk--> Yeats and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hardy. Yeats, although not a modernist, was to learn a lot from the new poetic movements that sprang up around him and adapted his writing to the new circumstances. Hardy was, in terms of technique at least, a more traditional figure and was to be a reference point for various anti-modernist reactions, especially from the 1950s onwards.<p><a id="The_Georgian_poets" name="The_Georgian_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Georgian poets</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Georgian poets were the first major grouping of the post-Victorian era. Their work appeared in a series of five anthologies called <i>Georgian Poetry</i> which were published by <!--del_lnk--> Harold Monro and edited by <!--del_lnk--> Edward Marsh. The poets featured included <!--del_lnk--> Edmund Blunden, <!--del_lnk--> Rupert Brooke, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Graves, <!--del_lnk--> D. H. Lawrence, <!--del_lnk--> Walter de la Mare and <!--del_lnk--> Siegfried Sassoon. Their poetry represented something of a reaction to the decadence of the 1890s and tended towards the sentimental. Brooke and Sassoon were to go on to win reputations as war poets and Lawrence quickly distanced himself from the group and was associated with the modernist movement.<p><a id="World_War_I" name="World_War_I"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h4>
      <p>As already noted, the Georgian poets Rupert Brooke and Siegfried Sassoon are now mostly remembered for their war poetry. Other notable poets who wrote about the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">war</a> include <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Rosenberg, <!--del_lnk--> Edward Thomas, <!--del_lnk--> Wilfred Owen, <!--del_lnk--> May Cannan and, from the home front, Hardy and <a href="../../wp/r/Rudyard_Kipling.htm" title="Rudyard Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. Although many of these poets wrote socially-aware criticism of the war, most remained technically conservative and traditionalist.<p><a id="Modernism" name="Modernism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Modernism</span></h4>

      <p>The early decades of the 20th century saw the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> begin to overtake the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as the major economic power. In the world of poetry, this period also saw American writers at the forefront of <i>avant-garde</i> practices. Among the foremost of these poets were <!--del_lnk--> T.S. Eliot and <a href="../../wp/e/Ezra_Pound.htm" title="Ezra Pound">Ezra Pound</a>, both of whom spent part, and in Eliot&#39;s case a considerable part, of their writing lives in England.<p>Pound&#39;s involvement with the <!--del_lnk--> Imagists marked the beginning of a revolution in the way poetry was written. English poets involved with this group included D. H. Lawrence, <!--del_lnk--> Richard Aldington, <!--del_lnk--> T. E. Hulme, <!--del_lnk--> F. S. Flint, <a href="../../wp/e/E._E._Cummings.htm" title="E. E. Cummings">E. E. Cummings</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Ford Madox Ford, <!--del_lnk--> Allen Upward and <!--del_lnk--> John Cournos. Eliot, particularly after the publication of <i>The Waste Land</i>, became a major figure and influence on other English poets.<p>In addition to these poets, other English modernists began to emerge. These included the London-Welsh poet and painter <!--del_lnk--> David Jones, whose first book, <i>In Parenthesis</i>, was one of the very few experimental poems to come out of World War I, the Scot <!--del_lnk--> Hugh MacDiarmid, <!--del_lnk--> Mina Loy and <!--del_lnk--> Basil Bunting.<p><a id="The_Thirties" name="The_Thirties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Thirties</span></h3>
      <p>The poets who began to emerge in the 1930s had two things in common; they had all been born too late to have any real experience of the pre-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> world and they grew up in a period of social, economic and political turmoil. Perhaps as a consequence of these facts, themes of community, social (in)justice and war seem to dominate the poetry of the decade.<p><a id="The_New_Country_poets" name="The_New_Country_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>New Country</i> poets</span></h4>
      <p>The poetic landscape of the decade was dominated by four poets; <!--del_lnk--> W. H. Auden, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Spender, <!--del_lnk--> Cecil Day-Lewis and <!--del_lnk--> Louis MacNeice, although the last of these belongs at least as much to the history of Irish poetry. These poets were all, in their early days at least, politically active on the <!--del_lnk--> Left. Although they admired Eliot, they also represented a move away from the technical innovations of their modernist predecessors. A number of other, less enduring, poets also worked in the same vein. One of these was <!--del_lnk--> Michael Roberts, whose <i>New Country</i> anthology both introduced the group to a wider audience and gave them their name.<p><a id="Surrealism_and_others" name="Surrealism_and_others"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Surrealism and others</span></h4>
      <p>The 1930s also saw the emergence of a home-grown English <!--del_lnk--> surrealist poetry whose main exponents were <!--del_lnk--> David Gascoyne, <!--del_lnk--> Hugh Sykes Davies, <!--del_lnk--> George Barker, and <!--del_lnk--> Philip O&#39;Connor. These poets turned to French models rather than either the <i>New Country</i> poets or English-language modernism, and their work was to prove of importance to later English experimental poets as it broadened the scope of the English <i>avant-garde</i> tradition.<p><!--del_lnk--> John Betjeman and <!--del_lnk--> Stevie Smith, who were two of the most significant poets of this period, stood outside all schools and groups. Betjeman was a quietly ironic poet of Middle England with a fine command of a wide range of <!--del_lnk--> verse techniques. Smith was an entirely unclassifiable one-off voice.<p><a id="The_Forties" name="The_Forties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Forties</span></h3>
      <p><a id="The_war_poets" name="The_war_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The war poets</span></h4>
      <p>The 1940s opened with the United Kingdom at war and a new generation of war poets emerged in response. These included <!--del_lnk--> Keith Douglas, <!--del_lnk--> Alun Lewis, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Reed and <!--del_lnk--> F. T. Prince. As with the poets of the First World War, the work of these writers can be seen as something of an interlude in the history of 20th century poetry. Technically, many of these war poets owed something to the 1930s poets, but their work grew out of the particular circumstances in which they found themselves living and fighting.<p><a id="The_New_Romantics" name="The_New_Romantics"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The New Romantics</span></h4>
      <p>The main movement in post-war 1940s poetry was the New Romantic group that included <!--del_lnk--> Dylan Thomas, <!--del_lnk--> George Barker, <!--del_lnk--> W. S. Graham, <!--del_lnk--> Kathleen Raine, <!--del_lnk--> Henry Treece and <!--del_lnk--> J. F. Hendry. These writers saw themselves as in revolt against the classicism of the <i>New Country</i> poets. They turned to such models as <!--del_lnk--> Gerard Manley Hopkins, <!--del_lnk--> Arthur Rimbaud and <!--del_lnk--> Hart Crane and the word play of <a href="../../wp/j/James_Joyce.htm" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>. Thomas, in particular, helped <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Welsh poetry to emerge as a recognisable force.<p><a id="Other_1940s_poets" name="Other_1940s_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other 1940s poets</span></h4>
      <p>Other significant poets to emerge in the 1940s include <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Durrell, <!--del_lnk--> Bernard Spencer, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Fuller, <!--del_lnk--> Norman Nicholson, <!--del_lnk--> Vernon Watkins, <!--del_lnk--> R. S. Thomas and <!--del_lnk--> Norman McCaig. These last four poets represent a trend towards regionalism and poets writing about their native areas; Watkins and Thomas in <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, Nicholson in <!--del_lnk--> Cumberland and MacCaig in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.<p><a id="The_Fifties" name="The_Fifties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Fifties</span></h3>
      <p>The 1950s were dominated by three groups of poets, <!--del_lnk--> The Movement, <!--del_lnk--> The Group and a number of poets that gathered around the label <!--del_lnk--> Extremist Art.<p><a id="The_Movement" name="The_Movement"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Movement</span></h4>
      <p>The Movement poets as a group came to public notice in <!--del_lnk--> Robert Conquest&#39;s 1955 anthology <i>New Lines</i>. The core of the group consisted of <!--del_lnk--> Philip Larkin, <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Jennings, <!--del_lnk--> D. J. Enright, <!--del_lnk--> Kingsley Amis, <!--del_lnk--> Thom Gunn and <!--del_lnk--> Donald Davie. They were identified with a hostility to modernism and internationalism, and looked to Hardy as a model. However, both Davie and Gunn later moved away from this position.<p><a id="The_Group" name="The_Group"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Group</span></h4>
      <p>As befits their name, <!--del_lnk--> the Group were much more formally a group of poets, meeting for weekly discussions under the chairmanship of <!--del_lnk--> Philip Hobsbaum and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Lucie-Smith. Other Group poets included <!--del_lnk--> Martin Bell, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Porter, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Redgrove, <!--del_lnk--> George MacBeth and <!--del_lnk--> David Wevill. Hobsbaum spent some time teaching in <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>, where he was a formative influence on the emerging Northern Ireland poets including <!--del_lnk--> Seamus Heaney.<p><a id="The_Extremist_Art_poets" name="The_Extremist_Art_poets"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Extremist Art poets</span></h4>
      <p>The term Extremist Art was first used by the poet <!--del_lnk--> A. Alvarez to describe the work of the American poet <!--del_lnk--> Sylvia Plath. Other poets associated with this group included Plath&#39;s one-time husband <!--del_lnk--> Ted Hughes, <!--del_lnk--> Francis Berry and <!--del_lnk--> Jon Silkin. These poets are sometimes compared with the <a href="../../wp/e/Expressionism.htm" title="Expressionism">Expressionist</a> German school.<p><a id="The_Modernist_tradition" name="The_Modernist_tradition"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Modernist tradition</span></h4>
      <p>A number of young poets working in what might be termed a modernist vein also started publishing during this decade. These included <!--del_lnk--> Charles Tomlinson, <!--del_lnk--> Gael Turnbull, <!--del_lnk--> Roy Fisher and <!--del_lnk--> Bob Cobbing. These poets can now be seen as forerunners of some of the major developments during the following two decades.<p><a id="The_1960s_and_1970s" name="The_1960s_and_1970s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The 1960s and 1970s</span></h3>
      <p>In the early part of the 1960s, the centre of gravity of mainstream poetry moved to Ireland, with the emergence of <!--del_lnk--> Seamus Heaney, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Paulin, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Muldoon and others. In England, the most cohesive groupings can, in retrospect, be seen to cluster around what might loosely be called the modernist tradition and draw on American as well as indigenous models.<p><a id="The_British_Poetry_Revival" name="The_British_Poetry_Revival"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The British Poetry Revival</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> British Poetry Revival was a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces <!--del_lnk--> performance, <!--del_lnk--> sound and <!--del_lnk--> concrete poetry as well as the legacy of Pound, Jones, MacDiarmid, Loy and Bunting, the <!--del_lnk--> Objectivist poets, <!--del_lnk--> the Beats and the <!--del_lnk--> Black Mountain poets, among others. Leading poets associated with this movement include <!--del_lnk--> J. H. Prynne, <!--del_lnk--> Eric Mottram, <!--del_lnk--> Tom Raworth, <!--del_lnk--> Denise Riley and <!--del_lnk--> Lee Harwood.<p><a id="The_Mersey_Beat" name="The_Mersey_Beat"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Mersey Beat</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Mersey Beat poets were <!--del_lnk--> Adrian Henri, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Patten and <!--del_lnk--> Roger McGough. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Although not actually a Mersey Beat poet, <!--del_lnk--> Adrian Mitchell is often associated with the group in critical discussion. Contemporary poet <!--del_lnk--> Steve Turner has also been compared with them.<p><a id="English_poetry_now" name="English_poetry_now"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">English poetry now</span></h2>
      <p>The last three decades of the 20th century saw a number of short-lived poetic groupings such as the <!--del_lnk--> Martians. There was a growth in interest in women&#39;s writing and in poetry from England&#39;s ethnic groupings, especially the West Indian community. Poets who emerged include <!--del_lnk--> Carol Ann Duffy, <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Motion, <!--del_lnk--> Craig Raine, <!--del_lnk--> Wendy Cope, <!--del_lnk--> James Fenton, <!--del_lnk--> Blake Morrison, <!--del_lnk--> Liz Lochhead, <!--del_lnk--> Linton Kwesi Johnson and <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Zephaniah. There was also a growth in performance poetry fuelled by the <!--del_lnk--> Poetry Slam movement. A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping. Further activity focussed around poets in Bloodaxe Books <!--del_lnk--> The New Poetry including <!--del_lnk--> Simon Armitage, <!--del_lnk--> Kathleen Jamie, <!--del_lnk--> Glyn Maxwell, <!--del_lnk--> Selima Hill, <!--del_lnk--> Maggie Hannan, and <!--del_lnk--> Michael Hofmann. The <!--del_lnk--> New Generation movement flowered in the 1990s and early twenty first century producing poets such as <!--del_lnk--> Don Paterson, <!--del_lnk--> Julia Copus, <!--del_lnk--> John Stammers, <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Polley, <!--del_lnk--> David Morley and <!--del_lnk--> Alice Oswald.<p>Despite all of this activity, major publishers dropped their poetry lists and both young and established writers became increasingly reliant on small and medium sized presses, generally dependent on State funding. As of 2004, it appears that a still thriving literature is faced with an ever-decreasing audience.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_poetry&quot;</div>
