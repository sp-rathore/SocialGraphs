      <p><b>English</b> is a widely distributed <a href="../../wp/l/Language.htm" title="Language">language</a> originating in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> that is currently the primary language of several countries. It is extensively used as a <!--del_lnk--> second language and as an <!--del_lnk--> official language in many other countries. English is the most widely taught and understood language in the world, and sometimes is described as a <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca. Although Modern Standard Chinese has more mother-tongue speakers (approximately 700 million) English is used by more people as a second or foreign language, putting the total number of English-speakers worldwide at well over one billion.<p>An estimated 354 million people speak English as their <!--del_lnk--> first language. Estimates about <!--del_lnk--> second language speakers of English vary greatly between 150 million and 1.5 billion. English is the dominant international language in communications, science, business, aviation, entertainment, diplomacy and the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. It has been one of the official languages of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> since its founding in 1945.<p>English is a <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic language that developed from <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a>, the language of the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons. English, having its major roots in Germanic languages, derives most of its grammar from <!--del_lnk--> Old English. As a result of the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest, it has been heavily influenced, more than any other <!--del_lnk--> Germanic language, by <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> and <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>. From England it spread to the rest of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Isles.htm" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, then to the colonies and territories of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> (outside and inside the current <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations) such as the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and others, particularly those in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglophone Caribbean. As a result of these historical developments English is the official language (sometimes one of several) in many countries formerly under British or American rule, such as <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kenya.htm" title="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uganda.htm" title="Uganda">Uganda</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Mandarin Chinese and <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> have more native speakers than does English; however, the geographic distribution of Mandarin and Hindi, as both first and second languages, is more limited than that of English. English also is the most widely spoken Germanic language. English spread to many parts of the world through the expansion of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, but did not acquire <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca status in the world until the late 20th century, when American culture began to overpower that of others on the global scale. Following <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the economic and cultural influence of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> increased and English permeated other cultures, chiefly through development of <!--del_lnk--> telecommunications technology. Because a working knowledge of English is required in many fields, professions, and occupations, education ministries throughout the world mandate the teaching of English to, at least, a basic level (see <!--del_lnk--> English as an additional language).<p>

      <p>English is an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Frisian language brought to southeastern <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> in the <a href="../../wp/5/5th_century.htm" title="5th century">5th century</a> AD and earlier by <!--del_lnk--> Germanic settlers and Germanic auxiliary troops from various parts of northwest <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Saxons, <!--del_lnk--> Angles) as well as <!--del_lnk--> Jutland (<!--del_lnk--> Jutes).<p>The extent of Germanic immigration to Britain during Roman supremacy there is unknown, but substantial, as Germanic auxiliary troops were continually recruited outside and settled within the borders of the Empire, Britain being no exception to this rule. Thus, the Germanic roots of English in Britain may go back to the 2nd Century A.D. or even earlier.<p>The original <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English language</a> was subsequently influenced by two successive waves of invasion. The first was by speakers of languages in the <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian branch of the Germanic family, who colonised parts of the British Isles in the eighth and ninth centuries. The second wave was of the <!--del_lnk--> Normans in the eleventh century, who spoke <!--del_lnk--> Norman French (an <!--del_lnk--> o&iuml;l language closely related to <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">Modern French</a>).<p>While modern scholarship considers most of the story to be legendary and politically motivated, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> reported that around the year <!--del_lnk--> 449, <!--del_lnk--> Vortigern, a <!--del_lnk--> legendary king of the <!--del_lnk--> Brythons, invited the <!--del_lnk--> Angles to help him against the <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Picts</a> (of modern-day <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>). In return, the Angles were granted lands in the southeast and far north of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. Further aid was sought, and in response came <!--del_lnk--> Saxons, Angles, and <!--del_lnk--> Jutes. The <i>Chronicle</i> talks of a subsequent influx of settlers who eventually established <!--del_lnk--> seven kingdoms.<p>These Germanic invaders dominated the original <!--del_lnk--> Celtic-speaking inhabitants, whose languages survived in areas not under Germanic domination: <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Brittany, <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. The dialects spoken by the invaders dominated almost all of what is now called England and formed what is today called the <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English language</a>, which resembled some coastal dialects in what are now northwest Germany and the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (i.e. <!--del_lnk--> Frisia). Later, it was influenced by the related <!--del_lnk--> North Germanic language <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse, spoken by the <a href="../../wp/v/Viking.htm" title="Viking">Vikings</a> who settled mainly in the north and the east coast down to London, the area known as the <!--del_lnk--> Danelaw.<p>Then came the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest of England in <!--del_lnk--> 1066. For about 300 years following, the Norman kings and the high nobility spoke only <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman, which was very close to <!--del_lnk--> Old French. A large number of Norman words found their way into Old English, leaving a parallel vocabulary that persists into modern times. The Norman influence strongly affected the evolution of the language over the following centuries, resulting in what is now referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Middle English.<p>During the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Middle English was transformed by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Vowel Shift, the spread of a standardised London-based dialect in government and administration, and the standardising effect of printing. <!--del_lnk--> Modern English can be traced back to around the time of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Shakespeare.htm" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.<p><a id="Classification_and_related_languages" name="Classification_and_related_languages"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Classification and related languages</span></h2>
      <p>The English language belongs to the western sub-branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic branch, which is itself a branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European family of languages.<p>The question as to which is the nearest living relative of English is a matter of some discussion. Apart from such English-lexified <!--del_lnk--> creole languages such as <!--del_lnk--> Tok Pisin, <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> &mdash; which is spoken primarily in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and parts of <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> &mdash; is the Germanic variety most closely associated with English. Like English, Scots ultimately descends from Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon. The closest relative to English after Scots is <!--del_lnk--> Frisian, which is spoken in the Northern <!--del_lnk--> Netherlands and Northwest <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Other less closely related living <!--del_lnk--> West Germanic languages include <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> itself, <!--del_lnk--> Low German, <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Afrikaans. The <!--del_lnk--> North Germanic languages of Scandinavia are less closely related to English than the West Germanic languages.<p>Many <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> words are also intelligible to an English speaker (though pronunciations are often quite different) because English absorbed a large vocabulary from French, via the <!--del_lnk--> Norman after the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest and directly from French in further centuries. As a result, a substantial share of English vocabulary is quite close to French, with some minor spelling differences (word endings, use of old French spellings, etc.), as well as occasional divergences in meaning.<p><a id="Geographical_distribution" name="Geographical_distribution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geographical distribution</span></h2>

      <p>According to the <i>World Factbook</i>, aided with Aneki, and the <!--del_lnk--> Guinness World Records English is currently the 2nd most commonly spoken language in the world. It has over 500 million speakers. It is behind only <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin, which has over 1 billion speakers. English is today the third most widely distributed language as a first spoken language in the world, after <!--del_lnk--> Mandarin and <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> (see the <!--del_lnk--> ranking). Something around 600 million people use the various dialects of English regularly. About 377 million people use one of the versions of English as their mother tongue, and a similar number of people use one of them as their second or foreign language as well. English is used widely in either the public or private sphere in more than 100 countries all over the world. In addition, the language has occupied a prominent place in international academic and business communities. The current status of the English language at the start of the new millennium compares with that of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> in most of Western Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire. English is also the most widely used language for young <!--del_lnk--> backpackers who travel across continents, regardless of whether it is their mother tongue or a secondary language.<p>Although the language is named after England, the United States now has more first-language English speakers than the rest of the world combined. The United Kingdom comes second, with England indeed having as many English speakers as the rest of the world combined (aside from the USA).

      <p>Because English is so widely spoken, it has often been referred to as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> global language&quot;, the <i><!--del_lnk--> lingua franca</i> of the modern era. While English is not an official language in many countries, it is currently the language most often taught as a <!--del_lnk--> second language around the world. It is also, by international treaty, the official language for aircraft/airport and maritime communication, as well as being one of the official languages of both the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>, and of most international athletic organizations, including the <!--del_lnk--> Olympic Committee. Books, magazines, and newspapers written in English are available in many countries around the world. English is also the most commonly used language in the sciences. In 1997, the Science Citation Index reported that 95% of its articles were written in English, even though only half of them came from authors in English-speaking countries.<p><a id="Dialects_and_regional_varieties" name="Dialects_and_regional_varieties"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dialects and regional varieties</span></h3>

      <p>The influence of the British Empire, and Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the primacy of the United States, especially since WWII, has spread English throughout the globe. Because of that global spread, English has developed a host of <!--del_lnk--> English dialects and English-based <!--del_lnk--> creole languages and <!--del_lnk--> pidgins.<p>The major <!--del_lnk--> varieties of English each include, in most cases, several subvarieties, such as <!--del_lnk--> Cockney slang within <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British English</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Newfoundland English, and the English spoken by Anglo-Qu&eacute;becers within <a href="../../wp/c/Canadian_English.htm" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> African American Vernacular English (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ebonics&quot;) and <!--del_lnk--> Southern American English within <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>. English is a <!--del_lnk--> pluricentric language, without a central language authority like France&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Acad&eacute;mie fran&ccedil;aise; and although no variety is clearly considered the only standard, there are a number of accents considered as more formal, such as <!--del_lnk--> Received Pronunciation in Britain or the <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Bostonian</a> dialect in the U.S.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> developed &mdash; largely independently &mdash; from the same origins, but following the <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a> a process of <!--del_lnk--> language attrition began, whereby successive generations adopted more and more features from English causing dialectalisation. Whether it is now a separate language or a <!--del_lnk--> dialect of English better described as <!--del_lnk--> Scottish English is in dispute. The pronunciation, grammar and lexis of the traditional forms differ, sometimes substantially from other varieties of English.<p>Because of English&#39;s wide use as a second language, English speakers have many different <!--del_lnk--> accents, which often signal the speaker&#39;s native dialect or language. For the more distinctive characteristics of regional accents, see <!--del_lnk--> Regional accents of English speakers, and for the more distinctive characteristics of regional dialects, see <!--del_lnk--> List of dialects of the English language.<p>Just as English itself has borrowed words from many different languages over its history, English <!--del_lnk--> loanwords now appear in a great many languages around the world, indicative of the technological and cultural influence of its speakers. Several <!--del_lnk--> pidgins and <!--del_lnk--> creole languages have formed using an English base, for example <!--del_lnk--> Tok Pisin began as one. There are many words in English coined to describe forms of particular non-English languages that contain a very high proportion of English words. <!--del_lnk--> Franglais, for example, is used to describe <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> with a very high English word content; it is found on the <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a>. Another variant, spoken in the border bilingual regions of Qu&eacute;bec in Canada, is called <!--del_lnk--> Frenglish. <!--del_lnk--> Norwenglish is a form of English containing many words or expressions directly copied from <!--del_lnk--> Norwegian.<p><a id="Constructed_varieties_of_English" name="Constructed_varieties_of_English"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Constructed varieties of English</span></h3>

       <li><!--del_lnk--> Basic English is simplified for easy international use. It is used by some aircraft manufacturers and other international businesses to write manuals and communicate. Some English schools in the Far East teach it as an initial practical subset of English.<li><!--del_lnk--> Special English is a simplified version of English used by the <!--del_lnk--> Voice of America. It uses a vocabulary of 1500 words.<li><!--del_lnk--> English reform is an attempt to improve collectively upon the English language.<li><!--del_lnk--> Seaspeak and the related <!--del_lnk--> Airspeak and Policespeak, all based on restricted vocabularies, were designed by <!--del_lnk--> Edward Johnson in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s to aid international cooperation and communication in specific areas.

       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> velar nasal <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[&#x14B;]</span> is a non-phonemic allophone of /n/ in some northerly British accents, appearing only before /g/.

In some accents such as <!--del_lnk--> Scottish English and <!--del_lnk--> Indian English it replaces /&#x279;/.

In some dialects such as <!--del_lnk--> Scouse (<a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>) either [x] or the <!--del_lnk--> affricate [kx] may be used as an <!--del_lnk--> allophone of /k/ in words such as <i>docker</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[d&#x252;kx&#x259;]</span>.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Voicing and <!--del_lnk--> aspiration of <!--del_lnk--> stop consonants in English depend on dialect and context, but a few general rules can be given:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Voiceless <!--del_lnk--> plosives and <!--del_lnk--> affricates (/ <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">p</span>/, / <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">t</span>/, / <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">k</span>/, and / <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">t&#x283;</span>/) are aspirated when they are word-initial or begin a stressed syllable &mdash; compare <i>pin</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[p&#x2B0;&#x26A;n]</span> and <i>spin</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[sp&#x26A;n]</span>, <i>crap</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[k&#x2B0;&#x279;&#x325;&aelig;p]</span> and <i>scrap</i> <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[sk&#x279;&aelig;p]</span>. <ul>
         <li>In some dialects, aspiration extends to unstressed syllables as well.<li>In other dialects, such as <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Pakistani English, all voiceless stops remain unaspirated.</ul>
       <li>Word-initial voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects.<li>Word-terminal voiceless plosives may be unreleased or accompanied by a glottal stop in some dialects (e.g. many varieties of <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>) &mdash; examples: <i>tap</i> [ <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">t&#x2B0;&aelig;p&#x31A;</span>], <i>sack</i> [ <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">s&aelig;k&#x31A;</span>].<li>Word-terminal voiced plosives may be devoiced in some dialects (e.g. some varieties of <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>) &mdash; examples: <i>sad</i> [ <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">s&aelig;d&#x325;</span>], <i>bag</i> [ <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">b&aelig;&#x261;&#x30A;</span>].

      <p>English is an <!--del_lnk--> intonation language. This means that the <!--del_lnk--> pitch of the <!--del_lnk--> voice is used <!--del_lnk--> syntactically, for example, to convey <!--del_lnk--> surprise and <!--del_lnk--> irony, or to change a <!--del_lnk--> statement into a <!--del_lnk--> question.<p>In English, intonation patterns are on groups of words, which are called tone groups, tone units, intonation groups or sense groups. Tone groups are said on a single breath and, as a consequence, are of limited length, more often being on average five words long or lasting roughly two seconds. The structure of tone groups can have a crucial impact on the meaning of what is said. For example:<dl>
       <dd>- <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/du&#x2D0; ju&#x2D0; ni&#x2D0;d &#x2C8;&#x25B;n&#x26A;&#x2CC;&theta;&#x26A;&#x14B;/</span> <i>Do you need anything?</i><dd>- <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/a&#x26A; d&#x259;&#x28A;nt | n&#x259;&#x28A;/</span> <i>I don&#39;t, no</i><dd>- <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/a&#x26A; d&#x259;&#x28A;nt n&#x259;&#x28A;/</span> <i>I don&#39;t know</i> (contracted to, for example, - <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">/a&#x26A; d&#x259;&#x28A;n&#x259;&#x28A;/</span> <i>I dunno</i> in fast or colloquial speech that de-emphasises the pause between don&#39;t and know even further)</dl>
      <p><a id="Characteristics_of_intonation_.28stress_accent.29" name="Characteristics_of_intonation_.28stress_accent.29"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Characteristics of intonation (stress accent)</span></h4>
      <p>English is a <i><!--del_lnk--> stress-timed language</i>, i.e., certain syllables in each multi-syllabic word get a relative prominence/loudness during pronunciation while the others do not. The former kind of syllables are said to be <i>accentuated/stressed</i> and the latter are <i>unaccentuated/unstressed</i>. All good dictionaries of English mark the accentuated syllable(s) by either placing an apostrophe-like ( <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">&#x2C8;</span> ) sign either before (as in <!--del_lnk--> IPA, <!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary, or <!--del_lnk--> Merriam-Webster dictionaries) or after (as in many other dictionaries) the syllable where the stress accent falls. In general, for a two-syllable word in English, it can be broadly said that if it is a noun or an adjective, the first syllable is accentuated; but if it is a verb, the second syllable is accentuated.<p>Hence in a sentence, each tone group can be subdivided into syllables, which can either be stressed (strong) or unstressed (weak). The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable. For example:<dl>
       <dd><i>That | was | the | <u><b>best</b></u> | thing | you | could | have | <b>done</b>!</i></dl>
      <p>Here, all syllables are unstressed, except the syllables/words &quot;best&quot; and &quot;done&quot;, which are stressed. &quot;Best&quot; is stressed harder and, therefore, is the nuclear syllable.<p>The nuclear syllable carries the main point the speaker wishes to make. For example:<dl>
       <dd><i><b>John</b> hadn&#39;t stolen that money</i>. (... Someone else had.)<dd><i>John <b>hadn&#39;t</b> stolen that money</i>. (... You said he had.)<dd><i>John hadn&#39;t <b>stolen</b> that money</i>. (... He was given the money.)<dd><i>John hadn&#39;t stolen <b>that</b> money</i>. (... He had stolen some other money.)<dd><i>John hadn&#39;t stolen that <b>money</b></i>. (... He stole something else.)</dl>
      <p>Also<dl>
       <dd><i><b>I</b> didn&#39;t tell her that.</i> (... Someone else told her.)<dd><i>I <b>didn&#39;t</b> tell her that.</i> (... You said I did.)<dd><i>I didn&#39;t <b>tell</b> her that.</i> (... I didn&#39;t say it; she could have inferred it, etc.)<dd><i>I didn&#39;t tell <b>her</b> that.</i> (... I told someone else.)<dd><i>I didn&#39;t tell her <b>that</b>.</i> (... I told her something else.)</dl>
      <p>The nuclear syllable is spoken louder than all the others and has a characteristic <b>change of pitch</b>. The changes of pitch most commonly encountered in English are the <b>rising pitch</b> and the <b>falling pitch</b>, although the <b>fall-rising pitch</b> and/or the <b>rise-falling pitch</b> are sometimes used. For example:<dl>
       <dd><i>When do you want to be paid?</i><dd><i>N&oacute;w?</i> (Rising pitch. In this case, it denotes a question: can I be paid now?)<dd><i>N&ograve;w</i> (Falling pitch. In this case, it denotes a statement: I choose to be paid now.)</dl>

      <p>English grammar displays minimal <!--del_lnk--> inflection compared with most other <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European languages. For example, Modern English, unlike Modern <a href="../../wp/g/German_language.htm" title="German language">German</a> or <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Romance languages, lacks <!--del_lnk--> grammatical gender and <!--del_lnk--> adjectival agreement. <!--del_lnk--> Case marking has almost disappeared from the language and mainly survives in <!--del_lnk--> pronouns. The patterning of <!--del_lnk--> strong (e.g. <i>speak/spoke/spoken</i>) versus <!--del_lnk--> weak verbs inherited from Germanic has declined in importance and the remnants of inflection (such as <!--del_lnk--> plural marking) have become more regular.<p>At the same time as inflection has declined in importance in English, the language has developed a greater reliance on features such as <!--del_lnk--> modal verbs and <!--del_lnk--> word order to convey grammatical information. <!--del_lnk--> Auxiliary verbs are used to mark constructions such as questions, negatives, the <!--del_lnk--> passive voice and progressive <!--del_lnk--> tenses.<p><a id="Vocabulary" name="Vocabulary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Vocabulary</span></h2>
      <p>Germanic words (which include all the basics such as <!--del_lnk--> pronouns and <!--del_lnk--> conjunctions) tend to be shorter than the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latinate</a> words of English, and more common in ordinary speech. The longer Latinate words are regarded by many as more elegant or educated. However, the excessive use of Latinate words is considered by some to be either pretentious (as in the stereotypical policeman&#39;s talk of &quot;apprehending the suspect&quot;) or an attempt to <!--del_lnk--> obfuscate an issue. <!--del_lnk--> George Orwell&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> essay &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Politics and the English Language&quot; gives a thorough treatment of this feature of English.<p>An English speaker is often able to choose between Germanic and Latinate <!--del_lnk--> synonyms: &quot;come&quot; or &quot;arrive&quot;; &quot;sight&quot; or &quot;vision&quot;; &quot;freedom&quot; or &quot;liberty.&quot; Often there is a choice between a Germanic word (oversee), a Latin word (supervise), and a French word derived from the same Latin word (survey). The richness of the language arises from the variety of different meanings and nuances such synonyms have from each other, enabling the speaker to express fine variations or shades of thought. Familiarity with the <!--del_lnk--> etymology of groups of synonyms can give English speakers greater control over their <!--del_lnk--> linguistic register. See: <!--del_lnk--> List of Germanic and Latinate equivalents.<p>An exception to this and a peculiarity perhaps unique to English is that the nouns for meats are commonly different from, and unrelated to, those for the animals from which they are produced, the animal commonly having a Germanic name and the meat having a French-derived one. Examples include: <!--del_lnk--> deer and <!--del_lnk--> venison; <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cow">cow</a> and <!--del_lnk--> beef; or <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Swine">swine</a>/<a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pig</a> and <!--del_lnk--> pork. This is assumed to be a result of the aftermath of the Norman invasion, where a French-speaking elite were the consumers of the meat, produced by English-speaking lower classes.<p>In everyday speech, the majority of words will normally be Germanic. If a speaker wishes to make a forceful point in an argument in a very blunt way, Germanic words will usually be chosen. A majority of Latinate words (or at least a majority of content words) will normally be used in more formal speech and writing, such as a <!--del_lnk--> courtroom or an <!--del_lnk--> encyclopedia article. However, there are other Latinate words that are used normally in everyday speech and do not sound formal; these are mainly words for concepts that no longer have Germanic words, and are generally assimilated better and in many cases do not appear Latinate. For instance, the words <i>mountain</i>, <i>valley</i>, <i>river</i>, <i>aunt</i>, <i>uncle</i>, <i>push</i> and <i>stay</i> are all Latinate.<p>English is noted for the vast size of its <!--del_lnk--> active vocabulary and its fluidity. English easily accepts technical terms into common usage and imports new words and phrases that often come into common usage. Examples of this phenomenon include: <a href="../../wp/h/HTTP_cookie.htm" title="HTTP cookie">cookie</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> and <!--del_lnk--> URL (technical terms), as well as <!--del_lnk--> genre, <!--del_lnk--> &uuml;ber, <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca and <!--del_lnk--> amigo (imported words/phrases, from French, German, modern Latin, and Spanish, respectively). In addition, <!--del_lnk--> slang often provides new meanings for old words and phrases. In fact, this fluidity is so pronounced that a distinction often needs to be made between formal forms of English and contemporary usage. See also: <!--del_lnk--> sociolinguistics.<p><a id="Number_of_words_in_English" name="Number_of_words_in_English"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Number of words in English</span></h3>
      <p>As the <i>General Explanations</i> at the beginning of the Oxford English Dictionary state:<dl>
       <dd>The Vocabulary of a widely diffused and highly cultivated living language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits... there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible circumference.</dl>
      <p>The vocabulary of English is undoubtedly vast, but assigning a specific number to its size is more a matter of definition than of calculation. Unlike other languages, there is no <!--del_lnk--> Academy to define officially accepted words. <!--del_lnk--> Neologisms are coined regularly in medicine, science and technology and other fields, and new <!--del_lnk--> slang is constantly developed. Some of these new words enter wide usage; others remain restricted to small circles. Foreign words used in immigrant communities often make their way into wider English usage. Archaic, dialectal, and regional words might or might not be widely considered as &quot;English&quot;.<p>The <i><!--del_lnk--> Oxford English Dictionary,</i> 2nd edition <i>(OED2)</i> includes over 600,000 definitions, following a rather inclusive policy:<dl>
       <dd>It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang (Supplement to the OED, 1933).</dl>
      <p>The difficulty of defining the number of words is compounded by the emergence of new versions of English, such as <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Pakistani English. The editors of <i>Merriam Webster&#39;s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged</i> (475,000 definitions) in their preface, estimate the number to be much higher.<p><a id="Word_origins" name="Word_origins"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Word origins</span></h3>

      <p>One of the consequences of the French influence is that the vocabulary of English is, to a certain extent, divided between those words which are <!--del_lnk--> Germanic (mostly <a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a>) and those which are &quot;Latinate&quot; (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>-derived, either directly from Norman French or other Romance languages).<p>Numerous sets of statistics have been proposed to demonstrate the various origins of English vocabulary. None, as yet, are considered definitive by a majority of linguists.<p>A computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old <i>Shorter Oxford Dictionary</i> (3rd ed.) was published in <i>Ordered Profusion</i> by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff (1973) that estimated the origin of English words as follows:<ul>
       <li><i><!--del_lnk--> Langue d&#39;o&iuml;l</i>, including <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Old Norman: <!--del_lnk--> 28.3%<li><a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a>, including modern scientific and technical Latin: 28.24%<li>Other <!--del_lnk--> Germanic languages (including <!--del_lnk--> Old English, <!--del_lnk--> Old Norse, and <a href="../../wp/d/Dutch_language.htm" title="Dutch language">Dutch</a>): 25%<li><!--del_lnk--> Greek: 5.32%<li>No etymology given: 4.03%<li>Derived from proper names: 3.28%<li>All other languages contributed less than 1%</ul>
      <p>A survey by Joseph M. Williams in <i>Origins of the English Language</i> of 10,000 words taken from several thousand business letters gave this set of statistics:<ul>
       <li>French (langue d&#39;o&iuml;l), 41%<li>&quot;Native&quot; English, 33%<li>Latin, 15%<li>Danish, 2%<li>Dutch, 1%<li>Other, 10%</ul>
      <p>Other estimates that have been made:<ul>
       <li>French (langue d&#39;o&iuml;l), 40%<sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup><li>Greek, 13%<sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup><li>Anglo-Saxon (Old English), 10%<sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup><li>Danish, 2%<li>Dutch, 1% <li>And, as about 50% of English is derived from Latin &mdash; directly or otherwise (e.g. from French) &mdash; <sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup> another 10 to 15% can be attributed to direct borrowings from those languages.</ul>
      <p>Some researchers assert that as much as 83% of the 1,000 most common English words are Anglo-Saxon in origin.<p><a id="Dutch_origins" name="Dutch_origins"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Dutch origins</span></h4>

The spelling of words often diverges considerably from how they are spoken, and English spelling is often considered to be one of the most difficult to learn of any language that uses an alphabet.

      <p><a id="Written_accents" name="Written_accents"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Written accents</span></h3>
      <p>English includes some words that can be written with accent marks. These words have mostly been imported from other languages, usually French. But it is increasingly rare for writers of English to actually use the accent marks for common words, even in very formal writing. The strongest tendency to retain the accent is in words that are atypical of English morphology and therefore still perceived as slightly foreign. For example, <i>caf&eacute;</i> and <i>anim&eacute;</i> both have a pronounced final <i>e</i>, which would be &quot;silent&quot; by the normal English pronunciation rules.<p>Some examples: &aring;ngstr&ouml;m, anim&eacute;, appliqu&eacute;, attach&eacute;, blas&eacute;, bric-&agrave;-brac, caf&eacute;, clich&eacute;, cr&egrave;me, cr&ecirc;pe, fa&ccedil;ade, fianc&eacute;(e), flamb&eacute;, na&iuml;ve, n&eacute;(e), papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, pass&eacute;, pi&ntilde;ata, prot&eacute;g&eacute;, raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre, r&eacute;sum&eacute;, risqu&eacute;, &uuml;ber-, vis-&agrave;-vis, voil&agrave;. For a more complete list, see <!--del_lnk--> List of English words with diacritics.<p>Some words such as <i>r&ocirc;le</i> and <i>h&ocirc;tel</i> were first seen with accents when they were borrowed into English, but now the accent is almost never used. The words were considered very French borrowings when first used in English, even accused by some of being foreign phrases used where English alternatives would suffice, but today their French origin is largely forgotten. The accent on &quot;&eacute;lite&quot; has disappeared from most publications today, though <!--del_lnk--> <i>Time</i> magazine still uses it. For some words such as &quot;soup&ccedil;on&quot; however, the only spelling found in English dictionaries (the <!--del_lnk--> OED and others) uses the diacritic.<p><!--del_lnk--> Italics, with appropriate accents, are generally applied to foreign terms that are uncommonly used in or have not been assimilated into English: for example, <i><!--del_lnk--> adi&oacute;s, <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;&eacute;tat, <!--del_lnk--> cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e, <!--del_lnk--> pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance, <!--del_lnk--> raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre, <!--del_lnk--> &uuml;ber (<!--del_lnk--> &uuml;bermensch), <!--del_lnk--> vis-&agrave;-vis.</i><p>It was formerly common in English to use a <!--del_lnk--> diaeresis to indicate a syllable break: for example, co&ouml;perate, da&iuml;s, re&euml;lect. One publication that still uses a diaeresis for this function is the <i><!--del_lnk--> New Yorker</i> magazine. However, this is increasingly rare in modern English. Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left out (cooperate), or a hyphen is used (co-operate). It is, however, still common in loanwords such as na&iuml;ve and no&euml;l.<p>Written accents are also used occasionally in <a href="../../wp/p/Poetry.htm" title="Poetry">poetry</a> and scripts for <a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">dramatic</a> performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable in a word should be stressed for dramatic effect, or to keep with the metre of the poetry. This use is frequently seen in archaic and pseudoarchaic writings with the &quot;-ed&quot; suffix, to indicate that the &quot;e&quot; should be fully pronounced, as with <i>curs&egrave;d</i>.<p>In certain older texts (typically <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British</a>), the use of <!--del_lnk--> ligatures is common in words such as arch&aelig;ology, &oelig;sophagus, and encyclop&aelig;dia. Such words have <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Greek origin. Nowadays, the ligatures have been generally replaced in British English by the separated letters &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; (&quot;archaeology&quot;, &quot;oesophagus&quot;) and in <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a> by &quot;ae&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (&quot;archaeology&quot;, &quot;esophagus&quot;), however, the spellings &quot;oeconomy&quot; and &quot;oecology&quot; are now generally replaced by &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;ecology&quot; outside the U.S. as well.<p>For further information on how one can type diacritics and ligatures, see <!--del_lnk--> British and American keyboards, <!--del_lnk--> keyboard layouts.<p><a id="Formal_written_English" name="Formal_written_English"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Formal written English</span></h2>

      <p>A version of the language, which is almost universally agreed upon by educated English speakers around the world, is called <!--del_lnk--> Formal written English. It takes virtually the same form no matter where in the English-speaking world it is written. In spoken English, by contrast, there are a vast number of differences between <!--del_lnk--> dialects, <!--del_lnk--> accents, and varieties of <!--del_lnk--> slang, colloquial and regional expressions. In spite of this, local variations in the formal written version of the language are quite limited.<p>Learners of English are in danger of being misled by native speakers who refer to <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Australian_English.htm" title="Australian English">Australian English</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British English</a> or other varieties of <strong class="selflink">English</strong>. While it is true that many regional differences between the forms of spoken English can be documented, the learner can easily fall into the trap of believing that these are different languages. They are instead mostly regional variations of the spoken language and such variations occur within these countries as well as between them.<p>The differences in formal writing that occur in the various parts of the English-speaking world are so slight that many dozens of pages of formal English can be read without the reader coming across any clues as to the origin of the writer, far less any difficulties of comprehension.<p>A popular American <!--del_lnk--> website about errors in English, written by a professor at a west coast U.S. university guiding his students towards preferred constructions of written English, contains almost nothing among its hundreds of entries with which a counterpart thousands of miles away in Sydney or London would disagree. Certainly, disputes about pronunciation and colloquial expressions used in speech abound. But in the written language these are relatively few.<p><a id="Basic_and_simplified_versions" name="Basic_and_simplified_versions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Basic and simplified versions</span></h2>
      <p>To make English easier to read, there are some simplified versions of the language. One basic version is named <i><!--del_lnk--> Basic English</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> constructed language with a small number of words created by <!--del_lnk--> Charles Kay Ogden and described in his book <i>Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar</i> (1930). The language is based on a simplified version of <strong class="selflink">English</strong>. Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for <a href="../../wp/e/Esperanto.htm" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>, and seven weeks for Basic English, comparable with <!--del_lnk--> Ido. Thus Basic English is used by companies who need to make complex books for international use, and by language schools that need to give people some knowledge of English in a short time.<p>Ogden did not put any words into Basic English that could be said with a few other words, and he worked to make the words work for speakers of any other language. He put his set of words through a large number of tests and adjustments. He also made the grammar simpler, but tried to keep the grammar normal for English users.<p>The concept gained its greatest publicity just after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> as a tool for world peace. Although it was not built into a programme, similar simplifications were devised for various international uses.<p>Another version, <!--del_lnk--> Simplified English, exists, which is a <!--del_lnk--> controlled language originally developed for <!--del_lnk--> aerospace industry maintenance manuals. It offers a carefully limited and standardised subset of English. Simplified English has a lexicon of approved words and those words can only be used in certain ways. For example, the word <i>close</i> can be used in the phrase &quot;Close the door&quot; but not &quot;do not go close to the landing gear&quot;.<p><a id="See_also_2" name="See_also_2"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language&quot;</div>
