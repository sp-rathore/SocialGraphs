      <p>In general, the word <i>energy</i> refers to a <!--del_lnk--> concept that can be paraphrased as &quot;the potential for causing changes&quot;, and therefore one can say that energy is the cause of any change. The word is used in several different contexts. The use of the word in mainstream science has a precise, well-defined meaning, which is not the case, most often, with many other usages.<p>
       <br /> The most common definition of energy is <!--del_lnk--> work that a certain force (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc) can do. Due to a variety of forces, energy has many different forms (gravitational, electric, heat, etc.) that can be grouped into two major categories: <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy and <!--del_lnk--> potential energy. According to this definition, energy has the same units as work; a <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a> applied through a distance. The <!--del_lnk--> SI unit of energy, the <!--del_lnk--> joule, equals one <!--del_lnk--> newton applied through one <!--del_lnk--> meter, for example. Energy has no direction in space, and is therefore considered a <!--del_lnk--> scalar quantity.<p>Energy is a <!--del_lnk--> conserved quantity, meaning that it cannot be created or destroyed, but only converted from one form into another. Thus, the total energy of the universe always remains constant.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The concept of energy, in the distant past, was used to explain easily observable phenomena, such as the effects observed on the <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">properties</a> of objects or any other changes. It was generally construed that all changes could in fact be explained through some sort of energy. Soon the idea that energy could be stored in objects took its roots in scientific thought and the concept of energy came to embrace the idea of the potential for change as well as change itself. Such effects (both potential and realized) come in many different forms. While in spiritualism they were reflected in changes in a person, in <!--del_lnk--> physical sciences it is reflected in different forms of energy <i>itself</i>, for example, <!--del_lnk--> electrical energy stored in a battery, the <!--del_lnk--> chemical energy stored in a piece of food (along with the oxygen needed to burn it), the <!--del_lnk--> thermal energy of a water heater, or the <!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy of a moving train. In 1807, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Young was the first to use the term &quot;energy&quot; instead of <!--del_lnk--> vis viva to refer to the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared. <!--del_lnk--> Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described &quot;<!--del_lnk--> kinetic energy&quot; in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, <!--del_lnk--> William Rankine coined the term &quot;<!--del_lnk--> potential energy.&quot;<p>
       <br /> The development of <!--del_lnk--> steam engines required engineers to develop concepts and formulas that would allow them to describe the <!--del_lnk--> mechanical and <!--del_lnk--> thermal efficiencies of their systems. Engineers such as <!--del_lnk--> Sadi Carnot and <!--del_lnk--> James Prescott Joule, mathematicians such as <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;mile Clapeyron and <!--del_lnk--> Hermann von Helmholtz , and amateurs such as <!--del_lnk--> Julius Robert von Mayer all contributed to the notion that the ability to perform certain tasks, called work, was somehow related to the amount of energy in the system. The nature of energy was elusive, however, and it was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the <!--del_lnk--> caloric) or merely a physical quantity, such as <a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a>.<p>William Thomson (<!--del_lnk--> Lord Kelvin) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of <a href="../../wp/t/Thermodynamics.htm" title="Thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>, which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by <!--del_lnk--> Rudolf Clausius, <!--del_lnk--> Josiah Willard Gibbs and <!--del_lnk--> Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by <!--del_lnk--> Ludwig Boltzmann, and to the introduction of laws of <!--del_lnk--> radiant energy by <!--del_lnk--> Jo&#x17E;ef Stefan,<p>During a 1961 lecture for undergraduate students at the <!--del_lnk--> California Institute of Technology, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Feynman.htm" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, a celebrated physics teacher and a Nobel Laureate, said this about the concept of energy:<blockquote>

      <p>The concepts of energy and its transformations are useful in explaining natural phenomena. The law of conservation of energy is equally useful. The direction of transformations explained with the help of energy is often influenced by <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a> considerations also.<p>The exact context of various natural <!--del_lnk--> phenomena and transformations varies from one natural science to another.

      <p>The transformation that constitutes the context of energy in physics, is the change in position or movement of an object which is brought about through the action of a <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a>. Thus in the context of <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a>, energy is said to be the ability to do <a href="../../wp/m/Mechanical_work.htm" title="Mechanical work">work</a>. Work is said to be done, in physics, when an object (howsoever small in size and mass) is moved across a distance, howsoever short, by the action of a force.<p>Mathematically, work is equal to the force multiplied by a distance (more accurately, force integrated over a certain path).<dl>

      <p>Units of energy are thus exactly the same as units of work (<!--del_lnk--> joules in the <!--del_lnk--> SI). Because work is <!--del_lnk--> frame dependent (i.e., can only be defined relative to certain <!--del_lnk--> initial state or <!--del_lnk--> reference state of the system), energy also becomes frame dependent. For example, although a speeding bullet has kinetic energy in the <!--del_lnk--> reference frame of a non-moving observer, it has zero kinetic energy in its <!--del_lnk--> proper (co-moving) reference frame -- because it takes zero work to accelerate a bullet from zero speed to zero speed. Of course, the selection of a reference state (or <!--del_lnk--> reference frame) is completely arbitrary - and usually is dictated to maximally simplify the problem to be dealt with. However, when the total energy of a system cannot be decreased by simple choice of reference frame, then the (minimal) energy remaining in the system is associated with an <!--del_lnk--> invariant mass of the system. In this special frame, called the center-of-momentum frame or centre-of-mass frame, total energy of the system <i>E</i> and both its <!--del_lnk--> invariant mass and <!--del_lnk--> relativistic mass <i>m</i> are related by Einstein&#39;s famous equation <!--del_lnk--> <i>E</i> = <i>mc</i>&sup2;.<p>The concept of quantized energy is a product of <a href="../../wp/q/Quantum_mechanics.htm" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Any system can be described by an <!--del_lnk--> Schrodinger equation, and for bound systems the solution of this equation leads to certain permitted states, each characterized by an <!--del_lnk--> energy level. In the realm of <!--del_lnk--> wave mechanics the energy is related to the frequency of an electromagnetic radiation by the <!--del_lnk--> Planck equation <b>E = h&nu;</b> (where h is the <!--del_lnk--> Planck&#39;s constant and <b>&nu;</b> the frequency)<p>According to Einstein&#39;s theory of <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>, mass and energy are equivalent. For example, there are processes, such as <a href="../../wp/e/Electron.htm" title="Electron">electron</a>-<!--del_lnk--> positron annihilation, in which mass is converted completely into energy, and energy also participates in gravitational interactions. The relationship between the two is:<dl>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Atoms and <!--del_lnk--> molecules, the central concepts of <a href="../../wp/c/Chemistry.htm" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a>, are made up of <!--del_lnk--> electrons and <!--del_lnk--> protons, and therefore <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">coulombic forces</a> are at work during the rearrangement of atoms (during formation or decomposition of molecules). The energy associated with this movement of charge is what we call &quot;chemical energy&quot;.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> chemical reaction invariably <!--del_lnk--> absorbs or <!--del_lnk--> releases heat or <!--del_lnk--> light. According to chemical thermodynamics a chemical transformation is possible only if so-called <!--del_lnk--> free energy decreases. The concept of free energy is a synthesis of energy and <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a>. Free energy is a useful concept in chemistry, because energy considerations alone are not sufficient to decide the possibility of a <!--del_lnk--> chemical reaction. According to the <!--del_lnk--> second law of thermodynamics, the entropy of the universe must increase in all processes (including chemical processes), and energy is transformed from one form to another (including from heat to any other form) so long as the second law is not violated. For example, a gas may expand and thus allow some of its heat to do work, but this is only possible because the net entropy of the universe <i>increases</i> due to the gas expansion, more than it <i>decreases</i> due to the disappearance of heat.<p>The concept of <!--del_lnk--> energy levels finds application in various kinds of <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopy, in which elucidation of <!--del_lnk--> atomic and <!--del_lnk--> molecular structure is based on the phenomenon of the presence of certain &quot;lines&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> absorption or emission <!--del_lnk--> spectra.<div class="thumb tnone">

      <p>These <b>lines</b> (so called because they appear as linear features in <!--del_lnk--> dispersion spectra (see example above), such as might be produced by a <!--del_lnk--> prism or <!--del_lnk--> diffraction grating) are postulated to be due to a certain specific amount of energy involved in the transition of atoms or molecules, from one state to another. Because a charactistic magnitude of energy is associated with a characteristic frequency (and wavelength) of light (or other electromagnetic radiation), such lines in spectra are direct clues to energetic changes which are permitted to happen only at certain energies, and not others.<p>The <i>speed</i> of a chemical reaction (at given temperature T) is related to a yet another concept, <!--del_lnk--> activation energy. The activation energy E, of a chemical reaction, can be visualized as the height of a barrier of energy separating two minima of the energy of the chemically reacting system (the energy of reactants and the energy of products). Thus, according to <!--del_lnk--> statistical mechanics the rate of chemical reactions is proportional to the Boltzmann&#39;s population factor <span class="texhtml"><i>e</i> <sup>&minus; <i>E</i> / <i>k</i><i>T</i></sup></span>, that is the population of molecules having energy greater than or equal to E at thr temperature T. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the <!--del_lnk--> Arrhenius equation.<p><a id="Biology" name="Biology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Biology</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Growth, <!--del_lnk--> development and <!--del_lnk--> metabolism are some of the central phenomena in the study of <a href="../../wp/b/Biology.htm" title="Biology">biology</a>. They cannot be explained without invoking the energy concept. Indeed sustenance of <a href="../../wp/l/Life.htm" title="Life">life</a> itself is critically dependent on energy transformations; living organisms survive because of exchange of energy within and without. In a living organism <!--del_lnk--> chemical bonds are constantly broken and made to make the exchange and transformation of energy possible. These chemical bonds are most often bonds in <!--del_lnk--> carbohydrates, including sugars.<div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/30/3019.png.htm" title="Flowchart of cellular respiration"><img alt="Flowchart of cellular respiration" height="340" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Cellular_respiration_flowchart.png" src="../../images/30/3019.png" width="214" /></a></span></div>
      <p>Other chemical bonds include bonds in chemical compounds that are important for the <!--del_lnk--> cell metabolism, for example, those in a molecule of <a href="../../wp/a/Adenosine_triphosphate.htm" title="Adenosine triphosphate">ATP</a> or <!--del_lnk--> fats and oils. These molecules, along with oxygen, are common stores of concentrated energy for the <!--del_lnk--> biological processes. One can therefore assert that transformation of energy from a more to a less concentrated form is the driving force of all <!--del_lnk--> biological processes or <!--del_lnk--> chemical processes that are responsible for the life of a biological organism. <!--del_lnk--> Molecular biology and <!--del_lnk--> biochemistry are in fact scientific studies concerning the making and breaking of chemical bonds in the <!--del_lnk--> molecules found in biological <!--del_lnk--> organisms.<p>As with other natural phenomena, the exchange of metabolic energy in biological organisms also increases the entropy of the universe. Nearly all energy transformations studied in biology are due to the <!--del_lnk--> chemical synthesis and decompositions ultimately brought about by the energy absorbed from photons in sunlight through <!--del_lnk--> insolation  and <a href="../../wp/p/Photosynthesis.htm" title="Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. The total energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants from the solar radiation is about 2 x 10<sup>23</sup> joules of energy per year . This is about 4% of the total sunlight energy which reaches Earth.<p>The predator-prey relationships, <!--del_lnk--> food chains, are in effect energy transformations within <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems that are studied in <a href="../../wp/e/Ecology.htm" title="Ecology">ecology</a>.<p><a id="Meteorology" name="Meteorology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Meteorology</span></h3>
      <p>Meteorological phenomena like <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">wind</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hail, <a href="../../wp/s/Snow.htm" title="Snow">snow</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lightning, <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornados</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Hurricanes">hurricanes</a>, are all a result of energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the planet Earth. It has been estimated that the average total <i>solar incoming radiation</i> (or <!--del_lnk--> insolation) is about 1350 watts per square meter incident to the summit of the atmosphere, at the equator at midday, a figure known as the <!--del_lnk--> solar constant. Although this amount varies a little each year, as a result of <!--del_lnk--> solar flares, <!--del_lnk--> prominences and the <!--del_lnk--> sunspot cycle. Some 34% of this is immediately reflected by the planetary <!--del_lnk--> albedo, as a result of clouds, snowfields, and even reflected light from water, rock or vegetation. As more energy is received in the tropics than is re-radiated, while more energy is radiated at the poles than is received, climatic homeostasis is only maintained by a transfer of energy from the tropics to the poles. This transfer of energy is what drives the winds and the ocean currents. Like biological processes, all meteorological processes involve transformation of energy from a concentrated form such as sunlight into a less concentrated form, such as far infrared radiation (i.e., heat radiation at the much smaller characteristic temperatures that occur on Earth, and thus is diffused into many photons). However, energy may be temporarily locally stored during this process, and the sudden release of such stored sources is responsible for the dramatic processes mentioned above. For example, the kinetic energy of a snow-avalanche or hurricane is due to the sudden release of energy previously captured from solar radiations.<div class="thumb tright">

Recent studies suggest that the Earth transforms about 6.18 x 10<sup>-12</sup> J/s (joules per second) per kilogram.

The magnitude of both of these energy sources decline over time, and based on half-life alone, it has been estimated that the current <!--del_lnk--> radioactive energy of the planet represents less than 1% of that which was available at the time the planet was formed.<p>As a result, geological forces of <!--del_lnk--> continental accretion, <!--del_lnk--> subduction and <!--del_lnk--> sea floor spreading, account for 90% of the Earth&#39;s energy. The remaining 10% of geological tectonic energy comes through <!--del_lnk--> hotspots produced by <!--del_lnk--> mantle plumes, resulting in <!--del_lnk--> shield volcanoes like <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii, <!--del_lnk--> geyser activity like <!--del_lnk--> Yellowstone or <!--del_lnk--> flood basalts like <a href="../../wp/i/Iceland.htm" title="Iceland">Iceland</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Tectonic process are driven by heat from the Earth&#39;s interior. The process is a simple heat engine which works via the upward buoyancy-induced motion of hot, low density magma after expansion by heat. The processes metamorphose weathered rocks, and (more importantly from the energy view) during <!--del_lnk--> orogeny periods, lift them up into mountain ranges. The potential energy represented by the mountain range&#39;s weight and height thus represents heat from the core of the Earth which has been partly transformed into gravitational potential energy. This potential energy may be suddenly released in landslides or <a href="../../wp/t/Tsunami.htm" title="Tsunami">tsunamis</a>. Similarly, the energy release which drives an earthquake represents stresses in rocks that are mechanical potential energy which has been similarly stored from tectonic processes. An earthquake thus ultimately represents kinetic energy which is being released from elastic potential energy in rocks, which in turn has been stored from heat energy released by radioactive decay and gravitational collapse in the Earth&#39;s interior.<p>The energy which is responsible for the geological processes of <i>erosion and deposition</i> is a result of the interaction of solar energy and gravity. An estimated 23% of the total insolation is used to drive the <!--del_lnk--> water cycle. When <!--del_lnk--> water vapour condenses to fall as <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rain">rain</a>, it dissolves small amounts of <a href="../../wp/c/Carbon_dioxide.htm" title="Carbon dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, making a weak <!--del_lnk--> acid. This acid acting upon the metallic <!--del_lnk--> silicates that form most rocks produces <!--del_lnk--> chemical weathering, removing the metals, and leading to the production of rocks and sand, carried by wind and water downslope through gravity to be deposited at the edge of continents in the sea. <!--del_lnk--> Physical weathering of rocks is produced by the expansion of ice crystals, left by water in the joint planes of rocks. A geologic cycle is continued when these eroded rocks are later uplifted into mountains.<p><a id="Astronomy_and_cosmology" name="Astronomy_and_cosmology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Astronomy and cosmology</span></h3>

However, some forms of energy resist such easy classification, as is the case with light energy.

The case of an ideal gas is perhaps one that has been analyzed mathematically in maximum detail. The kinetic energy,<i>&epsilon;</i> of the particles that comprise an ideal gas is expressed by the <!--del_lnk--> equipartition theorem to be equal to <img alt="\!{\frac{1}{2} k T}" class="tex" src="../../images/256/25644.png" />, so the energy per particle is proportional to temperature. For a monatomic gas having <i>N</i> particles each with three degrees of freedom, the internal energy is:<dl>

         <dd><img alt="\overline{E_{kT}}= {3\over{2}} NkT" class="tex" src="../../images/256/25645.png" /></dl>

      <p>where <b>k</b> is the <!--del_lnk--> Boltzmann constant and <b>T</b> is absolute <!--del_lnk--> temperature. Whereas all internal energy is kinetic in an ideal gas at low temperatures, at higher temperatures in gases, and in liquids and solids, there is more energy in vibrations within the molecules. Thus, whenever there is energy due to vibrations, half of it is stored as kinetic energy and the other half in electromagnetic <!--del_lnk--> potential energy between particles.<p>Similarly, <b><!--del_lnk--> radiation energy</b>, also commonly known as <b>light energy</b>, is often portrayed as being carried by moving <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photons</a> and <b><a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electrical energy</a></b> is portrayed as being transferred from one place to another through movement of electrons. However, close examination reveals that this is not really true. Radiation energy cannot be neatly categorized as classical kinetic energy, since photons have no <!--del_lnk--> invariant mass and thus the energy required to accelerate them to their velocity (and thus which is associated with their motion) cannot be calculated using other kinetic equations.<p>The <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electrical energy</a> of an <!--del_lnk--> electric current is not due to the motion of electrons from one end of the conducting wire to another - simply because speed of electrons on both ends of wire is the same (thus their kinetic energy is the same and can not be the sourse of energy delivered to a load in between). An electric current is in fact induced motion of charges at one end of a wire, by introduction of an electric field at the other. The electric field and the wave of current it drives are established over a conductor with a speed v almost equal to the speed of light (v=c/sqrt(&mu;&epsilon;)&asymp;c/1.83=1.6x10^8 m/sec in household copper or aluminium wires with polyvinil chloride insulation), but conduction electrons move at a tiny fraction of that speed (~0.1 mm/sec at current I ~ 1 A). The energy of an electric current is carried in the <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_field.htm" title="Electric field">electric field</a> and <!--del_lnk--> magnetic field of the current - as given by the <!--del_lnk--> Poynting vector. If a wire is made of a good conductor, then practically all electric energy flows outside the wire (because electric field and thus Poynting vector flux inside conductive wire are negligible), and it enters low conductive load (where Poynting vector tilts inward).

This potential electrical part of thermal energy is stored in &quot;deformation&quot; of atomic bonds during thermal motion of atoms (as atoms oscillate around their position of equilibrium, they not only have kinetic energy of motion but also a potential energy of displacement from equilibrium). This energy is a significant portion (about half) of thermal energy for strongly-bonded systems (=solids and liquids), with the rest of thermal energy being the kinetic energy of the atoms. However, the potential part of thermal energy is a smaller fraction of thermal energy in gasses, which carry more than half of their thermal energy as various kinds of kinetic energies of the gas atoms.<p><a id="Chemical_potential_energy" name="Chemical_potential_energy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Chemical potential energy</span></h4>

Energy is never stored in chemical bonds except as a negative quantity (i.e., it always requires energy to break a bond), but net energy may be released when weak chemical bonds are broken so that stonger bonds can be made. The mixture of a fuel and oxygen is an example: this stores chemical energy <b>as compared to</b> the products of combustion, i.e., the energy is not stored in the fuel, but rather exists as a potential energy to be converted to heat when the fuel combines with oxygen. Other common examples of chemical potential are a rechargable battery, or a food item (where again the energy is not stored in the item itself, but actually in the system of <i>item-plus-oxygen</i>). Some chemical fuels or explosives (for example, <!--del_lnk--> nitroglycerine) do not require a second reactant substance to release potential energy, but even in these cases, the energy released does not come from the bonds of the molecule, but rather is released from the stronger bonds of the products into which it decomposes (in the case of nitroglycerine, from the powerful bond in the new N<sub>2</sub> produced when it explodes).<p><a id="Elastic_potential_energy" name="Elastic_potential_energy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Elastic potential energy</span></h4>

Carbon dioxide is an important <!--del_lnk--> greenhouse gas which is thought to be responsible for some fraction of the rapid increase in <a href="../../wp/g/Global_warming.htm" title="Global warming">global warming</a> seen especially temperature records in the 19th century, as compared with tens of thousands of years worth of temperature records which can be read from ice cores taken in artic regions.<p>Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation also releases trace metals such as beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and silver into the environment, which also act as pollutants. Certain <!--del_lnk--> renewable energy technologies do not pollute the environment in the same ways, and therefore can help contribute to a cleaner energy future for the world. Renewable energy technologies available for electricity production include <!--del_lnk--> biofuels, <!--del_lnk--> solar power, <!--del_lnk--> tidal power, <!--del_lnk--> wind turbines, <!--del_lnk--> hydroelectric power etc. However, serious <!--del_lnk--> environmental concerns have been articulated by several <!--del_lnk--> environmental activists regarding these modes of electricity generation. According to them, some pollution is invariably produced during the manufacture and retirement of the materials associated with the machinery used in these technologies. A central way to avoid downsides of expanding energy production is <!--del_lnk--> energy conservation.<p><a id="Exploration_and_research" name="Exploration_and_research"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exploration and research</span></h3>

      <p>Scientists have realized that the known energy resources may not suffice forever, there is thus an urgent need to explore new avenues, which include prospecting for newer territories rich in oil or gas or methods for producing energy resources using methods that have been explored very little.While some scientists are busy in exploring the possibility of <!--del_lnk--> cold fusion many countries are diverting significant economic resources towards <a href="../../wp/s/Space_exploration.htm" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a> <!--del_lnk--> . Space exploration of long duration demands compact energy resources because the huge consumption of energy resources by a large size spacecraft cannot be met by chemical portable energy resources carried on board from the Earth. For missions to the outer solar system, compact nuclear power sources (in the form of <!--del_lnk--> nuclear reactors or <!--del_lnk--> radioisotope thermoelectric generators) are a necessity. It has been proposed to explore <!--del_lnk--> annihilation of matter for this purpose, although no practical way of producing significant amounts of antimatter, or storing them is presently known. Yet another field of research to explore a future source of energy is through <!--del_lnk--> artificial photosynthesis, a process being actively researched to convert the carbon dioxide into useful fuel, other than biomass without the intervention of plants.<p><a id="Management" name="Management"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Management</span></h3>

      <p>Since the cost of energy has become a significant factor in the performance of economy of societies, management of energy resources has become very crucial.Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively that is with minimum incremental costs. Many times it is possible to save expenditure on energy without incorporating fresh <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> by simple <!--del_lnk--> management techniques. Most often energy management is the practice of using energy more efficiently by eliminating energy wastage or to balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness with <!--del_lnk--> energy conservation.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h3>
      <p>Since energy plays an essential role in <!--del_lnk--> industrial societies, the ownership and control of energy resources plays an increasing role in <a href="../../wp/p/Politics.htm" title="Politics">politics</a> at the national level. Governments may seek to influence the sharing (distribution) of energy resources among various sections of the society through pricing mechanisms; or even who owns resources within their borders. They may also seek to influence the use of energy by individuals and business in an attempt to tackle <!--del_lnk--> environmental issues.<p>The most recent international political controversy regarding energy resources is in the context of <!--del_lnk--> Iraq wars. Some political analysts maintain that the hidden reason for both 1991 and 2003 wars can be traced to <!--del_lnk--> strategic control of international energy resources. Others counter this analysis with the numbers related to its economics. According to the latter group of analysts, U.S. has spent about $336 billion in Iraq  as compared with a background current value of $25 billion per year budget for the entire U.S. oil import dependence  See <!--del_lnk--> Energy wars<p><a id="Production" name="Production"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Production</span></h3>
      <p>Producing energy to sustain human needs is an essential social activity, and a great deal of effort goes into the activity. While most of such effort is limited towards increasing the production of <!--del_lnk--> electricity and <!--del_lnk--> oil, newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One such effort is to explore means of producing hydrogen from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore <!--del_lnk--> enzymatic decomposition of biomass. See <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen economy.<p>Other forms of conventional energy resources are also being used in new ways. <a href="../../wp/c/Coal.htm" title="Coal">Coal gasification and liquefaction</a> are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that <!--del_lnk--> oil reserves, at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived.

      <p>While energy resources are an essential ingredient for all modes of <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transportation">transportation</a> in society, the transportation of energy resources is becoming equally important. Energy resources are invariably located far from the place where they are consumed. Therefore their transportation is always in question. Some energy resources like liquid or gaseous fuels are transported using tankers or <!--del_lnk--> pipelines, while electricity transportation invariably requires a network of <!--del_lnk--> grid cables. The transportation of energy, whether by tanker, pipeline, or transmission line, poses challenges for scientists and engineers, policy makers, and economists to make it more riskfree and efficient.<p><a id="Usage" name="Usage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Usage</span></h3>

      <p>Ever since humanity discovered various energy resources available in nature, it has been busy in inventing devices, commonly known as machines, that make life more comfortable by using one or the other energy resource. Thus, although the primitive man knew the utility of fire to cook food, the invention of very many devices like gas burners and <!--del_lnk--> microwave ovens have increased the usage of energy for this purpose alone manifold. The trend is the same in any other field of social activity, be it <!--del_lnk--> construction of social infrastructure, manufacturing of fabrics for covering; porting; <!--del_lnk--> printing; decorating for example, <!--del_lnk--> textiles), <!--del_lnk--> air conditioning; <a href="../../wp/c/Communication.htm" title="Communication">communication</a> of information or for moving people and/or goods(<!--del_lnk--> automobiles)<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other links</span></h2>
