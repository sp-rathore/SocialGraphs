      <p><a id="Early_life" name="Early_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h3>
      <p>Wood was born in <!--del_lnk--> Raleigh, <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina to Ira David Wood III, an award-winning actor, singer, theatre director and playwright, and Sara Lynn Moore, an actress. Her brother, Ira David IV, is also an actor and her aunt, Carol Winstead Wood, is a <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood production designer; she also has a half brother, Dana, from her mother&#39;s first marriage. Wood is <a href="../../wp/j/Jew.htm" title="Jew">Jewish</a>.<p>Wood and her brother were actively involved in their father&#39;s theatre, Theatre In The Park, while growing up; she appeared in a production of <i><a href="../../wp/a/A_Christmas_Carol.htm" title="A Christmas Carol">A Christmas Carol</a></i> at the theatre when she was a few months old, and later starred as <!--del_lnk--> Helen Keller in a production of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Miracle Worker</i>, under her father&#39;s direction.<p><a id="Career" name="Career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Career</span></h3>
      <p>Wood auditioned for the child role in <i><!--del_lnk--> Interview with the Vampire</i>, which was eventually given to actress <!--del_lnk--> Kirsten Dunst. She appeared in several made-for-television films from 1994 and onwards, also playing an occasional role in the <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> series <i><!--del_lnk--> American Gothic</i>. In early 1997, Wood&#39;s parents separated and later divorced, and Wood moved with her mother to her mother&#39;s native <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles, where Wood was cast in the supporting role of <i>Jessie Sammler</i> on the television show <i><!--del_lnk--> Once and Again</i>. Wood&#39;s first major screen role was in the low-budget 1998 film, <i><!--del_lnk--> Digging to China</i>, which also starred <!--del_lnk--> Kevin Bacon and <!--del_lnk--> Mary Stuart Masterson. Wood remembers the role as initially being &quot;hard&quot;, but notes that it eventually led to her decision that acting is something she &quot;might never want to stop doing&quot;.<p>Wood left regular school at the age of eleven, and was <!--del_lnk--> home schooled, because of <!--del_lnk--> bullying and difficulty with teachers, who Wood says treated her like she was &quot;spoiled&quot; because she was an actress. She later drew upon her experiences with bullying to portray a malicious high school student in <i>Pretty Persuasion</i>.<p>Wood subsequently appeared in a number of films catering to a teenage audience, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Little Secrets</i>. She was set to have the leading role in the films <i><!--del_lnk--> Raise Your Voice</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Mean Girls</i>, but was unable to because of production scheduling changes. Wood&#39;s breakthrough movie role followed, with the 2003 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Thirteen</i>, for which she was nominated for a <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Award as <i>Best Actress - Drama</i>. During the time of <i>Thirteen&#39;</i>s release, <i><!--del_lnk--> Vogue</i> named Wood as one of the <i>It Girls of Hollywood</i>, and she appeared, along with the other actresses, on the magazine&#39;s July 2003 cover.<p>Her next two starring roles were in the dark <!--del_lnk--> independent films, <i><!--del_lnk--> Pretty Persuasion</i> (2005), in which she played a villainous, sexually active high-schooler, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Down in the Valley</i> (2006), in which her character engages in a sexual relationship with an older man posing as a <!--del_lnk--> cowboy. Wood has commented on her choice of sexually themed roles, saying that she is not aiming for the &quot;shock factor&quot; in her film choices, and adding that she hopes her roles &quot;spread awareness&quot; about the consequences of deviant behaviour among teenagers, citing that she has known people who behave similarly to her film characters.<p>In 2005, Wood starred in the <!--del_lnk--> music videos for <!--del_lnk--> Bright Eyes&#39; &quot;At the Bottom of Everything&quot; and <!--del_lnk--> Green Day&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot;. In September of 2006, she received <!--del_lnk--> Premiere magazine&#39;s &quot;Spotlight Award for Emerging Talent&quot;.<p>Wood has roles in several as-yet unreleased films, including <i>King of California</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Across the Universe</i>, a musical directed by <!--del_lnk--> Julie Taymor and set in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>; she will perform musical numbers in the film. During August and September 2006, Wood filmed <i>In Bloom</i>, in which she plays a younger version of a character played by <!--del_lnk--> Uma Thurman.<p><a id="Personal_life" name="Personal_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Personal life</span></h3>
      <p>Wood received her <!--del_lnk--> high school diploma at age fifteen. She has a black belt in <!--del_lnk--> Tae Kwon Do and enjoys singing, having recorded the songs &quot;Christmas Isn&#39;t Christmas Without You&quot; and &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; for the <i>School&#39;s Out Christmas Album</i>, which featured various artists. Wood is now considering taking part-time college courses, but is not yet pursuing a full-time college education.<p>Wood has said that her character in <i>Across the Universe</i>, whom she describes as an &quot;old soul, street smart and ahead of her time&quot;, is close to her real-life personality. Wood also describes herself as being &quot;laid back&quot; and &quot;not a party girl&quot;, citing her choice to stay away from what is considered a typical Hollywood lifestyle.<p>During 2006, Wood, who was described by <!--del_lnk--> the Guardian as an &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Anglophile&quot;, dated her &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Wake Me Up When September Ends&quot; music video co-star, English actor <!--del_lnk--> Jamie Bell.  She is also a friend of actor <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<p><a id="Selected_filmography" name="Selected_filmography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Selected filmography</span></h2>
