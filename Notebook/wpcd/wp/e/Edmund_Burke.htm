      <p><b>Edmund Burke</b> (<!--del_lnk--> January 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1729 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> July 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1797) was an <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish statesman, author, orator, <!--del_lnk--> political theorist, and <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a>, who served for many years in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a> as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Whig party. He is chiefly remembered for his support of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> colonies in the struggle against King <a href="../../wp/g/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a> that led to the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution and for his strong opposition to the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. The latter made Burke one of the leading figures within the <!--del_lnk--> conservative faction of the <!--del_lnk--> Whig party (which he dubbed the &quot;Old Whigs&quot;), in opposition to the pro-revolutionary &quot;New Whigs,&quot; led by <!--del_lnk--> Charles James Fox. Burke also published philosophical work on <a href="../../wp/a/Aesthetics.htm" title="Aesthetics">aesthetics</a> and founded the <i><!--del_lnk--> Annual Register</i>, a political review. He is often regarded as the father of Anglo-American conservatism.<p>

      <p>Burke, who was of <!--del_lnk--> Munster <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic stock, was born in <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> to a <!--del_lnk--> solicitor father who conformed to the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>. His mother, whose maiden name was Nagle, belonged to the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. Burke was raised in his father&#39;s faith and would remain throughout his life a practicing <a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>, but his political enemies would later repeatedly accuse him of harbouring secret Catholic sympathies at a time when membership in the Catholic church would have disqualified him from public office (<i>see</i> <!--del_lnk--> Penal Laws in Ireland).<p>He received his early education at a <a href="../../wp/r/Religious_Society_of_Friends.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> school in Ballitore and in <!--del_lnk--> 1744 he proceeded to <!--del_lnk--> Trinity College, Dublin. In <!--del_lnk--> 1747, he set up a Debating Club, known as Edmund Burke&#39;s Club, which in 1770 merged with the Historical Club to form the <!--del_lnk--> College Historical Society. The minutes of the meetings of Burke&#39;s club remain in the collection of the Historical Society. He graduated in <!--del_lnk--> 1748. Burke&#39;s father wished him to study for the <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>, and with this object he went to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1750 and entered the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Temple, but soon thereafter he gave up his legal studies in order to travel in Continental <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>.<p>Burke&#39;s first published work, <i><!--del_lnk--> A Vindication of Natural Society: A View of the Miseries and Evils Arising to Mankind</i>, appeared in <!--del_lnk--> 1756 and was fraudulently attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Lord Bolingbroke. It was originally taken as a serious treatise on <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>. Years later, with a government appointment at stake, Burke claimed that it had been intended as a <!--del_lnk--> satire. Many modern scholars consider it to be satire, but others take <i>Vindication</i> as a serious defence of anarchism (an interpretation notably espoused by <!--del_lnk--> Murray Rothbard.) Whether satire or not, it was the first anarchist essay, and taken seriously by later anarchists such as <!--del_lnk--> William Godwin. In <!--del_lnk--> 1757 Burke published a treatise on aesthetics, <i><!--del_lnk--> A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</i>, which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as <!--del_lnk--> Denis Diderot and <a href="../../wp/i/Immanuel_Kant.htm" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>. The following year, with <!--del_lnk--> Robert Dodsley, he created the influential <i>Annual Register</i>, a publication in which various authors evaluated the international political events of the previous year. In London, Burke became closely connected with many of the leading intellectuals and artists, including <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Johnson, <!--del_lnk--> David Garrick, <!--del_lnk--> Oliver Goldsmith, and <!--del_lnk--> Joshua Reynolds.<p>At about this same time, Burke was introduced to <!--del_lnk--> William Gerard Hamilton (known as &quot;Single-speech Hamilton&quot;). When Hamilton was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Chief Secretary for Ireland, Burke accompanied him to Dublin as his private secretary, a position he maintained for three years. In <!--del_lnk--> 1765 Burke became private secretary to liberal Whig statesman <!--del_lnk--> Charles Watson-Wentworth, the <!--del_lnk--> Marquess of Rockingham, at the time <a href="../../wp/p/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, who remained Burke&#39;s close friend and associate until his premature death in 1782.<p><a id="Political_career" name="Political_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h3>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1765 Burke entered the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British Parliament</a> as a member of the House of Commons for <!--del_lnk--> Wendover, a <!--del_lnk--> pocket borough in the control of Lord <!--del_lnk--> Verney, later 2nd Earl Verney, a close political ally of Rockingham. Burke took a leading role in the debate over the constitutional limits to the executive authority of the King. He argued strongly against unrestrained royal power and for the role of <!--del_lnk--> political parties in maintaining a principled opposition capable of preventing abuses by the monarch or by specific factions within the government. His most important publication in this regard was his <i><!--del_lnk--> Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents</i> of <!--del_lnk--> 1770. Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the American colonies under the government of King George III and his appointed representatives. He also campaigned against the persecution of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholics</a> in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and denounced the abuses and corruption of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_East_India_Company.htm" title="British East India Company">East India Company</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1769 Burke published, in reply to <!--del_lnk--> George Grenville, his pamphlet on <i>The Present State of the Nation</i>. In the same year he purchased the small estate of Gregories near <!--del_lnk--> Beaconsfield. The 600-acre estate was purchased with mostly borrowed money, and though it contained an art collection that included works by <!--del_lnk--> Titian, Gregories nevertheless would prove to be a heavy financial burden on the MP in the following decades. His speeches and writings had now made him famous, and among other effects had brought about the suggestion that he was the author of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Letters of Junius</i>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1774 he was elected member for <a href="../../wp/b/Bristol.htm" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, at the time &quot;England&#39;s second city&quot; and a large constituency with a genuine electoral contest. His address to the electors of Bristol was noted for its defence of the principles of <!--del_lnk--> representative democracy against the notion that elected officials should act narrowly as advocates for the interests of their constituents. Burke&#39;s arguments in this matter helped to formulate the <!--del_lnk--> delegate and <!--del_lnk--> trustee models of political representation. His support for <!--del_lnk--> free trade with Ireland and his advocacy of Catholic emancipation were unpopular with his constituents and caused him to lose his seat in <!--del_lnk--> 1780. For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke sat for <!--del_lnk--> Malton, another pocket borough controlled by Rockingham.<p>Under the <!--del_lnk--> Tory administration of <!--del_lnk--> Lord North (<!--del_lnk--> 1770-<!--del_lnk--> 1782) the American war went on from bad to worse, and it was in part owing to the splendid oratorical efforts of Burke that it was at last brought to an end. To this period belong two of his most famous performances, his speech on <i>Conciliation with America</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1775), and his <i>Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1777). The fall of North led to Rockingham being recalled to power. Burke became <!--del_lnk--> Paymaster of the Forces and <!--del_lnk--> Privy Councillor, but Rockingham&#39;s unexpected death in July of <!--del_lnk--> 1782 put an end to his administration after only a few months.<p>Burke then supported fellow Whig <!--del_lnk--> Charles James Fox in his coalition with Lord North, a decision that many came to regard later as his greatest political error. Under that short-lived coalition he continued to hold the office of Paymaster and he distinguished himself in connection with Fox&#39;s India Bill. The coalition fell in <!--del_lnk--> 1783, and was succeeded by the long Tory administration of <a href="../../wp/w/William_Pitt_the_Younger.htm" title="William Pitt the Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a>, which lasted until <!--del_lnk--> 1801. Burke was accordingly in opposition for the remainder of his political life. In <!--del_lnk--> 1785 he made his great speech on <i>The Nabob of Arcot&#39;s Debts</i>, and in the next year (<!--del_lnk--> 1786) he moved for papers in regard to the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> government of <!--del_lnk--> Warren Hastings, the consequence of which was the <!--del_lnk--> impeachment trial of that politician. The trial, of which Burke was the leading promoter, lasted from <!--del_lnk--> 1787 until Hastings&#39;s eventual acquittal in <!--del_lnk--> 1794.<p><a id="Response_to_the_French_Revolution" name="Response_to_the_French_Revolution"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Response to the French Revolution</span></h3>
      <p>Given his record as a strong supporter of American independence and as a campaigner against royal prerogative, many were surprised when Burke published his <i><!--del_lnk--> Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1790. With it, Burke became one of the earliest and fiercest British critics of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, which he saw not as movement towards a representative, constitutional democracy but rather as a violent rebellion against tradition and proper authority and as an experiment disconnected from the complex realities of human society, which would end in disaster. Former admirers of Burke, such as <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and fellow Whig politician <!--del_lnk--> Charles James Fox, proceeded to denounce Burke as a <!--del_lnk--> reactionary and an enemy of democracy. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Paine penned <i><!--del_lnk--> The Rights of Man</i> in <!--del_lnk--> 1791 as a response to Burke. However, other pro-democratic politicians, such as the American <a href="../../wp/j/John_Adams.htm" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>, agreed with Burke&#39;s assessment of the French situation. Many of Burke&#39;s dire predictions for the outcome of the French Revolution were later borne out by the execution of King <!--del_lnk--> Louis XVI, the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Reign of Terror, and the eventual rise of <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a>&#39;s autocratic regime.<p>These events, and the disagreements which arose regarding them within the Whig party, led to its breakup and to the rupture of Burke&#39;s friendship with Fox. In <!--del_lnk--> 1791 Burke published his <i><!--del_lnk--> Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs</i>, in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them. Eventually most of the Whigs sided with Burke and voted their support for the conservative government of <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <a href="../../wp/w/William_Pitt_the_Younger.htm" title="William Pitt the Younger">William Pitt the Younger</a>, which declared war on the revolutionary government of France in <!--del_lnk--> 1793.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1794 a terrible blow fell upon Burke in the loss of his son Richard, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise, which were not patent to others, and which in fact appear to have been non-existent. In the same year the Hastings trial came to an end. Burke felt that his work was done and indeed that he was worn out; and he took leave of Parliament. The King, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to make him Lord Beaconsfield, but the death of his son had deprived such an honour of all its attractions, and the only reward he would accept was a pension of &pound;2,500. Even this modest reward was attacked by the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Bedford and the <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Lauderdale, to whom Burke made a crushing reply in the <i>Letter to a Noble Lord</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1796). His last publications were the <i>Letters on a Regicide Peace</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France.<p>Burke died in <!--del_lnk--> Beaconsfield, <!--del_lnk--> Buckinghamshire in <!--del_lnk--> 1797.<p><a id="Influence_and_reputation" name="Influence_and_reputation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Influence and reputation</span></h2>

      <p>Burke&#39;s <i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> was extremely controversial at the time of its publication. Its intemperate language and factual inaccuracies even convinced many readers that Burke had lost his judgment. But as the subsequent violence and chaos in France vindicated much of Burke&#39;s assessment, it grew to become his best-known and most influential work. In the English-speaking world, Burke is often regarded as one of the fathers of modern <!--del_lnk--> conservatism, and his thinking has exerted considerable influence over the political philosophy of such <!--del_lnk--> classical liberals as <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Hayek and <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Popper.htm" title="Karl Popper">Karl Popper</a>. Burke&#39;s &#39;liberal&#39; conservatism, which opposes the implementation of grand theoretical plans of radical political change but recognizes the necessity of gradual reform, must not be confused with the autocratic conservatism of such anti-revolutionary Continental figures as <!--del_lnk--> Joseph de Maistre.<p><a href="../../wp/a/Adam_Smith.htm" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> remarked that &quot;Burke is the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do without any previous communication having passed between us&quot;.<!--del_lnk-->  The Liberal historian <!--del_lnk--> Lord Acton considered Burke as one of the three greatest liberals, along with <a href="../../wp/w/William_Ewart_Gladstone.htm" title="William Ewart Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Babington Macaulay.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Two contrasting assessments of Burke were offered long after his death by <a href="../../wp/k/Karl_Marx.htm" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. According to the former&#39;s <i><a href="../../wp/d/Das_Kapital.htm" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a></i>:<blockquote>
       <p>The sycophant&mdash;who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic <i>laudator temporis acti</i> against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy&mdash;was an out-and-out vulgar <!--del_lnk--> bourgeois.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Winston Churchill&#39;s &quot;Consistency in Politics&quot;:<blockquote>
       <p>On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority. But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing. History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations. His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect. No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other.</blockquote>
      <p>Though still controversial, Burke is today widely regarded as one of the major political thinkers of the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English-speaking</a> world. His writings, like his speeches, are characterised by the welding together of knowledge, thought, and feeling. Unlike most orators, he is more successful as a writer than he was as a speaker. He often rose too far above the heads of his audience, which the continued splendour of his declamation, his prolixity, and his excessive vehemence, often passing into fury, at length wearied, and even disgusted. Burke was known as the &#39;Dinner Bell&#39; to his contemporaries because MPs would leave the chamber to look for dinner when he rose to speak <!--del_lnk--> . But in his writings are found some of the grandest examples of a fervid and richly elaborated eloquence. Though he was never admitted to the Cabinet, he guided and influenced largely the policy of his party. His efforts in the direction of economy and order in administration at home, and on behalf of a more just government in America, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, as well as his contributions to political philosophy, constitute his most significant legacy.<p>Burke is the namesake of a variety of prominent associations and societies, including <!--del_lnk--> The Antient and Honourable Edmund Burke Society at the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.<p><a id="Speeches" name="Speeches"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Speeches</span></h2>
      <p>Burke made several famous speeches while serving in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> On American Taxation (<!--del_lnk--> 1774): &quot;Whether you were right or wrong in establishing the Colonies on the principles of commercial monopoly, rather than on that of revenue, is at this day a problem of mere speculation. You cannot have both by the same authority. To join together the restraints of an universal internal and external monopoly, with an universal internal and external taxation, is an unnatural union; perfect uncompensated slavery.&quot;</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> On Conciliation with America (<!--del_lnk--> 1775)<!--del_lnk--> : &quot;The proposition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war; not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations; not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented, from principle, in all parts of the Empire, not peace to depend on the juridical determination of perplexing questions, or the precise marking the shadowy boundaries of a complex government. It is simple peace; sought in its natural course, and in its ordinary haunts. It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific&hellip;&quot;</ul>
      <p>Also famous is his speech to the Electors of Bristol during the 1774 election, on the duties of a <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament.<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Speech to the Electors of Bristol (<!--del_lnk--> 1774)<!--del_lnk--> : &quot;...it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents. Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion..&quot;</ul>

This article, outlining radical political theory, was first published anonymously and, when Burke was revealed as its author, he explained that it was a satire.

       <li>Having lost his only heir, in 1794 Burke refused King George III&#39;s offer to raise him to the peerage as Lord Beaconsfield.

       <li><i><!--del_lnk--> Reflections on the Revolution in France</i> was addressed to an anonymous French nobleman whose identity has been the subject of many rumours.
