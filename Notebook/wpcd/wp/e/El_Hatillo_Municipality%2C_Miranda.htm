      <p><b>El Hatillo Municipality</b> (<a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>: <i><!--del_lnk--> Municipio El Hatillo</i>) is an <!--del_lnk--> administrative division of the <!--del_lnk--> State of Miranda, <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and along with <!--del_lnk--> Baruta, <!--del_lnk--> Chacao, <!--del_lnk--> Libertador and <!--del_lnk--> Sucre, it is one of <a href="../../wp/c/Caracas.htm" title="Caracas">Caracas</a>&#39; five <!--del_lnk--> municipalities. It is located in the southeast area of Caracas and in the northwest part of Miranda.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> seat of the <!--del_lnk--> municipal government is <!--del_lnk--> El Hatillo Town, founded in 1784 by <!--del_lnk--> Don Baltasar de Le&oacute;n, who also participated in the development of the region. Although the town had its origins during the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonization, it was not until 1991 when the municipality was established. In 2000, the year after a new <!--del_lnk--> constitution was introduced in Venezuela, some of the powers of the municipality were delegated to a mayor&#39;s office called <i>Alcald&iacute;a Mayor</i> which also took control over the other four municipalities of Caracas.<p>El Hatillo still preserves some of its <!--del_lnk--> colonial architecture, including an <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a> <!--del_lnk--> parish church, therefore, it is a place of interest for <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">visitors</a> to the city. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism; music festivals, art expositions and other cultural events are held in the municipality. Even though commercial areas are growing fast, agriculture still remains as an economic income in the rural areas of the municipality, which still represent the southern part of El Hatillo.<p>

      <p>In the 16th century, when the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonization in the area began, El Hatillo was inhabited by the <!--del_lnk--> indigenous <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribe</a> <!--del_lnk--> Mariches, descendants of the <!--del_lnk--> Caribs. <!--del_lnk--> Cacique Tamanaco was the leader of these tribes at the time. He is known for <!--del_lnk--> resisting the Spanish colonization, but very little is written about the origins of the Mariches. As the colonization developed, the indigenous habitants were killed. By orders of Caracas&#39; founder <!--del_lnk--> Diego de Losada, Tamanaco was also murdered.<p>Around 1752, <!--del_lnk--> Don Baltasar de Le&oacute;n Garc&iacute;a arrived to El Hatillo from <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;diz, <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, after completing his years as a prisoner at <i>La Carraca</i> for participating with his father in an <!--del_lnk--> insurgency against the Guipuzcoana Company. Don Baltasar founded El Hatillo Town, and he was one of the most significant contributors to its development at the time. Don Baltasar focused on making El Hatillo a strong, united and independent community. Don Baltasar tried to establish the place as a different <!--del_lnk--> parish from Baruta. On <!--del_lnk--> June 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1784, he accomplished this when the governor and the <!--del_lnk--> bishop agreed to declare the autonomy of El Hatillo in front of 180 <!--del_lnk--> Canary-descendant families, and under the direction of Don Baltasar. This date is currently accepted as the foundation of El Hatillo Town.<p>In 1803, Don Baltasar and his <!--del_lnk--> brother-in-law donated their properties to urbanize the town. An engineer took care of the job, which included <!--del_lnk--> grid streets and a <!--del_lnk--> parish church, built in honour to <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo, who had supposedly saved Baltasar from a <!--del_lnk--> plague that killed his father in prison.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In 1809, Manuel de Escalona achieved the separation of El Hatillo from Petare, another suburb of Caracas, making it a different <i>Tenientazgo de Justicia</i>. On <!--del_lnk--> April 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1810, Escalona incorporated the town to the movement of independence, becoming another important person in the municipality.<p>Ana Francisca P&eacute;rez Garc&iacute;a, Don Baltasar&#39;s wife, was also a significant woman in El Hatillo. She was caring with children, elders and ill citizens. Ana Francisca donated a considerable amount of money for the construction of a hospital in Petare after the 1812 earthquake. This hospital is currently known as the P&eacute;rez de Le&oacute;n de Petare Hospital.<p>Although El Hatillo was independent from Petare since 1809, it became part of Sucre Municipality at some point, which is where Petare is located. It is unclear how so happened, but on <!--del_lnk--> November 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1991, Miranda&#39;s Legislative Assembly gave El Hatillo full autonomy, making it an independent municipality. This decision was issued in <i>Gaceta Oficial</i> on <!--del_lnk--> January 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1992. In 1993, Mercedes Hern&aacute;ndez de Silva was elected the first <!--del_lnk--> mayor of El Hatillo, who took charge until 1996, when Flora Aranguren was elected mayor. On 2000, <!--del_lnk--> Alfredo Catal&aacute;n Schick was elected, and then re-elected in 2004 for another four-year term.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>El Hatillo Municipality is located at the northwest corner of the State of Miranda and at the southeast area of the city of Caracas. It is one of the state&#39;s 21 municipalities. El Hatillo is within the jurisdiction of the <i>Alcald&iacute;a Mayor</i>, which has power over three other adjacent municipalities of Miranda, and over <!--del_lnk--> Libertador Municipality in the <!--del_lnk--> Capital District. These five municipalities make up the city of Caracas. El Hatillo has a land size of <!--del_lnk--> 114 km&sup2;, making it the third largest municipality in the capital. The municipality is located at the <i>Serran&iacute;a del Interior</i>, a mountain range <!--del_lnk--> parallel to the Coastal Range, which spans east-west. The Turgua Range provides a natural boundary for the south of the municipality. El Hatillo limits north with Sucre and Baruta, south with Baruta and Paz Castillo, east with Sucre and Paz Castillo, and west with Baruta. The main streams in the municipality are Tusmare, at the centre of El Hatillo, and Prepo near the southern edge.<p>The tallest <!--del_lnk--> peak in El Hatillo is <!--del_lnk--> Picacho de El Volc&aacute;n, at 1,490 m over sea level, where many radio, television and telecommunication antennas serve Caracas. Despite its name, which in Spanish means &quot;Peak of The <a href="../../wp/v/Volcano.htm" title="Volcano">Volcano</a>&quot;, the mountain has no recorded volcanic history. Other significant mountains in El Hatillo are Gavil&aacute;n (1,148 m), Topo de El Pauj&iacute; (1,245 m) and Topo de Piedras Pintadas (1,196 m).<p><a id="Climate_and_environment" name="Climate_and_environment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Climate and environment</span></h3>
      <p>El Hatillo has a slightly cooler weather than downtown Caracas, which is caused by the higher altitude of the municipality. The average temperatures are between 21 and 24 degrees <!--del_lnk--> Celsius (70-75<!--del_lnk--> &deg;F). In the highest elevations of the municipalities the temperature can decrease to 18 &deg;C (64 &deg;F) and the atmosphere may have constant <!--del_lnk--> fog. The mean <!--del_lnk--> precipitation is 997.3 millimeters a year; annual values can range from 800 mm to 1500 mm. The average <!--del_lnk--> humidity index is 75%, and like in the rest of the country, the months of May through November belong to the rainy season while all other months correspond to the dry season. The winds are north aliz&eacute; <!--del_lnk--> trade winds.<p>The <a href="../../wp/v/Vegetation.htm" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a> of El Hatillo is formed by dense <!--del_lnk--> forests in most of the municipality. <!--del_lnk--> Trees occupy 30% of the surface along <!--del_lnk--> water bodies. Smaller plants like <!--del_lnk--> shrubs take around 9% and <!--del_lnk--> herbs occupy a similar percentage. In 1972, the forests of El Hatillo were declared protected zone of the metropolitan area of Caracas. The municipality is home for a wide range of <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">bird</a> <!--del_lnk--> species, with more than two hundred of these animals registered, including various types of <a href="../../wp/s/Sparrowhawk.htm" title="Sparrowhawk">sparrowhawks</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Eagle.htm" title="Eagle">eagles</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Falcon.htm" title="Falcon">falcons</a>, and <a href="../../wp/o/Owl.htm" title="Owl">owls</a>. This has encouraged <!--del_lnk--> birdwatching in the area, an activity that is promoted by the authorities of Miranda, who have also supported conservation of the species.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h3>

      <p>Prior to the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish colonization, El Hatillo was inhabited by <!--del_lnk--> Mariches, a native tribe related to the <!--del_lnk--> Caribs. In the 16th century the indigenous inhabitants were killed by the explorers. When the development in El Hatillo began, <!--del_lnk--> Spaniards coming from the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands settled in the area. Similarly, families from <!--del_lnk--> Madeira, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>, immigrated to El Hatillo.

      <p>Even though there are no defined limits for the <!--del_lnk--> neighborhoods of El Hatillo, the government website divides the municipality into <!--del_lnk--> urban and <!--del_lnk--> rural. Concentrated in the northern region of the municipality, the urban neighbourhood are El Hatillo Town, El Calvario, La Lagunita, Alto Hatillo, La Boyera, Las Mar&iacute;as, Oripoto, Los Pomelos, Los Naranjos, Los Geranios, La Caba&ntilde;a, Cerro Verde and Llano Verde, Colinas, Vista El Valle, Los Olivos, and El Cigarral. The rural localities of the municipality are located in southern El Hatillo. These are La Uni&oacute;n, Corralito, Turgua, La Hoyadita, Sabaneta, La Mata, Caicaguana, Los Naranjos and Altos de Halc&oacute;n.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>The economy of El Hatillo Municipality can be broken down in three sectors: the <!--del_lnk--> commercial sector, which has been growing along with the demographic increase and is primarily represented by shopping malls and stores around the urban areas of the municipality; <!--del_lnk--> agricultural, in the southern half of the municipality and existing since the founding of El Hatillo; and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, which contributes significantly to El Hatillo&#39;s income and is promoted by the government.<p>El Hatillo is a day visit for people in Caracas; the municipality is close to downtown, therefore, the place has been focused for tourism. Plaza Bol&iacute;var and its surroundings are very well maintained, additionally, the municipality government offers bus trips around the narrow streets of the town, showing people the colonial architecture. Handcrafted <!--del_lnk--> souvenirs are sold well. Hansi, a very popular shop offers all kinds of handcrafted products. There are at least three cultural centers in the municipality that attract tourists and residents to music festivals and art expositions. See <i>activities and recreation</i> below for more information.<p>Businesses in the municipality are almost strictly commercial. This fact has been taken as a cause of the high traffic in El Hatillo; those seeking employment within the municipality will have a better chance of finding one under commercial activities, but for office jobs, citizens need to look outside El Hatillo. This status of office underdevelopment has been attributed to several issues, there is no room for large scale office constructions, and for terrains available, the costs go very high.<p>Due to the increasing population, extensive <!--del_lnk--> shopping malls have been recently built in the municipality. Neighborhoods like La Lagunita, Los Naranjos and El Hatillo Town now offer large scale shopping malls with multiplex <!--del_lnk--> movie theaters, and the old typical houses of El Hatillo Town have been converted to shops, while preserving their colonial look. El Hatillo also receives income from agriculture.<p><a id="Law_and_government" name="Law_and_government"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Law and government</span></h2>
      <p>The law of Venezuela specifies that municipal governments have four main functions. The executive function is managed by the <!--del_lnk--> mayor, who is in charge of representing the municipality&#39;s administration. The legislative branch is represented by the Municipal Council, formed by seven <!--del_lnk--> councillors. This entity in charge of the deliberation of new decrees and local laws. The comptrolling tasks are managed by the municipal <!--del_lnk--> comptroller&#39;s office, which is in charge of the revision of <a href="../../wp/a/Accountancy.htm" title="Accountancy">accountancy</a>. Finally, planning is represented by the Local Public Planning Council, whose job is of managing projects for the development of the municipality.<p>The president of the Municipal Council is Leandro Pereira, supported by the <!--del_lnk--> political party <!--del_lnk--> Justice First. All but one of the seven councillors belong to parties opposed to <!--del_lnk--> President <!--del_lnk--> Hugo Ch&aacute;vez&#39;s administration. Additionally to the authorities mentioned before, there is a Legislative Commission, currently presided by councillor Salvador Pirrone. The commission&#39;s job is to assist the municipality in legal matters, like the creation of new laws and decrees.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> March 8, <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the year after a new constitution was introduced in Venezuela, it was <!--del_lnk--> decreed in <i>Gaceta Oficial</i> N&deg; 36,906 that the <!--del_lnk--> Metropolitan District of Caracas would be created, and that some of the powers of El Hatillo would be delegated to the <i>Alcald&iacute;a Mayor</i>, which would also start governing the Baruta, Libertador, Sucre and Chacao municipalities. Venezuelan municipalities are subdivided in parishes. Unlike other municipalities, El Hatillo only has one, the Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo Parish, sometimes denoted as Santa Rosal&iacute;a de El Hatillo Parish or simply El Hatillo parrish.<p>El Hatillo has had three mayors so far. From 1993 until 1996, Mercedes Hern&aacute;ndez de Silva was the first mayor of the municipality. Following that, Flora Aranguen served from 1996 until 2000. That same year, Alfredo Catal&aacute;n was elected mayor. In 2004 he was reelected; his term is set to end in 2008.<p><a id="Catalan.27s_administration" name="Catalan.27s_administration"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Catalan&#39;s administration</span></h3>
      <p>In 2001 the mayor stated that his main goal for the municipality was to promote it as a touristic destination. In fact, Catal&aacute;n&#39;s first year in office was focused on improving the appearance of the municipality, and the El Hatillo Independent Institute of Tourism and Recreation was created. Operation Joy (Spanish: <i>Operaci&oacute;n Alegr&iacute;a</i>), a project that attempts to make the municipality cleaner and nicer, has been in action during Catal&aacute;n&#39;s government.<p>According to the municipality website, the current government has made improvements to the <!--del_lnk--> educational facilities of the area, including the repair of five state-owned schools that support 1,400 students. Special programs have been implemented for students, such as drug prevention, water conservation, the Francisco de Miranda Project, which suggests the use of <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a> to improve children&#39;s education, and other programs that also benefit the municipality by getting citizens more involved in the community activities.<p>In terms of <a href="../../wp/h/Health.htm" title="Health">health</a>, El Hatillo houses the Jes&uacute;s Regetti <!--del_lnk--> Ambulatory, where citizens from inside and outside the municipality receive medical attention. According to the municipality, in 2004, 50,000 citizens of all ages benefited from this medical facility. The government claims that <!--del_lnk--> crimes that occur in El Hatillo only represent 1% of the crimes in Caracas. However, citizens criticize the municipality&#39;s insecurity and are unsure about the quality of health services and educational institutions. Read <i>criticism</i> below for more information.<p><a id="Criticism" name="Criticism"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Criticism</span></h4>
      <p>Some individuals, such as the journalist Nelson Bocaranda, have criticized the municipal government regarding its insecurity. Several examples that support Bocaranda&#39;s criticism exist. In early March 2006, two 24 and 25 years old men were gunned down after leaving a party at two o&#39;clock on a Sunday morning. On <!--del_lnk--> March 11, a 30 year old and a teenager died after being gun-shot 30 times at El Calvario neighbourhood. Bocaranda himself was a victim of death threats after criticizing Catal&aacute;n&#39;s administration in his radio emission <i>Los Run Runes de Nelson</i>. According to the <!--del_lnk--> IFEX, the mayor&#39;s father Norberto Catal&aacute;n, went to Bocaranda&#39;s office in La Lagunita with his bodyguard. Bocaranda was not in his office at the time, but his secretary was told that Norberto was armed and he would shoot the journalist if he did not take his comments back within 24 hours. The mayor&#39;s father also left threatening notes. A security video camera recorded the incident.<p>Violence is not be the only problem, since some other governmental shortcomings are also apparent. Urban planning has been insufficient, the demographic increment in recent years has caused the traffic to collapse during <!--del_lnk--> rush hour, and the public services are insufficient in some areas. Neighbors claim that public schools are in a bad state and that many students cannot attend classes due to <!--del_lnk--> socioeconomic problems. Likewise, citizens have alerted the media that health services are mediocre in the municipality.<p><a id="Bankruptcy" name="Bankruptcy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Bankruptcy</span></h4>
      <p>In 2001, Alfredo Catal&aacute;n mentioned in several occasions that the municipality was <!--del_lnk--> bankrupted. He said to the media that a lot had been done for El Hatillo for a first year in office, and since the beginning of his fist term, Catal&aacute;n had given priority to tourism. Between the five municipalities of Caracas, El Hatillo receives the least income from taxes, but he believed that Operation Joy would give the residents trust in the mayor, and more investments have been done in culture and tourism than in a new local government headquarters for example. Catal&aacute;n denounced that Flora Aranguren, the previous mayor, had left a <!--del_lnk--> deficit of almost <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>500,000 between <!--del_lnk--> budget and <!--del_lnk--> treasury.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>El Hatillo offers free <!--del_lnk--> public education. There is a total of seventeen <!--del_lnk--> primary education <!--del_lnk--> schools, in which eleven are public and six are <!--del_lnk--> private. Nineteen <!--del_lnk--> preschools exist, ten public and nine private. Data for <!--del_lnk--> secondary education is incomplete. It is only known that five private secondary schools exist in the municipality, but the number of public schools of this kind is unavailable. Note that the the data presented shows each educational stage separately, but a one facility may contain preschool, primary and secondary education.<p>The municipality has only one <!--del_lnk--> higher education facility, Nueva Esparta University. This three <!--del_lnk--> ha institution located in Los Naranjos began as a project with the creation of Nueva Esparta school in 1954, but it was not until 1989 when the university was constructed. This university is privately owned.<p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p>The methods of transportation in the municipality are basically private vehicles and road <!--del_lnk--> public transportation. The geographic features of El Hatillo have made it hard to extend the <!--del_lnk--> Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas. A long range line of the metro known as <!--del_lnk--> Line 5 (Magneta) has been proposed, but likely due to the geographic characteristics of southeast Caracas, it has not been constructed. The municipality&#39;s latest <!--del_lnk--> urban planning has been unorganized. News archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial constructions. New or enhanced alternative roads that will definitely fix the problem have not been finished. A south <!--del_lnk--> beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to high costs. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay&mdash;a neighbourhood in northeast Caracas&mdash;is under construction and it is planned to be finished in 2010. According to Catal&aacute;n, 23% of El Hatillo&#39;s inhabitants will eventually use this transit way.<p>Even though local solutions, such as the ones mentioned above, may improve the <!--del_lnk--> traffic congestions that affect El Hatillo, the traffic issue is a large scale problem that affects the whole city. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas on a daily basis, making the transportation networks &quot;collapse.&quot; The average speed of automobiles is 15 Km/h. Several causes for this problem have been given. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, an organized city should give 20% of its public spaces to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% of these areas are given for transit purposes. From 2001 to 2006, 250 000 new cars were sold in Caracas. Only in 2004, 50 000 vehicles were sold. In 2005, this number increased to 60 000, and as of November 2006, 70 000 cars have been sold since the year began. Public transportation is not fully reliable, an average trip in the city using mass transit takes around 90 minutes.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>The most significant icon of El Hatillo culture is <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo. Today, the church of El Hatillo Town is named after this <!--del_lnk--> saint, and the only parish in the municipality also has her name. The locals believe that Rosal&iacute;a takes care of the people. The community is largely <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic</a>; handcrafted products in shops are religious, and the municipality holds the Santa Rosa de Lima <!--del_lnk--> Seminary, formerly San Jos&eacute; Seminary. Like in the rest of Venezuela, in El Hatillo, the images of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mary have become part of the art and culture.<p>Don Baltasar de Le&oacute;n is remembered for founding and developing El Hatillo, so is his wife Ana Francisca. Manuel Escalona is recognized for including El Hatillo in the movement of the independence in the 19th century, as in the whole nation <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a> is considered a <!--del_lnk--> hero.<p><a id="Heritage" name="Heritage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heritage</span></h3>

      <p>Rosal&iacute;a is the <!--del_lnk--> patron <!--del_lnk--> saint of El Hatillo, she was born in <!--del_lnk--> Palermo, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> in 1130. Rosal&iacute;a was first recognized in 1624 when a horrible plague haunted Palermo. Santa Rosal&iacute;a appeared to many, and she became the patron of Palermo for saving many from the plague.<p>Years later, El Hatillo&#39;s founder believed too that Santa Rosal&iacute;a protected him from an infection. During the Guipuzcoana scandal in Venezuela, Baltasar&#39;s father Juan Francisco de Le&oacute;n and his sons were held prisoner in <!--del_lnk--> C&aacute;diz. Juan Francisco died as a consequence of <a href="../../wp/s/Smallpox.htm" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a>, but Don Baltasar completed his years in prison and then moved to El Hatillo, bringing the legacy of Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo to El Hatillo, saying that she protected him from the <!--del_lnk--> pestilence that killed his father in C&aacute;diz.<p>Consequently, El Hatillo&#39;s culture has grown around its most important patron, Santa Rosal&iacute;a is believed as the one who takes care of the people, she protects everyone from any <!--del_lnk--> pandemic that could hit the area. It was Don Baltasar who incorporated Rosal&iacute;a to the culture of El Hatillo. In 1766 the first <!--del_lnk--> chapel&mdash;now in El Calvario neighbourhood&mdash;was built in El Hatillo, but in 1784 a bigger <!--del_lnk--> parish church was built, which was named <i>Iglesia Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo</i>.<p><a id="Art_and_music" name="Art_and_music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Art and music</span></h3>

      <p>At the present there are frequent cultural events that revive the history of El Hatillo. The Cultural and Social Center El Hatillo, El Hatillo Art Centre and El Hatillo Atheneum are the places where most activities take place. Every year around the town&#39;s anniversary, the municipality&#39;s past is relived through the International Music Festival of El Hatillo and El Hatillo Week. There are also <!--del_lnk--> art galleries with frequent expositions. Holidays&mdash;whether they are nationwide or local&mdash;are always celebrated, and every September El Hatillo remembers Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo.<p>El Hatillo is home for performances from national and international musicians. In November 2005, the 7th El Hatillo Jazz Festival took place, a ten-days event that brings many visitors to the municipality to hear the notes from the best national <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> artists. In <!--del_lnk--> April 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, <!--del_lnk--> Dave Samuels inaugurated a music festival in El Hatillo Art Centre.

      <p>The hub of activity in El Hatillo is Bol&iacute;var Plaza (Spanish: <i>Plaza Bol&iacute;var</i>), a garden square encompassing the central block in the town of El Hatillo. Constructed in 1785, the Plaza was originally called <i>Plaza Mayor</i> or <i>Plaza del Mercado</i>. In 1911, a <!--del_lnk--> bust honoring Manuel Escalona was placed in the square, which was renamed in his honour. In 1952, the bust was replaced with a statue of Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var, and the plaza was again renamed, after the Venezuelan hero. Across from the Bol&iacute;var Square is the 18th-century Santa Rosal&iacute;a de Palermo Church, which was declared a National Historic Monument in 1960.<div class="thumb tleft">

Sucre Plaza (Spanish: <i>Plaza Sucre</i>)&mdash;graced since 1915 with a <!--del_lnk--> ceiba tree at its centre&mdash;is in the southern part of town; this was historically where people tied their mules while frequenting The Four Corners. The Four Corners (Spanish: <i>Las Cuatro Esquinas</i>) was a convenient social gathering spot in El Hatillo, comprising a general store, hardware shop, gambling place and bar.<p>La Lagunita is the site of one of the 15 <!--del_lnk--> Romanian Orthodox Churchs in the world since the widespread destruction of churches by the Ceacescu regime in Romania: the San Constantino and Santa Elena Romanian Orthodox Church.
