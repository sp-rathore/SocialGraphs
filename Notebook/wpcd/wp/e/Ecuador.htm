      <p>Advanced <!--del_lnk--> indigenous peoples flourished in Ecuador long before the area was mostly conquered by the <!--del_lnk--> Inca empire in the 15th century. Through a succession of wars and marriages with the different nations that inhabited the Interandean valley, the region became part of the Inca Empire. <!--del_lnk--> Atahualpa, one of the sons of the Inca emperor <!--del_lnk--> Huayna Capac, was born in Quito. However, he could not receive the crown of the Empire since the emperor had another son, <!--del_lnk--> Huascar, born in <!--del_lnk--> Cusco, the capital of the Inca Empire. Therefore the empire was divided in two: Atahualpa received the north, with his capital in Quito, and Huascar received the south with its capital in <!--del_lnk--> Cuzco. In 1531, the <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> <!--del_lnk--> conquistadors, under <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Pizarro, arrived in an Inca empire torn by civil war. Atahualpa wanted to align with the Spanish to defeat Huascar and reign over a re-unified Incan empire. The Spanish, however, had conquest intentions and established themselves in a fort in <!--del_lnk--> Cajamarca, captured Atahualpa during the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Cajamarca and held him for ransom. A room was filled with gold to secure his release. During his capture, <!--del_lnk--> Atahualpa arranged for the murder of his half-brother Huascar in Cuzco. The stage was set for the Spaniards to take over the Incan empire. Despite being surrounded and vastly outnumbered, the Spanish executed Atahualpa. To escape the confines of the fort, the Spaniards fired all their cannons and broke through the lines of the bewildered Incans. In subsequent years the Spanish colonists became the new elite centering their power in <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>.<p>The indigenous population was decimated by disease in the first decades of Spanish rule &mdash; a time when the natives also were forced into the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> encomienda&quot; labor system for Spanish landlords. In 1563, <a href="../../wp/q/Quito.htm" title="Quito">Quito</a> became the seat of a royal &quot;audiencia&quot; (administrative district) of Spain and part of the Peruvian Viceroyalty with its capital in Lima.<p>After nearly 300 years of Spanish colonization, Quito was a city of about 10,000 inhabitants, and it was there in 1822 that Ecuador joined <a href="../../wp/s/Sim%25C3%25B3n_Bol%25C3%25ADvar.htm" title="Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var">Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Gran Colombia, only to become a separate republic in 1830.<p>The 19th century was marked by instability, with a rapid succession of rulers. The conservative <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Garcia Moreno unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. In the late 1800s, world demand for <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">cocoa</a> tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.<p>A coastal-based liberal revolution in 1895 under <!--del_lnk--> Eloy Alfaro reduced the power of the clergy, and this liberal wing retained power until the military coup of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by populist politicians such as five-time President <!--del_lnk--> Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Velasco Ibarra.<p>Control over territory in the Amazon has led to a long-lasting dispute between Ecuador and <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a>. In 1941, in midst of fast-growing tensions between the two countries, war broke out. <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> claimed that Ecuador&#39;s military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion while Ecuador, on the other hand, claimed Peru invaded Ecuador. In July 1941 troops were mobilized. Peru had an <!--del_lnk--> army of 11,681 troops, facing a poorly supplied and badly armed Ecuadorian force of 5,300 soldiers, of which a little over 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces of the country. Hostilities broke on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river on several spots, testing the strength and disposition of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of El Oro. Over the course of the war <a href="../../wp/p/Peru.htm" title="Peru">Peru</a> gained control over all the disputed territory and occupied the Ecuadorian province of <!--del_lnk--> El Oro and some parts of the province of <!--del_lnk--> Loja (some 6% of the country), demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up their territorial claims. The <!--del_lnk--> Peruvian Navy blocked the port of <!--del_lnk--> Guayaquil, cutting supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the U.S and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalised in the <!--del_lnk--> Rio Protocol, signed on January 29, 1942, in favour of hemispheric unity against the <!--del_lnk--> Axis Powers in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. As a result of its victory, Peru was awarded the disputed territory. Two more wars would follow to finally end the dispute. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> Paquisha Incident and <!--del_lnk--> Cenepa War</i><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, the construction of the Andian pipeline, which brought oil from the east to the coast was completed, making Ecuador South America&#39;s second largest oil producer. That same year a nationalist military <a href="../../wp/m/Military_dictatorship.htm" title="Military dictatorship">junta</a> overthrew the government, remaining in power until 1979 when more <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democratic</a> constitutional measures were implemented. By 1982, the government faced an economic crisis, characterized by high <!--del_lnk--> inflation, budget deficits, a falling currency, mounting debt service, and uncompetitive industries, leading to chronic government instability.<p>Many years of mismanagement, starting with the mishandling of the country&#39;s debt during the 1970s military regime, have left the country essentially ungovernable. By the mid 90s, the government of Ecuador has been characterized by a weak executive branch that struggles to appease the ruling classes, represented in the legislative and judiciary. The last three democratically elected <!--del_lnk--> presidents have failed to finish their terms during that period.<p>Among the most relevant factors in the democratic instability is the emergence of the indigenous population as an active constituency. The population were motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform and lower unemployment, and by historical exploitation by the land-holding elite.<p>Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the Elite and Leftist movements, have led to a deterioration of the executive office. The public and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital to work with, as happened when in April 2005 Ecuador&#39;s Congress ousted President <!--del_lnk--> Lucio Guti&eacute;rrez. The Vice-President, <!--del_lnk--> Alfredo Palacio, took his place and remained in office until the presidential <!--del_lnk--> election of <!--del_lnk--> 15 October <!--del_lnk--> 2006, which did not produce a conclusive winner. The two highest polling candidates on that occasion, <!--del_lnk--> Alvaro Noboa and <!--del_lnk--> Rafael Correa went on a runoff election on <!--del_lnk--> 26 November, which results showed Correa winning the election with 56.8% of the vote.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

Ecuador is a member of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> (and most of its specialized agencies) and also is a member of many regional groups, including the <!--del_lnk--> Rio Group, the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American Economic System, the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American Energy Organization, the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American Integration Association, and The <!--del_lnk--> Andean Pact. Ecuador holds close relations with the US. In 2006, a contract breach from Occidental, a North American oil company, created stress in the USA-Ecuador relations. The Ecuadorian government declared the contract with the oil giant invalid, being the main cause for the delay in the Free Trade Agreement negotiation talks between the two countries. The Atpdea treaty will soon expire, meaning that commerce with the US will be significantly reduced, pressuring Ecuador to look for other international markets.<p>The outlook for the flower industry, in particular, is grim. The US buys 75% of all of Ecuador&#39;s flower exports. Ecuador&#39;s foreign policy failure is estimated to cost the country 30,000 jobs per year.  <a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Ecuador has three main geographic regions, plus an insular region in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.<ol>
       <li><i>La Costa,</i> or the coast, comprises the low-lying littoral in the western part of the country, including the Pacific coastline.<li><i>La Sierra</i> (&quot;the saw&quot;) is the high-altitude belt running north to south along the centre of the country, its mountainous <!--del_lnk--> terrain dominated by the <a href="../../wp/a/Andes.htm" title="Andes">Andes</a> mountain range.<li><i>El Oriente</i> (&quot;the east&quot;) comprises the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_Rainforest.htm" title="Amazon rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> areas in the eastern part of the country, accounting for just under half of the country&#39;s total surface area, though populated by under 5% of the population.<li>Finally, the <i>Regi&oacute;n Insular</i> is the region comprising the <a href="../../wp/g/Gal%25C3%25A1pagos_Islands.htm" title="Gal&aacute;pagos Islands">Gal&aacute;pagos Islands</a>, some 1,000 kilometers (620&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.</ol>
      <p>Ecuador&#39;s capital is <a href="../../wp/q/Quito.htm" title="Quito, Ecuador">Quito</a>, and is located in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Pichincha in the Sierra region. Its largest city is <!--del_lnk--> Guayaquil, located in the province of <!--del_lnk--> Guayas in the Costa. <a href="../../wp/c/Cotopaxi.htm" title="Cotopaxi">Cotopaxi</a>, which is located just south of <a href="../../wp/q/Quito.htm" title="Quito">Quito</a>, in the neighbouring province of that same name, is often wrongly claimed to be the world&#39;s highest active volcano, but several peaks in northern Chile and southern Peru are higher and (at least currently) more active.<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Ecuador has substantial <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> resources and rich agricultural areas. Because the country exports primary products such as oil, <a href="../../wp/b/Banana.htm" title="Banana">bananas</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> shrimp, fluctuations in world market prices can have a substantial domestic impact. Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market. Deteriorating economic performance in 1997-98 culminated in a severe economic and financial crisis in 1999. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks, including the El Ni&ntilde;o weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global oil prices in 1997-98, and international emerging market instability in 1997-98. These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador&#39;s unsustainable economic policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in an 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2% and a 65% devaluation of the national currency in 1999, which helped precipitate an unprecedented default on external loans later that year.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the administration of President Jamil Mahuad announced its intention to adopt the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. dollar as the official currency of Ecuador to address the ongoing economic crisis. The adoption of the U.S. dollar as currency, as opposed to pegging a local currency to it, means that the benefits of <!--del_lnk--> seigniorage accrue to the U.S. economy whether or not there is any compensation for this. Subsequent protest led to the removal of Mahuad from office and the elevation of Vice President Gustavo Noboa to the presidency.<p>The Noboa government confirmed its commitment to dollarize as the centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy. The government also entered into negotiations with the <!--del_lnk--> International Monetary Fund (IMF), culminating in the negotiation of a 12-month stand-by arrangement with the Fund. Additional policy initiatives include efforts to reduce the government&#39;s fiscal deficit, implement structural reforms to strengthen the banking system and regain access to private capital markets. Buoyed by high oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2000, with GDP rising 1.9%. However, 70% of the population lives below the <!--del_lnk--> poverty line, more than double the rate of 5 years ago. Inflation in 2000 remained high at 96.1%, but the rate of inflation continues to fall. Monthly inflation in February 2001 was 2.9%.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Ecuador&#39;s population is ethnically diverse. The largest ethnic group is comprised of <i><a href="../../wp/m/Mestizo.htm" title="Mestizo">Mestizos</a></i>, the mixed descendants of Spanish colonists and indigenous Amerindians, who constitute just over 65% of the population. <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians are second in numbers and account for approximately a quarter of the current population, around 25%. Whites are mainly <i><!--del_lnk--> criollos</i>, the relatively unmixed descendants of early Spanish colonists, and account for some 15%. The small <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Ecuadorian minority &mdash; including <!--del_lnk--> Mulattos and <i><!--del_lnk--> zambos</i>, and largely based in Esmeraldas and Ibarra &mdash; and immigrants from around the world constitute the remainder. Many foreign nationals have set up residence in Ecuador. There are sizeable expatriate Ecuadorian communities in Spain, Italy and the U.S.A.<p>The tropical forest region to the east of the mountains remains sparsely populated and contains only about 3% of the population.<p>Although the constitution demands that 30% of gross revenue be dedicated to education, the government&rsquo;s stated goal is to dedicate 11% of the budget. It is estimated that <!--del_lnk--> gross domestic product (GDP) spending will reach 4% in 2003. The UN Children&#39;s Fund (<!--del_lnk--> UNICEF) places adult literacy at 90%, but notes that this rate has been stagnant for more than ten years. The UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reports that only 87% of the primary school teachers and 72% of high school teachers have received training. The public education system is tuition-free, and attendance is mandatory from ages five to fourteen. However, the Ministry of Education reports that only 10% of five year olds actually have access to daily education and that only 66% of youngsters finish six years of schooling. In rural areas, only 10% of the youngsters go on to high school. Ministry statistics give the mean number of years completed as 6.7. Ecuador has sixty one universities, many of which now offer graduate degrees, although only 18% of the faculty in public universities possess graduate degrees. 300 Higher Institutes offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training. The Higher Education Reform Act transferred oversight of these poorly regulated institutes from the Ministry of Education to the CONESUP.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>

The film has been accused by several critics of painting an extremely distorted contrast between the coast (Guayaquil) and the highlands (Quito), which stems from the ever-present feelings of regionalism between the aforementioned parties.<p><i>Entre Marx y una Mujer Desnuda</i> (1995), known by the title <i>Between Marx and a Nude Woman</i>, is difficult to find, but this film created by Ecuadorian Camilo Luzuriaga provides a window into the life of young Ecuadorian leftists living in a country plagued by the remnants of feudal systems and coup d&#39;etats.<p>The 1991 film &quot;Sensaciones&quot; was directed by ecuadorean sieblings Juan Esteban Cordero and Viviena Cordero, and shot in Ecuador.
