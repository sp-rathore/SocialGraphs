In an interview with <!--del_lnk--> JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency, <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Jacques Dordain ESA&#39;s Director General (since 2003) outlined briefly the European Space Agency&#39;s mission:<blockquote>
       <p><i>Today space activities are pursued for the benefit of citizens, and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on earth. They want greater security and economic wealth, but they also want to pursue their dreams, to increase their knowledge, and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology.</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p><i>I think that space can do all of this: it can produce a higher quality of life, better security, more economic wealth, and also fulfil our citizens&#39; dreams and thirst for knowledge, and attract the young generation. This is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities. It has always been so, and it will be even more important in the future.</i></blockquote>

      <p>After the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">Second World War</a> many European scientists had left <!--del_lnk--> Western Europe in order to work either in the US or the Soviet Union. Although the booming recovering process of the 1950s made it possible for Western European countries to invest into research and specifically into space related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two major superpowers. In 1958, only months after the <!--del_lnk--> Sputnik shock, <!--del_lnk--> Edoardo Amaldi and <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Auger, two prominent members of the Western European scientific community at that time, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries, including <!--del_lnk--> Harrie Massey (UK).<p>The Western European nations decided to have two different agencies, one concerned to develop a launch system <!--del_lnk--> ELDO (European Launch Development Organisation) and the precursor of the European Space Agency, and <!--del_lnk--> ESRO (European Space Research Organisation) that was established on <!--del_lnk--> March 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1964 per an agreement signed on <!--del_lnk--> June 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1962. From 1968 to 1972 ESRO celebrated its first successes. Seven research satellites were brought into orbit, all by US launch systems.<p>The ESRO&#39;s successor organisation <!--del_lnk--> ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre, based in <!--del_lnk--> Noordwijk, <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">the Netherlands</a>) is still a part of ESA, though ESA itself is a much bigger organisation today. The ESA in its current form was founded in 1974, when ESRO was merged with <!--del_lnk--> ELDO. The ESA was constituted of 10 founding members: <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a><!--del_lnk--> .

      </div>
      <p>Beginning in the 1970s, when the <!--del_lnk--> space race between the US and the Soviet Union had tuned down and space budgets were cut dramatically in both <!--del_lnk--> superpowers, ESA established itself as a forerunner in space exploration. ESA joined NASA and the UK in the <!--del_lnk--> IUE, the world&#39;s first high-orbit <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>, which was launched in 1978 and operated very successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA began <!--del_lnk--> Giotto, its first deep-space mission, to study the Comets <a href="../../wp/c/Comet_Halley.htm" title="Comet Halley">Halley</a> and Grigg-Skejllerup. <!--del_lnk--> Hipparcos, a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s <!--del_lnk--> SOHO, <!--del_lnk--> Ulysses and the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> were all jointly carried out with NASA. Recent scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the <a href="../../wp/c/Cassini-Huygens.htm" title="Cassini-Huygens">Cassini-Huygens</a> space probe, to which ESA contributed by building the <!--del_lnk--> Titan landing module <!--del_lnk--> Huygens.<p>As the successor of the <!--del_lnk--> ELDO, ESA has also constructed rockets for unmanned scientific and commercial payloads. <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 1, launched in 1979, brought mostly-commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two developments of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and did establish ESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Its successor, the <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5 rocket, has established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market since its first successful flight in 1997 and prospectively will reach 25 successful launches by 2006.<p>The beginning of the new millennium saw ESA become, along with agencies like <!--del_lnk--> NASA, <!--del_lnk--> JAXA, and <!--del_lnk--> Roscosmos, one of the major participants in scientific space <!--del_lnk--> research. While ESA had relied on cooperation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the <!--del_lnk--> United States military) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on cooperation with Russia. A recent press issue thus stated:<blockquote>
       <p><i>Russia is ESA&#39;s first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already under way in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners.</i></blockquote>
      <p>Most notable for its new self-confidence are ESA&#39;s own recent successful missions <!--del_lnk--> Smart-1, a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology, the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Express mission as well as the development of the <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5 rocket.<p><a id="Further_goals_and_aims" name="Further_goals_and_aims"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Further goals and aims</span></h3>
      <p>ESA has ambitious space plans that may be divided into three large categories. First, ESA will maintain its scientific and research projects (e.g. tests and developments of new propulsion systems), try to find ways to reduce costs for their rocket fleet while enhancing their capacities, honour its commitments regarding the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">ISS</a> and engage in further <a href="../../wp/s/Space_exploration.htm" title="Space exploration">space exploration</a> like the <!--del_lnk--> Venus Express mission that was launched in late 2005. The second category has many parallels to NASA&#39;s plans and constitutes of astronomy-space missions such as the <!--del_lnk--> Planck Surveyor studying the cosmic microwave background (2008), the <!--del_lnk--> Herschel space observatory (2008), <!--del_lnk--> Corot that will be a milestone in the search for <!--del_lnk--> extrasolar planets and is due to launch in 2007 or the <!--del_lnk--> Darwin interferometer.<p>While the projects described above are more or less similar in their structure and aim as NASA&#39;s and other space agencies&#39; plans, the ESA&#39;s <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a> project is different. The <!--del_lnk--> Aurora Programme lays out a time table for future missions to <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a>, however in contrast to NASA&#39;s plans there is no emphasis on manned or unmanned <a href="../../wp/m/Moon.htm" title="Moon">lunar</a> missions, it rather includes several <i>flagship</i> missions designed to develop and test technology needed for a manned <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a> mission currently planned for 2030. Among these flagship missions is <!--del_lnk--> ExoMars, a mission involving a <!--del_lnk--> Mars rover. Until 2005 <!--del_lnk--> ExoMars was planned to be a joint mission between NASA and ESA, however obstacles such as American technology law that prohibits sharing of classified space technology information led to ESA deciding to go for it alone. The mission is currently planned to launch in 2013. An even more ambitious <a href="../../wp/m/Mars.htm" title="Mars">Mars</a> project is the <!--del_lnk--> Mars Sample Return Mission, that is planned as a follow-up mission to <!--del_lnk--> ExoMars. It will involve the first time a probe will return of samples from another planet, making it necessary to construct an ascent module that is capable of starting into Mars orbit and dock with the original probe.<p>Among the action for returning to the society the investment, they have developed the <!--del_lnk--> SCOS 2000 satellite control centre, and they allow the use of it free of charge to any European firm.<p><a id="Member_countries.2C_budget_and_organisations" name="Member_countries.2C_budget_and_organisations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Member countries, budget and organisations</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Overall_budget" name="Overall_budget"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Overall budget</span></h4>
      <p>The budget of ESA was announced as &euro;2.977 billion for 2005 (a ten percent increase on 2004) and for 2006 is estimated at &euro;2.904 billion. A large part of ESA&#39;s budget is invested in ESA&#39;s launch vehicles that are currently the most expensive part of ESA&#39;s activities (Twenty-two percent of the budget goes into launch vehicles; human space flight is second in budget expenditures). In 2005, the three largest contributors, together funding two thirds of ESA&#39;s budget, are France (29.3%), Germany (22.7%) and Italy (14.2%).<p>An important ministerial conference approved nearly all of ESA&#39;s budget requests in December 2005. The budget for the mandatory ESA programme, parts of the optional programme (i.e. optional for ESA&#39;s member states such as the ISS involvement) as well as important projects such as <!--del_lnk--> Aurora or the EU-backed <!--del_lnk--> Galileo navigation system have been approved. No decision has been reached with regard to ESA&#39;s involvement in the Russian <!--del_lnk--> Kliper project, a feasibility study worth &euro;50 million was not approved. ESA&#39;s budget will stay at about the same, however inflation-adjusted, level as 2005 throughout the next 5 years.<p><a id="Comparison_with_NASA" name="Comparison_with_NASA"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Comparison with NASA</span></h4>
      <p>In comparison with NASA&#39;s budget of sixteen billion <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">dollars</a> (&euro;13 billion), ESA&#39;s budget of &euro;3 billion superficially looks considerably less. However, in order to make a true comparison on funding levels between the U.S. and those European nations involved with the ESA, more factors have to be considered:<ul>
       <li><i>ESA member states fund separate national space agencies as well</i>: Unlike the US, European nations maintain both national space programs and contribute to ESA&#39;s space activities. Most of those national space agencies have considerable budgets provided for scientific space research and other space related programs as well as joint projects with ESA or other international programs. For instance, the <!--del_lnk--> Italian Space Agency (ASI) has a national budget for 2005 of about &euro;700 million, of which half is contributed to ESA and the other half is spent on its national or other programs. The <!--del_lnk--> German Aerospace Centre (German acronym DLR) has a separate budget for 2005 of &euro;700 million The French space program in 2005 was funded with &euro;1.7 billion, of which &euro;685 million are contributed to ESA and the rest of appr. &euro;1 billion to <!--del_lnk--> CNES&#39;s own budget and other national space programs. Taking these non-ESA space allocated funds of only those 3 major European countries together would amount to &euro;2 billion. Would all ESA memberstates national space agencies be added together with ESA&#39;s budget would more than double ESA&#39;s &euro;3 billion budget.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><i>ESA does not focus on human spaceflight</i>: Only about 16% of ESA&#39;s budget are human spaceflight related (&euro;500 million). In contrast considerable costs are incurred by NASA in maintaining the aging <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle. A single Space Shuttle launch costs more than $1 billion and during the last decades up to one-third of NASA&#39;s budget had to be invested in the Shuttle to keep it flying (for 2005, $5 billion are allocated for the Space Shuttle constituting 30% of the budget). Although ESA had plans for an own manned spacecraft such as <!--del_lnk--> Hermes, it has never actually developed or maintained a manned launch system, rather it has paid for seats on the American and Russian spacecrafts, and therefore was and is not focussing on a fully independent human spaceflight program. For a true comparison between the budgets and Europe&#39;s and the US&#39; focus in spaceflight this difference should be taken into account, that is for all non-human space related activities ESA memberstates and the US are not very far apart in terms of budgets (NASA&#39;s budget without the ISS, Space Shuttle and other human spaceflight related activity is about $9 billion, ESA and ESA memberstates allocate about &euro;4.5-5 billion (about $6 billion) to non-human spaceflight related space projects.) With NASA&#39;s commitment to the <!--del_lnk--> Vision for Space Exploration its focus on human spaceflight and budget expenditure for this segment of its space program will increase over the next decades. ESA has not stated that it intends to significantly enhance spending on human spaceflight.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><i>NASA&#39;s and ESA&#39;s administration structure is different</i>: After the <!--del_lnk--> space race activities of the 1960s and early 1970s, NASA has maintained a large administration and bureaucracy that still burdens both current projects and NASA budgets. ESA was never involved in large-scale political activity such as the space race, it therefore has always had a small and efficient structure and agency level comparable to a private company, as only about 1900 people are directly employed by ESA and many projects are allocated over different organisations in several European countries, with ESA coordinating these projects but not directly employing the people involved in the project (decentralized structure).</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><i>Both the US and Europe maintain space related projects outside their space programs</i>: As it is the case with the United States as well, some highly expensive European space projects are not within ESA&#39;s budget, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Galileo global positioning system. Funding for this &euro;4 billion project comes from special agreements between EU members and other international partners. Space related military spending both in the US and in Europe would increase space related spending if counted towards those entities&#39; space related activity.</ul>
      <p><a id="Comparison_with_other_space_agencies" name="Comparison_with_other_space_agencies"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Comparison with other space agencies</span></h4>
      <p>In terms of absolute cash budget size, the ESA has the second largest budget after NASA, with the Japanese <!--del_lnk--> JAXA having annual funds of &euro;1.6 billion at its disposal taking the third place, followed by the ambitious <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Space Agency with around &euro;1 billion and the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Space Agency which incurred a considerable boost in funding in 2006 with an annual federal budget of $800&ndash;900 million. The <!--del_lnk--> Indian Space Agency has about the same amount of funds available as Russia. If not counted as part of Europe&#39;s total space budget (ex-Russian) together with ESA&#39;s &euro;3 billion space budget (as outlined above) and other European space agencies, the <!--del_lnk--> French Space Agency would be in 4th place with &euro;1.7 billion.<p>One point in favour of the Russian Space Agency, the Chinese and the Indian space programmes, is that their budgets are growing rapidly largely stemming from the high growth rates of their economies, which leads to increasing amounts of money available with the government.<p>It should be noted that space programmes have high labour costs, thus in order to compare the actual funds available for each space agency some adjustment with regard to <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity in each country should be made. As PPP is 5.5 for India and 4.5 for China, their space programme budgets are actually worth more than the absolute euro/dollar figures. Still, considering that Russia, Europe, the US, China, India and Japan are all competing in commercial space launches and costs for rocket launches are in the same range for all of the forementioned countries, it seems that a modifier lower than 4 or 5 would be warranted for a true comparison of national space funding. A very good example of the true comparison of funding is the Russian Space Agency which partly due to its large experience in LEO manned space flight but also due to a higher <!--del_lnk--> purchasing power parity could sustain a manned space program comparable to <!--del_lnk--> NASA throughout the last 15 years despite its dramatically lower budget.<p><a id="Notable_national_space_agencies" name="Notable_national_space_agencies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Notable national space agencies</span></h3>

      <p><a id="Launch_vehicle_fleet" name="Launch_vehicle_fleet"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Launch vehicle fleet</span></h2>
      <p>ESA has made great progress towards its goal of having a complete fleet of launch vehicles in service, competing in all sectors of the launch market. ESA&#39;s fleet will soon consist of three major rocket designs, <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5, <!--del_lnk--> Soyuz and <!--del_lnk--> Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by <!--del_lnk--> Arianespace, an ESA subsidiary (a minority share is held by <!--del_lnk--> EADS as well), at ESA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> spaceport in French Guiana. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from other northern spaceports. In addition equatorial launches give spacecrafts an extra &#39;push&#39; of nearly 500 m/s due to the higher rotation velocity of someone standing on the equator than near the Earth&#39;s axis where rotation velocity approaches nil.<p><a id="Ariane_5" name="Ariane_5"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ariane 5</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5 rocket is the primary launcher of the ESA. Its maximum estimated <!--del_lnk--> payload is 6&ndash;10 metric tons to <!--del_lnk--> GTO and up to 21 metric tons to <!--del_lnk--> LEO. The launch craft has been in service since 1997 and replaced the <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 4. The Ariane rocket exists in several specifications, the heaviest one of these is the <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5 ECA that has been successfully launched in February 2005 for the first time, after it failed during its first test flight in 2002.<p>ESA&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Ariane <!--del_lnk--> 1, <!--del_lnk--> 2, <!--del_lnk--> 3 and <!--del_lnk--> 4 launchers (the latter of which was ESA&#39;s long time workhorse) have been retired.<p><a id="Soyuz_launch_vehicle" name="Soyuz_launch_vehicle"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Soyuz launch vehicle</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Soyuz is a Russian medium <!--del_lnk--> payload (ca. 3 metric tons to <!--del_lnk--> GTO) launcher to be brought into ESA service in 2007. ESA has entered into a &euro;340 million joint venture with the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Federal Space Agency over the use of the Soyuz launcher. Under the agreement, the Russian agency will manufacture Soyuz rocket parts for ESA, which will then be shipped to French Guiana for assembly. ESA benefits because it gains a medium <!--del_lnk--> payloads launcher, complementing its fleet while saving on development costs. In addition, the Soyuz rocket&mdash;which has been the Russian&#39;s space launch workhorse for some 40 years&mdash;is proven technology with a good safety record, which ESA might be happy to use for launching humans into space. Russia also benefits in that it will get access to the Kourou launch site. Launching from Kourou rather than <!--del_lnk--> Baikonur will allow the Russians to almost double the Soyuz payload (3.0 tonnes vs. 1.7 tonnes), because of Kourou&#39;s closer proximity to the equator. Both agencies benefit from the long term strategic cooperation that in addition will be used to jointly develop future technology. It is perhaps worth noting that France (ESA&#39;s largest contributor) has historically had good relations with Russia, which contributed to reaching the agreement.<p><a id="Vega" name="Vega"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vega</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Vega is ESA&#39;s small payload (ca. 1.5 metric tons to 700 km orbit) launcher; its first launch is planned for 2007. The leading ESA&#39;s member state for the Vega Programme is <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> contributing 65% of the costs. Vega itself has been designed to be a body launcher with three solid propulsion stages and an additional <!--del_lnk--> liquid propulsion upper module to place the cargo into the exact orbit intended. For a small-cargo rocket it is remarkable that Vega will be able to place multiple <!--del_lnk--> payloads into orbit.<p><a id="Human_space_flight" name="Human_space_flight"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Human space flight</span></h2>

      <p>At the time ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight, rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft: It was <!--del_lnk--> Czechoslovak <!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Remek who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet European in space (the first European in space being <a href="../../wp/y/Yuri_Gagarin.htm" title="Yuri Gagarin">Yuri Gagarin</a> of the Soviet Union) &mdash; on a <!--del_lnk--> Soviet <!--del_lnk--> Soyuz spacecraft, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Pole <!--del_lnk--> Miros&#x142;aw Hermaszewski and <!--del_lnk--> East German <!--del_lnk--> Sigmund J&auml;hn in the same year. This <!--del_lnk--> Soviet cooperation programme, known as <!--del_lnk--> Intercosmos, primarily involved the participation of <!--del_lnk--> Eastern bloc countries, however in 1982, <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Loup Chr&eacute;tien became the first western European cosmonaut on a flight to the <!--del_lnk--> Soviet <!--del_lnk--> Salyut 7 space station.<p>Because Chr&eacute;tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French <!--del_lnk--> CNES astronaut corps, the German <!--del_lnk--> Ulf Merbold is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the <!--del_lnk--> STS-9 space shuttle mission that included the first use of the European built <!--del_lnk--> Spacelab in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Beside paying for seats on the <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle, ESA continued its human space flight cooperation with the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and later <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, including numerous visits to <a href="../../wp/m/Mir.htm" title="Mir">Mir</a>.<p>During the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the <!--del_lnk--> European Astronaut Centre in <a href="../../wp/c/Cologne.htm" title="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> was established.

      <p>In the 1980s France pressed for an independent European manned launch vehicle. Around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of <!--del_lnk--> Hermes was introduced. The craft itself was modelled comparable to the first proposals of the <!--del_lnk--> Space Shuttle and constituted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have started from the parallelly developed <!--del_lnk--> Ariane 5 rocket. It was planned solely for use in LEO space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991, however the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> ESA looked forward to a cooperation with <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a> to build a next-generation human space vehicle. Thus the <!--del_lnk--> Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been invested.<p>In the 21st century ESA started new programmes in order to create an own manned spacecraft, most notably among its various projects and proposal is <!--del_lnk--> Hopper where a prototype built by <!--del_lnk--> EADS called <!--del_lnk--> Phoenix has already been tested. While projects such as <!--del_lnk--> Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, a new possibility has emerged. Following talks with the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Space Agency in 2004 and June 2005 a cooperation between ESA and the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Space Agency was announced to jointly work on the Russian designed <!--del_lnk--> Kliper shuttle, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond mere LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). <!--del_lnk--> Kliper constitutes the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russian</a> counterpart to the American <!--del_lnk--> Crew Exploration Vehicle programme. <!--del_lnk--> Kliper may see its first launch as early as 2012. It was speculated that Europe could finance part of it (development costs have recently been announced as 16 bn rubles which amounts solely to around &euro;500 million) and that it would even be possible that the lighter version of <!--del_lnk--> Kliper take off on an enhanced <!--del_lnk--> Soyuz rocket from both from <a href="../../wp/f/French_Guiana.htm" title="French Guiana">French Guiana</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Baikonur.<p>However a &euro;50 million participation study for <!--del_lnk--> Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not validated by the ESA member states. As a consequence, the participation of ESA remains an outstanding question. The situation is that the executive of ESA and its Human Spaceflight Directorate support Kliper, while the main contributing countries, and in particular <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, oppose the initiation of a new human space transportation project that would have ESA only be a junior partner in any project. <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Jacques Dordain has hinted that a decision on ESA&#39;s involvement in the project could be made as soon as June, 2006. In June 2006 ESA memberstates granted 15 million to the <!--del_lnk--> Advanced Crew Transportation System (ACTS) study, a two year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond LEO. This project is pursued with <!--del_lnk--> Roskosmos and has been labeled a successor-project to Kliper. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the ACTS spacecraft is contemplated for 2008.<p><a id="Projects" name="Projects"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Projects</span></h2>
