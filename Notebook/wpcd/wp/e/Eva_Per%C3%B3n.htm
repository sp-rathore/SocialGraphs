She is often referred to by the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish language diminutive <b>Evita</b>, which translates into English as &quot;Little Eva&quot;.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1951, Evita launched a campaign to be allowed to run for the office of Vice-President of Argentina. The nation&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> military, <a href="../../wp/o/Oligarchy.htm" title="Oligarchy">elite</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Juan Per&oacute;n himself all opposed and ultimately prevented Evita&#39;s candidacy. In <!--del_lnk--> 1952, Evita was given the official title of &quot;Spiritual Leader of the Nation&quot;. <p>Though she was never an officially elected political figure, most scholars agree that by her husband&#39;s second term in office Eva Per&oacute;n had come to exercise more power and influence within the government than anyone but her own husband.  This power derived from her leadership roles within the <!--del_lnk--> Pro-Peronist trade unions, the <!--del_lnk--> Eva Per&oacute;n Foundation, and the <!--del_lnk--> Female Peronist Party.  Many scholars agree that Evita was the most powerful woman in the history of her nation, and some claim that at the time of her death she was one of the most powerful women on earth. <p>

      <p>Iln the biography <i>Evita: The Real Life of Eva Per&oacute;n</i> Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that Eva Per&oacute;n was born on <!--del_lnk--> May 7, <!--del_lnk--> 1919, in <!--del_lnk--> Los Toldos, a small town in the <!--del_lnk--> Pampas, one hundred and fifty miles from the capital of Argentina. Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> birth certificate and <!--del_lnk--> baptismal records have not survived, but that those who claim to have seen them before they were destroyed say that the first names entered on the certificates were Eva Mar&iacute;a and the surname was listed as Ibarguren.  Tom&aacute;s de Elia and Juan Pablo Queiroz, editors of the photobiography <i>Evita: An Intimate Portrait of Eva Per&oacute;n</i>, agree that Eva Per&oacute;n was born in Los Toldos.  Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s own autobiography, which was originally published in Argentina in 1952 under the title <i>La Raz&oacute;n de mi Vida</i> (subsequently published in English speaking countries under the titles <i>My Mission in Life</i> and <i>Evita by Evita</i>), contains no dates, no reference to childhood occurrences, and does not list the location of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s birth nor her name at birth. <p>Eva Per&oacute;n spent her childhood in <!--del_lnk--> Jun&iacute;n, Buenos Aires Province, then a village in the Pampas. Her parents, Juan Duarte and Juana Ibarguren (often referred to as do&ntilde;a Juana), never married. Duarte was a rancher from nearby Chivilcoy, where he already had a wife and family. Fraser and Navarro claim that the &quot;second marriage&quot; that Duarte maintained with Ibarguren was not uncommon in rural Argentina and may in fact be related to the history of the region: &quot;The circumstances of war, the imperatives of the frontier and the complete absence of records meant that in nineteenth-century rural Argentina settlers took <!--del_lnk--> Indian women and left them and their children behind as they moved onwards, from settlement to settlement and region to region.&quot; <p>In 1920, when Eva was one year old, Duarte returned to his legal family, leaving Juana Ibarguren and her family of five children <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">impoverished</a>. As a result of the impoverishment, Ibarguren and her family moved to the poorest area of Jun&iacute;n. As a means of supporting herself and her children, Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was <!--del_lnk--> stigmatized by the abandonment of the father.  After Eva Per&oacute;n became powerful, it would be claimed that during this period of their lives Ibarguren had run a <!--del_lnk--> brothel in which Eva Per&oacute;n herself was a <!--del_lnk--> prostitute. Even <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, arguably Argentina&#39;s most celebrated writer, endorsed this belief.  Most biographers, such as Tomas Eloy Martinez, write that such claims are not true. <p><a id="Father.27s_death" name="Father.27s_death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Father&#39;s death</span></h3>
      <p>In 1926, Juan Duarte was killed in a car accident in Chivilcoy. Juana Ibarguren attended the <!--del_lnk--> funeral with her five children. Due to the conventions of early 20th century Argentina, the presence of Ibarguren and her children at Juan Duarte&#39;s funeral was seen as an affront. Legally, Ibarguren and her children did not exist for Duarte&#39;s married family. When the Ibarguren family arrived at the funeral, write Fraser and Navarro, a violent argument broke out between Ibarguren and Duarte&#39;s legal wife regarding the right of Ibarguren and her children to attend the funeral. It was only after the intervention of the wife&#39;s brother, Mayor of Chivilcoy, that Ibarguren and her children were allowed to view the body of Juan Duarte. After the <!--del_lnk--> wake, the Ibarguren family was not allowed to walk with the Duarte family behind Juan Duarte&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> hearse, but was required to walk with the undifferentiated crowd that followed the procession of the legally recognized family. <p>Much has been made about the importance of this episode in the development of the <!--del_lnk--> character of Eva Per&oacute;n. The usual interpretation is that this incident implanted in Eva Per&oacute;n a dislike, even hatred for, the <!--del_lnk--> middle and <!--del_lnk--> upper classes, and set her up for her future role as champion of the poor and lower classes of Argentines. For example, in the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical <i>Evita</i> the title character sings: &quot;Screw the middle classes/I will never accept them and they will never deny me anything again/My father&#39;s other family were middle class/And we were kept out of sight, hidden from view at his funeral.&quot;  The closest Eva Per&oacute;n herself ever came to referring to this incident was to write in her autobiography: &quot;As far as I can remember the existence of injustice has hurt my <!--del_lnk--> soul as if a nail was being driven into it. From every period of my life I retain the memory of some injustice tormenting me and tearing me apart.&quot;  Fraser and Navarro write that Eva Per&oacute;n was likely too young at the time to understand why her mother would want the family to attend the funeral or why their presence was <!--del_lnk--> controversial, but that it was likely the first time Eva Per&oacute;n had ever seen her family through the eyes of others. Fraser and Navarro speculate that rather than instilling in her an anger toward the upper classes, this incident may have instilled in Eva Per&oacute;n an anger toward her own mother for putting the young Eva in a position where she would be subjected to such hostility.  Though she would never write or speak about it publicly, Eva Per&oacute;n is said to have been uncomfortable with her &quot;<!--del_lnk--> illegitimate&quot; birth.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Neither Evita nor her sisters could ever confront the question of illegitimacy. As late as 1972 Erminda, the second youngest, would write that her mother and father were happily married, that he kissed her and her younger sister Eva Mar&iacute;a goodnight the night before he left the village on a business trip, and died. As for the &#39;legitimate&#39; Duartes, Erminda simply suggests that they were her <!--del_lnk--> step-sisters and that they &#39;were more sad than we were, because with the death of their father they were orphans, since they had lost their mother some years before.&#39;&quot; </blockquote>
      <p><a id="Move_to_Buenos_Aires" name="Move_to_Buenos_Aires"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Move to Buenos Aires</span></h3>
      <p>At approximately the age of 15, Eva Duarte traveled to <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. There is some disagreement about how she arrived. The most common account holds that Evita was taken to the capital city by the traveling <!--del_lnk--> tango singer <!--del_lnk--> Agust&iacute;n Magaldi. This version was popularized in the musical <i><a href="../../wp/e/Eva_Per%25C3%25B3n.htm" title="Evita">Evita</a></i> in which Magaldi is referred to as &quot;the first man to be of use to Eva Duarte&quot;.  Of Eva Duarte&#39;s arrival in Buenos Aires, De Elia and Queiroz write, &quot;The most persistent legend involves the tango singer Agust&iacute;n Magaldi, who would have accepted responsibility for the aspiring young artist, but the more plausible story is the one told by her family: Do&ntilde;a Juana took her daughter to Buenos Aires to audition at a radio station, and Eva arranged to stay on at the home of family friends, the Bustamontes.&quot;  Biographers Fraser and Navarro also doubt that Magaldi and Eva Duarte ever had a relationship. Fraser and Navarro write that there is no record of Magaldi making an appearance in Jun&iacute;n the year that Eva Duarte is said to have met him; Magaldi, who was devoted to his mother, was known to tour with his wife; and it would be difficult to understand what a famous tango singer would see in the skinny 15-year-old.  Whatever the means by which she arrived in Buenos Aires, most biographers agree that Eva Duarte did so in the early months of 1935.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Buenos Aires in the 1930s was the continent&#39;s most cosmopolitan and elegant metropolis and soon became known as the &#39;Paris of South America.&#39; As in any great European capital, the centre of the city was filled with caf&eacute;s, restaurants, theaters, movie houses, shops, and bustling crowds. Eva was one of many people from the provinces, attracted by the process of industrialization, who came to the capital during the 1930s. When she arrived in 1935 with little more than a cardboard suitcase containing her few possessions, the bold teenager must have felt a wrenching sense of vulnerability and solitude. In direct contrast to the glamour of the city, the 1930s were also years of great unemployment, poverty, and hunger in the capital, and many immigrants from the interior were forced to live in tenements, squalid boardinghouses, and in outlying shantytowns that became known as <i><!--del_lnk--> villas miserias</i>.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Eva Duarte was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education and without connections. After years of struggle, she eventually found work as a <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Film.htm" title="Film">film</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">actress</a>, being credited as Eva Duarte. Eva Duarte later had leading roles in <!--del_lnk--> B-grade movie melodramas. She also became a leading radio <!--del_lnk--> soap opera actress for <i>Radio El Mundo</i>, which Fraser and Navarro claim was the most important radio station in the country. She regularly appeared on a popular historical-drama program <i>Great Women of History</i> in which she played <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_I_of_England.htm" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Sarah Bernhardt and <!--del_lnk--> the last Tsarina of Russia. Eventually, Eva Duarte came to co-own the radio company. By 1943, Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousands pesos a month, making her one of the highest paid radio actresses in the nation during this time period. Pablo Raccioppi, who jointly ran Radio El Mundo with Eva Duarte, is said to have not liked Eva Duarte but to have noted that she was &quot;thoroughly dependable&quot;. <p><a id="Early_relationship_with_Juan_Per.C3.B3n" name="Early_relationship_with_Juan_Per.C3.B3n"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Early relationship with Juan Per&oacute;n</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Juan_Per.C3.B3n.27s_military_career" name="Juan_Per.C3.B3n.27s_military_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s military career</span></h3>
      <p>Juan Per&oacute;n was born on <!--del_lnk--> October 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1895, in Lobos, Argentina. He spent his childhood in the desert of <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia at the southern tip of Argentina. He entered <!--del_lnk--> military school at age 16. He joined the Argentine Army in 1915. After graduation, Per&oacute;n was posted to various <!--del_lnk--> garrisons in the interior of Argentina. In 1926, Per&oacute;n was promoted to captain and moved to Buenos Aires. He played a minor role in the 1930 coup. Fraser and Navarro claim that the 1930 coup established a new relationship between the Army and the government. Within the military there was some debate as to whether military intervention in politics was appropriate, and whether it should impose the <!--del_lnk--> corporate state on Argentina. <p>Per&oacute;n was appointed military <!--del_lnk--> attache to <a href="../../wp/c/Chile.htm" title="Chile">Chile</a> in 1936. (His first wife, <!--del_lnk--> Aurelia Tiz&oacute;n, would die of cancer in 1938.) In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Per&oacute;n was sent to Europe, where he would travel through Hungary, Austria, Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Fraser and Navarro claim that during this era Per&oacute;n was exposed to the theatrics of Mussolini&#39;s pseudo-imperial Rome. Per&oacute;n returned to Argentina in 1942. Fraser and Navarro also claim that Per&oacute;n, along with much of Europe during this period, believed that the only real choice for Europe was the choice between <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communism">communism</a> and <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascism</a>. <blockquote>
       <p>&quot;As a nationalist, of course, he welcomed the defeat of Britain, and he hoped the Axis powers would win the war. Yet he was not in the strictest sense a fascist, though he would frequently be called that; nor was the military lodge he helped found shortly after returning to Buenos Aires, the GOU (Grupo de Oficiales Unidos), concerned with strict implementation of fascism in Argentina along German or Italian lines. Its members, including Per&oacute;n, at this stage were concerned with what they thought was a more practical question, namely what would happen after the war. Per&oacute;n believed that Mussolini&#39;s Italy demonstrated that the interests of capital and labour could be reconciled by the state and it was this principle that he urged on his colleagues.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p><a id="San_Juan_earthquake" name="San_Juan_earthquake"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">San Juan earthquake</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, an <!--del_lnk--> earthquake struck the town of <!--del_lnk--> San Juan, Argentina. Six thousand people were killed. In response, Per&oacute;n, who was the Secretary of Labour, established a fund to raise money to aid the victims. Per&oacute;n devised a plan to have an &quot;artistic festival&quot;, which included radio and film actors. As part of the festivities, actors walked through the streets of San Juan with collection boxes to encourage locals to donate money to aid the victims of the earthquake. After a week of fundraising, all participants met at a <!--del_lnk--> gala. It was at this gala, on <!--del_lnk--> January 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, that Eva Duarte first met Juan Per&oacute;n.  Evita referred to the day she met her future husband as her &quot;marvellous day&quot;.  In his own memoir, Juan Per&oacute;n recalls his first impression of his future wife:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;There was a woman of fragile appearance, but with a strong voice, with long blonde hair falling loose to her back and fevered eyes. She said her name was Eva Duarte, that she acted on the radio and that she wanted to help the people of San Juan. I looked at her and felt overcome by her words; I was quite subdued by the force of her voice and her look. Eva was pale but when she spoke her face seemed to catch fire. Her hands were reddened with tension, her fingers knit tightly together, she was a mass of nerves.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Fraser and Navarro, however, claim that Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s memoirs are not always trustworthy. For example, Evita was not yet a blonde when she met Per&oacute;n at the San Juan gala. Fraser and Navarro write that whenever Juan Per&oacute;n spoke of his political life he was always concerned with placing himself in the best possible light, and this was certainly the case with Evita, who would become his most important political follower. Fraser and Navarro write that Juan Per&oacute;n and Evita left the gala together at around two in the morning. <p>Shortly after meeting in San Juan, Eva Duarte and Juan Per&oacute;n moved in together. This move is said to have scandalized some in Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s inner circle. During this time period in Argentina actors and politicians were seen as two distinct classes of people. Additionally, it was considered improper for an unmarried couple to live together. But Juan Per&oacute;n introduced her to his inner circle of political associates and advisors. Juan Per&oacute;n even allowed Eva Duarte to sit in on his meetings with close advisors and members of government.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;She would stay through the meeting, making the coffee, emptying the ashtrays or watching the guests in silence. Her presence among these educated men &mdash; graduates of the War College, doctors from the university or lawyer politicians &mdash; would not have been entirely accepted if she had been married to Per&oacute;n; as it was, it was quite incomprehensible. Evita had little education, and the sort of work she did on the radio was not considered respectable.... But to allow her to be part of his life in this way was damaging for him as a soldier and as a politician. As a soldier his prospects for promotion would be curtailed; as a politician he would be involved in scandal.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva Duarte had no knowledge or interest in politics prior to her meeting of Juan Per&oacute;n. Therefore, Eva Duarte never argued with Per&oacute;n or any of his inner circle but merely absorbed what she heard.  Juan Per&oacute;n would later claim in his memoir that he purposefully selected Eva Duarte as his pupil and set out to create in her a &quot;second I&quot;.  Fraser and Navarro, however, suggest that Juan Per&oacute;n allowed Eva Duarte such intimate exposure and knowledge of his inner circle because of his age. Juan Per&oacute;n was 48 when he met the 24-year-old Eva Duarte. He had come to politics late in life and was therefore free of preconceived ideas of how his political career should be conducted. <p>In May of 1944 it was announced that broadcast performers must organize themselves into a union, and that this union would be the only one permitted to operate in Argentina. Shortly after the union was formed, Eva Duarte was elected its president. Fraser and Navarro speculate that Juan Per&oacute;n made the suggestion that performers create a union, and the other performers likely felt it was good politics to elect his mistress. Shortly after her election as president of the union, Eva Duarte began a daily program called &quot;Toward a Better Future&quot; which dramatized in soap opera form the accomplishments of Juan Per&oacute;n. Often, Per&oacute;n&#39;s own speeches would be played during the course of the program. When she spoke, Eva Duarte spoke in ordinary language as a regular woman who wanted listeners to believe what she believed about Juan Per&oacute;n. <p><a id="October_17.2C_1945" name="October_17.2C_1945"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">October 17, 1945</span></h2>

      <p>By early 1945, the GOU had gained considerable influence within the Argentine government. President <!--del_lnk--> Pedro Pablo Ram&iacute;rez became wary of Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s growing power within the government but was unable to curb that power. On <!--del_lnk--> February 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1944, Ram&iacute;rez signed his own resignation paper which Fraser and Navarro claim was drafted by Juan Per&oacute;n himself. <!--del_lnk--> Edelmiro Juli&aacute;n Farrell, a friend of Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s, became President. Juan Per&oacute;n returned to his job as War Minister. Fraser and Navarro claim that by this point Per&oacute;n was the most powerful man in the Argentine government. <p>Shortly before his marriage to Eva on <!--del_lnk--> October 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, Juan Per&oacute;n was arrested by his opponents within the government who feared that due to the strong support of the <!--del_lnk--> <i>descamisados</i>, the workers and the poor of the nation, Per&oacute;n&#39;s popularity might eclipse that of the sitting president.<p>Eva has often been credited with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Per&oacute;n from prison on <!--del_lnk--> 17 October <!--del_lnk--> 1945. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the <!--del_lnk--> Tim Rice and <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;<a href="../../wp/e/Eva_Per%25C3%25B3n.htm" title="Evita">Evita</a>&quot;. Most historians, however, agree that this is not likely.  At the time of Per&oacute;n&#39;s imprisonment, Eva was still merely an actress. She had no political <!--del_lnk--> clout with the various <a href="../../wp/t/Trade_union.htm" title="Trade union">labor unions</a> that supported Per&oacute;n, and it is claimed that she was not well liked within Per&oacute;n&#39;s inner circle, nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point. When Juan Per&oacute;n was imprisoned, Eva Duarte was suddenly <!--del_lnk--> disenfranchised. (Biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser claim that letters between the two during Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s imprisonment indicate that the couple actually considered leaving the country after Per&oacute;n&#39;s release.) In reality, the massive rally that freed Per&oacute;n from prison was organized by the various unions, such as <!--del_lnk--> General Labor Confederation, or <i>CGT</i> as they came to be known. To this day, the date of October 17th is something of a holiday for the <!--del_lnk--> Justicialist Party in Argentina (celebrated as <i>D&iacute;a de la Lealtad</i>, or &quot;Loyalty Day&quot;).<p><a id="Juan_Per.C3.B3n.27s_first_presidential_campaign" name="Juan_Per.C3.B3n.27s_first_presidential_campaign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s first presidential campaign</span></h2>
      <p>After his release from prison, Juan Per&oacute;n decided to campaign for the presidency of the nation. Evita campaigned heavily for her husband during his 1946 presidential bid. Using her weekly radio show she delivered powerful speeches with heavy <!--del_lnk--> populist rhetoric urging the poor to align themselves with Per&oacute;n&#39;s movement. Although she had become wealthy from her radio and modeling success, she would highlight her own humble upbringing as a way of showing solidarity with the impoverished classes.<p>Along with her husband, Evita visited every corner of the country, becoming the first woman in Argentine history to appear in public on the campaign trail with her husband. (Incidentally, she was also the first woman in Argentine public life to wear trousers.) Eva&#39;s appearance alongside her husband often offended the <!--del_lnk--> establishment of the wealthy, the military, and those in political life. However, she was very popular with the public, who knew her from her radio and motion picture appearances, and therefore proved effective in getting attention from the poor and working class voters of Argentina. It was during this phase of her life that she first encouraged the Argentine population to refer to her not as &quot;Eva Per&oacute;n&quot; but simply as &quot;Evita&quot;, which is a Spanish <!--del_lnk--> diminutive or <!--del_lnk--> nickname roughly equivalent to &quot;Little Eva&quot;.<p><a id="European_tour" name="European_tour"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">European tour</span></h2>
      <p>After Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s first election to the presidency on March 28, 1946, Evita gradually took a prominent political role in the government, eventually overshadowing even the vice-president of the nation in all but military affairs.<p>
       <br /> In 1947, Evita embarked on a much-publicized &quot;Rainbow Tour&quot; of Europe, meeting with numerous heads of state, including <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco. It was aimed at being a massive <!--del_lnk--> public relations coup for the Per&oacute;n regime, which in the post-<a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> world was increasingly being viewed as <a href="../../wp/f/Fascism.htm" title="Fascism">fascist</a>. She was well-received in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, where she visited the tombs of Spain&#39;s first <!--del_lnk--> absolutist monarchs, <!--del_lnk--> Ferdinand and <!--del_lnk--> Isabella. <!--del_lnk--> Francoist Spain had not recovered from the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Civil War (the <!--del_lnk--> autarkic economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people). During her visit to Spain, Evita handed out 100-<!--del_lnk--> peseta notes to every poor child she met on her journey. Evita later met the <a href="../../wp/p/Pope.htm" title="Pope">Pope</a> in <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a>, and then travelled to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. In France and Italy she received mixed reactions. Some Italian protestors claimed that she represented a new form of fascism.<p>The European tour was originally intended to include a trip to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> to visit the <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">royal family</a>. Fraser and Navarro write that Evita called off the trip to England due to a sense of hurt vanity. When it was announced that the royal family was not able to meet Evita at the time she preferred, and that Evita&#39;s visit would not be treated by the royal family as being as important as the official state visit of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> First Lady <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Roosevelt, Evita called off the trip to England. The official reason for not visiting England was exhaustion.<p>During her tour to Europe, Eva Per&oacute;n was featured in a cover story for <!--del_lnk--> Time Magazine. The cover&#39;s caption &mdash; &quot;Eva Per&oacute;n: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow&quot; &mdash; was a reference to the name given to Evita&#39;s European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This would be the first time in the periodical&#39;s history that a South American first lady appeared on its cover, and she remains the only South American first lady to have appeared there. However, the 1947 cover story was the first publication to mention that Evita had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months. <p><a id="Charitable_and_feminist_works" name="Charitable_and_feminist_works"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Charitable and feminist works</span></h2>
      <p>After returning to Argentina from Europe, Evita would never again appear in public with the complicated <!--del_lnk--> hairdos of her movie star days. She would henceforth appear with her hair pulled back into a bun. Additionally, her style of clothing became more simple after the tour. No longer would she wear the elaborate <!--del_lnk--> couture of the European fashion houses. Perhaps in an attempt to make herself appear as more of a serious political figure, Evita would henceforth appear in public wearing modest <!--del_lnk--> business dress suit combinations.<p>Evita came to be powerful within the <!--del_lnk--> Pro-Peronist trade unions. She also founded the <!--del_lnk--> Eva Per&oacute;n Foundation, a charitable organization that built homes for the poor and homeless, and also provided free health care to citizens. Biographers Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro write, &quot;Under the auspices of the Foundation, Evita built 1,000 schools in the poorest areas of the country and handed these over to the State to operate.&quot;  Fraser and Navarro counter claims that Evita&#39;s Foundation was wasteful, though effective:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Evita&#39;s social works have been persistently criticized for being wasteful, ill-conceived and unrelated to people&#39;s needs. The conservative military government that succeeded Per&oacute;n concluded that the institutions of the Foundation were &#39;disproportionate to the aims, culture, and customs bringing about moral and family deviations.&#39; However, although the Foundation adopted &#39;luxury&#39; as a matter of policy, it did function better than many more rational and more frugal institutions. For the first time, there was no inequality in Argentine health care.... The work of the Foundation was deeply practical and personal, far more so than it might have been had it been bureaucractically exercised.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Eva Per&oacute;n also created the <!--del_lnk--> Female Peronist Party, which was the first large female political party in the nation. Navarro and Fraser write that by 1952, the party had 500,000 members and 3,600 headquarters across the country. In the election of 1952, this base of support won Per&oacute;n the election by sixty-three percent. Navarro and Fraser also write that Evita has often been given credit for gaining for women the right to vote, but that this is not the case. Nor was Evita, even by her own admission, truly a <!--del_lnk--> feminist. And yet her impact on women in Argentina, write Navarro and Fraser, was great.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Yet Evita&#39;s effect on the condition of women in Argentina and on their political life was decisive; what she accomplished here was as important as anything else she did. A mass of women who cared little about women&#39;s rights and were indifferent to the concerns of middle-class feminists had entered politics because of Evita. They were the first Argentine women to be active in politics, they gave Per&oacute;n a large majority in 1951 and they remained loyal to him and what they saw as the principles of Peronism long after their inspiration and figurehead had died.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Evita also helped to create a <!--del_lnk--> personality cult around her husband, whom she <!--del_lnk--> elevated to nearly divine status, often comparing him to <!--del_lnk--> Christ and saying that all Peronists must be ready to die for Per&oacute;n. Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro say that this apotheosis was what ultimately corrupted Per&oacute;n and debased the Peronist movement. In light of Evita&#39;s often verbose praise for her husband, the slightest criticism of Juan Per&oacute;n was easily interpreted as <!--del_lnk--> unpatriotic. Evita even stated explicitly that only the Peronists were truly Argentine, and anyone who was anti-Peronist was not truly Argentine.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;<i>Per&oacute;n is the heart, the soul, the nerve, and the reality of the Argentine people. We all know that there is only one man in our movement with his own source of light. We all feed off of that light. And that man is Per&oacute;n!</i>&quot; &mdash; 1951 speech by Eva Per&oacute;n</blockquote>
      <p>Eventually, Evita became the centre of her own vast personality cult and her image and name soon appeared everywhere, with <!--del_lnk--> train stations, a city (&quot;Ciudad Evita&quot;), and even a star in the sky being named after her. Despite her dominance and political power, Evita was always careful to never undermine the important symbolic role of her husband. Evita was always careful to justify her actions by claiming they were &quot;inspired&quot; or &quot;encouraged&quot; by the wisdom and passion of Per&oacute;n. And though she has often been interpreted as having been singularly ambitious in her own right, Navarro and Fraser claim (<i>op. cit.</i>) that everything Evita did was ultimately subordinate to the larger goals and aims of her husband&#39;s political agenda.<p><a id="Campaign_for_vice-presidency" name="Campaign_for_vice-presidency"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Campaign for vice-presidency</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>In 1951, Evita set her sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President&#39;s death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s death was not something the military could accept. <p>Evita did, however, receive great support from the working class, the unions, and the Peronist Women&#39;s Party. The intensity of the support she drew from these groups is said to have surprised even Juan Per&oacute;n himself. Fraser and Navarro write that the wide support Evita&#39;s proposed candidacy generated indicated to him that Evita had become as important to members of the Peronist party as Juan Per&oacute;n himself was. <p>On August 22, 1951 the unions held a mass rally of two million people called &quot;Cabildo Abierto&quot;. (The name &quot;Cabildo Abierto&quot; was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the <!--del_lnk--> May Revolution, in 1810.) The Per&oacute;ns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge <!--del_lnk--> scaffolding set up near the <!--del_lnk--> Casa Rosada, the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Per&oacute;n. It has been claimed that &quot;Cabildo Abierto&quot; was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure . At the mass rally, the crowd demanded that Evita publicly announce her official candidacy as vice president. Evita pleaded for more time to make her decision. The exchange between Evita and the crowd of two million became, for a time, a genuine and spontaneous dialogue, with the crowd chanting, &quot;&iexcl;Evita, Vice-Presidente!&quot;. When Evita asked for more time so she could make up her mind, the crowd demanded, &quot;&iexcl;Ahora, Evita, ahora!&quot; (&quot;Now, Evita, now!&quot;). Eventually, they came to a compromise. Evita told the audience that she would announce her decision over the radio a few days later.<p>Eventually, Evita declined the invitation to run for vice-president, saying her only ambition was that in the large chapter of history that would be written about her husband, she hoped that in the footnotes there would be mention of a woman who brought the &quot;hopes and dreams of the people to the president&quot;, who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into &quot;glorious reality&quot;. In Peronist rhetoric, this event has come to be referred to as &quot;The Renouncement&quot;, portraying Evita as having been a selfless woman in line with the Hispanic myth of <!--del_lnk--> marianismo. Most biographers, however, postulate that Evita did not so much renounce her ambition but rather caved to pressure from her husband, the military, and the wealthy, who preferred that she not enter the race.<p>By 1951, it had also become evident that her health was rapidly deteriorating. In early 1950, Evita fainted in public and underwent surgery few days later. Although it was reported that she had undergone appendectomy, Evita had developed advanced cervical cancer. Fainting continued through 1951 (including the evening after &quot;Cabildo abierto&quot;), with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding. Although her diagnosis was withheld from her by Juan, she knew she was not well, and a bid for the vice-presidency was not practical in light of her condition. Only a few months after &quot;the Renouncement,&quot; Evita underwent a secret radical hysterectomy in an attempt to cure her of her advanced cervical cancer.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1952, Evita rode with Juan Per&oacute;n in parade through Buenos Aires in celebration of his re-election as President of Argentina. (This was the first election in which Argentine women had been <!--del_lnk--> allowed to vote. Evita had organized women voters into the first truly powerful female political party in the country&#39;s history.) Evita was by this point so ill that she was unable to stand without support. Underneath her oversized fur coat was a frame made of plaster and wire that allowed her to stand. She took a triple dose of <!--del_lnk--> painkillers before the parade, and took another two doses when she returned home.<p>In an official ceremony a few days after Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s second inauguration, Evita was given the official title of &quot;Spiritual Leader of the Nation&quot;.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Despite having undergone hysterectomy by the preeminent American surgeon, George T. Pack, MD, Evita&#39;s cancer returned rapidly. She developed lung metastasis and was the first Argentinian to undergo chemotherapy (a novel treatment at that time). Despite all available treatment, she became emaciated, weighing only 36 kg by June of 1952. Evita died at the age of 33, at 8:27 p.m. on <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1952. The news was immediately broadcast throughout the country, and Argentina went into <!--del_lnk--> mourning: all activity in Argentina stopped: movies stopped playing, restaurants were closed and patrons were shown to the door. A radio broadcast interrupted the broadcasting schedule, with the announcer reading, &quot;It is my sad duty to inform you that today at 8:25 p.m. Eva Per&oacute;n, Spiritual Leader of the Nation, entered immortality&quot;. Eva Per&oacute;n was granted an official state funeral.  Evita&#39;s time of death was officially stated as 8:25 p.m. because it was felt that this time would be easier to remember.<p>According to a Time magazine article published on Aug. 11, 1952 titled &quot;In Mourning&quot;, the Peronist government enforced the beginning of daily periods of five minutes of mourning, following the daily radio announcement.  This article also published the following list which it referred to as the &quot;extravagant tributes&quot; offered during the mourning period:<blockquote>
       <ul>
        <li>&quot;The Union of Workers and Employees of the Food Industry cabled a request to Pope Pius XII to canonize Evita.<li>&quot;Minister of Public Health Ramon Carrillo ordered a 220-lb. candle, the height of Evita (5 ft. 5 in.), to be installed in the ministry and lighted for an hour on the 26th day of every month (the day Evita died). Carrillo thought the candle would last 100 years or more.<li>&quot;Schoolkids got prizes for poems and essays praising Evita. They were also told that she &quot;got sick because she kissed the ill, the lepers, the consumptives.&quot;<li>&quot;Carlos Alo&eacute;, super-Peronista governor of Buenos Aires province, fired an employee who refused to wear a black tie. A Buenos Aires youth was arrested for laughing on a streetcar. &quot;Attitudes like this are antisocial,&quot; said Alo&eacute;.<li>&quot;Eva&#39;s political cronies in high office, who stand to retain power if they can keep her memory alive, formed an &quot;Association of Friends of Eva Per&oacute;n&quot; and asked, &quot;What would Christ have been without his disciples?&quot; (Eva&#39;s disciples, presumably, will be wanting to look after the more than $100 million which annually pours into her Social Aid Foundation, a &quot;charity&quot; which is Argentina&#39;s biggest business and keeps no accounting of funds.) Deprived thereafter of her tremendous popularity and imposing presence, the regime was increasingly forced to resort to repressive measures to compensate for the lost magnetism and popular support that Evita generated.&quot; (From <!--del_lnk--> )</ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Upon her death, the Argentine public was told that Evita&#39;s age was only 30. The discrepancy was meant to dovetail with Evita&#39;s earlier tampering with her birth certificate. After becoming the first lady in 1946, Evita had her birth records altered to read that she had been born to married parents, and placed her birth date three years forward, making herself younger. <p>Shortly before Evita&#39;s death, Dr. Pedro Ara was approached to <!--del_lnk--> embalm the body. Fraser and Navarro write that it is doubtful that Evita herself ever expressed a wish to be embalmed and suggest that it was most likely Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s decision. Dr. Ara was a professor of anatomy who had studied in Vienna and maintained an academic career in Madrid. His work was occasionally referred to as &quot;the art of death&quot;. His highly advance embalming technique consisted of replacing the blood of the cadaver with <!--del_lnk--> glycerine, which retained all organs including the brain and created a very lifelike appearance, giving the corpses the appearance of &quot;artistically rendered sleep&quot;. Dr. Ara was known in Buenos Aires society for his work. Among the people he had embalmed was Spanish composer <!--del_lnk--> Manuel de Falla.  Dr. Ara claims that his embalming of Evita&#39;s corpse began on the night of her death and that by the next morning &quot;the body of Eva Peron was completely and infinitely incorruptible&quot; and therefore suitable for display to the public. <div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In the book <i>Per&oacute;n and the Enigmas of Argentina</i>, biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo Saxon nations of North America and Europe largely misunderstood Argentina&#39;s response to the death of Eva Per&oacute;n as well as the ornate funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Per&oacute;ns and Argentina itself.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Almost lost among the memories of Evita that have caught the imagination of the world there was another that has been little noted but whose importance is considerable: the legacy of <!--del_lnk--> incomprehension. Her brief and dazzling years were so successful because, in good part, she was so profoundly of the <!--del_lnk--> ethos. &#39;I have the body and the soul and the blood of the people.&#39; But it was the ethos of the old, <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic-<!--del_lnk--> Creole tradition, born in the interior out of Lima and nurtured on the Pampas. Like Per&oacute;n, she was wholly <!--del_lnk--> indigenous in origin and formation and spirit; like him, she was distrusted and misunderstood in the Argentina of the Liberal System and in the outside world that knew only that Argentina.&quot;</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
       <p>&quot;The same was true with regard to Evita&#39;s dramatized death during her last ten months, the dying in public that she sought as confirmation of her devotion. Such an attitude toward mortality is a variation of the old <!--del_lnk--> Hispanic preoccupation with death and with the dignity and splendor associated with it. It had by then faded away in most of the European Catholic societies and it is unknown in the Anglo-Saxon nations. Therefore, many saw her ordeal and the responses of Per&oacute;n and the vast public as elements in an essentially political passion play, an attempt to milk some sympathy and benefit out of what should have been a private tragedy.&quot; </blockquote>

      <p>Shortly after her death, plans were made to construct a monument in Evita&#39;s honour. The monument, which was to be a statue of a man representing the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Descamisados&quot;, was projected to be larger than the <!--del_lnk--> Statue of Liberty. Evita&#39;s body was to be stored in the base of the monument and, in the tradition of <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>&#39;s corpse, to be displayed for the public. Before the monument to Evita was completed, Juan Per&oacute;n was overthrown in a military <!--del_lnk--> coup, the <!--del_lnk--> Revoluci&oacute;n Libertadora, in 1955. Per&oacute;n hurriedly fled the country and did not make arrangements to secure Evita&#39;s body.<p>A military dictatorship took power in Argentina. The new authorities removed Evita&#39;s body from display and its whereabouts remained a mystery for years. From 1955 until 1971, the military dictatorship of Argentina issued a ban on Peronism. It became illegal not only to possess pictures of Juan and Eva Per&oacute;n even in one&#39;s home, but to even speak their names. After sixteen years, the military finally revealed the location of Evita&#39;s body. It had been buried in a crypt in <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan, Italy</a>, under the name &quot;Mar&iacute;a Maggi&quot;. In 1995, <!--del_lnk--> Tom&aacute;s Eloy Mart&iacute;nez published &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Santa Evita&quot;, which detailed many previously unknown facts about the escapades of Evita&#39;s corpse, such as the fact that many wax copies were made of the corpse. Mart&iacute;nez claimed that the corpse was damaged with a hammer and that one officer even committed <!--del_lnk--> necrophiliac acts on one of the copies of the corpse.<div class="thumb tright">

In 1973, Juan Per&oacute;n came out of exile and returned to Argentina, becoming president for the third time. Per&oacute;n died in office in 1974. <!--del_lnk--> Isabel Per&oacute;n, who had been elected vice-president, thus became the first female president in the world. It was Isabel who had Evita&#39;s body returned to Argentina and (briefly) displayed beside Juan Per&oacute;n&#39;s. The body was later buried in the Duarte family tomb in <!--del_lnk--> La Recoleta Cemetery, <a href="../../wp/b/Buenos_Aires.htm" title="Buenos Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. Extra measures were taken by the government to secure Evita&#39;s tomb. There is a trapdoor in the tomb&#39;s marble floor, which leads to a compartment that contains two coffins. Under the first compartment is a second trapdoor and a second compartment. That is where Evita&#39;s coffin rests. Biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that the claim is often made that Evita&#39;s tomb is so secure that it could withstand a nuclear attack. &quot;It reflects a fear,&quot; they write, &quot;a fear that the body will disappear from the tomb and that the woman, or rather the myth of the woman, will reappear.&quot; <p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

      <p>By the late <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>, Eva Per&oacute;n had become the subject of numerous articles, books, stage plays, and musicals, ranging from the biography <!--del_lnk--> The Woman with the Whip, to the B-grade film &quot;Little Mother&quot; , and a 1981 <!--del_lnk--> TV movie called &quot;Evita Peron&quot; with <!--del_lnk--> Faye Dunaway in the title role.

The musical began as a <!--del_lnk--> concept album co-produced by <!--del_lnk--> Tim Rice and <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Lloyd Webber, with <!--del_lnk--> Julie Covington in the title role. <!--del_lnk--> Elaine Paige would later be cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in <!--del_lnk--> London&#39;s West End. In 1980, <!--del_lnk--> Patti LuPone won the <!--del_lnk--> Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as the title character. Nicholas Fraser claims that to date the musical stage production has been performed on every continent (except <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>) and has generated over $2 billion in revenue. <p>As early as 1978, the musical was considered as the basis for a movie, with everyone from Patti LuPone, to <!--del_lnk--> Liza Minnelli, to <!--del_lnk--> Michelle Pfeiffer, to <!--del_lnk--> Meryl Streep, being considered for the title role. After a nearly 20-year production delay, <!--del_lnk--> Madonna was cast in the title role for <!--del_lnk--> the film version of the musical. Madonna would later win the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy&quot;. In response to the movie starring Madonna, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita&#39;s life, an Argentine film company released &quot;Eva Per&oacute;n: The True Story&quot;. The Argentine production starred actress Esther Goris in the title role. This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the <!--del_lnk--> Oscar in the category of &quot;Best Foreign Film&quot;.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;In her own country her story is at last part of history, arousing the sort of peaceful controversy one might expect from so astonishing a career. In the rest of the world, however, she has attained the condition of apotheosis &mdash; becoming a deity in the new world <!--del_lnk--> pantheon of electric <!--del_lnk--> celebrity.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Nicholas Fraser suggests that Evita is the perfect <a href="../../wp/p/Popular_culture.htm" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a> <!--del_lnk--> icon for our times because her career foreshadowed what by the late 20th century had become common. During Evita&#39;s time it was considered scandalous for a former entertainer to take part in public political life. Her detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into <!--del_lnk--> show business. But by the late 20th century, Fraser claims, the public had become engrossed in the <!--del_lnk--> cult of celebrity and public political life had become insignificant. Former actors and entertainers, from <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Sonny Bono, <a href="../../wp/a/Arnold_Schwarzenegger.htm" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Glenda Jackson, have often taken public political offices. In this regard, Evita was perhaps ahead of her time. Fraser also writes that Evita&#39;s story is appealing to our celebrity obsessed age because her story confirms one of <!--del_lnk--> Hollywood&#39;s oldest <!--del_lnk--> clich&eacute;, the <!--del_lnk--> rags to riches story. <p>In the book <i>Eva Per&oacute;n: The Myths of a Woman</i>, cultural <!--del_lnk--> anthropologist Julie M. Taylor claims that Evita has remained intriguing to people in Argentina and around the world due to the combination of four unique factors. Taylor writes:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;In the images examined, the three elements consistently linked &mdash;<!--del_lnk--> femininity, <a href="../../wp/m/Mysticism.htm" title="Mysticism">mystical</a> or <!--del_lnk--> spirituality power, and <!--del_lnk--> revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> leadership &mdash; display an underlying common theme. Identification with any one of these elements puts a person or a group at the margins of established society and at the limits of institutional authority. Anyone who can identify with all three images lays an overwhelming and echoing claim to dominance through forces that recognize no control in society or its rules. Only a woman can embody all three elements of this power.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>The fourth element in Evita&#39;s appeal, claims Taylor, is related to her status as a dead woman and the power that <!--del_lnk--> death holds over the public imagination. Further, Taylor claims that Evita&#39;s embalmed corpse is <!--del_lnk--> analogous to the <!--del_lnk--> incorruptibility of various <!--del_lnk--> Catholic saints, such as <!--del_lnk--> Bernadette Soubirous, and therefore holds powerful <!--del_lnk--> symbolism within the largely <!--del_lnk--> Catholic cultures of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>.<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;To some extent her continuing importance and popularity may be attributed not only to her power as a woman but also to the power of the dead. However a society&rsquo;s vision of the <!--del_lnk--> afterlife may be structured, death by its nature remains a mystery, and, until society formally allays the commotion it causes, a source of disturbance and disorder. Women and the dead &mdash; death and womanhood &mdash; stand in similar relation to structured social forms: outside public institutions, unlimited by official rules, and beyond formal categories. As a female corpse reiterating the symbolic themes of both woman and <!--del_lnk--> martyr, Eva Per&oacute;n perhaps lays double claim to spiritual leadership.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Tom&aacute;s Eloy Mart&iacute;nez suggests that Eva Per&oacute;n has remained an important cultural icon for the same reasons as fellow Argentine <!--del_lnk--> Ch&eacute; Guevara:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;Latin American myths are more resistant than they seem to be. Not even the mass exodus of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuban">Cuban</a> raft people or the rapid decomposition and isolation of <a href="../../wp/f/Fidel_Castro.htm" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>&#39;s regime have eroded the triumphal myth of Che Guevara, which remains alive in the dreams of thousands of young people in Latin America, Africa and Europe. Che as well as Evita symbolize certain naive, but effective, beliefs: the hope for a better world; a life sacrificed on the altar of the disinherited, the humiliated, the poor of the earth. They are myths which somehow reproduce the image of <a href="../../wp/j/Jesus.htm" title="Jesus Christ">Christ</a>.&quot;</blockquote>
      <p><a id="Allegations_of_fascism" name="Allegations_of_fascism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Allegations of fascism</span></h3>
      <p>In the book <i>Evita: The Real Life of Eva Per&oacute;n</i> authors Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write, &quot;Around no historical figure in modern times are there such complicated myths as those that exist around Eva, second wife of Juan Domingo Per&oacute;n.&quot;  One of the most complicated aspects of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s legacy regards her alleged connection to nazism, fascism, and her alleged role in aiding Nazi <!--del_lnk--> war criminals in escaping prosecution and living in anonymity in Argentina. Some authors and biographers have claimed that these allegations are true, while others claim they are merely among the many complicated myths to which Navarro and Fraser refer.<p>The book <i>The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Per&oacute;n&#39;s Argentina</i> depicts Eva Per&oacute;n on the cover along with Juan Per&oacute;n.  The 1980 made-for-TV movie <i>Evita Peron</i>, starring <!--del_lnk--> Faye Dunaway, also portrays Eva as a Nazi conspirator. <!--del_lnk--> Movie critic <!--del_lnk--> Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;(Eva Per&oacute;n) let down the poor, shirtless ones by providing a glamorous facade for a fascist dictatorship, by salting away charity funds, and by distracting from her husband&#39;s tacit protection of Nazi war criminals.&quot;  It has been claimed that Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s alleged support for Nazism is largely responsible for the negative portrayal of Eva Per&oacute;n in the <!--del_lnk--> Broadway version of the musical &quot;<a href="../../wp/e/Eva_Per%25C3%25B3n.htm" title="Evita">Evita</a>&quot; . When the musical debuted in <!--del_lnk--> London on <!--del_lnk--> June 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1978, the portrayal of Evita was comparatively sympathetic. By the time of musical&#39;s debut in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> in 1979, the structure of the production had been reworked considerably, with some songs being omitted entirely. In literature about the production of the musical it has been speculated that this reworking of the musical to portray Evita as a <!--del_lnk--> villain rather than as a <!--del_lnk--> heroine was in large part done in response to the fear of reprimand, perhaps even <!--del_lnk--> boycotts, by the large Jewish population of New York City. (In contrast to London, New York City has one of the largest <!--del_lnk--> Jewish populations in the world.) The producers were perhaps fearful that if they portrayed Evita too kindly in the musical then they would be accused of glorifying a supporter of nazism and fascism.<p>In 1997, <!--del_lnk--> Time Magazine published an article by Tom&aacute;s Mart&iacute;nez, Director of the <!--del_lnk--> Latin American program at <!--del_lnk--> Rutgers University, titled &quot;The Woman Behind the Fantasy: Prostitute, Fascist, Profligate &mdash; Eva Peron was Much Maligned, Mostly Unfairly&quot;. In this article, Mart&iacute;nez writes that Eva Per&oacute;n was not a nazi or a fascist and that she played no role in aiding Nazi criminals escape post-war prosecution:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;She was not a fascist&mdash;ignorant, perhaps, of what that <!--del_lnk--> ideology meant.... The difficulty in understanding <!--del_lnk--> Peronism and its two protagonists &mdash; Per&oacute;n and Evita &mdash; stems above all from the fact that Per&oacute;n sympathized with the <!--del_lnk--> Axis powers in 1944 and 1945, when he was a colonel and Minister of War. That blunder made him unacceptable to the U.S. The seeds of the idea that Evita shared his sentiments were also planted during that time. But Evita was more or less Per&oacute;n&#39;s clandestine lover then and thought only of holding on to her man and surviving. She lacked not only any political ideology but also influence and power in either Per&oacute;n&#39;s household or the political life of Argentina.... It is true that Per&oacute;n facilitated the entrance of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> criminals to Argentina in 1947 and 1948, thereby hoping to acquire advanced technology developed by the Germans during the war. But Evita played no part.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Lawrence Levine, the former president of the U.S.-Argentine Chamber of Commerce, writes that in contrast to Nazi ideology, the Per&oacute;ns were not anti-semitic. In the book <i>Inside Argentina from Per&oacute;n to Menem: 1950-2000 from an American Point of View</i>, Lawrence Levine writes:<blockquote>
       <p>&quot;The American government demonstrated no knowledge of Per&oacute;n&#39;s deep admiration for Italy (and his distaste for Germany, whose culture he found too rigid). Nor did they appreciate that although anti-Semitism existed in Argentina, Per&oacute;n&#39;s own views and his political associations were not anti-Semitic. They paid no attention to the fact that Per&oacute;n sought out the Jewish community in Argentina to assist in developing his policies and that one of his most important allies in organizing the industrial sector was Jose Ber Gerbald, a Jewish immigrant from Poland.&quot; </blockquote>
      <p>Historian Robert D. Crassweller, author of <i>Per&oacute;n and the Enigmas of Argentina</i>, does not address the allegations of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s involvement with Nazi war criminals. However, Crassweller does address the allegation of Peronism&#39;s ties with nazi and fascist political ideology. Crassweller writes, &quot;Peronism was not fascism&quot;, and &quot;Peronism was not nazism.&quot; Crassweller also refers to the comments of U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Ambassador <!--del_lnk--> George S. Messersmith. While visiting Argentina in 1947, Messersmith made the following statement: &quot;There is not as much social discrimination against Jews here as there is right in <!--del_lnk--> New York or in most places at home...&quot; <p>In his dissertation titled &quot;The Jews and Per&oacute;n: Communal Politics and National Identity in Peronist Argentina, 1946-1955&quot;, Lawrence D. Bell writes, &quot;Despite the claims of Per&oacute;n&#39;s detractors in the United States and elsewhere that he was anti-Semitic and in sympathy with European Fascism, Per&oacute;n in fact demonstrated a considerable amount of pragmatism in his dealings with Argentina&#39;s 250,000 strong Jewish population.&quot; <p>Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro claim that Per&oacute;n&#39;s detractors forged documents that were circulated around Argentina and England during Peron&#39;s first term.  These documents made it appear that Evita had met with Nazis in <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia to arrange for the smuggling of Nazi loot into the country. Fraser and Navarro claim that the allegedly forged documents address a period of Evita&#39;s life when she was still an actress and Per&oacute;n&#39;s mistress, and therefore any political action of any type was unlikely for Evita.<p><a id="In_Argentina" name="In_Argentina"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">In Argentina</span></h3>
      <p>In the book <i>Eva Per&oacute;n: The Myths of a Woman</i> cultural <!--del_lnk--> anthropologist Julie M. Taylor notes that the precise nature of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s power in Argentina is difficult to define because Eva Per&oacute;n never held an official political office. Taylor also claims that Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s continuing importance in Argentine politics is directly related to her unofficial and <!--del_lnk--> uninstitutionalized position. Taylor suggests that because she was not an <a href="../../wp/e/Election.htm" title="Election">officially elected</a> political leader, Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s power is often interpreted as existing not within the domain of politics but is often seen as aligned with, and deriving from, her very <!--del_lnk--> womanhood. Taylor argues that within Argentina Eva Per&oacute;n has become the screen onto which many constrasting and complicated <!--del_lnk--> archetypes of womanhood are projected. For Argentines Eva Per&oacute;n is often interpreted not as a politician but as either a corruption of, or the very embodiment of, &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> feminine <!--del_lnk--> ideal&quot;. For Peronists, Eva Per&oacute;n is often depicted as a <!--del_lnk--> mother figure, while anti-Peronists, such as <a href="../../wp/j/Jorge_Luis_Borges.htm" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a>, often claimed that Eva Per&oacute;n was a <!--del_lnk--> prostitute.<p>Fraser and Navarro claim that because Eva Per&oacute;n died at the peak of her popularity, her myth has remained intact and she remains one of the most important symbols of Peronism. Though it is not an official government holiday, the anniversay of Evita&#39;s death is marked by Argentines every year. Additionally, Eva Per&oacute;n has been featured on Argentine coins, and a form of Argentine currency called &quot;Evitas&quot; was named in her honour. <p>On <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, the 50th anniversary of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s death, a museum opened in her honour called &quot;Museo Evita&quot;. The museum, which was created by her great-niece Cristina Alvarez Rodriquez, houses many of Eva Per&oacute;n&#39;s clothes, portraits, and artistic renderings of her life. It has become a popular tourist attraction. The museum was opened in a building that was once used by the Eva Per&oacute;n Foundation. <p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>

In this episode, <!--del_lnk--> Lisa Simpson seeks to be the president of the Springfield Elementary student body.

The episode ends with the following disclaimer: &quot;On the advice of our lawyers, the producers would like to stress that they have never heard of a musical based on the life of Eva Per&oacute;n.&quot;</ul>
