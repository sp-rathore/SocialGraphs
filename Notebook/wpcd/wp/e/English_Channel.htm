      <p>The <b>English Channel</b> (<a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>: <i>La Manche</i> (<!--del_lnk--> IPA: <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in IPA">[m&#x251;&#x303;&#x283;]</span>), &quot;the sleeve&quot;) is the part of the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> that separates the <!--del_lnk--> island of <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> from northern <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and joins the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> to the Atlantic. It is about 563&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km (350&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) long and at its widest is 240&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;mi). The <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Dover is the narrowest part of the channel, being only 34&nbsp;km (21&nbsp;mi) from <!--del_lnk--> Dover to <!--del_lnk--> Cap Gris Nez, and is located at the eastern end of the English Channel, where it meets the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. During the period of <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Rome.htm" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Roman</a> <!--del_lnk--> hegemony the channel was known in <!--del_lnk--> Latin as the <i>Oceanus Britannicus</i> and up until around 1549 it was known as the <i>British Sea</i>.<p>The channel is relatively shallow, with an average depth of about 120&nbsp;m at its widest part, reducing to about 45&nbsp;m between Dover and <!--del_lnk--> Calais. From there eastwards the sea continues to shallow to about 26&nbsp;m in the <!--del_lnk--> Broad Fourteens where it lies over the watershed of the former land bridge between East Anglia and the Low Countries. The <a href="../../wp/c/Channel_Islands.htm" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> lie in the channel, close to the French side. The <a href="../../wp/i/Isles_of_Scilly.htm" title="Isles of Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a> in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Ushant in France mark the western end of the Channel. The <!--del_lnk--> French d&eacute;partement of <!--del_lnk--> Manche, which incorporates the <!--del_lnk--> Cotentin Peninsula that juts out into the channel, takes its name from the surrounding seaway.<p>

      <p>Before the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Devensian glaciation (the most recent <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_age.htm" title="Ice age">ice age</a>) around 10,000 years ago, the British Isles were part of <!--del_lnk--> continental Europe. During this period the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and almost all of the British Isles were covered with ice. The sea level was about 120 m lower than it is today, and the channel was an expanse of low-lying <!--del_lnk--> tundra, through which passed a river which drained the <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> and <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">Thames</a> towards the Atlantic to the west. As the <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_sheet.htm" title="Ice sheet">ice sheet</a> melted, a large freshwater lake formed in the southern part of what is now the North Sea. As the <!--del_lnk--> meltwater could still not escape to the north (as the northern North Sea was still frozen) the outflow channel from the lake entered the Atlantic Ocean in the region of Dover and Calais.<p>At some point around 6500 BC, catastrophic <!--del_lnk--> erosion swept away the <!--del_lnk--> chalk to create the English Channel, leaving the iconic <a href="../../wp/w/White_cliffs_of_Dover.htm" title="White cliffs of Dover">white cliffs of Dover</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Wave action on the soft, chalk cliffs widened the Channel further, a process which continues today.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

       <br /> The channel has been a key natural defence for Britain, allowing the nation to intervene but rarely be dangerously threatened in European conflicts, mostly notable in the fight against <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleon_I_of_France.htm" title="Napoleon I of France">Napoleon</a> during the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Nevertheless, the channel has been the scene of many invasions and attempted invasions, including the <!--del_lnk--> Roman conquest of Britain, the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest in 1066, the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_Armada.htm" title="Spanish Armada">Spanish Armada</a> in 1588, and the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Normandy.htm" title="Battle of Normandy">Normandy landings</a> in 1944. The channel has been the scene of many <!--del_lnk--> naval battles, including the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Goodwin Sands (1652), the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Portland (<!--del_lnk--> 1653), the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of La Hougue (1692) and the engagement between <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Kearsarge</i> and <!--del_lnk--> CSS <i>Alabama</i> (1864).<p>At times the channel has served as a link joining shared cultures and political structures, from pre-Roman <!--del_lnk--> Celtic society, the <!--del_lnk--> Roman culture, and the foundation of <!--del_lnk--> Brittany by settlers from Great Britain, to the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman state.<p><a id="Crossing_and_Trade" name="Crossing_and_Trade"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Crossing and Trade</span></h2>

      <p>Adding to the high level of cross-channel traffic is the very significant traffic passing through the channel, linking the economies of northern Europe with the rest of the world. Combined, this maritime traffic makes the channel the busiest seaway in the world, accounting for a large share of global maritime trade (some sources place this at 20% or more).<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Seaports" name="Seaports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Seaports</span></h3>
      <p>Cross-channel trade has been a significant factor for societies on both sides of the Channel from prehistoric times, and a number of important <!--del_lnk--> seaports and <!--del_lnk--> ferry locations have developed in both England (<a href="../../wp/d/Dover.htm" title="Dover">Dover</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Southampton.htm" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Plymouth.htm" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Weymouth, <a href="../../wp/p/Portsmouth.htm" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Poole, <!--del_lnk--> Newhaven) and France (<!--del_lnk--> Calais, <!--del_lnk--> Caen (<!--del_lnk--> Ouistreham), <!--del_lnk--> Dieppe, <!--del_lnk--> Le Havre, <!--del_lnk--> Cherbourg-Octeville, <!--del_lnk--> Roscoff, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Malo).<p><a id="Ferry" name="Ferry"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ferry</span></h3>

      <p>The Sport of Channel Swimming traces its origins to the latter part of the 19th century when Captain <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Webb made the first observed and unassisted swim across the Strait of Dover swimming from England to France on <!--del_lnk--> 24 August&ndash;<!--del_lnk--> 25 August <!--del_lnk--> 1875 in 21 hours and 45 minutes.<p>In 1927 (at a time when less than ten swimmers had managed to emulate the feat and a number of dubious claims were being made), the <!--del_lnk--> Channel Swimming Association (the CSA) was founded to authenticate and ratify swimmers&#39; claims to have swum the English Channel and to verify crossing times. The CSA was dissolved in 1999 and succeeded by two separate organisations: The <!--del_lnk--> CSA (Ltd) and the <!--del_lnk--> Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation (CSPF) (<!--del_lnk--> website). Both organisations are registered with the international governing body for swimming <!--del_lnk--> Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) (<!--del_lnk--> website) and observe and authenticate Cross-Channel Swims in the Strait of Dover.<p>Although the swimming rules and regulations of the two organisations are virtually identical, the CSA has not always been prepared to recognise swims conducted under the auspices of the larger and more popular CSPF.<p>A comprehensive list of all registered and verified <b>solo swims</b> is available from <!--del_lnk--> http://home.btconnect.com/critchlow/ChannelSwimDatabase.htm<p>A comprehensive list of all registered and verified <b>solo and relay swims</b> is available from <!--del_lnk--> http://www.doverlife.co.uk/channelswimming<p>For a list of Channel Swimming Association Records for swims registered only under the rules of the Channel Swimming Association and verified by that body, go to [www.channelswimmingassociation.com www.channelswimmingassociation.com]<ul>
