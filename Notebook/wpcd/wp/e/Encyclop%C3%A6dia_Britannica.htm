      <p>The <i><b>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</b></i> (properly spelled with the <!--del_lnk--> &aelig; <!--del_lnk--> ligature) is a general <!--del_lnk--> encyclopedia published by the <!--del_lnk--> privately held <!--del_lnk--> Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica Inc.. Regarded as one of the most important and widely recognized <!--del_lnk--> reference works in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, the encylopedia was first published progressively from 1768&ndash;71 as <i><b>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, or, A dictionary of arts and sciences, compiled upon a new plan</b></i>. It was one of the first printed English encyclopedias and today is the oldest continuously published English-language encyclopedia in the world.<p>From the late 18th century to the early 20th century, <i>Britannica&#39;</i>s articles were often judged as the foremost authority on a topic, and sometimes included new research or theory intended for a scholarly audience. During this era, the <i>Britannica</i> gained its erudite reputation and had a unique position in English-speaking culture.<p>The <i>Britannica</i> has survived fierce competition from an ever-increasing number of alternative information sources. New reference sources, such as <!--del_lnk--> academic journals, <!--del_lnk--> textbooks, specialized publications, and electronic resources, have redefined the demand for the print encyclopedia; although a print edition is still available, the <i>Britannica</i> has evolved primarily into electronic versions on <!--del_lnk--> CD-ROM, <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> and the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>.<p>

      <p>A product of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Enlightenment, the <i>Britannica</i> was originally published in late 1768 in <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and was the idea of <!--del_lnk--> Colin Macfarquhar, a bookseller and printer, and <!--del_lnk--> Andrew Bell, an engraver, who published the reference work under the <!--del_lnk--> pseudonym &quot;Society of Gentlemen.&quot; Needing an editor, the two chose a 28-year-old scholar named <!--del_lnk--> William Smellie who was offered 200 <a href="../../wp/p/Pound_sterling.htm" title="Pound sterling">pounds sterling</a> to produce the encyclopedia in 100 parts and three volumes. The first part appeared in December 1768, priced <!--del_lnk--> sixpence. By 1771, <i>Britannica</i> was complete, with 2,391 pages and 160 engraved illustrations; an estimated 3,000 copies had been sold. It consisted of three equally sized volumes covering A&ndash;B, C&ndash;L, and M&ndash;Z.<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

The longest are &quot;Anatomy,&quot; 166 pages, and &quot;Surgery,&quot; 238 pages. &quot;The various technical terms, etc., are explained as they occur in the order of the alphabet.&quot; &quot;Instead of dismembering the sciences, by attempting to treat them intelligibly under a multitude of technical terms, they have digested the principles of every science in the form of systems or distinct treatises, and explained the terms as they occur in the order of the alphabet, with references to the sciences to which they belong.&quot; This plan, as the compilers say, differs from that of all the previous dictionaries of arts and sciences. Its merit and novelty consist in&hellip; on the one hand keeping important subjects together, and on the other facilitating reference by numerous separate articles.</td>

      <p>It was with the third edition, published 1788&ndash;97 and edited by Macfarquhar (and after his death by <!--del_lnk--> George Gleig), that the encyclopedic vision was finally realized. Not only was it broader in scope, with 18 volumes plus a two-volume supplement of more than 16,000 pages&mdash;the third edition was the first to include articles written specifically for the <i>Britannica</i> canon by experts and academics, many of whom were recruited by Gleig. The third edition established the foundation of the <i>Britannica</i> as an important and definitive reference work for much of the next century.<p>Generally the major articles in the editions through the 10th edition were more scholarly and longer than the articles in late 20th- to 21st-century encyclopedias. Nineteenth-century editions of the <i>Britannica</i> regularly included notable new or major works from its authors that were not as forthcoming later down the line. Also, unlike similar publications, such as the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> <i><!--del_lnk--> Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, that were first published in the eighteenth century, the <i>Britannica</i> was an extremely conservative publication. Later editions were dedicated to the reigning <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">British monarch</a>.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Archibald Constable, an apprentice bookseller, was involved in the publication to varying degrees from 1788 and after Macfarquhar&#39;s death in 1793. Constable, after a stretch of work in his own publishing firm, went on in 1812 to acquire the <i>Britannica</i> from its trustees. From 1812 to 1826 his firm published the <i>Britannica</i>. The fourth, fifth and sixth editions, and the supplement to them, included works by a number of highly regarded Scottish and English authors and scientists: <!--del_lnk--> William Hazlitt, <!--del_lnk--> John Stuart Mill, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Malthus.htm" title="Thomas Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>, <!--del_lnk--> David Ricardo, <a href="../../wp/w/Walter_Scott.htm" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Young, whose article on <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> included the translation of the <!--del_lnk--> hieroglyphics on the <a href="../../wp/r/Rosetta_Stone.htm" title="Rosetta Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>.<p>In the late 1820s, due to financial problems at Constable, the rights to the <i>Britannica</i> were acquired by the Edinburgh publishing firm of <!--del_lnk--> A &amp; C Black. They published the seventh and eighth editions, and included new chapters, such as &quot;Architecture&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> William Hosking. The landmark ninth edition, often called &#39;the Scholar&#39;s Edition&#39;, was published from 1875 to 1889. The ninth edition included numerous in-depth scholarly articles by pre-eminent authors, and therefore is considered by some to mark the high point in the history of English-language encyclopedias.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A &amp; C Black moved to London in 1895. The <i>Britannica</i> later became associated with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Times</i> newspaper, and was sold in 1901. The 10th edition&mdash;of 11 volumes, including map and index volumes&mdash;was issued in effect as a large supplement to the ninth edition. The American <!--del_lnk--> Horace Everett Hooper was the publisher from 1897 to 1922. From 1909, and for the 11th edition, the publication became associated with the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, England.<p>The substantially rewritten 11th edition of 1910&ndash;11 is a classic edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>. The role of the encyclopedia changed substantially in the early 20th century, and the <!--del_lnk--> 11th edition of <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> (1911) reflected this. One key change was a shift from attempting to encompass the cutting edge of human knowledge, a goal made impractical by&mdash;among other things&mdash;the rapid expansion of scientific knowledge around the turn of the century. A second change reflected a changing readership. As the use of the encyclopedia as a general reference grew, readers expected shorter, more readable articles, rather than the primary authoritative scholarship that had defined earlier versions. These articles, intended to gain a wider audience and increased sales, were shorter, but still thorough in their own frame.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Sometimes called the <!--del_lnk--> 1911 <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, this edition is available in the <!--del_lnk--> public domain. The 11th edition was the first to be published substantially at one time, instead of volume by volume. The complete text is freely available online.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> trademark and publication rights were sold after the 11th edition to <!--del_lnk--> Sears Roebuck and it moved to Chicago. The 12th and 13th editions each took the form of a three-volume supplement (an update), intended for used in conjunction with the 11th edition. The 14th edition of 1929 marked a major shift, with fewer volumes and shorter articles, meant to be more accessible as a reference to a wider range of readers. However, the 14th edition was criticised by priest-turned-atheist <!--del_lnk--> Joseph McCabe, who claimed that it had been stripped of unfavourable content about the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>.<p>Sears Roebuck offered the rights to the <i>Britannica</i> as a gift to the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in 1941. <!--del_lnk--> William Benton was the publisher from 1943 to his death in 1973, followed by his widow Helen Hemingway Benton until her own death in 1974. In <!--del_lnk--> January <!--del_lnk--> 1996, the <i>Britannica</i> was purchased by <!--del_lnk--> billionaire <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> financier <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Safra. In <!--del_lnk--> October <!--del_lnk--> 2002, <i><!--del_lnk--> Esquire</i> editor <!--del_lnk--> A. J. Jacobs set out to read all 33,000 pages of the <i>Britannica</i>. He chronicled this quest for knowledge in the 2004 book <i>The Know-It-All</i>.<p><a id="CD-ROM_edition_and_Britannica_Online" name="CD-ROM_edition_and_Britannica_Online"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">CD-ROM edition and Britannica Online</span></h2>
      <p>In the 1980s, <a href="../../wp/m/Microsoft.htm" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> approached Britannica Inc. to collaborate on a <!--del_lnk--> CD-ROM encyclopedia. Britannica Inc., feeling that they had control of the market and showing strong profits (sales of the complete <i>Britannica</i> were priced between <!--del_lnk--> $1,500 and $2,200), turned Microsoft down. Britannica Inc.&#39;s senior management viewed their product as a luxury brand with an impeccable reputation handed down from generation to generation. They did not believe that a CD-ROM could adequately compete or supplement their business. In turn, Microsoft used content from <i><!--del_lnk--> Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia</i> to create what is now known as <i><!--del_lnk--> Encarta</i>.<p>In 1990, the <i>Britannica&#39;s</i> sales reached all-time high of $650 million. But <i>Encarta</i>, released in 1993, became a software staple with almost every computer purchase and the <i>Britannica&#39;s</i> market share plummeted. Britannica Inc. countered by offering a CD-ROM version of their product, although a CD-ROM could not generate the $500 to $600 in sales commissions that the print version did. Britannica Inc. decided on charging $995 for customers looking to purchase only the CD-ROM, while bundling a free disc with the print version. Britannica Inc. hoped that including the CD-ROM would entice buyers to stay with the brand.<p>In 1994 an online version was launched, with subscriptions for sale for $2,000. By 1996, the cost of the CD-ROM had dropped to $200. Sales had plummeted to $325 million&mdash;about half of their 1990 levels. Only 55,000 hard copy versions were sold in 1994, compared with 117,000 in 1990, and sales later fell to 20,000. Facing financial pressure, Britannica Inc. was purchased by Swiss financier <!--del_lnk--> Jacob Safra in 1996 for $135 million, a fraction of its book value. Since then Safra has introduced massive price-cutting measures in an effort to compete with <i>Encarta</i>, even offering the entire reference free of charge for a time (around 18 months, from <!--del_lnk--> October 1999 to <!--del_lnk--> March 2001) on the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>.<p>Currently, Britannica co-operates with <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> companies (&#x9060;&#x6D41;/&#x667A;&#x6167;&#x85CF;&#x5B78;&#x7FD2;&#x79D1;&#x6280;&#x516C;&#x53F8;) to provide a <!--del_lnk--> Traditional Chinese-<a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> bilingual version encyclopedia on internet according to the 2002 edition. It is the first bilingual product of Britannica.<p>Former editor-in-chief <!--del_lnk--> Robert McHenry believes that Britannica failed to exploit its early advantages in the market for electronic encyclopedias. Britannica had, for example, published the second <!--del_lnk--> multimedia encyclopedia titled <!--del_lnk--> <i>Compton&#39;s MultiMedia Encyclopedia</i> as early as 1989 (the first one being the <i><!--del_lnk--> Academic American Encyclopedia</i> published by <!--del_lnk--> Grolier), but did not launch <i>Britannica CD</i> until 1994, one year after Microsoft launched their <i>Encarta</i> encyclopedia. McHenry believes these failures were due to a reluctance among senior management to fully embrace the new technology, caused largely by the overriding influence of the sales staff and management. The sales personnel earned commissions from door-to-door selling of the print encyclopedias, which McHenry believes led to decisions about the distribution and pricing of the electronic products being driven by the desires of the sales personnel, rather than market conditions and customer expectations.<p><a id="Competition" name="Competition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Competition</span></h2>
      <p>Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges to the <i>Britannica</i> is the ease with which people can find information online. Many people simply prefer to find information with the help of a <!--del_lnk--> search engine, such as <a href="../../wp/g/Google.htm" title="Google">Google</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Yahoo! or <!--del_lnk--> MSN Search. While the information available on the Internet is typically not as structured and critically edited as that contained in <i>Britannica</i>, this is partly compensated for by the convenience and the sheer volume of information typically available on any subject. Advanced searching algorithms, such as <!--del_lnk--> page rank algorithm used by <a href="../../wp/g/Google.htm" title="Google">Google</a>, also assist an experienced user to quickly narrow down an investigation to relevant pages.<p>Online alternatives to the <i>Britannica</i> include <a href="../../wp/w/Wikipedia.htm" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, a <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">Web</a>-based free-content encyclopedia. Wikipedia is free to use; alternatively, the print and electronic versions of <i>Britannica</i> are available at libraries for checkout (either directly or through <!--del_lnk--> ILL) and can be accessed from home using some library web sites.<p>Substantive comparisons between the <i>Britannica</i> and Wikipedia are hard to draw. The journal <i><!--del_lnk--> Nature</i> reported on <!--del_lnk--> December 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 that of the 42 science articles it reviewed, there were 162 mistakes in Wikipedia versus 123 for <i>Britannica</i>. Britannica Inc. attacked <i>Nature&#39;</i>s study as flawed and misleading  and demanded a retraction. It mentioned that two of the articles in the study were actually from a <i>Britannica</i> year book, and not the encyclopedia. Another two were from <i>Compton&#39;s Encyclopedia</i> (called the <i>Britannica Student Encyclopedia</i> on the company&#39;s web site) and yet another reviewer comment regards an unknown publication. <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles. <i>Britannica</i> continued by citing several facts that were classified as errors by <i>Nature</i> but were not incorrect (e.g., the spelling of <i>Crotona</i> as <i>Crotone</i>). <i>Nature</i> defended its story and declined to retract it, stating that as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica, it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica&#39;s website.<p>As for the CD-ROM and DVD-ROM versions of Britannica, its biggest competitor is <i><!--del_lnk--> Encarta</i>. Both are in the same price range, with the 2007 Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>50 and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">US$</a>45. Britannica contains 100,000 articles, <!--del_lnk--> Merriam-Webster&#39;s Dictionary and Thesaurus (U.S. only), as well having Primary and Seconday School editions. Encarta contains 64,000 articles, a U.S. and U.K. dictionary, and a youth edition. Britannica has been criticised for only catering for <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> audiences, because <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>-related articles are less often updated, maps of the United States are more detailed than the rest of the World, and due to its lack of a U.K. dictionary. However, Britannica is still regarded as more in depth than Encarta.<p>Comparing <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> with other print encyclopedias also provides a mixed picture. <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Kister&#39;s <i>Kister&#39;s Best Encyclopedias,</i> 2nd edition (1994) compared the accuracy of several encyclopedias. <i>Britannica</i>, although more accurate than many, was ranked lower than <i><!--del_lnk--> Encyclopedia Americana,</i> <i><!--del_lnk--> World Book Encyclopedia,</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Compton&#39;s Encyclopedia,</i> all of which received perfect scores. Another area in which <i>Britannica</i> lags when compared with other print reference works is currency. <i>Kister&#39;s</i> ranked <i>Britannica</i> lower in this respect than the same three aforementioned works, as well.<p><a id="Current_version" name="Current_version"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Current version</span></h2>

      <p>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica Inc. now owns a <!--del_lnk--> trademark on the word &quot;Britannica.&quot; The current version of <i>Britannica</i> was written by over 4,000 contributors, including noted scholars such as <!--del_lnk--> Milton Friedman, <!--del_lnk--> Michael DeBakey and <a href="../../wp/c/Carl_Sagan.htm" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>. Under the influence of the director of planning, <!--del_lnk--> Mortimer Adler, the 15th edition, first published in 1974 and frequently reissued since, was published not as one alphabetical sequence of volumes as previously but in three parts that covered topics in different degrees of depth: a one-volume <!--del_lnk--> Prop&aelig;dia that provides a structured hierarchy to all the information in the set, a 12-volume Microp&aelig;dia which contains short articles (most of them from one to five paragraphs), and a 17-volume Macrop&aelig;dia for longer articles, which range from a few pages to over three hundred pages. The Microp&aelig;dia provides cross-references from articles to more extended treatment in the Macrop&aelig;dia or to other related Microp&aelig;dia coverage. Macrop&aelig;dia articles deal with topics such as countries, individual sciences and surveys of broad divisions of culture. They contain many subsections which would be covered by individual articles in most encyclopedias. Britannica&#39;s intention is to provide systematic surveys of knowledge and to put detail into context. A two-volume index was added in 1985. The print edition continues to be produced, with each version being an updated printing of the 15th edition. Forty-six percent of the content of the encyclopedia has been revised within the last three years. A newly revised print set was issued in 2005.<p>The <i>Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2006 DVD</i> contains over 55 million words and just over 100,000 articles. This includes 73,645 regular Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica articles, with the remainder drawn from the <i>Britannica Student Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, the <i>Britannica Elementary Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> and the <i>Britannica Book of the Year</i> (1993&ndash;2004), plus a small number of &quot;classic&quot; articles from early editions of the encyclopaedia. The package also includes a range of supplementary content including maps, videos, sound clips, animations and web links. It also offers study tools and dictionary and thesaurus entries from <i><!--del_lnk--> Merriam-Webster</i>.<p>The online version has more than 120,000 articles and is updated daily. It also has daily features, updates and links to news articles from <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i> and the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Subscriptions cost $69.95 per year in the United States and &pound;39.99 per year in the United Kingdom. Weekly and monthly plans are also available. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries and this is an important part of Britannica&#39;s business.<p><i>Britannica</i> uses a hybrid of <a href="../../wp/b/British_English.htm" title="British English">British</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/American_English.htm" title="American English">American English</a>, for example <i>colour</i> (not <i>colour</i>), <i>centre</i> (not <i>centre</i>), <i>encyclopaedia</i> (not <i>encyclopedia</i>), but <i>civilize</i> (not <i>civilise</i>) and <i>defense</i> (not <i>defence</i>).<p><a id="Editors" name="Editors"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Editors</span></h3>

      <p>There are several abbreviated Britannica encyclopedias. The single-volume <i>Britannica Concise Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> has 28,000 articles; <i>Compton&#39;s by Britannica</i>, which incorporates the former <i><!--del_lnk--> Compton&#39;s Encyclopedia</i>, consists of 26 volumes with a total of 11,000 pages, and is aimed at secondary school age children; <i>My First Britannica</i> is aimed at 6 to 12 year olds; and the <i>Britannica Discovery Library</i> is targeted at pre-school children. Since 1938 Britannica has published annually a <i>Book of the Year</i> chronicling the past year&#39;s events, also available online back to the 1994 edition (covering the events of 1993). Britannica Inc. also publishes a number of specialist reference works.<p><a id="Edition_history" name="Edition_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Edition history</span></h2>
