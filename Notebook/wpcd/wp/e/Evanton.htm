      <p><b>Evanton</b> (<a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Scottish Gaelic</a>: <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd"><i>Baile E&ograve;ghainn</i></span>) is a small town, or rather, a large village in <!--del_lnk--> Easter Ross, in the <!--del_lnk--> Highland region of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. It lies between the river <!--del_lnk--> Sgitheach and the <!--del_lnk--> Allt Graad, is 24 kilometres (15 miles) north of the city of Inverness, some 6.5 km (4 miles) south-west of <!--del_lnk--> Alness, and 10 km (6.5 miles) north-west of <!--del_lnk--> Dingwall. The village has five streets, the main one being Balconie Street (B817). It has been desribed by analysts at Highland Council as a &quot;commuting settlement&quot;, because most of the inhabitants work in other areas of Easter Ross and the greater Inverness area.<p>The current town was founded in the early <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century by <!--del_lnk--> Evan Fraser of Balconie, but the core of the village buildings date from the Victorian era. Evanton has several tourist attractions, including the <!--del_lnk--> Fyrish monument, the <!--del_lnk--> Black Rock Gorge and the ruined church of <!--del_lnk--> Kiltearn lying near the river Sgitheach as it flows into the <!--del_lnk--> Cromarty Firth, as well as other miscellaneous natural, historical and archaeological attractions in the surrounding area. There are two Churches, one <!--del_lnk--> Church of Scotland and one <!--del_lnk--> Free Church of Scotland. There is one primary school, but the nearest high schools are in Dingwall and Alness. It has one convenience store, a post-office, two public inns (Balconie Inn and Novar Arms) and several other miscellaneous businesses. The village hall is named the &#39;Diamond Jubilee Hall.&#39;<p>

      <p>Evanton lies within the ancient parish of <!--del_lnk--> Kiltearn (<a href="../../wp/s/Scottish_Gaelic_language.htm" title="Scottish Gaelic language">Gd:</a> <i>Cill Tighearna</i>), within the medieval lands known as Ferindonald (<i>Fearann Dh&ograve;mhnaill</i>) in the heart of the old &quot;Earldom&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> Ross. Traditionally, Ferindonald is supposed to be derived from a grant of King <a href="../../wp/m/Malcolm_III_of_Scotland.htm" title="Malcolm III of Scotland">M&aacute;el Coluim III</a> to Domnall &quot;Munro&quot; (<i>Domhnall mac an Rothaich</i>), the legendary progenitor of <!--del_lnk--> Clan Munro. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this family until the <!--del_lnk--> fourteenth century, and it is not likely to be historically accurate.<p>Evanton is in close proximity to the site of <!--del_lnk--> Balconie Castle, an old seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Mormaers and <!--del_lnk--> Earls of Ross. By the early modern period, the area was dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Munros of <!--del_lnk--> Foulis (<i>Foghlais</i>), who had <!--del_lnk--> their castle just a few kilometres away. Indeed, the latter began to bury their family at Kiltearn after <!--del_lnk--> 1588. The <i>Cille</i> place-name in Kiltearn tells us that there had been a very ancient Gaelic church near Evanton, like all <i>Cille</i> place-names, founded before <!--del_lnk--> 800. The current Gaelic name <i>Cill Tighearna</i> (&quot;Church of the Lord&quot;) is probably a corruption of an older form, both because the name formation is unusual in being dedicated to the Lord Himself, and because the form given in <!--del_lnk--> 1227 is <i>Kiltierny</i>, suggesting some kind of connection to <!--del_lnk--> Tigernach in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Other suggestions have included a dedication to St Ternan.  The church lay next to the lordly residence of Balconie. By the <!--del_lnk--> later middle ages, Balconie was one of the five lordships of Ross, as well as an individual seat of the Earls of Ross. Place-name evidence suggests that the site may once have been a Pictish residence. A charter granted by <!--del_lnk--> Aodh, Earl of Ross in <!--del_lnk--> 1281 records the name <i>Petkenny</i>, but a charter of <!--del_lnk--> 1333 refers to a location called <i>Balkenny</i>. The development of the name <!--del_lnk--> Pitlochry, where Pictish <i>Pit-</i> is replaced by Gaelic <i>Baile</i>, suggests the names are the same, but the great early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="Twentieth century">twentieth century</a> <!--del_lnk--> toponymist <!--del_lnk--> William J. Watson was doubftful.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p>Before the industrial era, Scotland had nothing that we would call a city, although it had many towns. For most of the country though, there was just a series of scattered hamlets and lordly estates. So it was in Kiltearn. There had been a settlement, an old <i>ferm toun</i> known as Drummond (<i>Drumainn</i>), near the location of Evanton, and several lordly residences, such as Foulis, Novar and Balconie Castle. In <!--del_lnk--> 1807, the local landowner <!--del_lnk--> Evan Fraser of Balconie was clearing his estates to make way for sheep, and founded Evanton as a planned settlement for the relocated residents, modestly naming it after himself. To this day, in the words of one historian, Evanton &quot;remains today an attractive example of a well planned, regularly laid out estate village&quot;.The Reverend Thomas Munro expressed similar sentiments in the <!--del_lnk--> 1840s, when he wrote that &quot;the village was built on a waste of land, and differs from all others in the country by its regular and neat appearance&quot;.  The village suffered from the severe famine that plagued the Highlands in <!--del_lnk--> 1840s. There was a riot in the village in <!--del_lnk--> 1846, because the authorities continued to export grain despite the failure of the previous year&#39;s potato crop; similar riots occurred in <!--del_lnk--> Rosemarkie, <!--del_lnk--> Balintraid and <!--del_lnk--> Avoch. In <!--del_lnk--> 1847, there was near starvation in the village, and the villagers managed to maintain themselves on <!--del_lnk--> turnips. However, the village population recovered; by the beginnings of the <!--del_lnk--> First World War, Evanton had taken much of its current physical shape, and at this point in time contained businesses as diverse as a tobacconist and a bicycle shop,  both of which have subsequently disappeared.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the twentieth century, the village enjoyed a variety of fortunes. The distillery closed in 1926 (see below) and one of the most important historical locations in Easter Ross, <!--del_lnk--> Balconie Castle, was demolished in <!--del_lnk--> 1965. It had been an old seat of the Earls of Ross, but by the <!--del_lnk--> 1960s the owner could not afford to repair the dry rot. There was a <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> <!--del_lnk--> airfield constructed near Evanton in <!--del_lnk--> 1922, on Alness Bay. It was known as the &quot;Novar Base&quot;, because of its location on the Novar Estates. It was serviced from <!--del_lnk--> Leuchars, and was used by the aircraft from the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Home Fleet base of <!--del_lnk--> Invergordon. The largest aircraft to have landed there was a <!--del_lnk--> USAAF <!--del_lnk--> B17. On <!--del_lnk--> Empire Day, <!--del_lnk--> 1939, RAF bases all over the United Kingdom were opened to the public, and the Evanton Aerodrome was the most northerly location to participate, attracting 9000 visitors. The base closed in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s. However, the oil boom of the 1970s caused radical expansion of the village. It has been growing steadily ever since. <p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>
      <p>The modern village is on average a little younger than the Highland region in general. The population of Evanton varies depending on how it is calculated. The Evanton &quot;Settlement Zone&quot; is different from the Evanton &quot;Settlement&quot;, and the former is of course larger. There are 671 households and 1678 inhabitants in total in the Evanton-zone. Evanton-settlement on its own however has only 1105 inhabitants. The population in both cases though is growing steadily, and the 1990s saw a moderate increase of 8.12% for the zone, rising from 1552 to 1678; and 10.72% for the settlement on its own, rising from 998 to 1105. Over two thirds of the houses in the zone are owner-occupied. Roughly 16.4% or 275 people who live in Evanton-zone were born outside of Scotland, almost always coming from <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>Evanton is more or less enclosed to the north-east and the south-west by two rivers, the <!--del_lnk--> Allt Graad and the <!--del_lnk--> River Sgitheach. The <!--del_lnk--> Allt Graad, sometimes called the River Glass, is a picturesque river that flows from <!--del_lnk--> Loch Glass, near <!--del_lnk--> Ben Wyvis, for 9 km (5&frac12; miles) until it passes the northern end of the village, and empties into the <!--del_lnk--> Cromarty Firth. However, some 3 km (2 miles) before it reaches the <!--del_lnk--> Cromarty Firth, it passes through the <!--del_lnk--> Black Rock Gorge. The latter is a few hundred metres in length and reaches 36 metres (120 feet) in height. In April, <!--del_lnk--> 2004, ten days of filming took place in the area for the movie <i><!--del_lnk--> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> and the Gorge is the setting for one scene.  The <!--del_lnk--> River Sgitheach, sometimes written as Skiack or Skiach, is not as large a river as the Allt Graad and can run low in the summer. It flows from the mountains of inland Ross and is complemented by numerous other streams until it passes several waterfalls before flowing past the southern end of the village, and the northern end of the old settlement of Drummond, into the Cromatry Firth about 1 km from the mouth of the Allt Graad.<p><a id="Economy" name="Economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Economy</span></h2>
      <p>A significant but small percentage of people have employment in the oil industry owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the <!--del_lnk--> Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include <!--del_lnk--> forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as <!--del_lnk--> Inverness, <!--del_lnk--> Dingwall, <!--del_lnk--> Alness and <!--del_lnk--> Invergordon, which is why only 13% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% of the population of the zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.<p>There had been a distillery in the Evanton area of the Kiltearn parish as early as the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century, its existence being reported by Harry Robertson, the author of the late eighteenth century Kiltearn section of the late eighteenth century <!--del_lnk--> 1st Statistical Account. The Glen Skiack distillery opened in <!--del_lnk--> 1896  and only ever produced a relatively small amount of Whisky. However, the effects of the U.S. <!--del_lnk--> Prohibition law, which damaged the income of all Scottish distilleries, proved too much for Glen Skiack, and the operation was forced to close in <!--del_lnk--> 1926. The building itself was demolished in <!--del_lnk--> 1933.<p><a id="Transport" name="Transport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transport</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1860, the government decided to construct a railway line going from Inverness through <!--del_lnk--> Easter Ross. The line was completed by <!--del_lnk--> 1862, and the following year, on May 23rd 1863, Evanton gained its own train station. However, the station was called Novar, and was not renamed &quot;Evanton&quot; until <!--del_lnk--> 1937. Sadly for the local economy, the station was closed in June <!--del_lnk--> 1960. The platforms remain there to this day, but the signal posts have been destroyed. The Inverness to Thurso railway line, known today as &quot;Far North Line&quot;, still passes by the seaward side of the town, and the trains can still be heard from a great distance. The nearest train station is Alness.<p>The A9, the great road connecting Inverness with the far north, once ran through Evanton, on the path of Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as part of a general scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields.  This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by <!--del_lnk--> Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1845, the local minister wrote that the &quot;the language generally spoken is an impure form of Gaelic, but it is rapidly losing ground&quot; and that &quot;in Evanton, both English and Gaelic are spoken indifferently&quot;. The minister wrote that the people, especially the children, learned English with ease after they had learned to write Gaelic. The minister also gave some reasons why the people were keen to learn English, telling us that &quot;English being the language universally spoken by the higher classes, the mass of the people attach a notion of superior refinement to the possession of it&quot;.  Half a century previously, Harry Robertson had praised the spirit of one watchmaker in the region, but added &quot;it is a pity that he can hardly read nor write, and hardly speaks English&quot;.<p>Today, one can see Gaelic written on the walls of the parish church, but the language has effectively died out, and English is totally dominant. Nevertheless, there are still some 72 residents (4.3%) of the village who know the language. The village is also a big location on the Highland folk-circuit, and enjoys a vibrant musical culture in the Gaelic tradition. It is a regular practice for local musicians to meet in the Balconie Inn, one of the two <!--del_lnk--> licenced establishments of the town, and engage in evening-long sessions. Many prominent musicians on the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic music scene have visited, including <!--del_lnk--> Dougie MacLean.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evanton&quot;</div>
