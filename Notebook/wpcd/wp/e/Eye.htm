      <p>In most <a href="../../wp/v/Vertebrate.htm" title="Vertebrate">vertebrates</a> and some <!--del_lnk--> mollusks, the eye works by allowing light to enter it and project onto a light-sensitive panel of cells known as the <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a> at the rear of the eye, where the light is detected and converted into electrical signals. These are then transmitted to the <a href="../../wp/b/Brain.htm" title="Brain">brain</a> via the <!--del_lnk--> optic nerve. Such eyes are typically roughly spherical, filled with a <!--del_lnk--> transparent gel-like substance called the <!--del_lnk--> vitreous humour, with a focusing <a href="../../wp/l/Lens_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Lens (anatomy)">lens</a> and often an <!--del_lnk--> iris which regulates the intensity of the light that enters the eye. The eyes of <!--del_lnk--> cephalopods, <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a>, <!--del_lnk--> amphibians, and <!--del_lnk--> snakes usually have fixed lens shapes, and focusing vision is achieved by telescoping the lens &mdash; similar to how a <!--del_lnk--> camera focuses.<p><!--del_lnk--> Compound eyes are found among the <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a> and are composed of many simple facets which give a pixelated image (not multiple images, as is often believed). Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and which can give a full 360 degree field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some <a href="../../wp/a/Arthropod.htm" title="Arthropod">arthropods</a>, including many <!--del_lnk--> Strepsiptera, have compound eye composed of a few facets each, with a retina capable of creating an image, which does provide multiple-image vision. With each eye viewing a different angle, a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain, providing a very wide-angle, high-resolution image.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Possessing detailed hyperspectral colour vision, the <!--del_lnk--> Mantis shrimp has been reported to have the world&#39;s most complex colour vision system. <!--del_lnk--> Trilobites, which are now extinct, had unique compound eyes. They used clear <a href="../../wp/c/Calcite.htm" title="Calcite">calcite</a> crystals to form the lenses of their eyes. In this, they differ from most other arthropods, which have soft eyes. The number of lenses in such an eye varied, however: some trilobites had only one, and some had thousands of lenses in one eye.<p>Some of the simplest eyes, called <!--del_lnk--> ocelli, can be found in animals like <!--del_lnk--> snails, who cannot actually &quot;see&quot; in the normal sense. They do have <!--del_lnk--> photosensitive cells, but no lens and no other means of projecting an image onto these cells. They can distinguish between light and dark, but no more. This enables snails to keep out of direct sunlight. Jumping spiders have simple eyes that are so large, supported by an array of other, smaller eyes, that they can get enough visual input to hunt and pounce on their prey. Some insect larvae, like caterpillars, have a different type of single eye (<!--del_lnk--> stemmata) which gives a rough image.<p><a id="Evolution_of_eyes" name="Evolution_of_eyes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Evolution of eyes</span></h2>

      </div>
      <p>The common origin (<!--del_lnk--> monophyly) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact based on shared anatomical and genetic features of all eyes; that is, all modern eyes, varied as they are, have their origins in a proto-eye evolved some 540 million years ago. The majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop, as the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an &quot;arms race&quot;. Prey animals and competing predators alike would be forced to rapidly match or exceed any such capabilities to survive. Hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel.<p>Eyes in various animals show adaptation to their requirements. For example, <a href="../../wp/b/Bird_of_prey.htm" title="Bird of prey">birds of prey</a> have much greater visual acuity than humans, and some can see <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light. The different forms of eyes in, for example, vertebrates and mollusks are often cited as examples of <!--del_lnk--> parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry.<p>The earliest eyes, called &quot;eyespots&quot;, were simple patches of <!--del_lnk--> photoreceptor cells, physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell. These eyespots could only sense ambient brightness: they could distinguish light and dark, but not the direction of the lightsource. This gradually changed as the eyespot depressed into a shallow &quot;cup&quot; shape, granting the ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source. The pit deepened over time, the opening diminished in size, and the number of photoreceptor cells increased, forming an effective <!--del_lnk--> pinhole camera that was capable of slightly distinguishing dim shapes.<p>The thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye&#39;s aperture, originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot, allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialize into a transparent humour that optimized colour filtering, blocked harmful radiation, improved the eye&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> refractive index, and allowed functionality outside of water. The transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers, with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution, and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased, in most species with the transparent <!--del_lnk--> crystallin protein.<p>The gap between tissue layers naturally formed a bioconvex shape, an ideal structure for a normal refractive index. Independently, a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer split forward from the lens: the <a href="../../wp/c/Cornea.htm" title="Cornea">cornea</a> and <!--del_lnk--> iris. Separation of the forward layer again forms a humour, the <!--del_lnk--> aqueous humour. This increases refractive power and again eases circulatory problems. Formation of a nontransparent ring allows more blood vessels, more circulation, and larger eye sizes.<p><a id="Anatomy_of_the_mammalian_eye" name="Anatomy_of_the_mammalian_eye"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Anatomy of the mammalian eye</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Three_layers" name="Three_layers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Three layers</span></h3>
      <p>The structure of the mammalian eye can be divided into three main layers or <i>tunics</i> whose names reflect their basic functions: the <!--del_lnk--> fibrous tunic, the <!--del_lnk--> vascular tunic, and the <!--del_lnk--> nervous tunic.<ul>
       <li>The fibrous tunic, also known as the <i>tunica fibrosa oculi</i>, is the outer layer of the eyeball consisting of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cornea.htm" title="Cornea">cornea</a> and <!--del_lnk--> sclera. The sclera gives the eye most of its white colour. It consists of dense <!--del_lnk--> connective tissue filled with the protein <!--del_lnk--> collagen to both protect the inner components of the eye and maintain its shape.<li>The vascular tunic, also known as the <i>tunica vasculosa oculi</i>, is the middle vascularized layer which includes the <!--del_lnk--> iris, <!--del_lnk--> ciliary body, and <!--del_lnk--> choroid. The choroid contains <!--del_lnk--> blood vessels that supply the retinal cells with necessary <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and remove the waste products of <!--del_lnk--> respiration. The choroid gives the inner eye a dark colour, which prevents disruptive reflections within the eye.<li>The nervous tunic, also known as the <i>tunica nervosa oculi</i>, is the inner sensory which includes the <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a>. The retina contains the photosensitive <!--del_lnk--> rod and <!--del_lnk--> cone cells and associated neurons. To maximise vision and light absorption, the retina is a relatively smooth (but curved) layer. It does have two points at which it is different; the <!--del_lnk--> fovea and <!--del_lnk--> optic disc. The fovea is a dip in the retina directly opposite the lens, which is densely packed with cone cells. It is largely responsible for <!--del_lnk--> colour vision in humans, and enables high acuity, such as is necessary in <!--del_lnk--> reading. The optic disc, sometimes referred to as the anatomical blind spot, is a point on the <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a> where the optic nerve pierces the retina to connect to the nerve cells on its inside. No photosensitive cells whatsoever exist at this point, it is thus &quot;blind&quot;.</ul>
      <p><a id="Anterior_and_posterior_segments" name="Anterior_and_posterior_segments"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anterior and posterior segments</span></h3>
      <p>The mammalian eye can also be divided into two main segments: the <!--del_lnk--> anterior segment and the <!--del_lnk--> posterior segment.<p><a id="Anterior_segment" name="Anterior_segment"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Anterior segment</span></h4>
      <p>The anterior segment is the front third of the eye that includes the structures in front of the <!--del_lnk--> vitreous humour: the <a href="../../wp/c/Cornea.htm" title="Cornea">cornea</a>, <!--del_lnk--> iris, <!--del_lnk--> ciliary body, and <a href="../../wp/l/Lens_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Lens (anatomy)">lens</a>. Within the anterior segment are two fluid-filled spaces: the <!--del_lnk--> anterior chamber and the <!--del_lnk--> posterior chamber. The anterior chamber is the space between the posterior surface of the cornea (i.e. the <!--del_lnk--> corneal endothelium) and the iris, whereas the posterior chamber is between the iris and the front face of the vitreous.<p>The cornea and lens help to <!--del_lnk--> converge light rays to focus onto the retina. The lens, behind the iris, is a <!--del_lnk--> convex, springy disk which focuses light, through the second humour, onto the <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a>. It is attached to the ciliary body via a ring of <!--del_lnk--> suspensory ligaments known as the <!--del_lnk--> Zonule of Zinn. To clearly see an object far away, the circularly arranged <!--del_lnk--> ciliary muscle will pull on the lens, flattening it. When the ciliary muscle contracts, the lens will spring back into a thicker, more convex, form. Humans gradually lose this flexibility with age, resulting in the inability to focus on nearby objects, which is known as <!--del_lnk--> presbyopia. There are other <!--del_lnk--> refraction errors arising from the shape of the cornea and lens, and from the length of the eyeball. These include <!--del_lnk--> myopia, <!--del_lnk--> hyperopia, and <!--del_lnk--> astigmatism. The iris, between the lens and the first humour, is a pigmented ring of fibrovascular tissue and muscle fibres. Light must first pass though the centre of the iris, the <a href="../../wp/p/Pupil.htm" title="Pupil">pupil</a>. The size of the pupil is actively adjusted by the circular and radial muscles to maintain a relatively constant level of light entering the eye. Too much light being let in could damage the retina; too little light makes sight difficult.<p>All of the individual components through which light travels within the eye before reaching the retina are transparent, minimising dimming of the light. Light enters the eye from an external medium such as air or water, passes through the cornea, and into the first of two humours, the <!--del_lnk--> aqueous humour. Most of the light refraction occurs at the cornea which has a fixed curvature. The first humour is a clear mass which connects the cornea with the lens of the eye, helps maintain the convex shape of the cornea (necessary to the <!--del_lnk--> convergence of light at the lens) and provides the <!--del_lnk--> corneal endothelium with nutrients.<p><a id="Posterior_segment" name="Posterior_segment"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Posterior segment</span></h4>

      <p>The posterior segment is the back two-thirds of the eye that includes the <!--del_lnk--> anterior hyaloid membrane and all structures behind it: the <!--del_lnk--> vitreous humor, <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a>, <!--del_lnk--> choroid, and <!--del_lnk--> optic nerve. On the other side of the lens is the second humour, the <!--del_lnk--> vitreous humour, which is bounded on all sides: by the <a href="../../wp/l/Lens_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Lens (anatomy)">lens</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ciliary body, suspensory ligaments and by the retina. It lets light through without refraction, helps maintain the shape of the eye and suspends the delicate lens. In some animals, the retina contains a reflective layer (the <!--del_lnk--> tapetum lucidum) which increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell perceives, allowing the animal to see better under low light conditions.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>In many species, the eyes are inset in the portion of the skull known as the <a href="../../wp/o/Orbit_%2528anatomy%2529.htm" title="Orbit (anatomy)">orbits</a> or eyesockets. This placement of the eyes helps to protect them from injury.<p>In humans, the <!--del_lnk--> eyebrows redirect flowing substances (such as rainwater or sweat) away from the eye. Water in the eye can alter the refractive properties of the eye and blur vision. It can also wash away the tear fluid &mdash; along with it the protective lipid layer &mdash; and can alter corneal physiology, due to <!--del_lnk--> osmotic differences between tear fluid and freshwater. This is made apparent when swimming in freshwater pools, as the osmotic gradient draws &quot;pool water&quot; into the corneal tissue (the pool water is <!--del_lnk--> hypotonic), causing <a href="../../wp/e/Edema.htm" title="Edema">edema</a>, and subsequently leaving the swimmer with &quot;cloudy&quot; or &quot;misty&quot; vision for a short period thereafter. It can be reversed by irrigating the eye with <!--del_lnk--> hypertonic <!--del_lnk--> saline which <!--del_lnk--> osmotically draws the excess water out of the eye.<p>In many animals, including humans, <a href="../../wp/e/Eyelid.htm" title="Eyelid">eyelids</a> wipe the eye and prevent dehydration. They spread <!--del_lnk--> tears on the eyes, which contains substances which help fight <!--del_lnk--> bacterial infection as part of the <!--del_lnk--> immune system. Some aquatic animals have a second eyelid in each eye which refracts the light and helps them see clearly both above and below water. Most creatures will automatically react to a threat to its eyes (such as an object moving straight at the eye, or a bright light) by covering the eyes, and/or by turning the eyes away from the threat. <!--del_lnk--> Blinking the eyes is, of course, also a <!--del_lnk--> reflex.<p>In many animals, including humans, <!--del_lnk--> eyelashes prevent fine particles from entering the eye. Fine particles can be bacteria, but also simple dust which can cause irritation of the eye, and lead to tears and subsequent blurred vision.<p><a id="Other_articles_regarding_eye_anatomy" name="Other_articles_regarding_eye_anatomy"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Other articles regarding eye anatomy</span></h4>

      <p>The structure of the mammalian eye owes itself completely to the task of focusing <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a> onto the <a href="../../wp/r/Retina.htm" title="Retina">retina</a>. This light causes <!--del_lnk--> chemical changes in the <!--del_lnk--> photosensitive cells of the retina, the products of which trigger <!--del_lnk--> nerve impulses which travel to the brain.<p>The retina contains two forms of photosensitive cells important to vision &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> rods and <!--del_lnk--> cones. Though structurally and metabolically similar, their function is quite different. Rod cells are highly sensitive to light allowing them to respond in dim light and dark conditions. These are the cells which allow humans and other animals to see by moonlight, or with very little available light (as in a dark room). This is why the darker conditions become, the less colour objects seem to have. Cone cells, conversely, need high light intensities to respond and have high visual acuity. Different cone cells respond to different <!--del_lnk--> wavelengths of light, which allows an organism to see colour.<p>The differences are useful; apart from enabling sight in both dim and light conditions, humans have given them further application. The fovea, directly behind the lens, consists of mostly densely-packed cone cells. This gives humans a highly detailed central vision, allowing reading, bird watching, or any other task which primarily requires looking at things. Its requirement for high intensity light does cause problems for <!--del_lnk--> astronomers, as they cannot see dim stars, or other objects, using central vision because the light from these is not enough to stimulate cone cells. Because cone cells are all that exist directly in the fovea, astronomers have to look at stars through the &quot;corner of their eyes&quot; (averted vision) where rods also exist, and where the light <i>is</i> sufficient to stimulate cells, allowing the individual to observe distant stars.<p>Rods and cones are both photosensitive, but respond differently to different frequencies of light. They both contain different pigmented <!--del_lnk--> photoreceptor <a href="../../wp/p/Protein.htm" title="Protein">proteins</a>. Rod cells contain the protein <!--del_lnk--> rhodopsin and cone cells contain different proteins for each colour-range. The process through which these proteins go is quite similar &mdash; upon being subjected to <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> of a particular wavelength and intensity, the protein breaks down into two constituent products. Rhodopsin, of rods, breaks down into <!--del_lnk--> opsin and <!--del_lnk--> retinal; iodopsin of cones breaks down into <!--del_lnk--> photopsin and <!--del_lnk--> retinal. The opsin in both opens <!--del_lnk--> ion channels on the <!--del_lnk--> cell membrane which leads to the generation of an <a href="../../wp/a/Action_potential.htm" title="Action potential">action potential</a> (an impulse which will eventually get to the visual cortex in the brain).<p>This is the reason why cones and rods enable organisms to see in dark and light conditions &mdash; each of the photoreceptor proteins requires a different light intensity to break down into the constituent products. Further, <!--del_lnk--> synaptic convergence means that several rod cells are connected to a single <!--del_lnk--> bipolar cell, which then connects to a single <!--del_lnk--> ganglion cell and information is relayed to the <!--del_lnk--> visual cortex. Whereas, a single cone cell is connected to a single bipolar cell. Thus, action potentials from rods share neurons, where those from cones are given their own. This results in the high visual acuity, or the high ability to distinguish between detail, of cone cells and not rods. If a ray of light were to reach just one rod cell this may not be enough to stimulate an action potential. Because several &quot;converge&quot; onto a bipolar cell, enough <!--del_lnk--> transmitter molecules reach the <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_synapse.htm" title="Synapse">synapse</a> of the bipolar cell to attain the <!--del_lnk--> threshold level to generate an <a href="../../wp/a/Action_potential.htm" title="Action potential">action potential</a>.<p>Furthermore, colour is distinguishable when breaking down the iodopsin of cone cells because there are three forms of this protein. One form is broken down by the particular EM wavelength that is red light, another green light, and lastly blue light. In simple terms, this allows human beings to see <!--del_lnk--> red, green and blue light. If all three forms of cones are stimulated equally, then white is seen. If none are stimulated, black is seen. Most of the time however, the three forms are stimulated to different extents &mdash; resulting in different colors being seen. If, for example, the red and green cones are stimulated to the same extent, and no blue cones are stimulated, <!--del_lnk--> yellow is seen. For this reason red, green and blue are called <!--del_lnk--> primary colors and the colors obtained by mixing two of them, <!--del_lnk--> secondary colors. The secondary colors can be further complimented with primary colors to see <!--del_lnk--> tertiary colors.<p><a id="Acuity" name="Acuity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Acuity</span></h2>

      <p>Visual acuity can be measured with several different metrics.<p>Cycles per <!--del_lnk--> degree (CPD) measures how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of degree angles. It is essentially no different from <!--del_lnk--> angular resolution. To measure CPD, first draw a series of black and white lines of equal width on a grid (similar to a bar code). Next, place the observer at a distance such that the sides of the grid appear one degree apart. If the grid is 1 meter away, then the grid should be about 8.7 millimeters wide. Finally, increase the number of lines and decrease the width of each line until the grid appears as a solid grey block. In one degree, a human would not be able to distinguish more than about 12 lines without the lines blurring together. So a human can resolve distances of about 0.93 millimeters at a distance of one meter. A horse can resolve about 17 CPD (0.66 mm at 1 m) and a rat can resolve about 1 CPD (8.7 mm at 1 m).<p>A <!--del_lnk--> diopter is the unit of measure of <!--del_lnk--> optical power.<p><a id="Dynamic_range" name="Dynamic_range"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dynamic range</span></h2>
      <p>At any given instant, the retina can resolve a <!--del_lnk--> contrast ratio of around 100:1 (about 6 1/2 <!--del_lnk--> stops). As soon as your eye moves (saccades) it re-adjusts its exposure both chemically and by adjusting the iris. Initial dark adaptation takes place in approximately four seconds of profound, uninterrupted darkness; full adaptation through adjustments in retinal chemistry (the <!--del_lnk--> Purkinje effect) are mostly complete in thirty minutes. Hence, over time, a contrast ratio of about 1,000,000:1 (about 20 <!--del_lnk--> stops) can be resolved. The process is nonlinear and multifaceted, so an interruption by light nearly starts the adaptation process over again. Full adaptation is dependent on good blood flow; thus dark adaptation may be hampered by poor circulation, and vasoconstrictors like alcohol or tobacco.<p><a id="Eye_movement" name="Eye_movement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eye movement</span></h2>

      <p>Animals with compound eyes have a wide field of vision, allowing them to look in many directions. To see more, they have to move their entire head or even body.<p>The visual system in the brain is too slow to process that information if the images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second (Westheimer and McKee, 1954). Thus, for humans to be able to see while moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Another complication for vision in frontal-eyed animals is the development of a small area of the retina with a very high visual acuity. This area is called the fovea, and covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Eye movements are thus very important for visual perception, and any failure to make them correctly can lead to serious visual disabilities.<p>Having two eyes is an added complication, because the brain must point both of them accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas; otherwise, double vision would occur. The movements of different body parts are controlled by striated muscles acting around joints. The movements of the eye are no exception, but they have special advantages not shared by skeletal muscles and joints, and so are considerably different.<p><a id="How_we_see_an_object" name="How_we_see_an_object"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">How we see an object</span></h4>

      <p>What is seen as colour is essentially different combinations of certain ranges of wavelengths in the <!--del_lnk--> electromagnetic spectrum. In humans at least, there are three different kinds of cones for three ranges of wavelengths, roughly red, green and blue light. Each color of cone picks up the intensity of light in its range of wavelengths, and the combination is translated by the brain to a perceived color. Of course, some people lack the ability to see some or all of the colour spectrum: they are referred to as being <a href="../../wp/c/Color_blindness.htm" title="Color blindness">&#39;colour blind&#39;</a>.<p><a id="Extraocular_muscles" name="Extraocular_muscles"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Extraocular muscles</span></h4>

      <p>Each eye has six muscles that control its movements: the <!--del_lnk--> lateral rectus, the <!--del_lnk--> medial rectus, the <!--del_lnk--> inferior rectus, the <!--del_lnk--> superior rectus, the <!--del_lnk--> inferior oblique, and the <!--del_lnk--> superior oblique. When the muscles exert different tensions, a torque is exerted on the globe that causes it to turn. This is an almost pure rotation, with only about one millimeter of translation. Thus, the eye can be considered as undergoing rotations about a single point in the centre of the eye.<p><a id="Rapid_eye_movement" name="Rapid_eye_movement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rapid eye movement</span></h3>

      <p>Rapid eye movement typically refers to the stage during <a href="../../wp/s/Sleep.htm" title="Sleep">sleep</a> during which the most vivid dreams occur.

      <p>Even when looking intently at a single spot, the eyes drift around. This ensures that individual photosensitive cells are continually stimulated in different degrees. Without changing input, these cells would otherwise stop generating output. Microsaccades move the eye no more than a total of 0.2&deg; in adult humans.<p><a id="Vestibulo-ocular_reflex" name="Vestibulo-ocular_reflex"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vestibulo-ocular reflex</span></h3>

      <p>The eyes can also follow a moving object around. This is less accurate than the vestibulo-ocular reflex as it requires the brain to process incoming visual information and supply <!--del_lnk--> feedback. Following an object moving at constant speed is relatively easy, though the eyes will often make saccadic jerks to keep up. The smooth pursuit movement can move the eye at up to 100&deg;/s in adult humans.<p>While still, the eye can measure relative speed with high accuracy, however under movement relative speed is highly distorted. Take for example, when watching a plane while standing -- the plane has normal visual speed. However, if an observer watches the plane while moving in the same direction as the plane&#39;s movement, the plane will appear as if were standing still or moving very slowly.<p>When an observer views an object in motion moving away or towards himself, there is no eye movement occurring as in the examples above, however the ability to discern speed and speed difference is still present; although not as severe. The intensity of light (e.g. night vs. day) plays a major role in determining speed and speed difference. For example, no human can with reasonable accuracy, visually determine the speed of an approaching train in the evening as they could during the day. Similarly, while moving, the ability is further diminished unless there is another point of reference for determining speed; however the inaccuracy of speed or speed difference will always be present.<p><a id="Optokinetic_reflex" name="Optokinetic_reflex"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Optokinetic reflex</span></h3>
      <p>The optokinetic reflex is a combination of a saccade and smooth pursuit movement. When, for example, looking out of the window in a moving train, the eyes can focus on a &#39;moving&#39; tree for a short moment (through smooth pursuit), until the tree moves out of the field of vision. At this point, the optokinetic reflex kicks in, and moves the eye back to the point where it first saw the tree (through a saccade).<p><a id="Vergence_movement" name="Vergence_movement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vergence movement</span></h3>

      <p>When a creature with binocular vision looks at an object, the eyes must rotate around a vertical axis so that the projection of the image is in the centre of the retina in both eyes.

      <p>There are many diseases, disorders, and age-related changes that may affect the eyes and surrounding structures.<p>As the eye ages certain changes occur that can be attributed solely to the aging process. Most of these anatomic and physiologic processes follow a gradual decline. With aging, the quality of vision worsens due to reasons independent of aging eye diseases. While there are many changes of significance in the nondiseased eye, the most functionally important changes seem to be a reduction in pupil size and the loss of accommodation or focusing capability (<!--del_lnk--> presbyopia). The area of the pupil governs the amount of light that can reach the retina. The extent to which the pupil dilates also decreases with age. Because of the smaller pupil size, older eyes receive much less light at the retina. In comparison to younger people, it is as though older persons wear medium-density sunglasses in bright light and extremely dark glasses in dim light. Therefore, for any detailed visually guided tasks on which performance varies with illumination, older persons require extra lighting. <p>With aging a prominent white ring develops in the periphery of the cornea- called arcus senilis. Aging causes laxity and downward shift of eyelid tissues and atrophy of the orbital fat. These changes contribute to the etiology of several eyelid disorders such as <!--del_lnk--> ectropion, <!--del_lnk--> entropion, <!--del_lnk--> dermatochalasis, and <!--del_lnk--> ptosis. The vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction (<!--del_lnk--> posterior vitreous detachment or PVD) and its opacities &mdash; visible as <!--del_lnk--> floaters &mdash; gradually increase in number.<p>Various <!--del_lnk--> eye care professionals, including <!--del_lnk--> ophthalmologists, <!--del_lnk--> optometrists, and <!--del_lnk--> opticians, are involved in the treatment and management of ocular and vision disorders. A <!--del_lnk--> Snellen chart is one type of <!--del_lnk--> eye chart used to measure <!--del_lnk--> visual acuity. At the conclusion of an <!--del_lnk--> eye examination, an eye doctor may provide the patient with an <!--del_lnk--> eyeglass prescription for <!--del_lnk--> corrective lenses.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye&quot;</div>
