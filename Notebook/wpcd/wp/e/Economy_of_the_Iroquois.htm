      <p>The <b>economy of the Iroquois</b> originally focused on communal production and combined elements of both <!--del_lnk--> horticulture and <!--del_lnk--> hunter-gatherer systems. The <a href="../../wp/t/Tribe.htm" title="Tribe">tribes</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois Confederacy and other Northern <!--del_lnk--> Iroquoian-speaking peoples, including the <!--del_lnk--> Huron, lived in the region including what is now <!--del_lnk--> New York State and the <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Lakes.htm" title="Great Lakes">Great Lakes</a> area. The Iroquois Confederacy was composed of five different tribes &mdash; a sixth was added later &mdash; who had banded together shortly before <!--del_lnk--> European contact. While not Iroquois, the Huron peoples fell into the same linguistic group and shared an economy similar to the Iroquois. The Iroquois peoples were predominantly agricultural, harvesting the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Three Sisters&quot; commonly grown by <!--del_lnk--> Native American groups: <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bean.htm" title="Bean">beans</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> squash. They developed certain cultural customs related to their lifestyle. Among these developments were ideas concerning the nature and management of <a href="../../wp/p/Property.htm" title="Property">property</a>.<p>The Iroquois developed a system of economics very different from the now dominant Western variety. This system was characterized by such components as communal <!--del_lnk--> land ownership, <!--del_lnk--> division of labor by gender, and <!--del_lnk--> trade mostly based on <!--del_lnk--> gift economics.<p>Contact with Europeans in the early <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">1600s</a> had a profound impact on the economy of the Iroquois. At first, they became important trading partners, but the expansion of European settlement upset the balance of the Iroquois economy. By 1800 the Iroquois had been confined to <!--del_lnk--> reservations, and they had to adapt their traditional economic system. In the 20th century, some of the Iroquois groups took advantage of their independent status on the reservation and started <!--del_lnk--> Indian casinos. Other Iroquois have incorporated themselves directly into the outside economies off the reservation.<p>

      <p>The Huron had an essentially <!--del_lnk--> communal system of land ownership. The French Catholic missionary <!--del_lnk--> Gabriel Sagard described the fundamentals. The Huron had &quot;as much land as they need[ed].&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AxtellHuronQuote"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> As a result the Huron could give families their own land and still have a large amount of excess land owned communally. Any Huron was free to clear the land and farm. He maintained possession of the land as long as he continued to actively cultivate and tend the fields. Once he abandoned the land, it reverted to communal ownership, and anyone could take it up for themselves.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AxtellAban"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> While the Huron did seem to have lands designated for the individual, the significance of this possession may be of little relevance; the placement of corn storage vessels in the <!--del_lnk--> longhouses, which contained multiple families in one kinship group, suggests the occupants of a given longhouse held all production in common.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_TriggerHouseCommon"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The Iroquois had a similar communal system of land distribution. The tribe owned all lands but gave out tracts to the different clans for further distribution among households for cultivation. The land would be redistributed among the households every few years, and a clan could request a redistribution of tracts when the Clan Mothers&#39; Council gathered.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesDistribut"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Those clans that abused their allocated land or otherwise did not take care of it would be warned and eventually punished by the Clan Mothers&#39; Council by having the land redistributed to another clan.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_JohanPunishClan"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Land property was really only the concern of the women, since it was the women&#39;s job to cultivate food and not the men&#39;s.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesGendner"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The Clan Mothers&#39; Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans. Food from such lands, called <i>k&#x11B;ndi&#x1D4;&quot;gw&#x1CE;&#39;ge&#39; hodi&#39;y&#x11B;n&#39;tho</i>, would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_JohanCommonFest"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Division_of_labor:_agriculture_and_forestry" name="Division_of_labor:_agriculture_and_forestry"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Division of labor: agriculture and forestry</span></h2>
      <p>The division of labor reflected the <!--del_lnk--> dualistic split into have common in the Iroquois cultural mind. The twin gods Sapling (East) and Flint (West) embodied the dualistic notion of two complementary halves. Dualism was applied to labor with each gender taking a clearly defined role that complemented the work of the other. Women did all work involving the field while men did all work involving the forest including the manufacture of anything involving wood.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_JohanSplit"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois men were responsible for <!--del_lnk--> hunting, <!--del_lnk--> trading, and <!--del_lnk--> fighting, while the women took care of <!--del_lnk--> farming, <!--del_lnk--> food gathering, and <!--del_lnk--> housekeeping. This gendered division of labor was the predominate means of dividing work in Iroquois society.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AxtellDiv"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> At the time of contact with Europeans, Iroquois women produced about 65% of the good and the men 35%.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_JohanPCFood"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The combined production of food was successful to the point where famine and hunger were extremely rare--early Europeans settlers often envied the success of Iroquois food production.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_JohansenFoodPlenty"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The Iroquois system of work matched their system of land ownership. Since the Iroquois owned property together, they worked together as well. The women performed difficult work in large groups, going from field to field helping one another work each others&#39; land. Together they would sow the fields as a &quot;mistress of the field&quot; distributed a set amount of seeds to each of the women.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AxtellMistress"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois women of each agricultural group would select an old but active member of their group to act as their leader for that year and agree to follow her directions. The women performed other work cooperatively as well. The women would cut their own wood, but their leader would oversee the collective carrying of the wood back to the village.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesWood"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The women&#39;s clans performed other work, and according to <!--del_lnk--> Mary Jemison, a white woman assimilated as an Indian, the collective effort averted &quot;every jealously of one having done more or less work than another.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesJemison"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Iroquois men also organized themselves in a cooperative fashion. Of course, the men acted collectively during military actions, as there is little sense in a single individual fighting entirely alone in battle.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesBattle"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The other jobs of men, such as hunting and fishing, also involved cooperative elements similar to women&#39;s cooperation. However, the men differed from the women in that they more often organized as a whole <!--del_lnk--> village rather than as a <!--del_lnk--> clan.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesClan"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The men organized hunting parties where they used extensive cooperation to kill a large amount of game. One first hand account told of a large hunting party that built a large brush fence in a forest forming a <i>V</i>. The hunters burned the forest from the open side of the <i>V</i>, forcing the animals to run towards the point where the village&#39;s hunters waited in an opening. A hundred <!--del_lnk--> deer could be killed at a time under such a plan.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesDeer"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The men also fished in large groups. Extensive fishing expeditions often took place where men in <!--del_lnk--> canoes with <!--del_lnk--> weirs and <!--del_lnk--> nets covered entire streams to reap large amounts of fish, sometimes a thousand in half of a day.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesFishing"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> A hunting or fishing party&#39;s takings were considered common property and would be divided among the party by the leader or taken to the village for a feast.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesFish"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Hunting and fishing were not always cooperative efforts, but the Iroquois generally did better in parties than as individuals.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesHunt"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Trade" name="Trade"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trade</span></h2>
      <p>The cooperative production and communal distribution of goods made internal trade within the Iroquois Confederacy pointless, but external trade with tribes in regions with resources the Iroquois lacked served a purpose.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesRegional"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois traded excess corn and tobacco for the pelts from the tribes to the north and the <!--del_lnk--> wampum from the tribes to the east.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesGoods"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois used <!--del_lnk--> present-giving more often than any other mode of exchange. Present-giving reflected the <!--del_lnk--> reciprocity in Iroquois society. The exchange would begin with one clan giving another tribe or clan a present with the expectation of some sort of needed commodity being given in return. This form of trade ties to the Iroquois culture&#39;s tendency to share property and cooperate in labor. In all cases no explicit agreement is made, but one service is performed for the community or another member of the community&#39;s good with the expectation that the community or another individual would give back.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesRecip"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> External trade offered one of the few opportunities for individual enterprise in Iroquois society. A person who discovered a new trading route had the exclusive right to trade along the same route in the future; however, clans would still collectivize trading routes to gain a monopoly on a certain type of trade.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesRoutes"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The arrival of Europeans created the opportunity for greatly expanded trade. Furs were in demand in Europe, and they could be acquired cheaply from Indians in exchange for manufactured goods the Indians could not make themselves.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_FurReplace"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Trade did not always benefit the Indians. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> took advantage of the gift-giving culture. They showered the Iroquois with European goods, making them dependent on such items as rifles and metal axes. The Iroquois had little choice but to trade for gunpowder after they had discarded their other weapons. The British primarily used these gifts to gain support among the Iroquois for fighting against the French.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_FurBritish"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois also traded for alcohol, a substance they did not have before the arrival of Europeans. Eventually, this would have a very negative impact on Iroquois society. The problem became so bad by 1753 that Scarrooyady, an Iroquois Chief, had to petition the <!--del_lnk--> Governor of Pennsylvania to intervene in trade: &quot;Your Traders now bring scarce anything but Rum and Flour; they bring little powder and lead, or other valuable goods . . . and get all the skins that should go to pay the debts we have contracted for goods bought of the Fair Traders; by this means we not only ruin ourselves but them too. These wicked Whiskey Sellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them sell their very clothes from their backs. In short, if this practice be continued, we must be inevitably ruined.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AlcoholQ"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Impact_on_Iroquois_culture_and_society" name="Impact_on_Iroquois_culture_and_society"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact on Iroquois culture and society</span></h2>
      <p>The structure of the Iroquois economy created a unique property and <!--del_lnk--> work ethic. The threat of theft was almost nonexistent, since little was held by the individual except basic tools and implements that were so prevalent they had little value. The only goods worth stealing would have been <!--del_lnk--> wampum.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SpeckWampum"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> While a theft-free society can be respected by all, communal systems such as that of the Iroquois are often criticized for not providing any incentive to work. In order for the Iroquois to succeed without an individual incentive, they had to develop a communal work ethic. Virtue became synonymous with productivity. The idealized Iroquois man was a good warrior and productive hunter while the perfect woman excelled in agriculture and housekeeping.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_StitesIdeal"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> By emphasizing an individual&#39;s usefulness to society, the Iroquois created a mindset that encouraged their members to contribute even though they received similar benefits no matter how hard they worked.<p>As a result of their communal system, some would expect the Iroquois to have a culture of dependence without individuality. The Iroquois, however, had a strong tradition of autonomous responsibility. Iroquois men were taught to be self-disciplined, self-reliant, and responsible as well as stoic.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WallaceIdeal"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois attempted to eliminate any feelings of dependency during childhood and foster a desire for responsibility. At the same time, the child would have to participate in a communal culture, so children were taught to think as individuals but work for the community.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_WallaceChild"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Modern_economy" name="Modern_economy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Modern economy</span></h2>
      <p>Many Iroquois have been fully integrated into the surrounding Western economy of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. For others their economic involvement is more isolated in the <!--del_lnk--> reservation. Whether directly involved in the outside economy or not, most of the Iroquois economy is now greatly influenced by national and world economies. The Iroquois have been involved in the steel construction industry for over a hundred years, with many men from the <!--del_lnk--> Mohawk<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MohawkSteel"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> nations working on such high-steel projects as the <!--del_lnk--> Empire State Building and <!--del_lnk--> World Trade Centre.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NPRBuild"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Inside the reservation the economic situation has often been bleak. For instance, the U.S. side of the Mohawk reservation has recently had <!--del_lnk--> unemployment as high as 46 percent.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_MohawkUnemployment"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Many reservations have successful businesses, however. The Seneca reservation contains the <!--del_lnk--> City of Salamanca, <!--del_lnk--> New York, a centre of the hardwoods industry<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SalumWood"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> with a Native American population of 13 percent. The Seneca make use of their independent reservation status to sell gasoline and cigarettes tax free and run high-stakes <!--del_lnk--> bingo operations. The Seneca have also debated opening <!--del_lnk--> Indian casinos.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_SenecaRes"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>The <!--del_lnk--> Oneida have already set up casinos on their reservations in New York and <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin. The Oneida are one of the largest employers in northeastern Wisconsin with over 3,000 employees, including 975 people in tribal government. The Tribe manages over 16 million dollars in federal and private grant monies and a wide range of programs, including those authorized by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_EPAOneida"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Oneida business ventures have brought millions of dollars into the community and improved the <!--del_lnk--> standard of living.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_OneidaBiz"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p><a id="Land_after_the_Europeans_arrived" name="Land_after_the_Europeans_arrived"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Land after the Europeans arrived</span></h3>
      <p>The Iroquois system of land management had to change with the coming of the Europeans and the forced isolation to <!--del_lnk--> reservations. The Iroquois had a system of collectively owned land free to be used as needed by their members. While this system was not wholly collective as land was distributed to individual family groups, the Iroquois lacked the Western conception of property as a <!--del_lnk--> commodity.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_Noon"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> After the Europeans arrived and placed the Iroquois on reservations, the natives had to adjust their property system to a more Western model. Despite the influence of Western culture, the Iroquois have maintained a unique view of property over the years. Modern-day Iroquois Doug George-Kanentiio sums up his perception of the Iroquois property view: The Iroquois have &quot;no absolute right to claim territory for purely monetary purposes. Our Creator gave us our aboriginal lands in trust with very specific rules regarding its uses. We are caretakers of our Mother Earth, not lords of the land. Our claims are valid only so far as we dwell in peace and harmony upon her.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_KanentiooEarthQ"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span><p>Similar sentiments were expressed in a statement by the Iroquois Council of Chiefs (or Haudenosaunee) in 1981. The Council distinguished the &quot;Western European concepts of land ownership&quot; from the Iroquois view that &quot;the earth is sacred&quot; and &quot;was created for all to use forever&mdash;not to be exploited merely for this present generation.&quot; Land is not just a commodity and &quot;In no event is land for sale.&quot; The statement goes on, &quot;Under Haudenosaunee law, Gayanerkowa, the land is held by the women of each clan. It is principally the women who are responsible for the land, who farm it, and who care for it for the future generations. When the Confederacy was formed, the separate nations formed one union. The territory of each nation became Confederacy land even though each nation continued to have a special interest in its historic territory.&quot;<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_CouncilQ"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Council&#39;s statement reflects the persistence of a unique view of property among the Iroquois.<p>The system of the <!--del_lnk--> Grand River Iroquois (two Iroquois reservations in Canada) integrated the traditional Iroquois property structure with the new way of life after being confined to a reservation. The reservation was established under two deeds in the eighteenth century. These deeds gave corporate ownership of the reservation lands to the Six Nations of the Iroquois.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonDeed"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> Individuals would then take a perpetual lease on a piece of land from the Confederacy.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonLease"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois idea that land came into one&#39;s possession if cared for and reverted to public control if left alone persisted in reservation property law. In one property dispute case, the Iroquois Council sided with the claimant who had made improvements and cultivated the land over the one who had left it alone.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonCouncil"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The natural resources on the land belonged to the tribe as a whole and not to those who possessed the particular parcel.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonResource"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The Iroquois leased the right to extract stone from the lands in one instance and fixed royalties on all the production.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonExtract"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> After natural gas had been discovered on the reservation, the Six Nations took direct ownership of the natural gas wells and paid those who had wells on their land compensation only for damages done by gas extraction.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_NoonGas"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> This setup closely resembled the precontact land distribution system where the tribes actually owned the land and distributed it for use but not unconditional ownership. Another instance of traditional Iroquois property views impacting modern-day Indian life involves the purchase of land in New York State by the <!--del_lnk--> Seneca-<!--del_lnk--> Cayuga tribe, perhaps for a <!--del_lnk--> casino. The casino would be an additional collectively owned revenue maker. The Seneca-Cayuga already own a bingo hall, a gas station, and a cigarette factory.<span class="reference plainlinksneverexpand" id="ref_AdamsFact"><sup><!--del_lnk--> </sup></span> The later-day organization of reservation property directly reflects the influence of the precontact view of land ownership.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Iroquois&quot;</div>
