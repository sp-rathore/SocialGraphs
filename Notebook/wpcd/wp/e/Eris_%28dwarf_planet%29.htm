Under a <!--del_lnk--> new definition approved on <!--del_lnk--> August 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Eris was designated a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; along with Pluto and <a href="../../wp/c/Ceres_%2528dwarf_planet%2529.htm" title="Ceres (dwarf planet)">Ceres</a>.

      <p>Eris was discovered by the team of <!--del_lnk--> Mike Brown, <!--del_lnk--> Chad Trujillo, and <!--del_lnk--> David Rabinowitz on <!--del_lnk--> January 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, from images taken on <!--del_lnk--> October 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2003. The discovery was announced on <!--del_lnk--> July 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, the same day as two other large <!--del_lnk--> TNOs, <!--del_lnk--> (136108) 2003 EL<sub>61</sub> and <!--del_lnk--> (136472) 2005 FY<sub>9</sub>. The search team has been systematically scanning for large outer <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> bodies for several years, and had previously been involved in the discovery of several other very large TNOs, including <!--del_lnk--> 50000 Quaoar, <!--del_lnk--> 90482 Orcus, and <a href="../../wp/9/90377_Sedna.htm" title="90377 Sedna">90377 Sedna</a>.<p>Routine observations were taken by the team on <!--del_lnk--> October 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2003, using the 48-<!--del_lnk--> inch (122&nbsp;cm) <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Oschin <!--del_lnk--> reflecting telescope at <!--del_lnk--> Mount Palomar Observatory, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, but the object captured on the images was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: the team&#39;s automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5 <!--del_lnk--> arcseconds per hour to reduce the number of <!--del_lnk--> false positives returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75 arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris&#39; slow motion against the background <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a>.<p>Follow-up observations were then carried out to make a preliminary determination of its <!--del_lnk--> orbit, which allowed its distance and size to be estimated. The team had planned to delay announcing their discovery until further observations had been made which would have allowed more accurate determinations of the body&#39;s size and mass, but were forced to bring forward the announcement when the discovery of another object they had been tracking (<!--del_lnk--> 2003 EL<sub>61</sub>) was announced by another group in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>.<p>Yet more observations released in October 2005 revealed that the object had a moon, <!--del_lnk--> Dysnomia, nicknamed &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Gabrielle&quot; at the time. Scientists plan to use this information to determine the mass of Eris.<br clear="left" />

      <p>Eris is classified as a <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planet and a <a href="../../wp/s/Scattered_disc.htm" title="Scattered disc">scattered disk object</a> (SDO).The latter is a category of the <!--del_lnk--> TNOs that are believed to have been &quot;scattered&quot; from the <a href="../../wp/k/Kuiper_belt.htm" title="Kuiper belt">Kuiper belt</a> into more distant and unusual <!--del_lnk--> orbits following gravitational interactions with <!--del_lnk--> Neptune as the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> was forming. Although its high orbital inclination is unusual among the known SDOs, theoretical models suggest that objects that were originally near the inner edge of the Kuiper belt are scattered into orbits with higher inclinations than objects from the outer belt. Inner-belt objects are expected to be generally more massive than outer-belt objects, and so astronomers expect to discover more large objects like Eris in high-inclination orbits.<p>As Eris is larger than <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, it was initially described as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> tenth planet&quot; by <!--del_lnk--> NASA and in media reports of its discovery. In response to the uncertainty over its status, and because of continuing debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> IAU delegated a group of astronomers to develop a new definition of the term planet. This definition was clarified under the new IAU <a href="../../wp/d/Definition_of_planet.htm" title="Definition of planet">definition of a planet</a>, adopted on <!--del_lnk--> 24 August <!--del_lnk--> 2006. Eris has been termed a <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planet by the IAU. It may also be under consideration as a member of &quot;a new class of trans-Neptunian objects&quot; yet to be defined by that body. It is not, however, considered to be a planet.<p><a id="Name" name="Name"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Name</span></h2>

      <p>136199 Eris is named after the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Eris (<!--del_lnk--> Greek &#x1F1C;&rho;&iota;&sigmaf;), a personification of strife and discord. This name was assigned on <!--del_lnk--> September 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 following an unusually long period in which it was best known by the <!--del_lnk--> provisional designation <b>2003 UB<sub>313</sub></b>, which was granted automatically by the <!--del_lnk--> IAU under their naming protocols for <!--del_lnk--> minor planets.<p><a id="Nicknames" name="Nicknames"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Nicknames</span></h3>
      <p>Before the name Eris was granted, two nicknames were used for the planet by the popular media.<ul>
       <li>&quot;Xena&quot; was an informal name used by the discovery team. It was inspired by eponymous heroine of the television series <i><!--del_lnk--> Xena: Warrior Princess</i>. The discovery team had reportedly saved the nickname &#39;Xena&#39; for the first body they discovered that was larger than <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>. Their only stated reason was that &quot;We have always wanted to name something <!--del_lnk--> Xena&quot; (apparently implying that the name was chosen without any reference to <!--del_lnk--> Planet X).<li>The nickname &quot;Lila&quot; has also been used, but this is a misunderstanding of <i>planetlila</i>, part of the <!--del_lnk--> URL of the <!--del_lnk--> discovery web page; the web page&#39;s name was derived from the name of <!--del_lnk--> Mike Brown&#39;s then-newborn daughter, Lilah.</ul>
      <p><a id="Choosing_an_official_name" name="Choosing_an_official_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Choosing an official name</span></h3>
      <p>The delay in assigning a name was due to uncertainty over whether the object was classified as a <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planet</a> or a minor planet; different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of object.  The decision on a name had to wait until after the <!--del_lnk--> August 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 IAU ruling <!--del_lnk--> defining the object as a <!--del_lnk--> dwarf planet.<p>Brown had previously speculated that <!--del_lnk--> Persephone would be a good name for the object. However, this was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an <a href="../../wp/a/Asteroid.htm" title="Asteroid">asteroid</a> with that name (<!--del_lnk--> 399 Persephone). Since IAU regulations demand a name from a <!--del_lnk--> creation mythology for objects with orbital stability beyond <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a>&#39;s orbit, the team had also been considering such possibilities.<p>The discovery team proposed &#39;Eris&#39; on <!--del_lnk--> 6 September <!--del_lnk--> 2006, and on <!--del_lnk--> 13 September <!--del_lnk--> 2006, it was accepted as the official name by the IAU. <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk-->  The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by the debate over the object&#39;s nature.<p><a id="Orbit" name="Orbit"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Orbit</span></h2>

Approximately forty known <!--del_lnk--> TNOs (most notably <!--del_lnk--> 2000 OO<sub>67</sub> and <a href="../../wp/9/90377_Sedna.htm" title="90377 Sedna">Sedna</a>), while currently closer to the Sun than Eris, have greater <i>average</i> orbital distances.<p>Its orbit is highly <!--del_lnk--> eccentric, and brings it to within 37.8 AU of the Sun (a typical perihelion for <!--del_lnk--> scattered objects), still safe from direct interaction with <a href="../../wp/n/Neptune.htm" title="Neptune">Neptune</a> (at ~30 AU). For comparison, <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, like other <!--del_lnk--> plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by <!--del_lnk--> orbital resonance, it can cross Neptune&rsquo;s orbit. Unlike the <!--del_lnk--> terrestrial planets and <a href="../../wp/g/Gas_giant.htm" title="Gas giant">gas giants</a>, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same <!--del_lnk--> plane as the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a>&#39;s, Eris&#39; orbit is very <!--del_lnk--> inclined &mdash; it is tilted at an angle of about 44 <!--del_lnk--> degrees to the <!--del_lnk--> ecliptic.<p>The object currently has an <!--del_lnk--> apparent magnitude of about 19, making it bright enough to be detectable in some amateur <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescopes</a>. A telescope with an 8&quot; lens or mirror and a <!--del_lnk--> CCD can detect Eris under favorable conditions. The reason it had not been noticed until now is because of its steep orbital inclination: most searches for large outer solar system objects concentrate on the ecliptic plane, in which most solar system material is found.<p>Eris is now in the constellation <!--del_lnk--> Cetus. It was in <!--del_lnk--> Sculptor until <!--del_lnk--> 1929, and will enter <!--del_lnk--> Pisces in <!--del_lnk--> 2036. Because the orbit of Eris is highly inclined, it only passes through a few constellations of the traditional <!--del_lnk--> Zodiac.<p><a id="Size" name="Size"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Size</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> diameter of Eris has been measured to be 2400&nbsp;km using images from the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Space_Telescope.htm" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. The brightness of an object depends both on its size and the amount of light it reflects (its <!--del_lnk--> albedo). At a distance of 67 AU, an object with a radius of 3000&nbsp;km would have an <!--del_lnk--> angular size of 40 <!--del_lnk--> milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with HST; although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of Hubble&#39;s capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as <!--del_lnk--> deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>This revised estimate of the diameter makes Eris only 4% larger than <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a> According to Hubble, Eris&#39; diameter measures 2,397 km (1,490 mi), give or take 100 km (60 mi). Pluto is about 2,306 km (1,433 mi) across. It also indicates that the albedo is 0.86, higher than any other large body in the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> other than <a href="../../wp/e/Enceladus_%2528moon%2529.htm" title="Enceladus (moon)">Enceladus</a>. It is speculated that the high albedo is due to the surface ices being replenished due to temperature fluctuations as Eris&#39; eccentric orbit takes it closer and farther from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>.<p><a id="Thermal_measurement" name="Thermal_measurement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Thermal measurement</span></h3>
      <p>Previous observations of the thermal emission of Eris at a wavelength of 1.2 mm, where the object&#39;s brightness depends only on temperature and surface area, indicated a diameter of 3000<sup>+270</sup><sub>-100</sub> km, about a third larger than Pluto. If the object rotates quickly, resulting in a more even heat distribution and a temperature of 23 to 24 <!--del_lnk--> kelvins, a likely diameter would be in the higher portion of the range (best fit 3090 km); if it rotates slowly, the visible surface would be warmer (about 27 K) and a likely diameter would be in the smaller end of the range (best fit 2860 km). The 2860 km figure implies a Pluto-like albedo of 60%, consistent with its Pluto-like spectral signature.<p><a id="Possible_explanation_of_the_inconsistent_results" name="Possible_explanation_of_the_inconsistent_results"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Possible explanation of the inconsistent results</span></h3>
      <p>The apparent inconsistence of the HST PSF results (2400 &plusmn; 100 km) with the above <!--del_lnk--> IRAM results (3000 &plusmn; 370 km) will be certainly studied in more length. <!--del_lnk--> Brown explains it by a slightly lower <!--del_lnk--> absolute magnitude than the one assumed by Bertoldi (&minus;1.12 &plusmn; 0.01 versus &minus;1.16 &plusmn; 0.1, resulting by itself in almost 100 km difference in diameter). Assuming further the highest diameter (2500 km) and pole-on position of the object the difference between the results would appear consistent with 1.1-<!--del_lnk--> &sigma; error margin.<p>Another possible explanation for the IRAM results is offered by the <!--del_lnk--> Max-Planck-Institut f&uuml;r Radioastronomie. The ratio between the <!--del_lnk--> bolometric <!--del_lnk--> albedo (representing the total reflected energy and used in the thermal method) and the geometric albedo (representing the reflection in some visual wavelength and used to calculate the diameter from HST pictures) is not known with high precision and depends on many factors. By itself, this uncertainty could bridge the gap between the two measures.<p><a id="Surface" name="Surface"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Surface</span></h2>

      <p>The discovery team followed up their initial identification of Eris with <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic observations made at the 8 m <!--del_lnk--> Gemini North Telescope in <!--del_lnk--> Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x2BB;</font>i on <!--del_lnk--> January 25, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. <!--del_lnk--> Infrared light from the object revealed the presence of <!--del_lnk--> methane ice, indicating that the surface of Eris is rather similar to <a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, which was the only <!--del_lnk--> TNO already known to show the presence of methane. Neptune&#39;s moon <!--del_lnk--> Triton is probably related to <!--del_lnk--> Kuiper Belt objects, and also has methane on its surface.<p>Unlike the somewhat reddish Pluto and Triton, however, Eris appears almost grey. Pluto&#39;s reddish colour is believed to be due to deposits of <!--del_lnk--> tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough away from the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> that methane can <!--del_lnk--> condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.<p>Methane is very <!--del_lnk--> volatile and its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a> where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that it has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its <!--del_lnk--> atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another recently discovered TNO, <!--del_lnk--> 2003 EL<sub>61</sub>, which reveal the presence of <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> ice but not methane.<p><a id="Atmosphere" name="Atmosphere"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Atmosphere</span></h2>
      <p>Even though Eris can be up to three times further from the Sun than Pluto, it approaches close enough that some of the various ices that exist on the surface might become warm enough to <!--del_lnk--> sublimate and form a fine atmosphere; however, it is unclear whether this actually happens on Eris.<p>Due to its orbit, surface temperatures vary between about &minus;232 and &minus;248 degrees Celsius.<p><a id="Moon" name="Moon"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Moon</span></h2>

      <p>During 2005, the <!--del_lnk--> adaptive optics team at the <!--del_lnk--> Keck telescopes in <!--del_lnk--> Hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest <!--del_lnk--> TNOs (<a href="../../wp/p/Pluto.htm" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>, 2005 FY<sub>9</sub>, 2003 EL<sub>61</sub>, and Eris), using the newly commissioned <!--del_lnk--> laser guide star adaptive optics system. Observations taken on <!--del_lnk--> September 10 revealed a <!--del_lnk--> moon in orbit around Eris, which received its name (<!--del_lnk--> Dysnomia) at the same time as its primary. In keeping with the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Xena&quot; nickname already in use for Eris, the moon was previously nicknamed <i>Gabrielle</i> by its discoverers, after the <!--del_lnk--> television warrior princess&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> sidekick. The name Dysnomia is taken from a <!--del_lnk--> mythological demon of lawlessness who was Eris&#39; daughter. This is also an acknowledgement of the former nicknames, as the character of Xena was played by <!--del_lnk--> Lucy Lawless<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_%28dwarf_planet%29&quot;</div>
