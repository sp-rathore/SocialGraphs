      <p><b>Eskimos</b>, or <b>Esquimaux</b>, are terms used to refer to <!--del_lnk--> people who inhabit the <!--del_lnk--> circumpolar region, excluding <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavia and most of <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, but including the easternmost portions of <!--del_lnk--> Siberia. There are two main groups of Eskimos: the <!--del_lnk--> Inuit in northern <!--del_lnk--> Alaska, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Yupik of western Alaska and the Russian Far East.<p>The Eskimos are related to the <!--del_lnk--> Aleuts and the <!--del_lnk--> Alutiiq from the <!--del_lnk--> Aleutian Islands in Alaska as well as the Sug&#39;piak from the <!--del_lnk--> Kodiak Islands and as far as the <!--del_lnk--> Prince William Sound in southcentral Alaska.<p>Eastern Eskimo people (Inuit) speak <!--del_lnk--> Inuktitut, and western Alaskan Eskimo communities (Yup&#39;ik) speak <!--del_lnk--> Yup&#39;ik. There is a <!--del_lnk--> dialect continuum between the two, and the westernmost <!--del_lnk--> dialects of Inuktitut could be viewed as forms of Yup&#39;ik. <!--del_lnk--> Kinship culture also differs between east and west, as eastern Inuit lived with <!--del_lnk--> cousins of both parents, but western Inuit lived in <!--del_lnk--> paternal kinship groups. The <!--del_lnk--> Sireniki language is sometimes regarded as a third branch of Eskimo, but other sources regard it as a group belonging to the Yupik branch.<p>

      <p>The term Eskimo can include the Alutiiq, <!--del_lnk--> Inupiat, Sug&#39;piak, and Yup&#39;ik Eskimo populations of Alaska, and the Yupik population of Eastern Russia. The speakers of the Yupik languages self-identify as Eskimo <!--del_lnk--> , but the majority of the Native population in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland prefer to be called &quot;Inuit&quot;, or to a smaller extent <!--del_lnk--> Inuvialuit, and most find the term Eskimo highly offensive.<p>The term &quot;Eskimos&quot; is now used by some to refer to rugged and brave individuals who are able to deal with <!--del_lnk--> cold and ice even if they are not natives of the far North. For example, the Cambridge Eskimos, established in the <!--del_lnk--> 1930s and still active, are an <a href="../../wp/i/Ice_hockey.htm" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> team based at the <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Cambridge.htm" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">Britain</a>, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Abitibi Eskimos hockey team, based out of <!--del_lnk--> Iroquois Falls, Ontario, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. In somewhat the same vein, the <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Football League&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Edmonton team is called the <!--del_lnk--> Eskimos<p><a id="Origin_of_the_term_Eskimo" name="Origin_of_the_term_Eskimo"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of the term Eskimo</span></h2>
      <p>
       <br />
      <p>Some <!--del_lnk--> Algonquian languages call Eskimos by names that mean &quot;eaters of raw meat&quot; or something that sounds similar. The <!--del_lnk--> Plains Ojibwe, for example, use the word <i>&ecirc;&scaron;kipot</i> (&quot;one who eats raw,&quot; from <i>a&scaron;k-</i>, &quot;raw,&quot; and <i>-po-</i>, &quot;to eat&quot;) to refer to Eskimos. It is entirely possible that the Ojibwe have adopted words resembling &quot;Eskimo&quot; by borrowing them from French, and the French word merely <i>sounds</i> like Ojibwe words that can be interpreted as &quot;eaters of raw meat&quot;.<p>But in the period of the earliest attested French use of the word, the Plains Ojibwe were not in contact with Europeans, nor did they have very much direct contact with the Inuit in pre-colonial times.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Innu-aimun (Montagnais) language, a dialect of <!--del_lnk--> Cree which was known to French traders at the time of the earliest attestation of <i>esquimaux</i>, does not have vocabulary fitting this etymological analysis. Furthermore, since Cree people also traditionally consumed raw meat, a pejorative significance based on this etymology seems unlikely. A variety of competing etymologies have been proposed over the years, but the most likely source is the Montagnais word meaning &quot;snowshoe-netter&quot;. Since Montagnais speakers refer to the neighbouring <!--del_lnk--> Mi&#39;kmaq people using words that sound very much like <i>eskimo</i>, many researchers have concluded that this is the more likely origin of the word. <p>The anthropologist <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Huxley in <i>On the Methods and Results of Ethnology</i> (1865) defined the &quot;Esquimaux race&quot; to be the indigenous peoples in the Arctic region of northern Canada and Alaska. He described them to &quot;certainly present a new stock&quot; (different from the other indigenous peoples of North America). He described them to have straight black hair, dull skin complexion, short and squat, with high cheek bones and long skulls.<p><a id="Inuit" name="Inuit"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Inuit</span></h2>

      <p>The &#39;Yupik are <!--del_lnk--> indigenous or aboriginal peoples who live along the coast of western <!--del_lnk--> Alaska, especially on the <!--del_lnk--> Yukon-<!--del_lnk--> Kuskokwim delta and along the Kuskokwim River (Central Alaskan Yupik), in southern Alaska (the <!--del_lnk--> Alutiiq) and in the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Far East and <!--del_lnk--> St. Lawrence Island in western Alaska (the <!--del_lnk--> Siberian Yupik).<p><a id="Alutiiq" name="Alutiiq"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Alutiiq</span></h3>

      <p>The Alutiiq also called <i>Pacific Yupik</i> or <i>Sugpiaq</i>, are a southern, coastal branch of <!--del_lnk--> Alaskan <!--del_lnk--> Yupik. They are not to be confused with the <!--del_lnk--> Aleuts, who live further to the southwest, including along the <!--del_lnk--> Aleutian Islands. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as <!--del_lnk--> salmon, <!--del_lnk--> halibut, and <a href="../../wp/w/Whale.htm" title="Whale">whale</a>, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals. Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, where they work in all aspects of the modern economy, while also maintaining the cultural value of subsistence. The Alutiiq language is relatively close to that spoken by the <!--del_lnk--> Yupik in the <!--del_lnk--> Bethel, Alaska area, but is considered a distinct language with two major dialects. The Koniag Dialect is spoken on the <!--del_lnk--> Alaska Peninsula and on <!--del_lnk--> Kodiak Island. The Chugach Dialect is spoken on the <!--del_lnk--> Kenai Peninsula and in <!--del_lnk--> Prince William Sound. Residents of Nanwalek, located on southern part of the Kenai Peninsula near Seldovia, speak what they call Sugpiaq and are able to understand those who speak Yupik in Bethel. With a population of approximately 3,000, and the number of speakers in the mere hundreds, Alutiiq communities are currently in the process of revitalizing their language.<p><a id="Siberian_Yupik_.28Yuit.29" name="Siberian_Yupik_.28Yuit.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Siberian Yupik (Yuit)</span></h3>

      <p>Traditionally, the Eskimo languages family was divided into Inuit and Yup&#39;ik (or Yup&#39;ik-Yuit). However, recent research suggests that Yup&#39;ik by itself is not a valid node, or, equivalently, that the Inuit <!--del_lnk--> dialect continuum is but one of several languages of the Yup&#39;ik group. However, although it may be technically correct to replace the term <i>Eskimo</i> with <i>Yup&#39;ik</i> in this classification, this would not be acceptable to most Inuit. Also, the Alaskan-Siberian dichotomy appears to have been geographical rather than linguistic.<p>An overview of the <b>Eskimo-Aleut</b> languages family is given below:<dl>
