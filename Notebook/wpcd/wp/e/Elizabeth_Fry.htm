      <p><b>Elizabeth Fry</b> (n&eacute;e Gurney; <!--del_lnk--> 21 May <!--del_lnk--> 1780 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 12 October <!--del_lnk--> 1845) was an <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> <!--del_lnk--> prison reformer, <!--del_lnk--> social reformer and <!--del_lnk--> philanthropist.<p>Fry was the driving force in legislation to make the treatment of prisoners more humane, and she was supported in her efforts by a reigning monarch.

      <p><a id="Birth_and_family_background" name="Birth_and_family_background"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Birth and family background</span></h2>
      <p>Elizabeth Gurney was born in Gurney Court, off Magdalen Street, <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> to a <a href="../../wp/r/Religious_Society_of_Friends.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Quaker</a> family. Her family home as a child was Earlham Hall, <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, which is now part of the <!--del_lnk--> University of East Anglia. Her father, Joseph Gurney, was a partner in <!--del_lnk--> Gurney&#39;s bank. Her mother, Catherine, was a part of the Barclay family, who were among the founders of <!--del_lnk--> Barclays Bank. Elizabeth&#39;s mother died when she was only twelve years old. As one of the oldest girls in the family, she was partly responsible for the care and training of the younger children, including her brother <!--del_lnk--> Joseph John Gurney.<p><a id="Awakening_of_social_concern" name="Awakening_of_social_concern"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Awakening of social concern</span></h2>
      <p>At eighteen years old, the young Elizabeth Gurney was deeply moved by the preaching of <!--del_lnk--> William Savery, an American Quaker. Motivated by his words, she took an interest in the <!--del_lnk--> poor, the <!--del_lnk--> sick, and the <!--del_lnk--> prisoners. She collected old clothes for the poor, visited those who were sick in her neighbourhood, and started a <!--del_lnk--> Sunday school in the summer house to teach children to read. She met Joseph Fry (1777 &ndash;1861), a banker and also a Quaker, when she was twenty years old. They married on <!--del_lnk--> 19 August <!--del_lnk--> 1800 at the Norwich Goat Lane Friends Meeting House and moved to St. Mildred&#39;s Court in the <!--del_lnk--> City of London. They had eleven children in all (Hatton, 2005, 13), born between 1801 and 1822, including <!--del_lnk--> Katherine Fry (1801-1886), who wrote a <i>History of the Parishes of East and West Ham</i> (1888). Elizabeth Fry was recorded as a Minister of the <a href="../../wp/r/Religious_Society_of_Friends.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a> in 1811. Joseph and Elizabeth Fry lived in Plashet House in <!--del_lnk--> East Ham between 1809 and 1829, moving then to Upton Lane in <!--del_lnk--> Forest Gate<p><a id="Fry.27s_prison_work" name="Fry.27s_prison_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fry&#39;s prison work</span></h2>

      <p>Prompted by a family friend, <!--del_lnk--> Stephen Grellet, Fry visited <!--del_lnk--> Newgate prison. The conditions she saw there horrified her. The women&#39;s section was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. They slept on the floor and did their own cooking and washing in the small cells in which they slept.<p>She returned the following day with food and clothes for some of the prisoners. She was unable to further her work for nearly 4 years because of difficulties within the Fry family, including financial difficulties in the Fry bank. Fry returned in 1816 and was eventually able to found a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their parents. She began a system of supervision and required the women to sew and to read the Bible. In <!--del_lnk--> 1817 she helped found the <b>Association for the Improvement of the Female Prisoners</b> in Newgate.<p><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Fowell Buxton, Fry&#39;s brother-in-law, was elected to Parliament for <a href="../../wp/w/Weymouth.htm" title="Weymouth">Weymouth</a> and began to promote her work among his fellow MPs. In <!--del_lnk--> 1818 Fry gave evidence to a <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> committee on the conditions prevalent in British prisons, becoming the first woman to present evidence in Parliament.<p>Fry and her brother <!--del_lnk--> Joseph John Gurney took up the cause of abolishing <!--del_lnk--> capital punishment. At that time, people in England could be executed for over 200 crimes. Early appeals to the <!--del_lnk--> Home Secretary were all rejected, until <!--del_lnk--> Sir Robert Peel became the Home Secretary, they finally got a receptive audience. They persuaded Peel to introduce a series of prison reforms that included the <!--del_lnk--> Gaols Act 1823. Fry and Gurney went on a tour of the prisons in Great Britain. They published their findings of inhumane conditions in a book entitled <i>Prisons in Scotland and the North of England</i>.<p><a id="Fry.27s_other_humanitarian_work" name="Fry.27s_other_humanitarian_work"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fry&#39;s other humanitarian work</span></h2>
      <p>Fry also helped the <!--del_lnk--> homeless, establishing a &quot;nightly shelter&quot; in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> after seeing the body of a young boy in the winter of <!--del_lnk--> 1819/<!--del_lnk--> 1820. In 1824, during a visit to <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, she instituted the Brighton District Visiting Society. The society arranged for volunteers to visit the homes of the poor and provide help and comfort to them. The plan was successful and was duplicated in other districts and towns across Britain.<p>After her husband went bankrupt in 1828, Fry&#39;s brother became her business manager and benefactor. Thanks to him her work went on and expanded.<p>In 1840 Fry opened a training school for nurses. Her programme inspired <a href="../../wp/f/Florence_Nightingale.htm" title="Florence Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a> who took a team of Fry&#39;s nurses to assist wounded soldiers in the <a href="../../wp/c/Crimean_War.htm" title="Crimean War">Crimean War</a>.<p><a id="Fry.27s_reputation" name="Fry.27s_reputation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fry&#39;s reputation</span></h2>
      <p>Fry became well known in <a href="../../wp/s/Society.htm" title="Society">society</a>. Some people criticized her for having such an influential role as a woman. Others alleged that she was neglecting her duties as a wife and mother in order to conduct her humanitarian work. One admirer was <!--del_lnk--> Queen Victoria, who granted her an audience a few times and contributed money to her cause.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
      <p>Fry died at <a href="../../wp/r/Ramsgate.htm" title="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> on <!--del_lnk--> 13 October <!--del_lnk--> 1845 and her remains were buried in the <a href="../../wp/r/Religious_Society_of_Friends.htm" title="Religious Society of Friends">Friends</a>&#39; burial ground at <!--del_lnk--> Barking. It is reported that over one thousand people stood in silence as her body was buried.<p><a id="Posthumous" name="Posthumous"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Posthumous</span></h2>
      <p>Fry has two plaques at her birthplace Gurney Court, off Magdalen Street, <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a> and one on her childhood home, Earlham Hall, plus there is an Elizabeth Fry Road in Earlham. There is also a plaque on St. Mildred&#39;s Court in the <!--del_lnk--> City of London where she lived when she was first married, which in turn is remembered in St. Mildred&#39;s Road in <!--del_lnk--> Earlham.<p>In 2002 she was depicted on the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of England five <!--del_lnk--> pound note. Fry is also depicted on two panels of the <!--del_lnk--> Quaker Tapestry&mdash;panels E5 and E6. In February 2007 a new plaque was placed in her honour on the Friends Meeting House in Upper Goat Lane, <a href="../../wp/n/Norwich.htm" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies honours her memory by advocating for women who are in the criminal justice system.
