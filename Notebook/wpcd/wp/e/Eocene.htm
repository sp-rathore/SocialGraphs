      <p>The <b>Eocene</b> <!--del_lnk--> epoch (56-34 <!--del_lnk--> Ma) is a major division of the <!--del_lnk--> geologic timescale and the second epoch of the <!--del_lnk--> Palaeogene <!--del_lnk--> period in the <!--del_lnk--> Cenozoic era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the <a href="../../wp/p/Paleocene.htm" title="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> epoch to the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by the emergence of the first modern <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. The end is set at a major <!--del_lnk--> extinction event called <b>Grande Coupure</b> (the &quot;Great Break&quot; in continuity), which may be related to the impact of one or more large <!--del_lnk--> bolides in <!--del_lnk--> Siberia and in what is now <!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake Bay. As with other <!--del_lnk--> geologic periods, the <!--del_lnk--> strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain.<p>The name Eocene comes from the Greek <i>eos</i> (dawn) and <i>ceno</i> (new) and refers to the &quot;dawn&quot; of modern (&#39;new&#39;) mammalian fauna that appeared during the epoch.<table class="toccolours" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

      <p>Marking the start of the Eocene, the planet heated up in one of the most rapid (in geologic terms) and extreme global warming events recorded in geologic history, called the <!--del_lnk--> Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum or Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM or IETM). This was an episode of rapid and intense warming (up to 7&deg;C at high latitudes) that lasted less than 100,000 years <!--del_lnk--> . The Thermal Maximum provoked a sharp extinction event that distinguishes Eocene <!--del_lnk--> fauna from the ecosystems of the <a href="../../wp/p/Paleocene.htm" title="Paleocene">Paleocene</a>.<p>The Eocene global climate was perhaps the most homogeneous of the Cenozoic; the temperature gradient from <!--del_lnk--> equator to <!--del_lnk--> pole was only half that of today&#39;s, and deep <!--del_lnk--> ocean currents were exceptionally warm.<!--del_lnk-->  The polar regions were much warmer than today, perhaps as mild as the modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest; that warm temperate forests extended right to the poles, while rainy tropical climates extended as far north as 45 degrees latitude away from the Equator. The difference was greatest in the temperate latitudes; the climate in the tropics however, was probably similar to today&#39;s.(Stanley, 508)<p><a href="../../wp/c/Climate.htm" title="Climate">Climates</a> remained warm through the rest of the Eocene, although slow global cooling, which eventually led to the <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene <!--del_lnk--> glaciations, started around the end of the epoch as ocean currents around <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> cooled.<p><a id="Eocene_paleogeography" name="Eocene_paleogeography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eocene paleogeography</span></h2>
      <p>During the Eocene, the <a href="../../wp/c/Continent.htm" title="Continent">continents</a> continued to <a href="../../wp/p/Plate_tectonics.htm" title="Plate tectonics">drift</a> toward their present positions.<p>At the beginning of the period, <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> remained connected, and warm <!--del_lnk--> equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 mya, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding <a href="../../wp/a/Antarctica.htm" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> began to freeze, sending cold water and icefloes north, reinforcing the cooling.<p>The northern <!--del_lnk--> supercontinent of <!--del_lnk--> Laurasia began to break up, as <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="../../wp/g/Greenland.htm" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a> drifted apart.<p>In western North America, <!--del_lnk--> mountain building started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts.<p>Europe saw the <!--del_lnk--> Tethys Sea finally vanish, while the uplift of the <!--del_lnk--> Alps isolated its final remnant, the <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean Sea">Mediterranean</a>, and created another shallow sea with island <!--del_lnk--> archipelagos to the north. Though the North <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe, as the faunas of the two regions are very similar.<p><a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> continued its journey away from <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, and began its collision with <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, folding the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalaya">Himalayas</a> into existence.<ul>

      <p>It is hypothesized that the Eocene hothouse world was due to runaway global warming from released <!--del_lnk--> methane clathrates deep in the oceans. The clathrates were buried beneath mud that was disturbed as the oceans warmed. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) has ten to twenty times the greenhouse gas effect of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).<p><a id="Eocene_flora" name="Eocene_flora"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eocene flora</span></h2>
      <p>At the beginning of the Eocene, the high temperatures and warm oceans created a moist, balmy environment, with forests spreading throughout the earth from pole to pole. Apart from the driest deserts, Earth must have been entirely covered in forests.<p>Polar forests were quite extensive. Fossils and even preserved remains of trees such as <!--del_lnk--> swamp cypress and <!--del_lnk--> dawn redwood from the Eocene have been found in Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic. As aforementioned, the preserved remains found in the Canadian Arctic are not fossils, but actual pieces preserved in oxygen-poor water in the swampy forests of the time, and then buried before they had the chance to decompose. Even at that time, Ellesmere Island was only a few degrees in latitude further south than it is today. Fossils of subtropical and even tropical trees and plants from the Eocene have also been found in Greenland and Alaska. <!--del_lnk--> Tropical rainforests grew as far north as the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific Northwest and <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>.<p><!--del_lnk--> Palm trees were growing as far north as <!--del_lnk--> Alaska and northern <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> during the early Eocene, although they became less and less abundant as the climate cooled. <!--del_lnk--> Dawn redwoods were far more extensive as well.<p>Cooling began mid-period, and by the end of the Eocene continental interiors had begun to dry out, with forests thinning out considerably in some areas. The newly-evolved <!--del_lnk--> grasses were still confined to river banks and lake edges, and had not yet expanded into <!--del_lnk--> plains and <!--del_lnk--> savannas.<p>The cooling also brought seasonal changes. <!--del_lnk--> Deciduous trees, better able to cope with large temperature changes, began to overtake <!--del_lnk--> evergreen tropical species. By the end of the period, deciduous forests covered large parts of the northern continents, including North America, Eurasia and the <a href="../../wp/a/Arctic.htm" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>, and rainforests held on only in equatorial <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>.<p>Antarctica, which began the Eocene fringed with a warm temperate to sub-tropical rainforest, became much colder as the period progressed; the heat-loving tropical <!--del_lnk--> flora was wiped out, and by the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/o/Oligocene.htm" title="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> the continent hosted deciduous forests and vast stretches of <!--del_lnk--> tundra.<p><a id="Eocene_fauna" name="Eocene_fauna"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eocene fauna</span></h2>

      <p>The oldest known <a href="../../wp/f/Fossil.htm" title="Fossil">fossils</a> of most of the modern mammal orders appear within a brief period during the early Eocene. At the beginning of the Eocene, several new mammal groups arrived in North America. These modern mammals, like <!--del_lnk--> artiodactyls, <!--del_lnk--> perissodactyls and <!--del_lnk--> primates, had features like long, thin legs, feet and hands capable of grasping, as well as differentiated <!--del_lnk--> teeth adapted for chewing. Dwarf forms reigned. All the members of the new mammal orders were small, under 10&nbsp;kg; based on comparisons of tooth size, Eocene mammals were only 60 per cent of the size of the primitive <a href="../../wp/p/Paleocene.htm" title="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> mammals that had preceded them. They were also smaller than the mammals that followed them. It is assumed that the hot Eocene temperatures favored smaller animals that were better able to manage heat.<p>Both groups of modern <!--del_lnk--> ungulates (hoofed animals) became prevalent due to a major radiation between Europe and North America; along with carnivourous ungulates like <i><!--del_lnk--> Mesonyx</i>. Early forms of many other modern mammalian orders appeared, including <a href="../../wp/b/Bat.htm" title="Bat">bats</a>, <!--del_lnk--> proboscidians, <!--del_lnk--> primates, <!--del_lnk--> rodents and <!--del_lnk--> marsupials. Older primitive forms of mammals declined in variety and importance. Important Eocene land fauna fossil remains have been found in western North America, Europe, <!--del_lnk--> Patagonia, <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <!--del_lnk--> South-East Asia. Marine fauna are best known from <!--del_lnk--> South Asia and the southeast <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>.<p>Reptile fossils are also known from the Eocene, such as the fearsomely enormous crocodile <i><!--del_lnk--> Deinosuchus</i>, which lived as far north as Wyoming during the Eocene and grew much larger than the modern-day <!--del_lnk--> saltwater crocodile. Python fossils and turtle fossils are also known from <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North America</a>.<p>During the Eocene plants and marine faunas became quite modern. Many modern <!--del_lnk--> bird orders first appear in the Eocene.<p><a id="Eocene_oceans" name="Eocene_oceans"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Eocene oceans</span></h2>
      <p>The Eocene oceans were warm and teeming with <a href="../../wp/f/Fish.htm" title="Fish">fish</a> and other sea life. The first <!--del_lnk--> Carcharinid sharks appeared, as did early marine mammals, including <i><!--del_lnk--> Basilosaurus</i>, an early species of <a href="../../wp/w/Whale.htm" title="Whale">whale</a> that is thought to be descended from land animals, the hoofed predators called <!--del_lnk--> mesonychids, of which <i><!--del_lnk--> Mesonyx</i> was a member. The first <!--del_lnk--> sirenians, relatives of the elephants, also appeared at this time.<p><a id="The_Grande_Coupure" name="The_Grande_Coupure"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The <i>Grande Coupure</i></span></h2>
      <p>The <i>Grande Coupure</i>, or &quot;great break&quot; in continuity, with a major European turnover in mammalian fauna about 33.5 Ma, marks the end of the last phase of Eocene assemblages, the <!--del_lnk--> Priabonian, and the arrival in Europe of Asian immigrants. The Grande Coupure is characterized by widespread extinctions and <!--del_lnk--> allopatric speciation in small isolated <!--del_lnk--> relict populations. It was given its name in 1910 by the Swiss <a href="../../wp/p/Paleontology.htm" title="Paleontology">palaeontologist</a> <!--del_lnk--> Hans Georg Stehlin, to characterise the dramatic turnover of European mammalian fauna, which he placed at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. A comparable turnover in Asian fauna has since been called the &quot;Mongolian Remodelling&quot;.<p>The Grande Coupure marks a break between <!--del_lnk--> endemic European faunas before the break and mixed faunas with a strong Asian component afterwards. J.J. Hooker and his team summarized the break:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Pre-Grande Coupure faunas are dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> perissodactyl family <!--del_lnk--> Palaeotheriidae (distant horse relatives), six families of <!--del_lnk--> artiodactyls (cloven-hoofed mammals) (Anoplotheriidae, Xiphodontidae, Choeropotamidae, Cebochoeridae, Dichobunidae and Amphimerycidae), the rodent family Pseudosciuridae, the primate families Omomyidae and Adapidae, and the <!--del_lnk--> archontan family Nyctitheriidae.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>&quot;Post-Grande Coupure faunas include the true <!--del_lnk--> rhinos (family Rhinocerotidae), three artiodactyl families (Entelodontidae, Anthracotheriidae and Gelocidae) related respectively to <a href="../../wp/p/Pig.htm" title="Pig">pigs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> hippos and <!--del_lnk--> ruminants, the <!--del_lnk--> rodent families Eomyidae, Cricetidae (hamsters) and Castoridae (<a href="../../wp/b/Beaver.htm" title="Beaver">beavers</a>), and the lipotyphlan family Erinaceidae (<!--del_lnk--> hedgehogs). The speciose genus Palaeotherium plus Anoplotherium and the families Xiphodontidae and Amphimerycidae were observed to disappear completely.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dd>&quot;Only the marsupial family <!--del_lnk--> Herpetotheriidae, the artiodactyl family <!--del_lnk--> Cainotheriidae, and the rodent families <!--del_lnk--> Theridomyidae and Gliridae (<!--del_lnk--> dormice) crossed the faunal divide undiminished.&quot; (Hooker et al. 2004)</dl>
      <p>Whether this abrupt change was caused by <a href="../../wp/c/Climate_change.htm" title="Climate change">climate change</a> associated with the earliest polar glaciations and a major fall in sea levels, or by competition with taxa dispersing from Asia, few would argue for an isolated single cause. More spectacular causes are related to the impact of one or more large <!--del_lnk--> bolides in <!--del_lnk--> Siberia and in the<!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake Bay impact crater. Improved correlation of northwest European successions to global events (Hooker et al. 2004) confirms the Grande Coupure as occuring in the earliest Oligocene, with a hiatus of about 350 ka prior to the first record of post-Grande Coupure Asian immigrant taxa.<p>An element of the paradigm of the Grande Coupure was the apparent extinction of all European <!--del_lnk--> primates at the Coupure: the recent discovery of a mouse-sized early Oligocene <!--del_lnk--> omomyid, reflecting the better survival chances of small mammals, further undercut the Grand Coupure paradigm.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene&quot;</div>
