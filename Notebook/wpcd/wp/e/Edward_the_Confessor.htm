      <p><b>St Edward the Confessor</b> or <i><b>Eadweard III</b></i> (<i>c</i>. 1004 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> 4 January <!--del_lnk--> 1066), son of <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready, was the penultimate <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon <!--del_lnk--> King of England and the last of the <!--del_lnk--> House of Wessex, ruling from <!--del_lnk--> 1042 until his death. His reign marked the continuing disintegration of royal power in England and the aggrandisement of the great territorial earls, and it foreshadowed the country&#39;s later connection with <!--del_lnk--> Normandy, whose duke <a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William I</a> was to supplant Edward&#39;s successors <!--del_lnk--> Harold Godwinson and <!--del_lnk--> Edgar &AElig;theling as England&#39;s ruler.<p>He succeeded his half-brother <!--del_lnk--> Harthacanute, who had successfully regained the throne of England after being dispossessed by their mutual step-brother, <!--del_lnk--> Harold Harefoot; Edward and his brother Alfred the Aetheling, both sons of <!--del_lnk--> Emma of Normandy by <!--del_lnk--> Ethelred the Unready, had previously failed to depose Harold in 1036.<p>Edward was canonised in 1161 and is considered a <!--del_lnk--> saint by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, which regards Edward the Confessor as the <!--del_lnk--> patron saint of kings, difficult marriages, and separated spouses.

      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1013, Edward and his brother Alfred were taken to Normandy by their mother <!--del_lnk--> Emma, sister of Normandy&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Duke <!--del_lnk--> Richard II, to escape the <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a> invasion of England. Edward developed an intense personal piety in his quarter-century of Norman exile, during his most formative years, while England formed part of a great Danish empire. His familiarity with Normandy and its leaders would also influence his later rule.<p>After an abortive attempt with Alfred in <!--del_lnk--> 1036 to displace their step-brother <!--del_lnk--> Harold Harefoot from the throne, Edward returned to Normandy; Alfred, however, was captured and killed by <!--del_lnk--> Godwin, Earl of Wessex. This murder of his brother is thought to be the source of much of his later hatred for the Earl and played a major part in the reason for his banishment in autumn 1051; Edward said that the only way in which Godwin could be forgiven was if he brought back the murdered Alfred, an impossible task.<p>The Anglo-Saxon lay and ecclesiastical nobility invited Edward back to England in <!--del_lnk--> 1041; this time he became part of the household of his half-brother <!--del_lnk--> Harthacanute (son of Emma and <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Canute</a>), and according to the <i><!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> was sworn in as king alongside him. Following Harthacanute&#39;s death on <!--del_lnk--> 8 June <!--del_lnk--> 1042, Edward ascended the throne. The <i>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</i> indicates the popularity he enjoyed at his accession &mdash; &quot;before <!--del_lnk--> Harthacanute was buried, all the people chose Edward as king in London&quot;. Edward was crowned at <!--del_lnk--> the cathedral of Winchester, the royal seat of the <!--del_lnk--> West Saxons on <!--del_lnk--> 3 April <!--del_lnk--> 1043.<p>When Edward died in 1066 he had no son to take over the throne so there was a problem as three people claimed the throne of England.<p><a id="Edward.27s_Reign" name="Edward.27s_Reign"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Edward&#39;s Reign</span></h2>
      <p>Edward&#39;s reign was marked by peace and prosperity, but effective rule in England required coming to terms with three powerful earls: <!--del_lnk--> Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who was firmly in control of the <!--del_lnk--> thegns of <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>, which had formerly been the heart of the Anglo-Saxon monarchy; <!--del_lnk--> Leofric, Earl of Mercia, whose legitimacy was strengthened by his marriage to <!--del_lnk--> Lady Godiva, and in the north, <!--del_lnk--> Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Edward&#39;s sympathies for Norman favourites frustrated Saxon and Danish nobles alike, fuelling the growth of anti-Norman opinion led by <!--del_lnk--> Godwin, who had become the king&#39;s father-in-law in <!--del_lnk--> 1045. The breaking point came over the appointment of an <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">archbishop of Canterbury</a>: Edward rejected Godwin&#39;s man and appointed the bishop of London, <!--del_lnk--> Robert of Jumi&egrave;ges, a trusted Norman.<div class="floatright"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/521/52146.jpg.htm" title=""><img alt="" height="309" longdesc="/wiki/Image:St_Edward_the_Confessor.jpg" src="../../images/521/52146.jpg" width="197" /></a></span></div>
      <p>Matters came to a head over a bloody riot at Dover between the townsfolk and Edward&#39;s kinsman <!--del_lnk--> Eustace, count of Boulogne. <!--del_lnk--> Godwin refused to punish them, <!--del_lnk--> Leofric and <!--del_lnk--> Siward backed the King, and <!--del_lnk--> Godwin and his family were all exiled in September <!--del_lnk--> 1051. <!--del_lnk--> Queen Edith was sent to a nunnery at <!--del_lnk--> Wherwell. Earl Godwin returned with an armed following a year later, however, forcing the king to restore his title and send away his Norman advisors. Godwin died in <!--del_lnk--> 1053 and the Norman <!--del_lnk--> Ralph the Timid received <!--del_lnk--> Herefordshire, but his son Harold accumulated even greater territories for the Godwins, who held all the earldoms save <a href="../../wp/m/Mercia.htm" title="Mercia">Mercia</a> after <!--del_lnk--> 1057. <!--del_lnk--> Harold led successful raiding parties into <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> in 1063 and negotiated with his inherited rivals in Northumbria in <!--del_lnk--> 1065, and in January <!--del_lnk--> 1066, upon Edward&#39;s death, he was proclaimed king.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>The details of the succession have been widely debated: the Norman position was that <!--del_lnk--> William had been designated the heir, and that Harold had been publicly sent to him as emissary from Edward, to apprise him of Edward&#39;s decision. Harold&#39;s party asserted that the old king had made a deathbed bestowal of the crown on Harold. However, Harold was approved by the <!--del_lnk--> Witenagemot who, under <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon law, held the ultimate authority to convey kingship.<p>Edward had married Godwin&#39;s daughter <!--del_lnk--> Edith on <!--del_lnk--> 23 January <!--del_lnk--> 1045, but the union was childless. The reason for this is the subject of much speculation. Possible explanations include Edward, having taken vow of chastity, considering the union a <!--del_lnk--> spiritual marriage, the age difference between Edward and Edith engendering a filial rather than spousal relationship, Edward&#39;s antipathy toward Edith&#39;s father (Barlow 1997), or infertility.<p>Edward&#39;s nearest heir would have been his nephew <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Exile, who was born in England, but spent most of his life in Hungary. He had returned from exile in 1056 and died not long after, in February the following year. So Edward made his great nephew <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Atheling his heir. But Edgar had no secure following among the earls: the resultant succession crisis on Edward&#39;s death without a direct &quot;throneworthy&quot; heir &mdash; the &quot;foreign&quot; Edgar was a stripling of fourteen &mdash; opened the way for Harold&#39;s coronation and the invasions of two effective claimants to the throne, the unsuccessful invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Harald Hardrada in the north and the successful one of William of Normandy.<p><a href="../../wp/w/William_I_of_England.htm" title="William I of England">William of Normandy</a>, who had visited England during Godwin&#39;s exile, claimed that the childless Edward had promised him the succession to the throne, and his <a href="../../wp/n/Norman_conquest_of_England.htm" title="Norman conquest of England">successful bid for the English crown</a> put an end to Harold&#39;s nine-month kingship following a 7000-strong Norman invasion. <!--del_lnk--> Edgar &AElig;theling was elected king by the <!--del_lnk--> Witan after Harold&#39;s death but was brushed aside by William. Edward, or more especially the medi&aelig;val cult which would later grow up around him under the later Plantagenet kings, had a lasting impact on English history. <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> was founded by Edward between <!--del_lnk--> 1045 and <!--del_lnk--> 1050 on land upstream from the City of London, and was consecrated on <!--del_lnk--> 28 December <!--del_lnk--> 1065. Centuries later, <!--del_lnk--> Westminster was deemed symbolic enough to become the permanent seat of English government under <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_III_of_England.htm" title="Henry III of England">Henry III</a>. The Abbey contains a shrine to Edward which was the centrepiece to the Abbey&#39;s redesign during the mid-thirteenth century. In 2005, Edward&#39;s remains were found beneath the pavement in front of the high altar. His remains had been moved twice in the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries, and the original tomb has since been found on the central axis of the Abbey in front of the original high altar.<p>Historically, Edward&#39;s reign marked a transition between the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a> West Saxon kingship of England and the Norman monarchy which followed Harold&#39;s death. Edward&#39;s allegiances were split between England and his mother&#39;s Norman ties. The great earldoms established under <!--del_lnk--> Canute grew in power, while Norman influence became a powerful factor in government and in the leadership of the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Church</a>.<p>It was during the reign of Edward that some features of the English monarchy familiar today were introduced. Edward is regarded as responsible for introducing the royal seal and coronation regalia. Also under Edward, a marked change occurred in Anglo-Saxon art, with continental influences becoming more prominent (including the &quot;Winchester Style&quot; which had become known in the 10th century but prominent in the 11th), supplanting Celtic influences prominent in preceding painting, sculpture, calligraphy and jewellery (see <!--del_lnk--> Benedictional of St. &AElig;thelwold for an example of the Winchester Style). His crown is believed to have survived until the <!--del_lnk--> English Civil War when <a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Cromwell.htm" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> allegedly ordered it to be destroyed. Gold from it is understood to have been integrated into the <!--del_lnk--> St. Edward&#39;s Crown, which has been used in coronations since <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_II_of_England.htm" title="Charles II of England">Charles II of England</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1661.<p><a id="Canonization" name="Canonization"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Canonization</span></h2>
      <p>When <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_II_of_England.htm" title="Henry II of England">Henry II</a> came to the throne in <!--del_lnk--> 1154, he united in his person at last the Saxon and Norman royal lines. To reinforce this new warrant of authenticity, the <!--del_lnk--> cult of King Edward the Confessor was promoted. <!--del_lnk--> Osbert de Clare was a monk of <!--del_lnk--> Westminster, elected Prior in <!--del_lnk--> 1136, and remembered for his lives of saints <!--del_lnk--> Edmund, <!--del_lnk--> Ethelbert and <!--del_lnk--> Edburga, in addition to one of Edward, in which the king was represented as a holy man, reported to have performed several miracles and to have healed people by his touch. Osbert was, as his surviving letters demonstrate, an active ecclesiastical politician, and went to <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> to advocate the cause for Edward to be declared a saint, successfully securing his <!--del_lnk--> canonisation by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Alexander III in <!--del_lnk--> 1161. In <!--del_lnk--> 1163, the newly sainted king&#39;s remains were enshrined in <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_Abbey.htm" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> with solemnities presided over by <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Becket.htm" title="Thomas Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. On this occasion the honour of preparing a sermon was given to <!--del_lnk--> Aelred, the revered Abbot of <!--del_lnk--> Rievaulx, to whom is generally attributed the <i>vita</i> in Latin, a <!--del_lnk--> hagiography partly based on materials in an earlier <i>vita</i> by Osbert de Clare and which in its turn provided the material for a rhymed version in octasyllabic <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Norman, possibly written by the chronicler <!--del_lnk--> Matthew Paris.<p>At the time of Edward&#39;s canonisation, saints were broadly categorised as either <!--del_lnk--> martyrs or <!--del_lnk--> confessors: martyrs were people who had been killed for their faith, while confessors were saints who had died natural deaths. Edward was accordingly styled Edward the Confessor, partly to distinguish him from his canonised predecessor <!--del_lnk--> Edward the Martyr.<p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> regards Edward the Confessor as the <!--del_lnk--> patron saint of kings, difficult marriages, and separated spouses. After the reign of Henry II Edward was considered the patron saint of England until <!--del_lnk--> 1348 when he was replaced in this role by <!--del_lnk--> St. George. He remained the patron saint of the Royal Family.<p>Edward&#39;s reign is memorialized in an eight panel <!--del_lnk--> stained glass window within <!--del_lnk--> St Laurence Church, Ludlow, England.<p><a id="In_the_Arts" name="In_the_Arts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In the Arts</span></h2>
