      <p>The <b>EMD GP30</b> was a 2,250&nbsp;hp (1,680&nbsp;kW) four-axle <!--del_lnk--> B-B <!--del_lnk--> diesel locomotive built by <!--del_lnk--> General Motors&#39; <!--del_lnk--> Electro-Motive Division of <!--del_lnk--> La Grange, Illinois between July, 1961 and November, 1963. 948 examples were built for railroads in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> (2 only), including 40 cabless <!--del_lnk--> B units for the <!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific Railroad.<p>It was the first so-called &quot;second generation&quot; EMD diesel locomotive, and was produced in response to increased competition by a new entrant, <!--del_lnk--> General Electric&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> U25B, which was released roughly at the same time as the GP30. The GP30 is easily recognizable due to its high profile and stepped cab roof, unique among <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> locomotives. A number are still in service today in original or rebuilt form.<p>

      <p><a id="Development" name="Development"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Development</span></h3>
      <p>The GP30 was conceived out of the necessity of matching new competitor GE&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> U25B. The U25B offered 2,500&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) while EMD&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> GP20 and its <!--del_lnk--> 567D2 <!--del_lnk--> prime mover was only rated at 2,000&nbsp;hp (1,500&nbsp;kW). It also featured a sealed, airtight long hood with a single inertial air intake for electrical cooling, with a pressurised cooling system which kept dust out of the engine and equipment area. Finally, the entire design was optimized for ease of access and maintenance. The U25B demonstrators were receiving much praise&mdash;and orders&mdash;from the railroads that tested them. Meanwhile, <!--del_lnk--> ALCO had been producing the 2,400&nbsp;hp (1,800&nbsp;kW) <!--del_lnk--> RS-27 since 1959, though it had not sold well.<p>EMD&#39;s engine department managed to get an extra 250&nbsp;hp (186&nbsp;kW) out of the <!--del_lnk--> V16 <!--del_lnk--> EMD 567-series engine; the new engine was designated the <i>EMD 567D3</i>. 2,250&nbsp;hp (1,680&nbsp;kW) wasn&#39;t quite equivalent to the GE and ALCO offerings, but EMD hoped the railroads&#39; familiarity with EMD equipment would improve their chances. The locomotive in which it would be fitted was improved along the lines of the U25B; sealed long hood, central air intake, and engineered for easier maintenance access. The frame and trucks of the GP20 were carried across; the extra equipment for the centralized air system required more space behind the cab, and since the locomotive was not going to be lengthened, extra space was achieved vertically by raising the height of the locomotive, giving room for the central air system, turbocharger and electrical cabinet all behind the cab. This extra height behind the cab meant that the body style used for previous GP units was not suitable.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Since EMD needed the new locomotive to be visibly modern and updated, they turned to the GM Automotive Styling Centre at <!--del_lnk--> Troy, Michigan for help. The automobile stylists created the GP30&#39;s trademark &quot;hump&quot; and cab roof profile. The hump-like bulge started at the front of the cab and enveloped the air intakes for the central air system and the <!--del_lnk--> dynamic brake blister. Units ordered without dynamic brakes were the same shape, but lacked the intakes to cool the dynamic brake resistor grids.<p>For the first time on an EMD <!--del_lnk--> hood unit, a low short hood was the default. A high short hood could be ordered, but only holdouts <!--del_lnk--> Norfolk and Western Railway and <!--del_lnk--> Southern Railway received such units. EMD originally planned to name the locomotive the <b>GP22</b>, and the first demonstrators were put out under that number, but EMD&#39;s marketing department decided to leapfrog GE&#39;s numbering to make the new locomotive seem more advanced. Marketing literature claimed 30 distinct improvements from the GP20 and that this was the reason for the number.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The GP30 successfully countered the GE threat and kept EMD in the dominant position in the North American diesel market. While losing a little power to the GE and ALCO competition, the solidity and reliability of the GP30&mdash;and the familiarity of railroad mechanical departments with EMD products&mdash;ultimately won many more orders for EMD. 948 were sold, in comparison to 478 U25Bs. In addition, the GP30 was only sold until the end of <!--del_lnk--> 1963, while the U25B was available until <!--del_lnk--> 1966.<p>Most major railroads ordered GP30s, and many smaller ones did too. The largest orders were from the <!--del_lnk--> UP (152), <!--del_lnk--> SOU (120), <!--del_lnk--> ATSF (85), and the <!--del_lnk--> B&amp;O (77). The sole purchaser of <!--del_lnk--> B units (by the mid <!--del_lnk--> 1960s generally an outdated concept) was the UP, who kept the practice of running its locomotives in matched sets much longer than others. Eight of those 40 B units were fitted with <!--del_lnk--> steam generators for heating <!--del_lnk--> passenger trains, the only GP30s to receive them.<p>Some units for the <!--del_lnk--> GM&amp;O, <!--del_lnk--> MILW and <!--del_lnk--> SOO were built from ALCO trade-ins and ride on <!--del_lnk--> AAR type B trucks instead of the standard <!--del_lnk--> Blomberg Bs. An indisputable tribute to the quality of the GP30 design is the fact that a good number are still in service <!--del_lnk--> as of 2006, which is a service lifespan of over 40 years and well in excess of the design life of 25-30 years for the average diesel locomotive. Furthermore, when life-expired, some railroads chose to give them major rebuilds instead of scrapping them.<p><a id="Rebuilds" name="Rebuilds"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rebuilds</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Burlington Northern Railroad was the most extensive rebuilder of GP30s. Finding a need for modernised units of lower power, it sent GP30s&mdash;-both its own and units purchased from other railroads-&mdash;to be rebuilt. Seventy units were sent to EMD and 65 to <!--del_lnk--> Morrison Knudsen (now <!--del_lnk--> MotivePower Industries) for rebuilding, and the rebuilds are known as <b>GP39E</b> and <b>GP39M</b> respectively. The changes included new generators, <!--del_lnk--> Dash-2 modular electronic control systems and 567D3 engines upgraded with <!--del_lnk--> EMD 645-series power assemblies, rated at 2,300&nbsp;hp (1,720&nbsp;kW) and designated 16-645D3. These units are still in service on local and smaller lines throughout the <!--del_lnk--> BNSF Railway system.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, meanwhile, performed a similar upgrade in its own <!--del_lnk--> Cleburne, Texas shops, stripping the locomotives down to bare metal and rebuilding with new equipment. The 567 engines retained their 2,250&nbsp;hp (1,680&nbsp;kW) rating but were upgraded with 645-series power assemblies. The generators and traction motors were upgraded and control and electrical equipment was replaced. The trucks received Hyatt <!--del_lnk--> roller bearings and single-clasp brake systems. Rooftop <!--del_lnk--> air conditioners and new <!--del_lnk--> horns were added. The locomotives were repainted in the blue and yellow <i><!--del_lnk--> Yellowbonnet</i> scheme, and designated <b>GP30u</b> (for <i>upgraded</i>). 78 of these survived until the BNSF merger, and most are still in use in secondary service.<p><a id="Preservation" name="Preservation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Preservation</span></h3>
      <p>According to John Komanesky&#39;s <i>Preserved Diesels</i> site, 16 GP30s have been preserved by a variety of museums, societies and tourist railways. This is in addition to a number still in operational use. A number of these preserved locomotives are in operational condition.<p><!--del_lnk--> Union Pacific GP30 849 is in the collection of the <!--del_lnk--> Western Pacific Railroad Museum and is operational.<p><a id="Units_produced" name="Units_produced"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Units produced</span></h2>
