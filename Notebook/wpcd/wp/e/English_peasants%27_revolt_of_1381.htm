      <p>The <b>Peasants&#39; Revolt</b>, <b>Tyler&rsquo;s Rebellion</b>, or the <b>Great Rising</b> of <!--del_lnk--> 1381 was one of a number of <!--del_lnk--> popular revolts in late medieval Europe and is a major event in the <!--del_lnk--> history of England. The names of some of its leaders, <!--del_lnk--> John Ball, <!--del_lnk--> Wat Tyler and <!--del_lnk--> Jack Straw, are still familiar even though very little is actually known about these individuals.<p>Tyler&#39;s Rebellion is significant because it marked the beginning of the end of serfdom in medieval England. Tyler&#39;s Rebellion led to calls for the reform of feudalism in <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> and an increase in rights for the serf class.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The revolt was precipitated by heavy-handed attempts to enforce the third <!--del_lnk--> poll tax, first levied in <!--del_lnk--> 1377 supposedly to finance military campaigns overseas &mdash; a continuation of the <a href="../../wp/h/Hundred_Years%2527_War.htm" title="Hundred Years&#39; War">Hundred Years&#39; War</a> initiated by King <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_III_of_England.htm" title="Edward III of England">Edward III of England</a>. The third <!--del_lnk--> poll tax, unlike the two earlier, was not levied on a flat rate basis (as in <!--del_lnk--> 1377) nor according to schedule (as in <!--del_lnk--> 1379), but in a manner that appeared more arbitrary and hence unfair: it was also set at 12d compared with the 1377 rate of 4d. The young King, <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_II_of_England.htm" title="Richard II of England">Richard II</a>, was also another reason for the uprising, as he was only 14 at the time, and therefore unpopular men such as <!--del_lnk--> John of Gaunt (the acting regent), <!--del_lnk--> Simon Sudbury (Chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury) and <!--del_lnk--> Sir Robert Hales (the Lord Treasurer, responsible for the poll tax) were left to rule instead, and many saw them as corrupt officials, trying to exploit the weakness of the King. A longer-term factor was the way the <!--del_lnk--> Statute of Labourers of <!--del_lnk--> 1351 was enforced. The <a href="../../wp/b/Black_Death.htm" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> that ravaged England in <!--del_lnk--> 1348 and <!--del_lnk--> 1349 had greatly reduced the labour force, and, as a consequence, labourers were able to demand enhanced terms and conditions. The Statute attempted to curb this by pegging wages and restricting the mobility of labour, but the probable effect was that labourers employed by lords were effectively exempted, but labourers working for other employers, both artisans and more substantial peasants, were liable to be fined or held in the stocks.<p>The event that triggered the uprising was the incident involving the attempt to force the village of Brentwood, Essex, to pay the recent poll tax. When John Bampton, along with two armed guards, entered the village and demanded them to pay, the locals insisted they had already paid and would not contribute another penny. Bampton then tried to arrest some villagers; however, over one hundred men, led by Thomas Baker, chased Bampton out of the village. When he returned to London, troops were dispatched to deal with them. These men were also repelled by Baker, who made the man in charge swear an oath to never return and beheaded six of the accompanying clerks. By this time the violent discontent had spread, and the counties of Essex and Kent were in full revolt. Soon people moved on London in an armed uprising.<p><a id="First_protests" name="First_protests"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">First protests</span></h2>
      <p>In June 1381, two groups of common people from the southeastern counties of <!--del_lnk--> Kent and <!--del_lnk--> Essex marched on <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>. The most vociferous of their leaders, Walter, or &quot;Wat&quot; Tyler, was at the head of a contingent from <!--del_lnk--> Kent. When the rebels arrived in <!--del_lnk--> Blackheath on <!--del_lnk--> June 12, the renegade <!--del_lnk--> Lollard priest, John Ball, preached a sermon including the famous question that has echoed down the centuries: <i>&quot;When <!--del_lnk--> Adam delved and <!--del_lnk--> Eve span, who was then the <!--del_lnk--> gentleman?&quot;</i>. The following day the rebels, encouraged by the sermon, crossed <a href="../../wp/l/London_Bridge.htm" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a> into the heart of the city. Meanwhile the &#39;Men of Essex&#39; had gathered with Jack Straw at <!--del_lnk--> Great Baddow and had marched on London, arriving at <!--del_lnk--> Stepney. Instead of what was expected from a riot however, there was only a systematic attack on certain properties, many of them associated with <!--del_lnk--> John of Gaunt and/or the <!--del_lnk--> Hospitaller Order. On <!--del_lnk--> June 14, they are reputed to have been met by the young king himself, and to have presented him with a series of demands, including the dismissal of some of his more unpopular ministers and the effective abolition of serfdom. One of the more intriguing demands of the peasants was &quot;that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester&quot;. This is often said to refer to the statutes of the Charter of Winchester (1251), though it is sometimes considered to be a reference to the more equitable days of king <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a>, when <!--del_lnk--> Winchester was the capital of England.<p><a id="Storming_the_Tower_of_London" name="Storming_the_Tower_of_London"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Storming the Tower of London</span></h2>

      <p>At the same time, a group of rebels stormed the <a href="../../wp/t/Tower_of_London.htm" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>&mdash; after likely being let in&mdash; and summarily executed those hiding there, including the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Chancellor (<!--del_lnk--> Simon of Sudbury, the <a href="../../wp/a/Archbishop_of_Canterbury.htm" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, who was particularly associated with the poll tax), and the Lord Treasurer (<!--del_lnk--> Robert de Hales, the Grand Prior of the <!--del_lnk--> Knights Hospitallers of England). The <!--del_lnk--> Savoy Palace of the king&#39;s uncle <!--del_lnk--> John of Gaunt was one of the London buildings destroyed by the rioters. <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_II_of_England.htm" title="Richard II of England">Richard II</a> agreed to reforms such as fair rents and the abolition of <!--del_lnk--> serfdom.<p><a id="Smithfield" name="Smithfield"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Smithfield</span></h2>
      <p>At <!--del_lnk--> Smithfield, on the following day, further negotiations with the king were arranged, but on this occasion the meeting did not go according to plan. Wat Tyler left his Army and rode forth to parlay with the King and his party. Tyler, it is alleged by his killers, behaved most belligerently and dismounted his horse and called for a drink most rudely. In the ensuing dispute Tyler drew his dagger and <!--del_lnk--> William Walworth, the Mayor of London drew his sword and attacked Tyler, mortally wounding him in the neck. Seeing him surrounded by the King&#39;s entourage the Rebel Army was in uproar, but King Richard, seizing the opportunity, rode forth and promised the Rebels all was well, that Tyler had been knighted, and their demands would be met - they were to March to <!--del_lnk--> St John&#39;s Fields, where Wat Tyler would meet them. This they duly did, but the King broke his promise. The Nobles quickly re-established their control with the help of a hastily organised militia of 7000, and most of the other leaders were pursued, captured and executed, including John Ball. Jack Straw turned on his associates under torture and betrayed many of them to the executioner - though it did not save him. Following the collapse of the revolt, the king&#39;s concessions were quickly revoked, and the tax was levied.<p>Despite its name, participation in the Peasants&#39; Revolt was not confined to serfs or even to the lower classes. Although the most significant events took place in the capital, there were violent encounters throughout eastern England -- but those involved hastened to dissociate themselves in the months that followed.<p><a id="Literary_mention" name="Literary_mention"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literary mention</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> John Gower, friend of <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer, saw the peasants as unjustified in their cause. In his <i><!--del_lnk--> Vox Clamantis</i>, he sees the peasant action as the work of the <!--del_lnk--> Anti-Christ and a sign of evil prevailing over virtue.<p><!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey Chaucer mentions <!--del_lnk--> Jack Straw, one of the leaders of the Revolt, in his satiric &#39;The Nun&#39;s Priest&#39;s Tale&#39; of <i><!--del_lnk--> The Canterbury Tales</i>.<p><i><!--del_lnk--> Froissart&#39;s Chronicles</i> devotes twenty pages to the revolt.<p><!--del_lnk--> William Morris described the revolt in <i>A Dream of John Ball</i> (1888).<p>In the book <i>Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry</i> (1990) author <!--del_lnk--> John J. Robinson (not a professional historian), combines scholarly research with entertaining storytelling to make the case that the leadership of the revolt was somehow involved with the disbanded <!--del_lnk--> Knights Templar, and makes broad correlations throughout his book to <!--del_lnk--> Freemasonry and the Templar Order. These claims are unique to Robinson and are warily received by professional scholars of the period.<p><a id="Further_reading" name="Further_reading"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_peasants%27_revolt_of_1381&quot;</div>
