      <p>Saint <b>Edwin</b> (alternately <b>Eadwine</b> or <b>&AElig;duini</b>) (<i>c.</i> 586&ndash;October 12, 632/633) was the <!--del_lnk--> King of <!--del_lnk--> Deira and <!--del_lnk--> Bernicia - which would later become known as <!--del_lnk--> Northumbria - from about 616 until his death. He converted to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and was <!--del_lnk--> baptised in 627; after he fell at the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Hatfield Chase, he was venerated as a <!--del_lnk--> saint.<p>Edwin was the son of <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;lle king of <!--del_lnk--> Deira.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that on &AElig;lle&#39;s death a certain &quot;<!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelric&quot; assumed power. The exact identity of &AElig;thelric is uncertain. He may have been a brother of &AElig;lle, an elder brother of Edwin, an otherwise unknown Deiran noble, or the father of &AElig;thelfrith. &AElig;thelfrith himself appears to have been king of &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Northumbria&quot;&mdash;both Deira and Bernicia&mdash;by no later than 604. During the reign of &AElig;thelfrith, Edwin was an exile. The location of his early exile as a child is not known, but late traditions, reported by <!--del_lnk--> Reginald of Durham and <!--del_lnk--> Geoffrey of Monmouth, place Edwin in the <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Gwynedd, fostered by king <!--del_lnk--> Cadfan ap Iago, so allowing biblical parallels to be drawn from the struggle between Edwin and his supposed foster-brother <!--del_lnk--> Cadwallon. By the 610s he was certainly in Mercia, under the protection of king <!--del_lnk--> Cearl, whose daughter Cwenburh he married.<p>By around 616, Edwin was in East Anglia, under the protection of king <!--del_lnk--> Raedwald. <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> reports that &AElig;thelfrith tried to have Raedwald murder his unwanted rival, and that Raedwald was minded to do so, only being persuaded otherwise by his wife with Divine prompting. Regardless of the exact course of events, Raedwald faced &AElig;thelfrith in battle by the <!--del_lnk--> river Idle in 616, and &AElig;thelfrith was killed, along with Raedwald&#39;s son Raegenhere. Edwin was installed as king of Northumbria, effectively confirming Raedwald as <!--del_lnk--> Bretwalda; &AElig;thelfrith&#39;s sons went into exile in Irish <a href="../../wp/d/D%25C3%25A1l_Riata.htm" title="D&aacute;l Riata">D&aacute;l Riata</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Picts.htm" title="Picts">Pictland</a>. That Edwin was able to take power not only his native Deira, but also Bernicia, may have been due to his support from Raedwald, to whom he may have remained subject during the early part of his reign. Edwin&#39;s reign marks an interruption of the otherwise consistent domination of Northumbria by the Bernicians, and has been seen as &quot;contrary to the prevailing tendency&quot;.<p><a id="Edwin_as_king" name="Edwin_as_king"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Edwin as king</span></h2>
      <p>With the death of &AElig;thelfrith, and of the powerful <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelberht of Kent the same year, Raedwald and his client Edwin were well placed to dominate England, and indeed Raedwald did so until his death a decade later. Edwin annexed the minor <!--del_lnk--> British kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Elmet following a campaign in either <!--del_lnk--> 616 or <!--del_lnk--> 626. Elmet had probably been subject to Mercia and then to Edwin.  The much larger <!--del_lnk--> kingdom of Lindsey appears to have been taken over c. 625, after the death of king Raedwald.<p>At this time Edwin and <!--del_lnk--> Eadbald of Kent were allies, and Edwin arranged to marry Eadbald&#39;s sister <!--del_lnk--> &AElig;thelburh. It is said by Bede that Eadbald would only agree to marry his sister to Edwin if he converted to Christianity. The marriage of Eadbald&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Merovingian mother <!--del_lnk--> Bertha had resulted in the conversion of Kent, and &AElig;thelburh&#39;s would do the same in Northumbria.<p>Edwin&#39;s expansion to the west may have begun in early in his reign. In the early 620s, there is firm evidence of a war being waged between Edwin and <!--del_lnk--> Fiachnae mac B&aacute;et&aacute;in of the <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;l nAraidi, king of the <!--del_lnk--> Ulaid in <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. A lost poem is known to have existed recounting Fiachnae&#39;s campaigns against the Saxons, and the <!--del_lnk--> Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of <!--del_lnk--> Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623&ndash;624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin&#39;s designs on the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae&#39;s death in 626, at the hands of his namesake, Fiachnae mac Demm&aacute;in of the <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;l Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae&#39;s death a year later in battle against the <a href="../../wp/d/D%25C3%25A1l_Riata.htm" title="D&aacute;l Riata">D&aacute;l Riata</a> probably eased the way for Edwin&#39;s conquests in the Irish sea province.<p>The routine of kingship in Edwin&#39;s time involved regular, probably annual, wars with neighbours, to obtain tribute, submission and slaves. By Edwin&#39;s death, it is likely that these annual wars, unreported in the main, had extended the Northumbrian kingdoms from the <!--del_lnk--> Humber and the <!--del_lnk--> Mersey north to the <!--del_lnk--> Southern Uplands and the <!--del_lnk--> Cheviots.<p>The royal household moved regularly from one &quot;royal villa&quot; to the next, consuming the food renders given in tribute and the produce of the royal estates, dispensing justice, and ensuring that royal authority remained visible throughout the land. The royal sites in Edwin&#39;s time included <!--del_lnk--> Yeavering in Bernicia, where traces of a timber <!--del_lnk--> amphitheatre have been found. This &quot;Roman&quot; feature makes Bede&#39;s claim that Edwin was preceded by a standard-bearer carrying a &quot;tufa&quot; (<a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language"><i>OE</i></a> <i>thuuf</i>, this may have been a winged globe) appear to be more than antiquarian curiosity, although whether the model for this practice was Roman or Frankish is unknown. Other royal sites included <i>Campodunum</i> in Elmet (perhaps <!--del_lnk--> Barwick), <!--del_lnk--> Sancton in Deira and <!--del_lnk--> Goodmanham, the site where the pagan high priest Coifi destroyed the idols according to Bede. Edwin&#39;s realm included the former Roman cities of <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Carlisle, and both appear to have been of some importance in the 7th century, although it is not clear whether urban life continued at this period.<p><a id="Edwin.27s_conversion_to_Christianity" name="Edwin.27s_conversion_to_Christianity"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Edwin&#39;s conversion to Christianity</span></h2>
      <p>The account of Edwin&#39;s conversion offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin&#39;s exile, tells how Edwin&#39;s life was saved by <!--del_lnk--> Paulinus of York. The second, following his marriage to &AElig;thelburh, was the attempted assassination at <a href="../../wp/y/York.htm" title="York">York</a>, at Easter 626, by an agent of <!--del_lnk--> Cwichelm of Wessex, Edwin&#39;s decision to allow the baptism of his daughter <!--del_lnk--> Eanfled and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against Cwichelm proved successful. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede&#39;s account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to take risks, unable to decide whether to convert or not.<p>As well as these events, the influence of Edwin&#39;s half-Merovingian Queen cannot be ignored, and the letters which Bede reproduces, sent by <!--del_lnk--> Pope Boniface V to Edwin and Athelburh are unlikely to have been unique. Given that Kent was under Frankish influence, while Bede sees the mission as being &quot;Roman&quot; in origin, the Franks were equally interested in converting their fellow Germans, and in extending their power and influence. Bede recounts Edwin&#39;s baptism, and that of his chief men, on the 12th of April 627. Edwin&#39;s zeal, so Bede says, led to Raedwald&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Eorpwald also converting.<p>Edwin&#39;s conversion and Eorpwald&#39;s were reversed by their successors, and in the case of Northumbria the Roman Paulinus appears to have had very little impact. Indeed, by expelling British clergy from Elmet and elsewhere in Edwin&#39;s realm, Paulinus may have weakened the Church rather than strengthening it. Very few Roman clergy were present in Paulinus&#39;s time, only <!--del_lnk--> James the Deacon being known, so that the &quot;conversion&quot; can have been only superficial, extending little beyond the royal court. Paulinus&#39;s decision to flee Northumbria at Edwin&#39;s death, unlike his acolyte James who remained in Northumbria for many years afterwards until his death, suggests that the conversion was not popular, and the senior Italian cleric unloved.<p><a id="Edwin_as_overlord" name="Edwin_as_overlord"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Edwin as overlord</span></h2>
      <p>The first challenge to Edwin came soon after his marriage-alliance with Kent, concluded at <a href="../../wp/c/Canterbury.htm" title="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> in the summer of 625. By offering his protection to lesser kings, such as the king of <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Wight.htm" title="Isle of Wight">Wight</a>, Edwin thwarted the ambitions of Cwichelm of Wessex. Cwichelm&#39;s response was to send an assassin, as noted already. Edwin did not immediately respond to this insult, suggesting either that he felt unable to do so, or that Bede&#39;s portrayal of him as a rather indecisive ruler is accurate. Following the failed assassination, as noted, Edwin committed himself to Christianity provided only that he was victorious against Cwichelm.<p>From about 627 onwards, Edwin was the most powerful king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The <i>imperium</i>, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated with the idea of a <!--del_lnk--> Bretwalda, a later concept invented by <!--del_lnk--> West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin&#39;s overlordship, and failure would diminish it.<p>Edwin&#39;s supposed foster-brother Cadwallon enters the record circa 629, but Cadwallon was defeated and either submitted to Edwin&#39;s authority or went into exile. With the defeat of Cadwallon, Edwin&#39;s authority appears to have been unchallenged for a number of years, until <a href="../../wp/p/Penda_of_Mercia.htm" title="Penda of Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a> and Cadwallon rose against him in 632&ndash;633.<p>Edwin faced Penda and Cadwallon at the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Hatfield Chase in the autumn of 632 or 633, and was defeated and killed. For a time his body was (allegedly) hidden in <!--del_lnk--> Sherwood Forest at a location that became the village of <!--del_lnk--> Edwinstowe (trans. Edwin&#39;s resting place). Of his two grown sons by Cwenburh of Mercia, Osfrith died at Hatfield, and Eadfrith was captured by Penda and killed some time afterwards.<p>After his death, Edwin&#39;s Queen &AElig;thelburh, along with Paulinus, returned to Kent, taking her son Wuscfrea, daughter Eanfled, and Osfrith&#39;s son Yffi into exile with her. Wuscfrea and Yffi were sent to the court of &AElig;thelburh&#39;s kinsman <!--del_lnk--> Dagobert I, king of the Franks, but died soon afterwards. Eanfled, however, lived to marry her first cousin king <!--del_lnk--> Oswiu, son of Acha and &AElig;thelfrith.<p><a id="Death_and_legacy" name="Death_and_legacy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Death and legacy</span></h2>
      <p>Edwin&#39;s realm was divided at his death. He was succeeded by <!--del_lnk--> Osric, son of Edwin&#39;s paternal uncle &AElig;lfric, in Deira, and by <!--del_lnk--> Eanfrith, son of &AElig;thelfrith and Edwin&#39;s sister Acha, in Bernicia. Both reverted to <!--del_lnk--> paganism, and both were killed by Cadwallon; eventually Eanfrith&#39;s brother <a href="../../wp/o/Oswald_of_Northumbria.htm" title="Oswald of Northumbria">Oswald</a> defeated and killed Cadwallon and united Northumbria once more. Thereafter, with the exception of <!--del_lnk--> Oswine son of Osric, power in Northumbria was in the hands of the Idings, the descendants of <!--del_lnk--> Ida of Bernicia, until the middle of the 8th century.<p>After his death, Edwin came to be venerated as a saint by some, although his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, who was killed in 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British in both cases, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede&#39;s treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded Oswald as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.<p>Edwin&#39;s renown comes largely from his treatment at some length by Bede, writing from an uncompromisingly English and Christian perspective, and rests on his belated conversion to Christianity. His united kingdom in the north did not outlast him, and his conversion to Christianity was renounced by his successors. When his kingship is compared with his pagan brother-in-law &AElig;thelfrith, or to &AElig;thelfrith&#39; sons Oswald and Oswiu, or to the resolutely pagan Penda of Mercia, Edwin appears to be something less than a key figure in Britain during the first half of the <a href="../../wp/7/7th_century.htm" title="7th century">7th century</a>. Perhaps the most significant legacies of Edwin&#39;s reign lay in his failures, the rise of Penda and of Mercia, and the return from Irish exile of the sons of &AElig;thelfrith which tied the kingdom of Northumbria into the Irish sea world for generations.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_of_Northumbria&quot;</div>
