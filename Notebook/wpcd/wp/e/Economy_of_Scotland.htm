      <p>After the Industrial Revolution, the <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> economy concentrated on heavy industry, dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding, <!--del_lnk--> coal mining and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> industries. Scottish participation in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> also allowed the Scottish economy to export its output throughout the world. However heavy industry declined in the latter part of the 20th century leading to a remarkable shift in the economy of Scotland towards a technology and service sector based economy. The 1980s saw an economic boom in the <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Glen corridor between <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, with many large technology firms relocating to Scotland. Today the industry employs over 41,000 people. Scottish-based companies have strengths in information systems, defence, electronics, instrumentation and semi-conductors. There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry, based around links between the <!--del_lnk--> universities and indigenous companies like Wolfson, <!--del_lnk--> Linn, Nallatech and Axeon. There is also a significant presence of global players like <!--del_lnk--> National Semiconductor and <!--del_lnk--> Motorola. Other major industries include <!--del_lnk--> banking and <!--del_lnk--> financial services, <a href="../../wp/e/Education.htm" title="Education">education</a>, <!--del_lnk--> entertainment, <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, transport equipment, <!--del_lnk--> oil and <a href="../../wp/g/Gas.htm" title="Gas">gas</a>, <!--del_lnk--> whisky, and <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> is just over &pound;74 billion ($130 billion) (2002) <!--del_lnk--> , giving a per capita GDP of &pound;14,651 ($25,546) (2002).<p>Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland and the sixth largest centre in Europe, with many large financial firms based there, including the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Bank of Scotland (the second largest bank in Europe), <!--del_lnk--> HBOS (owners of the <!--del_lnk--> Bank of Scotland) and Standard Life Insurance. Glasgow is Scotland&#39;s leading seaport and is the fourth largest manufacturing centre in the UK, accounting for well over 60% of Scotland&#39;s manufactured exports. Shipbuilding, although significantly diminished from its heights in the early 20th century, is still a large part of the Glasgow economy. The city has the UK&#39;s largest and most economically important commerce and retail district after London&#39;s West End. Glasgow is also one of Europe&#39;s top 20 financial centres and is home to many of the UK&#39;s leading companies. Other important industries include textile production, chemicals, distilling, brewing and fishing.<p><a id="Natural_Resources" name="Natural_Resources"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Manufacturing</span></h2>

      <p>Manufacturing in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> has shifted its focus in recent years with heavy industries such as <!--del_lnk--> shipbuilding and <a href="../../wp/i/Iron.htm" title="Iron">iron</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> declining in their importance and contribution to the economy. It is generally argued that this has been in response to increasing <!--del_lnk--> globalisation and competition from low cost producers across the world, which has eroded Scotland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> comparative advantage in such industries over the latter half of the 20th century. However, the decline in heavy industry in Scotland has been supplanted with the rise in the manufacture of lighter, less labour intensive products such as <!--del_lnk--> optoelectronics, <!--del_lnk--> software, <!--del_lnk--> chemical products and derivatives as well as <!--del_lnk--> life sciences. Not only has the decline of heavy industry, in the last 20 to 30 years, resulted in a sectoral shift of labour, it has led to smaller firms, strengthening links with the academic community and substantial, industry-specific retraining programmes for the workforce.<p><a id="Whisky" name="Whisky"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Whisky</span></h3>
      <p>Scotch Whisky is probably the best known of Scotland&#39;s manufactured exports contributing around &pound;800 million to the Scottish economy, supporting 41,000 jobs as well as adding &pound;2 billion to the balance of trade making it one of the UK&rsquo;s top five manufacturing export earners. The Whisky industry also generates a substantial income for the government with around &pound;1.6bn raised in <!--del_lnk--> duty each year. The principal whisky producing areas include <!--del_lnk--> Speyside and the island of <!--del_lnk--> Islay where there are 8 distilleries providing a major source of employment for the island. In many areas the whisky industry is closely related with <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, with many distilleries also functioning as tourist attractions.<p><a id="Electronics" name="Electronics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Electronics</span></h3>
      <p>The electronics industry in Scotland <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Glen is the phrase that is used to describe the growth and development of Scotland&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> hi-tech and electronics industries in the <!--del_lnk--> Central Belt through the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s and <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, analogous to the larger concentration of hi-tech industries in <!--del_lnk--> Silicon Valley, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>. Companies such as <!--del_lnk--> IBM (which maintains a plant at <!--del_lnk--> Greenock near <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>) have been in Scotland since the <!--del_lnk--> 1950&#39;s being joined in the <!--del_lnk--> 1980&#39;s by others such as <!--del_lnk--> Sun Microsystems at <!--del_lnk--> Linlithgow. 45,000 people are employed by electronics and electronics-related firms, accounting for 12% of manufacturing output. Today, Scotland produces 28% of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>&rsquo;s PCs; more than seven per cent of the world&rsquo;s <!--del_lnk--> PCs; and 29% of Europe&rsquo;s notebooks.<p><a id="Textiles" name="Textiles"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Textiles</span></h3>
      <p>Historically textiles were a large employer in Scotland in places such as the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Borders, <a href="../../wp/s/Shetland.htm" title="Shetland">Shetland</a> and the <a href="../../wp/o/Outer_Hebrides.htm" title="Outer Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> - areas where there is much production of wool. <!--del_lnk--> Knitwear and <!--del_lnk--> tweed are traditionally seen as cottage industries but names like <!--del_lnk--> Pringle have given Scottish knitwear and apparel a presence on the international market. Despite increasing competition from low-cost textile producers in SE <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Subcontinent, textiles in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> is still a major employer with a workforce of around 22,000. Furthermore the textiles industry is the 7th largest exporter in Scotland accounting for over 3% of all Scottish manufactured products<p><a id="Exports" name="Exports"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exports</span></h3>
      <p>In 2004, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) was provisionally estimated to be &pound;17.5 billion, of which 70% (&pound;12.2 billion) were attributable to manufacturing. The largest export products for Scotland are <!--del_lnk--> whisky, electronics, and financial services. <p><a id="Major_Trading_Partners" name="Major_Trading_Partners"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Major Trading Partners</span></h3>
      <p>Excluding intra UK trade, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="EU">EU</a> constitute the largest markets for Scotland&#39;s exports. As part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, Scotland fully participates in the <!--del_lnk--> Single Market and <!--del_lnk--> Free Trade Area which exists across all EU member states and regions.

The densest network of <!--del_lnk--> roads, <!--del_lnk--> railways and <!--del_lnk--> motorways is concentrated in the <!--del_lnk--> Central Lowlands of the country where around 70% of the population live. The motorway and trunk road network is principally centred on the cities of <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and connecting them to other major concentrations of population, and is vitally important to the economy of Scotland. Key routes include the <!--del_lnk--> M8 motorway, which is one of the busiest and most important major routes in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, with other primary routes such as the <!--del_lnk--> A9 connecting the <!--del_lnk--> Highlands to the Central Belt, and the <!--del_lnk--> A90/<!--del_lnk--> M90 connecting <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> in the east. The <!--del_lnk--> M74 and <!--del_lnk--> A1, in the west and east of the country, respectively, provide the main road corridors from <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive has stated that it intends to spend &pound;3bn on a capital investment scheme to improve Scotland&#39;s road and rail system, over the next decade , with the setting up of a national agency in January <!--del_lnk--> 2006 - <!--del_lnk--> Transport Scotland to oversee this. Many roads in the Highlands are single track, with passing places.<p>The rail network is primarily centred on the central belt and is used principally as a means of public transport, with some freight movements - for example from the port at <!--del_lnk--> Grangemouth. After a large rationalisation of routes in the 1960s, which led to station and line closures, the rail network is currently being expanded, to cope with ever increasing levels of passenger demand. The rail-operator <!--del_lnk--> First ScotRail operates most routes within Scotland, with long-distance connections to <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> operated by <!--del_lnk--> GNER or <!--del_lnk--> Virgin Trains. Proposals which have been mooted include the construction of a high-speed <!--del_lnk--> MAGLEV rail system connecting <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Glasgow.htm" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> which, it estimated, will cut journey times between the two cities by around 30 minutes . Other measures suggested include the electrification of the rail system in order to cut journey times.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, 22.6 million passengers used Scotland&#39;s airports, with their being 514,000 aircraft movements  with Scottish airports being amongst the fastest growing in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in terms of passenger numbers. Plans have been published by the major airport operator <!--del_lnk--> BAA plc to facilitate the expansion of capacity at the major international airports of <!--del_lnk--> Glasgow, <!--del_lnk--> Edinburgh and <!--del_lnk--> Aberdeen, including new terminals and runways to cope with a large forecasted rise in passenger use. <!--del_lnk--> Prestwick Airport also has large air freight operations and cargo handling facilties. Scotland is well-served by many airlines and has an expanding international route network, with recent long-haul services to <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a>, <!--del_lnk--> New York and <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.<p>Major deep-water <!--del_lnk--> Port facilities exist at <a href="../../wp/a/Aberdeen.htm" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Grangemouth, <!--del_lnk--> Greenock, <!--del_lnk--> Peterhead, <!--del_lnk--> Scapa Flow and <!--del_lnk--> Sullom Voe. Scotland is connected to mainland <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> by a dedicated ferry service between <!--del_lnk--> Rosyth (near <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>) and <!--del_lnk--> Zeebrugge in <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>. In addition to this many remote island communities on Scotland&#39;s western seaboard are served by lifeline ferry services operated by the state-owned company <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian MacBrayne, which carry tourists as well as freight and are vital to the economies of these islands.<p><a id="The_Role_of_the_Public_Sector" name="The_Role_of_the_Public_Sector"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The Role of the Public Sector</span></h2>
      <p>The public sector, in Scotland, has a significant impact upon the economy and comprises central government departments, local government, and public corporations. In quarter 3 of 2005, there were 577,300 people employed in the public sector, which accounts for 23.4% of employment in Scotland - this includes all medical professionals employed within the <!--del_lnk--> National Health Service in Scotland, those employed in the fire, police and emergency services and those employed in the state education and higher education sector. This is in addition to employees of the government in the civil service and in local government as well as <!--del_lnk--> public bodies and corporations.<p>There is a clear separation of responsibility of the powers of both the UK government and the devolved <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive in relation to the formulation and execution of national economic policy as it affects <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> - this is set out under Section 5 of the <!--del_lnk--> Scotland Act 1998.<p><a id="UK_Government" name="UK_Government"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">UK Government</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> UK Government along with the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> retains full control over Scotland&#39;s fiscal environment, in relation to taxation (including tax rates and tax collection) and the overall share of central government expenditure apportioned to <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, in the form of an annual block grant. It also retains complete responsibility for the operation of the Welfare State, in terms of pensions, unemployment insurance and <!--del_lnk--> child benefit - as part of the UK-wide Welfare State exercised by the UK <!--del_lnk--> Department for Work and Pensions and <!--del_lnk--> HM Treasury.<p><a id="Scottish_Executive" name="Scottish_Executive"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Scottish Executive</span></h3>
      <p>The Scottish Executive has very limited power to raise or lower the rate of <!--del_lnk--> income tax in Scotland by up to 3p in the pound, but has the power to vary <!--del_lnk--> business rates and can regulate the application of local taxes such as the <!--del_lnk--> council tax levied by <!--del_lnk--> local authorities in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Nevertheless the Scottish Executive has full control over how Scotland&#39;s annual block grant is divided between government departments, such as healthcare and education and on state-owned enterprises, such as <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Water and <!--del_lnk--> Caledonian MacBrayne. The Scottish Executive does however have control over Economic Development policy, and controls, funds and regulates the national Economic development Agency - <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Enterprise. In 2006, for example, the budget of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive was around &pound;25bn,  which the Scottish Executive can spend on the areas under its jurisdiction such as education, healthcare, transport, the environment and justice.<p><a id="Local_Government" name="Local_Government"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Local Government</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 32 unitary authorities in Scotland have the ability to levy a local tax, called the <!--del_lnk--> Council Tax which is used to pay for local services such as refuse collection, street lighting, roads, pavements, public parks and museums. The value of residential property is the base for the tax, with each dwelling allocated to one of eight bands coded by letters A through H (H being the highest) on the basis of its assumed capital value. Each local authority sets a tax rate expressed as the annual levy on a Band D property inhabited by two liable adults. The budget of local authorities is supplemented by direct <!--del_lnk--> grants from the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Executive.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h4>
      <p>Education in Scotland is well-funded with very high levels of participation in all sectors of education. Participation in further and higher education is especially high, with Scottish universities generally being recognised as amongst the best in the teaching of <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Law.htm" title="Law">law</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Engineering.htm" title="Engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Technology.htm" title="Technology">technology</a>. Increasingly Scotland is being seen as an exporter of education, with the number of overseas students applying to studying at universities throughout Scotland, rising substantially in recent years . Most universities are linked with a flourishing research and development sector; the <!--del_lnk--> University of Dundee is at the heart of a <a href="../../wp/b/Biotechnology.htm" title="Biotechnology">biotechnology</a> and <!--del_lnk--> medical research cluster ; the <!--del_lnk--> University of Edinburgh is a centre of excellence in the field of <!--del_lnk--> Artificial Intelligence and the <!--del_lnk--> University of Aberdeen is a world-leader in the study of offshore technology in the oil and gas industry  . Scotland generally has a well-educated population - adult Literacy rates are at over 99%.<p><a id="Health" name="Health"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Health</span></h4>
      <p>Another major component of central government expenditure in Scotland is on healthcare and healthcare related services. The <!--del_lnk--> National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly controlled provider of the majority of healthcare in Scotland, with the NHS being a major employer not only in terms of doctors nurses and other key healthcare workers, but also in terms of administration. The service is administered differently from the rest of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and is largely <i>free at the point of use</i> to residents in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, except for <!--del_lnk--> dental services (where those over 19 must pay) and prescriptions (free to the elderly and subsidised for others). In the short term spending on healthcare in Scotland remains high in response to the nations&#39; poor diet and high instance of <!--del_lnk--> heart disease. In the medium to long term, the challenges of an ageing population are likely to increase demand for health services and put increasing pressure on the health service in <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>.<p><a id="Other_Economic_Indicators.07UNIQ34155f9c19c5f406-nowiki-00000117-QINU31.07UNIQ34155f9c19c5f406-nowiki-00000118-QINU" name="Other_Economic_Indicators.07UNIQ34155f9c19c5f406-nowiki-00000117-QINU31.07UNIQ34155f9c19c5f406-nowiki-00000118-QINU"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other Economic Indicators</span></h2>
