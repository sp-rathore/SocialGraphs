       <li>One of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian names of the country, <i>km.t</i>, or &quot;black land,&quot; is derived from the fertile black soils deposited by the Nile floods, distinct from the &#39;red land&#39; (<i>dSr.t</i>) of the desert. The name is realized as <i>k&#x12B;mi</i> and <i>k&#x12B;m&#x259;</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> Coptic stage of the Egyptian language, and appeared in early Greek as <i>Kyme&iacute;a</i>.</ul>

       <li><i>Mi<span class="Unicode">&#x1E63;</span>r</i>, the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> and official name for modern Egypt (<!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Arabic: <i>Ma<span class="Unicode">&#x1E63;</span>r</i>), is of <!--del_lnk--> Semitic origin directly cognate with the <a href="../../wp/h/Hebrew_language.htm" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> &#x5DE;&#x5B4;&#x5E6;&#x5B0;&#x5E8;&#x5B7;&#x5D9;&#x5B4;&#x5DD; (<i>Mitzr&aacute;yim</i>), meaning &quot;the two straits&quot; (a reference to the dynastic separation of upper and lower Egypt), and possibly means &quot;a country&quot; or &quot;a state&quot;. <i>Mi<span class="Unicode">&#x1E63;</span>r</i> in Arabic also means &quot;a country&quot; or &quot;a state&quot;.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The English name &quot;Egypt&quot; came via the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> word <i>Aegyptus</i> derived from the <!--del_lnk--> ancient Greek word <span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">&Alpha;&#x3AF;&gamma;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> (<i>Aigyptos</i>). According to <!--del_lnk--> Strabo, &Alpha;&#x3AF;&gamma;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; (<i>Aigyptos</i>), in ancient Greek meant &quot;below the Aegean&quot; (<span class="polytonic" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">A&#x1F30;&gamma;&alpha;&#x3AF;&omicron;&upsilon; &#x1F51;&pi;&tau;&#x3AF;&omega;&sigmaf;</span>, &quot;Aegaeou upti&#x14D;s&quot;), and was formed by the combination of the two words. It has also been suggested that the word is a corruption of the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian phrase <i><span class="Unicode">&#x1E25;wt-k3-pt&#x1E25;</span></i> meaning &quot;home of the <!--del_lnk--> Ka (Soul) of Ptah&quot;, the name of a temple of the god <!--del_lnk--> Ptah at <!--del_lnk--> Memphis.</ul>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Nile Valley was site of continuous human habitation since at least the <!--del_lnk--> Paleolithic. Traces of these early peoples appear in the form of artifacts and rock carvings along the terraces of the <a href="../../wp/n/Nile.htm" title="Nile">Nile</a> and in the desert oases.

Climate changes and/or overgrazing around 8000 BC began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt, eventually forming the <a href="../../wp/s/Sahara.htm" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>.

During the <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic, several <!--del_lnk--> predynastic cultures developed independently in <!--del_lnk--> Upper and Lower Egypt. The <!--del_lnk--> Badarian culture and the successor <!--del_lnk--> Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_Egypt.htm" title="Ancient Egypt">Dynastic Egyptian civilization</a>. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining somewhat culturally separate, but maintaining frequent contact through trade. The earliest known evidence of <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appear during the predynastic period on <!--del_lnk--> Naqada III pottery vessels, dated to about 3200 BC.<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="float:left; clear:left; margin:5px; border:2px solid black;">

      <p>A unified kingdom was founded circa 3150 <!--del_lnk--> BC by King <!--del_lnk--> Menes, giving rise to a <!--del_lnk--> series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia. <!--del_lnk--> Egyptians subsequently referred to their unified country as <i>tAwy</i>, meaning &#39;Two Lands&#39;; and later <i>km.t</i> (<!--del_lnk--> Coptic: <i>K&#x12B;mi</i>), the &#39;Black Land&#39;, a reference to the fertile black soil deposited by the Nile river. <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its <!--del_lnk--> religion, <!--del_lnk--> arts, <!--del_lnk--> language and customs.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about 150 years. Stronger Nile floods and stabilization of government, however, brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Kingdom <i>c</i>. 2040 BC, reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh <!--del_lnk--> Amenemhat III. A <!--del_lnk--> second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first alien ruling dynasty in Egypt, that of the <!--del_lnk--> Semitic <!--del_lnk--> Hyksos. The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around 1650 BC, and founded a new capital at <!--del_lnk--> Avaris. They were eventually driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by <!--del_lnk--> Ahmose I, who founded the <!--del_lnk--> Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from <!--del_lnk--> Memphis to <!--del_lnk--> Thebes.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> New Kingdom (c.1550&minus;1070 BC) began with the Eighteenth Dynasty, marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as <!--del_lnk--> Jebel Barkal in <!--del_lnk--> Nubia, and included parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Levant in the east. This period is known for some of the most well-known <!--del_lnk--> Pharaohs, including <a href="../../wp/h/Hatshepsut.htm" title="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Thutmose III, <a href="../../wp/a/Akhenaten.htm" title="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> and his wife <!--del_lnk--> Nefertiti, <!--del_lnk--> Tutankhamun and <a href="../../wp/r/Ramesses_II.htm" title="Ramesses II">Ramesses II</a>. The first known self-conscious expression of <!--del_lnk--> monotheism came during this period in the form of <!--del_lnk--> Atenism. Frequent contacts with other nations brought in new ideas in the New Kingdom.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch. It <!--del_lnk--> fell to the Persians in 343 BC after the last native pharaoh, King <!--del_lnk--> Nectanebo II, was defeated in battle. Later, Egypt fell to the <!--del_lnk--> Greeks and <!--del_lnk--> Romans, beginning over two thousand years of foreign rule. Before Egypt became part of the <!--del_lnk--> Byzantine realm, Christianity had been brought by <!--del_lnk--> Saint Mark the Evangelist in the AD first century. <!--del_lnk--> Diocletian&#39;s reign marks the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt, when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted. The <!--del_lnk--> New Testament was by then translated into Egyptian, and after the <!--del_lnk--> Council of Chalcedon in AD 451, a distinct <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established.<p>The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief <!--del_lnk--> Persian invasion early in the seventh century, until in AD 639, Egypt was <!--del_lnk--> invaded by the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Arabs. The form of Islam the Arabs brought to Egypt was <!--del_lnk--> Sunni, though early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity, giving rise to various <!--del_lnk--> Sufi orders that have flourished to this day. Muslim rulers nominated by the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic Caliphate <!--del_lnk--> remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries, including a period for which it was the seat of the Caliphate under the <!--del_lnk--> Fatimids. With the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Ayyubid dynasty, a <!--del_lnk--> Turco-<!--del_lnk--> Circassian military caste, the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluks, took control about AD 1250 and continued to govern even after the <!--del_lnk--> conquest of Egypt by the <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Turks in 1517.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The brief <!--del_lnk--> French Invasion of Egypt in 1801 had a great social impact on the country and its culture, as native Egyptians were introduced to the principals of the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and were invited to head their own government. A series of civil wars took place between the Ottoman Turks, the Mamluks, and Albanian mercenaries following the evacuation of French troops, resulting in the Albanian <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Ali <!--del_lnk--> taking control of Egypt where he was appointed as the Ottoman <!--del_lnk--> viceroy in 1805. He led a modernization campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and increased industrialization, which were then taken up and further expanded by his grandson and successor <!--del_lnk--> Isma&#39;il Pasha.<p>Following the completion of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> by Ismail in 1869, Egypt became an important world transportation hub. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt and eventually they came to have an important influence on governmental affairs. The country also fell heavily into debt to European powers. Ostensibly to protect its investments, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> <a href="../../wp/s/Scramble_for_Africa.htm" title="Scramble for Africa">seized control</a> of Egypt&#39;s government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> continued until 1914 when as a result of the declaration of <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">war with the Ottoman Empire</a>, Britain declared a <!--del_lnk--> protectorate over Egypt and deposed the <!--del_lnk--> khedive, replacing him with <!--del_lnk--> his uncle who was appointed <!--del_lnk--> Sultan of Egypt.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Between 1882 and 1906, a local nationalist movement for independence was taking shape. The <!--del_lnk--> Dinshaway Incident prompted Egyptian opposition to take a stronger stand against British occupation and the first political parties were founded. After the first World War, <!--del_lnk--> Saad Zaghlul and the <!--del_lnk--> Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement after gaining a majority at the local Legislative Assembly. When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to <a href="../../wp/m/Malta.htm" title="Malta">Malta</a> on March 8, 1919, Egypt witnessed its first modern revolution. Constant revolting by the Egyptian people throughout the country led Great Britain to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt&#39;s independence on February 22, 1922.<p>The new Egyptian government drafted and implemented a new <!--del_lnk--> constitution in 1923 based on a <a href="../../wp/p/Parliamentary_system.htm" title="Parliamentary system">parliamentary</a> representative system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly-elected as <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924, and in 1936 the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. However, continued instability in the government due to remaining British control and increasing involvement by the King in politics led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a <i><!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;&eacute;tat</i> by a group of <!--del_lnk--> army officers in 1952. They forced <!--del_lnk--> King Farouk I to abdicate in support of his son <!--del_lnk--> King Ahmed Fouad II.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Egyptian Republic was declared on <!--del_lnk--> 18 June <!--del_lnk--> 1953 with General <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic. Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 by <!--del_lnk--> Gamal Abdel Nasser &ndash; the real architect of the 1952 movement &ndash; and was later put under <!--del_lnk--> house arrest. Nasser assumed <!--del_lnk--> power as President and declared the full independence of Egypt from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 18, <!--del_lnk--> 1956. His <!--del_lnk--> nationalization of the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a> on <!--del_lnk--> July 26, <!--del_lnk--> 1956 prompted the 1956 <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis. Three years after the 1967 <!--del_lnk--> Six Day War, in which Egypt lost the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai to <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>, Nasser died and was succeeded by <!--del_lnk--> Anwar Sadat. Sadat switched Egypt&#39;s <a href="../../wp/c/Cold_War.htm" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> allegiance from the <a href="../../wp/s/Soviet_Union.htm" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the <!--del_lnk--> Infitah economic reform policy, while violently clamping down on religious and secular opposition alike.<p>In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched a surprise attack on Israel in an attempt to regain the occupied Sinai Penninsula. Both the <!--del_lnk--> US and the <!--del_lnk--> USSR intervened and a cease-fire was reached between both sides. Despite not being a complete military success, most historians agree that the <!--del_lnk--> Yom Kippur war presented Sadat with a political victory that would later allow him to pursue peace with Israel. In <!--del_lnk--> 1977, Sadat made a historical visit to Israel which led to the <!--del_lnk--> 1978 <!--del_lnk--> peace treaty in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat&#39;s initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt&#39;s expulsion from the Arab League, but was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians. Sadat was assassinated in Cairo by a fundamentalist military soldier in <!--del_lnk--> 1981 and was succeeded by the incumbent <!--del_lnk--> Hosni Mubarak. In 2003, the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian Movement for Change, popularly known as <i>Kifaya</i>, was launched to seek a return to <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> and greater <!--del_lnk--> civil liberties.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>Egypt has been a republic since <!--del_lnk--> 18 June <!--del_lnk--> 1953. President <!--del_lnk--> Mohamed Hosni Mubarak has been the <!--del_lnk--> President of the Republic since <!--del_lnk--> October 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1981, following the assassination of former-President <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Anwar El-Sadat. Mubarak is currently serving his fifth term in office. He is the leader of the ruling <!--del_lnk--> National Democratic Party. <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Nazif was sworn in as Prime Minister on <!--del_lnk--> 9 July <!--del_lnk--> 2004, following the resignation of Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Atef Ebeid from his office.<p>Although power is ostensibly organized under a <!--del_lnk--> multi-party <!--del_lnk--> semi-presidential system, whereby the executive power is theoretically divided between the President and the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister, in practice it rests almost solely with the President who traditionally has been elected in single-candidate elections for more than fifty years. Egypt also holds regular multi-party parliamentary elections. The last presidential election, in which Mubarak won a fifth consecutive term, <!--del_lnk--> was held in September 2005.<p>In late February 2005, President Mubarak announced in a surprise television broadcast that he had ordered the reform of the country&#39;s presidential election law, paving the way for multi-candidate polls in the upcoming presidential election. For the first time since the <!--del_lnk--> 1952 movement, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates. The President said his initiative came &quot;out of my full conviction of the need to consolidate efforts for more freedom and democracy.&quot; However, the new law placed draconian restrictions on the filing for presidential candidacies, designed to prevent well-known candidates such as <!--del_lnk--> Ayman Nour from standing against Mubarak, and paved the road for his easy re-election victory.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Concerns were once again expressed after the 2005 presidential elections about government interference in the election process through fraud and vote-rigging, in addition to police brutality and violence by pro-Mubarak supporters against opposition demonstrators. This poses major questions about the government&#39;s purported commitment to democracy.<p>As a result, most Egyptians are skeptical about the process of <!--del_lnk--> democratization and the role of the elections. Less than 25 percent of the country&#39;s 32 million registered voters (out of a population of more than 78 million) actually turned out for the 2005 elections. Newspapers, however, have exhibited an increasing degree of freedom in criticizing the president, and the results of the <!--del_lnk--> 2005 parliamentary elections, which saw <!--del_lnk--> Islamist candidates such as the banned <!--del_lnk--> Muslim Brotherhood winning seats, indicate that a change of some sorts may be underway.<p><a id="International" name="International"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International</span></h3>
      <p>The permanent headquarters for the <!--del_lnk--> League of Arab States (The Arab League) is located in Cairo. The Secretary General of the League has traditionally been an Egyptian. Former Egyptian Foreign Minister <!--del_lnk--> Amr Moussa is the current Secretary General of the Arab League. The Arab League briefly moved out of Egypt to Tunis in 1978 as a protest at the peace treaty with Israel, but returned in 1989.<p>Egypt was the first Arab state to establish diplomatic relations with the state of Israel, after the signing of the <!--del_lnk--> Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty at the <!--del_lnk--> Camp David Accords. Egypt has a major influence amongst other Arab states, and has historically played an important role as a mediator in resolving disputes between various Arab nations, and in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Most Arab nations still give credence to Egypt playing that role, though its effects are often limited.<p>Former Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Boutros Boutros-Ghali served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.<p>A territorial dispute with Sudan over an area known as the <!--del_lnk--> Hala&#39;ib Triangle, has meant that diplomatic relations between the two remain strained.<p><a id="Human_rights" name="Human_rights"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Human rights</span></h3>

A rapidly-growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress the economy.<p>The government has struggled to prepare the economy for the new millennium through economic reform and massive investments in communications and physical infrastructure. Egypt has been receiving U.S. <!--del_lnk--> foreign aid (since 1979, an average of $2.2 billion per year) and is the third-largest recipient of such funds from the United States following the Iraq war.

Almost all the population is concentrated along the banks of the Nile (notably Alexandria and Cairo), in the Delta and near the Suez Canal. Approximately 90% of the population adheres to <!--del_lnk--> Islam and most of the remainder to Christianity (primarily the <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Orthodox denomination). Apart from religious affiliation, Egyptians can be divided demographically into those who live in the major urban centers and the <!--del_lnk--> fellahin or farmers of rural villages.<p><!--del_lnk--> Egyptians are by the far the largest ethnic group in Egypt at 97-98% (about 76.4 million) of the total population. Ethnic minorities include the <!--del_lnk--> Bedouin Arab tribes living in the eastern deserts and the <!--del_lnk--> Sinai Peninsula, the <!--del_lnk--> Berber-speaking <!--del_lnk--> Siwis of the <!--del_lnk--> Siwa Oasis, and the ancient <!--del_lnk--> Nubian communities clustered along the Nile in the southernmost part of Egypt. Egypt also hosts some 90,000 refugees and asylum seekers, made up mostly of 70,000 <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian refugees and 20,000 <!--del_lnk--> Sudanese refugees. The once-vibrant <!--del_lnk--> Jewish community in Egypt has virtually <!--del_lnk--> disappeared, with only a small number remaining in Egypt and those who visit on religious occasions.

      <p>Religion plays a central role in most Egyptians&#39; lives as visitors to the country quickly discover. The <!--del_lnk--> rolling calls to prayer that are heard five times a day have the informal effect of regulating the pace of everything from business to entertainment. Cairo is famous for its numerous mosque <!--del_lnk--> minarets and church towers.<p>Egypt is predominantly Muslim, at approximately 90% of the population, with the majority being adherents of the <!--del_lnk--> Sunni branch of Islam. A significant number of Muslim Egyptians also follow native <!--del_lnk--> Sufi <!--del_lnk--> orders. Christians represent about 10% of the population, with the largest being the <!--del_lnk--> Coptic denomination (primarily Coptic Orthodox, but also <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Catholic and Coptic Protestant) at 9%, while the remaining 1% include <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholics</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/Eastern_Orthodox_Church.htm" title="Eastern Orthodox Church">Greek Orthodox</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Syriac Orthodox, and <!--del_lnk--> Armenian Orthodox, largely found in <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria and <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>.<p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> constitution, any new legislation must implicitly agree with <!--del_lnk--> Islamic laws. The mainstream <!--del_lnk--> Hanafi school of <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam is largely organised by the state, through <i>Wizaret Al-Awkaf</i> (Ministry of Religious Affairs). <i>Al-Awkaf</i> controls all mosques and overviews Muslim clerics. <!--del_lnk--> Imams are trained in Imam vocational schools and at <!--del_lnk--> Al-Azhar University. The department supports Sunni Islam and has commissions authorised to give <i><!--del_lnk--> Fatwa</i> judgements on Islamic issues.<p>Egypt hosts two major religious institutions. <!--del_lnk--> Al-Azhar University (Arabic: &#x62C;&#x627;&#x645;&#x639;&#x629; &#x627;&#x644;&#x623;&#x632;&#x647;&#x631;) is the oldest <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islamic</a> institution of higher studies (founded around 970 <!--del_lnk--> A.D) and considered by many to be the oldest extant university. Egypt also has a strong Christian heritage as evidenced by the existence of the <!--del_lnk--> Coptic Orthodox Church headed by the <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch of Alexandria, which has a following of approximately 50 million Christians worldwide, most importantly in <a href="../../wp/e/Ethiopia.htm" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Eritrea.htm" title="Eritrea">Eritrea</a> (one of the famous Coptic Orthodox Churches is Saint Takla Haimanot Church in Alexandria).<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Religious freedom for Egypt&#39;s Coptic Christian community is hampered to varying degrees by extremist <!--del_lnk--> Islamist groups and by discriminatory and restrictive government policies. Until recently, Christians were required to obtain presidential approval for even minor repairs in churches, but the law was recently eased. Copts have faced increased marginalization after the 1952 coup d&#39;&eacute;tat. That however changed to some degree when President <!--del_lnk--> Sadat appointed <!--del_lnk--> Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as the Egyptian Foreign Minister. Prominent Copts on the cabinet now include Finance Minister <!--del_lnk--> Youssef Boutros Ghali and Environment Minister Maged George. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Naguib Sawiris, an extremely successful businessman and one of the wealthiest people internationally is an Egyptian Copt. Under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday in 2002. The Coptic community however has occassionally been the target of hate crimes and physical assault, most recently during attacks on three churches in Alexandria. In addition, many Copts continue to complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion.<p>Egypt was once home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. Jews partook of all aspects of Egypt&#39;s social and political life; one of the most ardent Egyptian nationalists, Yaqub Sanu&#39; (Abu Naddara), was a Jew, as was popular singer <!--del_lnk--> Leila Mourad. After the 1956 <!--del_lnk--> Suez Crisis, some 25,000 Egyptian Jews were expelled by <!--del_lnk--> Gamal Abdel Nasser, their Egyptian citizenship was revoked and their property was confiscated. A steady stream of migration of Egyptian Jews followed, reaching a peak after the <!--del_lnk--> Six-Day War with Israel in 1967. Today, Jews in Egypt number less than 200.<p><a href="../../wp/b/Bah%25C3%25A1%2527%25C3%25AD_Faith.htm" title="Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith">Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute;s</a> in Egypt, whose population ranges between several hundred and a few thousand, have their <!--del_lnk--> institutions and community activities banned. Since their faith is not officially recognized by the state, they are also not allowed to use it on their national identity cards (conversely, Islam, Christianity, &amp; Judaism are officially recognized); hence most of them do not hold national identity cards. In April 2006 a court case recognized the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith, but the government appealed the court decision and succeeded in having it suspended on 15 May.<p>There are Egyptians who identify as <!--del_lnk--> atheist and <!--del_lnk--> agnostic, but their numbers are largely unknown as openly advocating such positions risks legal sanction. In 2000, an openly atheist Egyptian writer, who called for the establishment of a local association for atheists, was tried on charges of insulting Islam in four of his books.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>At 386,636&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi&sup2; (1,001,450&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; ), Egypt is the world&#39;s thirtieth-largest country (after <a href="../../wp/m/Mauritania.htm" title="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>).

Egypt&#39;s important role in geopolitics stems from its strategic position: a <!--del_lnk--> transcontinental nation, it possesses a land bridge (the Isthmus of Suez) between <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a>, which in turn is traversed by a navigable waterway (the <a href="../../wp/s/Suez_Canal.htm" title="Suez Canal">Suez Canal</a>) that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the <a href="../../wp/i/Indian_Ocean.htm" title="Indian Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> via the <a href="../../wp/r/Red_Sea.htm" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>.<p>Apart from the Nile Valley, the majority of Egypt&#39;s landscape is a big, sandy desert. The winds blowing can create sand dunes over one hundred feet high. Egypt includes parts of the <!--del_lnk--> Sahara Desert and of the <!--del_lnk--> Libyan Desert. These deserts were referred to as the &quot;red land&quot; in ancient Egypt, and they protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats.<p>Towns and cities include <!--del_lnk--> Alexandria, one of the greatest ancient cities, <!--del_lnk--> Aswan, <!--del_lnk--> Asyut, <a href="../../wp/c/Cairo.htm" title="Cairo">Cairo</a>, the modern Egyptian capital, <!--del_lnk--> El-Mahalla El-Kubra, <!--del_lnk--> Giza, the site of the Pyramid of Khufu, <!--del_lnk--> Hurghada, <!--del_lnk--> Luxor, <!--del_lnk--> Kom Ombo, <!--del_lnk--> Port Safaga, <!--del_lnk--> Port Said, <!--del_lnk--> Sharm el Sheikh, <!--del_lnk--> Suez, where the Suez Canal is located, <!--del_lnk--> Zagazig, and <!--del_lnk--> Al-Minya. <!--del_lnk--> Oases include <!--del_lnk--> Bahariya, <!--del_lnk--> el Dakhla, <!--del_lnk--> Farafra, <!--del_lnk--> el Kharga and <!--del_lnk--> Siwa.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Egypt has a dry climate. It is hot in the summer, with temperatures averaging between 80 and 90&deg;F. Winters are warm, with temperatures averaging between 55 and 70&deg;F. A steady wind from the northwest helps hold down the temperature near the coast. The <!--del_lnk--> Khamaseen is a wind that blows from the south in Egypt, usually in spring or summer, bringing sand and dust, and sometimes raises the temperature in the desert to more than 100&deg;F. Rain seldom falls in Egypt. Along the Mediterranean Coast, the average yearly rainfall is 8 inches.

Today, many aspects of Egypt&#39;s ancient culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern <!--del_lnk--> Western culture, itself with roots in ancient Egypt.<p>Egypt&#39;s capital city, Cairo, is Africa&#39;s largest city and has been renowned for centuries as a centre of learning, culture and commerce. Egypt has the highest number of <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Laureates in Africa and the Arab World. Some Egyptian born politicians were or are currently at the helm of major international organizations like <!--del_lnk--> Boutros Boutros-Ghali of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mohamed ElBaradei of the <!--del_lnk--> IAEA.<p><a id="Renaissance" name="Renaissance"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Renaissance</span></h4>
      <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Rifa&#39;a et-Tahtawi started the Egyptian Renaissance, which renewed interest in Egyptian antiquity and exposed Egypt to <a href="../../wp/a/Age_of_Enlightenment.htm" title="Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> principals. Tahtawi co-founded with education reformer <!--del_lnk--> Ali Mubarak a native <!--del_lnk--> Egyptology school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars, such as <!--del_lnk--> Suyuti and <!--del_lnk--> Maqrizi, who themselves studied the <!--del_lnk--> history, <!--del_lnk--> language and <!--del_lnk--> antiquities of Egypt. Egypt&#39;s renaissance reached a peak through the work of people like <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Abduh, Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, <!--del_lnk--> Qasim Amin, <!--del_lnk--> Salama Moussa and <!--del_lnk--> Taha Hussein. They forged a <a href="../../wp/l/Liberalism.htm" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> path for Egypt expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, <!--del_lnk--> secularism and faith in science to bring progress.<p><a id="Arts" name="Arts"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Arts</span></h4>
      <p>The Egyptians were one of the first major civilizations to codify design elements in art. The wall paintings done in the service of the <!--del_lnk--> Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Modern and contemporary Egyptian art can be as diverse as any works in the world art scene. The <!--del_lnk--> Cairo Opera House serves as the main performing arts venue in the Egyptian capital. Egypt&#39;s media and arts industry has flourished since the late nineteenth century, today with more than thirty satellite channels and over one hundred motion pictures produced each year. Cairo in fact has long been known as the &quot;Hollywood of the Middle East.&quot; To bolster its media industry further, especially with the keen competition from the <!--del_lnk--> Persian Gulf Arab States and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, a large media city was built.

      <p><a href="../../wp/l/Literature.htm" title="Literature">Literature</a> constitutes an important cultural element in the life of Egypt. Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated throughout the Middle East. The first modern Egyptian novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Zaynab</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Muhammad Husayn Haykal was published in <!--del_lnk--> 1913 in the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian vernacular. Egyptian novelist <!--del_lnk--> Naguib Mahfouz was the first Arabic-language writer to win the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Literature. Egyptian women writers include <!--del_lnk--> Nawal El Saadawi, well known for her <!--del_lnk--> feminist <!--del_lnk--> activism, and <!--del_lnk--> Alifa Rifaat who also writes about women and tradition. Vernacular poetry is perhaps the most popular literary genre amongst Egyptians, represented by such luminaries as Ahmed Fuad Nigm (Fagumi), <!--del_lnk--> Salah Jaheen and <!--del_lnk--> Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi.<p><a id="Music" name="Music"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h4>

Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of people such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who influenced the later work of Egyptian music giants such as <!--del_lnk--> Sayed Darwish, <!--del_lnk--> Umm Kulthum, <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Abdel Wahab and <!--del_lnk--> Abdel Halim Hafez. From the 1970s onwards, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, while Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other festivities.<p><a id="Festivals" name="Festivals"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Festivals</span></h4>
      <p>Egypt is famous for its many festivals and religious carnivals, also known as <i>mulids</i>. They are usually associated with a particular <!--del_lnk--> Coptic or <!--del_lnk--> Sufi saint, but are often celebrated by all Egyptians irrespective of creed or religion. <!--del_lnk--> Ramadan has a special flavor in Egypt, celebrated with sounds, lights (local lanterns known as <i>fawanees</i>) and much flare that many Muslim tourists from the region flock to Egypt during Ramadan to witness the spectacle. The ancient spring festival of Sham en Nisim (<!--del_lnk--> Copto-<!--del_lnk--> Egyptian: <span class="Unicode">&#x3EC;&#x2CB1;&#x2C99;&lsquo;&#x2C9B;&#x2C9B;&#x2C93;&#x2CA5;&#x2C93;&#x2C99;</span> <i>shom en nisim</i>) has been celebrated by Egyptians for thousands of years, typically between the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian months of Baramouda (April) and Bashans (May) following Easter Sunday.<p><a id="Sports" name="Sports"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Sports</span></h4>
