      <p>England is <!--del_lnk--> named after the <!--del_lnk--> Angles (Old English genitive case, &quot;Engla&quot; - hence, Old English &quot;Engla Land&quot;), the largest of a number of <!--del_lnk--> Germanic tribes who settled in England in the 5th and 6th centuries, who are believed to have originated in <!--del_lnk--> Angeln, in modern-day northern <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>.<p>Their name has had a variety of different spellings. The earliest known reference to these people is under the name <b>Anglii</b> by Tacitus in chapter 40 of his <!--del_lnk--> Germania, written around <!--del_lnk--> 98. He gives no precise indication of their geographical position within <!--del_lnk--> Germania, but states that, together with six other tribes, they worshipped a goddess named Nerthus, whose sanctuary was situated on &quot;an island in the Ocean.&quot;<p>The terms <b>Angelfolc</b>, <b>Anglorum</b> and <b>Anglis</b> were all used by <a href="../../wp/b/Bede.htm" title="Bede">Bede</a> in <!--del_lnk--> <i>Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum</i> (<i>Ecclesiastical History of the English People</i>) when referring to England and the <!--del_lnk--> English people.<p>The origin of the word itself is uncertain. It may come directly from the Germanic god <!--del_lnk--> Ingwaz or Ingui, and the <!--del_lnk--> Ingvaeones federation of which the Angles were part.<p>When England was confederated in 802, it was under the Saxon King Egbert of Wessex. The capital was Winchester and the official language was the Late West Saxon dialect of Old English. The confederacy was otherwise dominated by Angles, however, so it bore the name &#39;Engla Land.&#39;<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>By AD 43, the time of the main Roman invasion of Britain, Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. Like other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans and their economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south.<p><a id="Anglo-Saxon_England" name="Anglo-Saxon_England"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Anglo-Saxon England</span></h3>

      <p>Originally, England (or Angleland) was a geographical term to describe the territory of Britain which was occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons, rather than a name of an individual <!--del_lnk--> nation state.<p>The Kingdom of England was not founded until the separate petty kingdoms were unified under <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> King of Wessex, who later proclaimed himself King of the English after liberating <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> from the <!--del_lnk--> Danes in <!--del_lnk--> 886.<p>For the next few hundred years, the Kingdom of England would fall in and out of power between several <a href="../../wp/w/Wessex.htm" title="Wessex">West-Saxon</a> and <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a> kings. For over half a century, the unified Kingdom of England became part of a vast Danish empire under <a href="../../wp/c/Canute_the_Great.htm" title="Canute the Great">Cnut</a>, before regaining independence for a short period under the restored West-Saxon lineage of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_the_Confessor.htm" title="Edward the Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>.<p>The Kingdom of England continued to exist as an independent nation-state right through to the <!--del_lnk--> Acts of Union and the <!--del_lnk--> Union of Crowns.

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/n/Norman_conquest_of_England.htm" title="Norman conquest of England">Norman conquest of England</a> was the conquest of the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England by <!--del_lnk--> William the Conqueror (<!--del_lnk--> Duke of Normandy), in 1066 at the <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Hastings.htm" title="Battle of Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a> and the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Norman control of England. It is an important watershed in English history for a number of reasons. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and lessened <!--del_lnk--> Scandinavian influence. The success of the conquest created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe, created the most sophisticated governmental system in Europe, changed the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> and culture, and set the stage for English-<a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> conflict that would last into the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>.<p>The events of the conquest also paved the way for a pivotal historical document to be produced - the <a href="../../wp/d/Domesday_Book.htm" title="Domesday Book">Domesday Book</a>. The Domesday Book was the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086, executed for William the Conqueror. The survey was similar to a census by a government of today and is England&#39;s earliest surviving public records publication.<p>The Norman conquest, to this day, remains the last successful military conquest of England.<h3> <span class="mw-headline">Great Britain and the United Kingdom</span></h3>
      <p>When the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England and the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Scotland merged to form the unified <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain under the <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1707, both England and Scotland lost their individual political, though not legal, identities. This union has subsequently changed its name twice: firstly on the merger with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Ireland following the <!--del_lnk--> Act of Union in <!--del_lnk--> 1800 creating the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in <!--del_lnk--> 1801, and then following the secession from the union of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State under the terms of the <!--del_lnk--> Government of Ireland Act 1920, the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Throughout these changes, England retained a separate legal identity from its partners, with a separate legal system from those in <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and eventually the strong feelings of the Welsh were acknowledged when it was decided that the name would henceforth be &quot;England and Wales&quot;. <a href="../../wp/w/Wales.htm" title="Wales">Wales</a> gained even more of an identity when, like <!--del_lnk--> Scotland, it gained its own department within the UK government, the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Office.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

      <p>There has not been a <!--del_lnk--> Government of England since <!--del_lnk--> 1707 when the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of England merged with the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Scotland to form the <!--del_lnk--> Kingdom of Great Britain, although both kingdoms had been ruled by a single monarch since 1603 under <a href="../../wp/j/James_I_of_England.htm" title="James I of England">James I</a>. Prior to the <a href="../../wp/a/Acts_of_Union_1707.htm" title="Acts of Union 1707">Acts of Union 1707</a>, England was ruled by a <!--del_lnk--> monarch and the <!--del_lnk--> Parliament of England.<p>The Scottish and Welsh governing institutions were created by the UK parliament along with strong support from the majority of people of Scotland and Wales, and are not yet independent of the rest of Britain. However, this gave each country a separate and distinct political identity, leaving England (83% of the UK population) as the only part of Britain directly ruled in nearly all matters by the British government in London. In Cornwall, a region of England claiming a distinct national identity, there has been a campaign for a <!--del_lnk--> Cornish assembly along Welsh lines by nationalist parties such as <!--del_lnk--> Mebyon Kernow.<p>Regarding parliamentary matters, a long-standing anomaly called the <!--del_lnk--> West Lothian question has come to the fore. Before Scottish devolution, purely-Scottish matters were debated at Westminster, but subject to a convention that only Scottish MPs could vote on them. The &quot;Question&quot; was that there was no &quot;reverse&quot; convention: Scottish MPs could and did vote on issues relating only to England and Wales. Welsh devolution has removed the anomaly for Wales, but not for England: Scottish and Welsh MPs can vote on English issues, but Scottish and Welsh issues are not debated at Westminster at all. This problem is exacerbated by an over-representation of Scottish MPs in the government, sometimes referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish mafia; as of September 2006, seven of the twenty-three <!--del_lnk--> Cabinet members are Scottish, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and Defence Secretary.<p>In terms of national administration, England&#39;s affairs are managed by a combination of the <!--del_lnk--> UK government, the UK parliament, a number of England-specific <!--del_lnk--> quangos, such as <!--del_lnk--> English Heritage, and the <!--del_lnk--> Regional Assemblies (a kind of nascent executive for each English Region).<p>There are calls for a <!--del_lnk--> devolved English Parliament, and some English people and parties go further by calling for the dissolution of the Union entirely. However, the approach favoured by the current <!--del_lnk--> Labour government was (on the basis that England is too large to be governed as a single sub-state entity) to propose the devolution of power to the <!--del_lnk--> Regions of England. <!--del_lnk--> Lord Falconer claimed a devolved English parliament would dwarf the rest of the United Kingdom. Referendums would decide whether people wanted to vote for directly-elected <!--del_lnk--> regional assemblies to watch over the work of the non-elected <!--del_lnk--> Regional Development Agencies.<p>During the campaign, a common criticism of the proposals was that England did not need &quot;another tier of bureaucracy&quot;. On the other hand, many said that they were not <!--del_lnk--> decentralising enough, and amounted not to devolution, but to little more than local government reorganisation, with no real power being removed from central government, and no real power given to the regions, which would not even gain the limited powers of the <!--del_lnk--> Welsh Assembly, much less the tax-varying and legislative powers of the <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Parliament (note: Welsh powers are now being expanded). They said that power was simply re-allocated within the region, with little new resource allocation and no real prospects of Assemblies being able to change the pattern of regional aid. Late in the process, responsibility for regional transport was added to the proposals. This was perhaps crucial in the North East, where resentment at the <!--del_lnk--> Barnett Formula, which delivers greater regional aid to adjacent <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, was a significant impetus for the North East devolution campaign. However, a <!--del_lnk--> referendum on this issue in <!--del_lnk--> North East England on <!--del_lnk--> 4 November <!--del_lnk--> 2004 rejected this proposal, and plans for referendums in other Regions (such as Yorkshire) were shelved.<p><a id="Subdivisions" name="Subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Subdivisions</span></h2>

      <p>Historically, the highest level of local government in England was the <!--del_lnk--> county. These divisions had emerged from a range of units of old, pre-unification England (such as the Kingdoms of <!--del_lnk--> Sussex and <!--del_lnk--> Kent) and further Mediaeval reorganisations (sometimes using <!--del_lnk--> duchies such as <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire and <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall). These <!--del_lnk--> historical county lines were usually drawn up before the <!--del_lnk--> industrial revolution and the mass urbanisation of England. The counties each had a <!--del_lnk--> county town and many county names were drawn from these (for example <!--del_lnk--> Nottinghamshire, from <a href="../../wp/n/Nottingham.htm" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>).<p>Since the latter part of the <!--del_lnk--> 19th Century there has been a series of local government reorganisations. The solution to the emergence of large urban areas was the creation of large <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan counties centred on cities (an example being <!--del_lnk--> Greater Manchester). In the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s reform of local government, there began the creation of <!--del_lnk--> unitary authorities, where <!--del_lnk--> districts gained the administrative status of a county. Today, there exists some confusion between the <!--del_lnk--> ceremonial counties (which do not necessarily form an administrative unit) and the <!--del_lnk--> metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties.<p><!--del_lnk--> Non-metropolitan counties (or &quot;shire counties&quot;) are divided into one or more <!--del_lnk--> districts. At the very lowest level, England is divided into <!--del_lnk--> parishes, though these are not to be found everywhere (many urban areas for example are <!--del_lnk--> unparished). Parishes are prohibited from existing in Greater London.<p>England is now also divided into <!--del_lnk--> 9 regions, which do not have an elected authority and exist to co-ordinate certain local government functions across a wider area. <!--del_lnk--> London is a special case, and is the one region which currently has a representative <!--del_lnk--> authority as well as a directly elected <!--del_lnk--> mayor. The 32 <!--del_lnk--> London boroughs and the <!--del_lnk--> Corporation of London remain the local form of government in the city.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>England is both the most populous and the most ethnically diverse nation in the United Kingdom with 50,431,700 inhabitants, or 83.8% of the UK&#39;s total. This would make England the 25th largest <!--del_lnk--> country by population if it were a sovereign state. The 2001 census records roughly around 9% of England&#39;s inhabitants as being non-white in origin. The country&#39;s population is &#39;ageing&#39;, with a declining percentage of the population under age 16 and a rising one of over 65. Population continues to rise and in every year since 1901, with the exception of 1976, there have been more births than deaths. England is one of the most densely populated countries in Europe, with 383 people per square kilometre, making it second only to the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>.<p>There is a debate over the extent to which the population of England (and indeed that of <!--del_lnk--> Britain as a whole) is composed of long-standing indigenous stock or descended from various groups of settlers and immigrants who have arrived over millennia.

      <p>As its name suggests, the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, today spoken by hundreds of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue today (although not officially designated as such). An <!--del_lnk--> Indo-European language in the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Frisian branch of the <!--del_lnk--> Germanic family, it is closely related to <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Frisian. As the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms merged into England, &quot;<a href="../../wp/o/Old_English_language.htm" title="Old English language">Old English</a>&quot; emerged; some of its literature and poetry has survived.<p>Used by aristocracy and commoners alike before the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest (1066), English was displaced in cultured contexts under the new regime by the <!--del_lnk--> Norman French language of the new Anglo-French aristocracy. Its use was confined primarily to the lower social classes while official business was conducted in a mixture of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> and French. Over the following centuries, however, English gradually came back into fashion among all classes and for all official business except certain traditional ceremonies, some of which survive to this day. But <!--del_lnk--> Middle English, as it had by now become, showed many signs of French influence, both in vocabulary and spelling. During the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, many words were coined from <!--del_lnk--> Latin and <!--del_lnk--> Greek origins; and more recent years, <!--del_lnk--> Modern English has extended this custom, being always remarkable for its far-flung willingness to incorporate foreign-influenced words.<p>It is most commonly accepted that because of the legacy and impact of the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a> is now the <!--del_lnk--> world&#39;s unofficial <!--del_lnk--> lingua franca, while <!--del_lnk--> English common law is also the foundation of legal systems throughout the English-speaking countries of the world.<p><a id="Additional_languages" name="Additional_languages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Additional languages</span></h3>
      <p>British law does not recognise any language as being official, but <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the only language used in England for general official business. The other national languages of the UK (<!--del_lnk--> Welsh, <!--del_lnk--> Irish and <!--del_lnk--> Scottish Gaelic) are confined to their respective nations, and only Welsh is treated by law as an equal to English (and then only for organisations which do business in Wales).<p>The only non-<!--del_lnk--> Anglic native spoken language in England is the <!--del_lnk--> Cornish language, a <!--del_lnk--> Celtic language spoken in <!--del_lnk--> Cornwall, which became extinct in the nineteenth century but has been revived and is spoken in various degrees of fluency, currently by around 2000 people. This has no official status (unlike Welsh) and is not required for official use, but is nonetheless supported by national and local government under the <!--del_lnk--> European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Cornwall County Council has produced a draft strategy to develop these plans. There is, however, no programme as yet for public bodies to actively promote the language. <a href="../../wp/s/Scots_language.htm" title="Scots language">Scots</a> is spoken by some adjacent to the Anglo-Scottish Border, and <!--del_lnk--> Welsh is still spoken by some natives around Oswestry, Shropshire, on the Welsh border.<p>Most <!--del_lnk--> deaf people within England speak <!--del_lnk--> British sign language (BSL), a <!--del_lnk--> sign language native to Britain. The <!--del_lnk--> British Deaf Association estimates that 250,000 people throughout the UK speak BSL as their first or preferred language, but does not give statistics specific to England. Unlike Cornish, BSL is an official language of the UK  although most British government departments and hospitals have limited facilities for deaf people. The <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> broadcasts several of its programmes with BSL interpreters.<p>Different languages from around the world, especially from the former <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Nations, have been brought to England by immigrants. Many of these are widely spoken within ethnic minority communities, with <!--del_lnk--> Hindi, <!--del_lnk--> Bengali, <!--del_lnk--> Punjabi, <!--del_lnk--> Urdu, <!--del_lnk--> Polish, <!--del_lnk--> Greek, <!--del_lnk--> Turkish and <!--del_lnk--> Cantonese being the most common languages that people living in Britain consider their <i><!--del_lnk--> first language</i>. These are often used by official bodies to communicate with the relevant sections of the community, particularly in big cities, but this occurs on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis rather than as the result of specific legislative ordinances.<p>Other languages have also traditionally been spoken by minority populations in England, including <!--del_lnk--> Romany.<p>Despite the relatively small size of the nation, there are a many distinct <!--del_lnk--> English regional accents. Those with particularly strong accents may not be easily understood elsewhere in the country. Use of foreign non-standard varieties of English (such as <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean English) is also increasingly widespread, mainly because of the effects of immigration and post-colonialism.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>

In <!--del_lnk--> 1536, the Church was split from Rome over the issue of the divorce of <!--del_lnk--> King Henry VIII from Catherine of Aragon.

      <p>As an ethnic group, the English trace their heritage to the Romano-Britons, Anglo-Saxons, the Danish-Vikings that formed the Danelaw during the time of <a href="../../wp/a/Alfred_the_Great.htm" title="Alfred the Great">Alfred the Great</a> and the Normans.<p>Regardless of ethnic connotations, the simplest view is that an English person is someone who is from England and holds British nationality, regardless of his or her racial origin. It has, however, been a notoriously complicated, emotive and controversial identity to delimit.<p>Centuries of English dominance within the United Kingdom has created a situation where to be English is, as a <a href="../../wp/l/Linguistics.htm" title="Linguistics">linguist</a> would put it, an &quot;unmarked&quot; state. The English frequently include their neighbours in the wider term of &quot;British&quot;, while the Scots and Welsh tend to be more forward about referring to themselves by one of those more specific terms. This reflects a more subtle form of English-specific <!--del_lnk--> patriotism in England; <!--del_lnk--> St George&#39;s Day, the country&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> national day, is barely celebrated.<p>It is believed amongst English nationalist circles that the &#39;natural culture&#39; of England is comprised of legacies of <!--del_lnk--> Brythonic tribes of Celts and <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxons appearing in waves of gradual migration. It also is seen as being influenced by the Scandinavian legends such as <!--del_lnk--> Beowulf, and by the <!--del_lnk--> Norman Conquest. The <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a common early location for English identity.<p>Modern celebration of English identity is often found around its sports, one field in which the British <!--del_lnk--> Home Nations often compete individually. The English <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">Association football</a> <!--del_lnk--> team, <!--del_lnk--> Rugby Union team and <!--del_lnk--> Cricket team often cause increases in the popularity of celebrating Englishness.<p>According to research and the analysis of names in Britain in 2006, the town of <!--del_lnk--> Ripley in <!--del_lnk--> Derbyshire has the highest proportion of people of ethnic-English origin. The analysis put 42.2 million adult voters in mainland Britain into 200 ethnic groups, based on both given names and surnames.

      <p>The St George&#39;s Cross is a red cross on a white background. It is the official <!--del_lnk--> national flag of England. In the past it was rarely seen flying, but in recent times has experienced an increase in popularity. It is believed to have been adopted for the uniform of English soldiers during the <a href="../../wp/c/Crusades.htm" title="Crusades">Crusades</a> of the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries. From about <!--del_lnk--> 1277 it officially became the national flag of England. St George&#39;s Cross was originally the flag of <a href="../../wp/g/Genoa.htm" title="Genoa">Genoa</a> and was adopted by England and the City of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the powerful Genoese fleet. The maritime <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Genoa was rising and going to become, together with its rival <!--del_lnk--> Venice, one of the most important powers in the world. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the <!--del_lnk--> Doge of Genoa for this privilege. The cross of St George would become the official <!--del_lnk--> Flag of England.<p>A red cross acted as a symbol for many <!--del_lnk--> Crusaders in the 12th and 13th centuries. It became associated with <!--del_lnk--> St George and England, along with other countries and cities (such as <a href="../../wp/g/Georgia_%2528country%2529.htm" title="Georgia (country)">Georgia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Milan.htm" title="Milan">Milan</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Genoa), which claimed him as their <!--del_lnk--> patron saint and used his cross as a banner. It remained in national use until 1707, when the <!--del_lnk--> Union Jack (more properly known as the Union Flag, except when used at sea) which English and Scottish ships had used at sea since 1606, was adopted for all purposes to unite the whole of Great Britain under a common flag. The flag of England no longer has much of an official role, but it is widely flown by <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_England.htm" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> properties and at sporting events. The Flag of St. George has gained popularity in recent years, and is widely seen flown out of houses, or on cars during important football tournaments in which England is competing. (Paradoxically, the latter is a fairly recent development; until the late 20th century, it was commonplace for fans of English teams to wave the Union Flag, rather than the St George&#39;s Cross).<p><a id="Three_Lions" name="Three_Lions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Three Lions</span></h3>

However, the arms of both the <!--del_lnk--> Football Association and the <!--del_lnk--> England and Wales Cricket Board are based on the three lions design.

Education is the responsibility of <!--del_lnk--> Department for Education and Skills at national level and, in the case of publicly funded compulsory education, of Local Education Authorities.
