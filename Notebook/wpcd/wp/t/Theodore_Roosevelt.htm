      <p><b>Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt, Jr.</b>, (<!--del_lnk--> October 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1858 &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1919), also known as <b>T.R.</b> and to the public (but never to friends and intimates) as <b>Teddy</b>. Per Roosevelt, himself, his last name is pronounced &quot;Rosavelt.&quot;  He was the 26th <a href="../../wp/p/President_of_the_United_States.htm" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>, and a leader of the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party and of the <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Movement. He served in many roles including <!--del_lnk--> Governor of <!--del_lnk--> New York, historian, naturalist, explorer, author, and soldier. Roosevelt is most famous for his personality: his energy, his vast range of interests and achievements, his model of masculinity, and his &quot;cowboy&rdquo; persona.<p>As Assistant Secretary of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Navy, he prepared for and advocated war with Spain in 1898. He organized and helped command the <!--del_lnk--> 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the <!--del_lnk--> Rough Riders, during the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish-American War. Returning to New York as a war hero, he was elected Republican governor in 1898. He was a professional historian, a lawyer, a naturalist and explorer of the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_Basin.htm" title="Amazon Basin">Amazon Basin</a>; his 35 books include works on outdoor life, natural history, the American frontier, political history, naval history, and his autobiography.<p>In 1901, as Vice President, Roosevelt succeeded President <a href="../../wp/w/William_McKinley.htm" title="William McKinley">William McKinley</a> after an assassination. Roosevelt was a <!--del_lnk--> Progressive reformer who sought to move the dominant Republican Party into the Progressive camp. He distrusted wealthy businessmen and dissolved 40 monopolistic corporations as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> trust buster.&quot; He was clear, however, to show that he did not disagree with trusts and capitalism in principle but was only against their corrupt, illegal practices. His &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Square Deal&quot; promised a fair shake for both the average citizen, including regulation of railroad rates and pure foods and drugs, and the businessmen. As an outdoorsman, he promoted the conservation movement, emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. After 1906, he moved left, attacking big business and suggesting the courts were biased against <!--del_lnk--> labor unions. In 1910, he broke with his friend and anointed successor <a href="../../wp/w/William_Howard_Taft.htm" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, but lost the Republican nomination to Taft and ran in the 1912 <!--del_lnk--> election on his own one-time <!--del_lnk--> Bull Moose ticket. Roosevelt lost but pulled so many Progressives out of the Republican Party that Democrat <a href="../../wp/w/Woodrow_Wilson.htm" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> won in 1912, and the conservative faction took control of the Republican Party for the next two decades.<p>Roosevelt understood the strategic significance of the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, and negotiated for the U.S. to take control of its construction in 1904; he felt that the Canal&#39;s completion was his most important and historically significant international achievement. He was the first American to be awarded the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize, winning its <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Peace Prize</a> in 1906, for negotiating the peace in the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War.<p>Historian Thomas Bailey, who disagreed with Roosevelt&#39;s policies, nevertheless concluded, &quot;Roosevelt was a great personality, a great activist, a great preacher of the moralities, a great controversialist, a great showman. He dominated his era as he dominated conversations....the masses loved him; he proved to be a great popular idol and a great vote getter.&quot; His image stands alongside <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">Washington</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Jefferson</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Lincoln</a> on <a href="../../wp/m/Mount_Rushmore.htm" title="Mount Rushmore">Mount Rushmore</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Surveys of scholars have consistently ranked him from #3 to #7 on the list of greatest American presidents.<script type="text/javascript">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Roosevelt was born at <!--del_lnk--> 28 East 20th Street in the modern-day <!--del_lnk--> Lemming section of <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1858, the second of four children of <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Roosevelt, Sr. (1831&ndash;1877) and <!--del_lnk--> Mittie Bulloch (1834&ndash;1884). He had an elder sister <!--del_lnk--> Anna, nicknamed &quot;Bamie&quot; as a child and &quot;Bye&quot; as an adult for being always on the go; and two younger siblings &mdash; his brother <!--del_lnk--> Elliott (the father of <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Roosevelt) and his sister <!--del_lnk--> Corinne, (grandmother of <a href="../../wp/n/Newspaper.htm" title="Newspaper">newspaper</a> columnists, <!--del_lnk--> Joseph and <!--del_lnk--> Stewart Alsop).<p>The Roosevelts had been in New York since the mid 17th century and had grown with the emerging New York commerce class after the <!--del_lnk--> American Revolution. By the 18th Century, the family had grown in wealth, power and influence from the profits of several businesses including hardware and plate-glass importing. The family was strongly <!--del_lnk--> Democratic in its political affiliation until the mid-1850s, then joined the new <!--del_lnk--> Republican Party. Theodore&#39;s father, known in the family as &quot;Thee&quot;, was a New York City philanthropist, merchant, and partner in the family glass-importing firm <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt and Son. He was a prominent supporter of <a href="../../wp/a/Abraham_Lincoln.htm" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and the Union effort during the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. Theodore&#39;s mother Mittie Bulloch was a Southern belle from a slave-owning family in <!--del_lnk--> Savannah, Georgia and had quiet Confederate sympathies. Mittie&#39;s brother, Theodore&#39;s uncle, <!--del_lnk--> James Dunwoody Bulloch, &quot;Uncle Jimmy&quot;, was a U.S. Navy officer who became a Confederate admiral and naval procurement agent in Britain. Another uncle <!--del_lnk--> Irvine Bulloch was a midshipman on the Confederate raider, <!--del_lnk--> CSS <i>Alabama</i>; both remained in England after the war.<p>Sickly and <a href="../../wp/a/Asthma.htm" title="Asthma">asthmatic</a> as a youngster, Roosevelt had to sleep propped up in bed or slouching in a chair during much of his early childhood, and had frequent ailments. Despite his illnesses, he was a hyperactive and often mischievous young man. His lifelong interest in <!--del_lnk--> zoology was formed at age seven upon seeing a dead <!--del_lnk--> seal at a local market. After obtaining the seal&#39;s head, the young Roosevelt and two of his cousins formed what they called the &quot;Roosevelt Museum of Natural History&quot;. Learning the rudiments of <!--del_lnk--> taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with many animals that he killed or caught, studied, and prepared for display. At age nine, he codified his observation of insects with a paper titled &quot;The Natural History of Insects&quot;.<p>To combat his poor physical condition, his father compelled the young Roosevelt to take up exercise. To deal with bullies, Roosevelt started <!--del_lnk--> boxing lessons. Two trips abroad had a permanent impact: family tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and of the Middle East 1872 to 1873.<p><!--del_lnk--> Theodore Sr. had a tremendous influence on young Theodore and was a life-long source of inspiration. Of him Roosevelt wrote, &quot;My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.&quot; Roosevelt&#39;s sister later wrote, &quot;He told me frequently that he never took any serious step or made any vital decision for his country without thinking first what position his father would have taken.&quot;<p>Young &quot;Teedie&quot;, as he was nicknamed as a child, (the nickname &quot;Teddy&quot; was from his first wife, and he later harbored an intense dislike for it) was mostly home schooled by tutors and his parents. A leading biographer says: &quot;The most obvious drawback to the home schooling Roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge.&quot; He was solid in geography (thanks to his careful observations on all his travels) and very well read in history, strong in biology, French and German, but deficient in mathematics, Latin and Greek. He matriculated at <!--del_lnk--> Harvard College in 1876, graduating <!--del_lnk--> magna cum laude. His father&#39;s death in 1878 was a tremendous blow, but Roosevelt redoubled his activities. He did well in science, philosophy and rhetoric courses but fared poorly in Latin and Greek. He studied biology with great interest and indeed was already an accomplished naturalist and published <!--del_lnk--> ornithologist. He had a photographic memory and developed a life-long habit of devouring books, memorizing every detail. He was an unusually eloquent conversationalist who, throughout his life, sought out the company of the smartest men and women. He could multitask in extraordinary fashion, dictating letters to one secretary and memoranda to another, while browsing through a new book. During his adulthood, a visitor would get a not-so-subtle hint that Roosevelt was losing interest in the conversation when he would pick up a book and begin looking at it now and then as the conversation continued.<p>While at Harvard, Roosevelt was active in numerous clubs, including the <!--del_lnk--> Alpha Delta Phi and <!--del_lnk--> Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternities. He also edited a student magazine. He was runner-up in the Harvard boxing championship, losing to <!--del_lnk--> C.S. Hanks. The sportsmanship Roosevelt showed in that fight was long remembered. Upon graduating from Harvard, Roosevelt underwent a physical examination and his doctor advised him that due to serious heart problems, he should find a desk job and avoid strenuous activity. Roosevelt disregarded the advice and chose to embrace the strenuous life instead.<p>He graduated <!--del_lnk--> Phi Beta Kappa and <i>magna cum laude</i> (22nd of 177) from Harvard in 1880, and entered <!--del_lnk--> Columbia Law School. When offered a chance to run for <!--del_lnk--> New York Assemblyman in 1881, he dropped out of law school to pursue his new goal of entering public life.<p><a id="Early_public_life" name="Early_public_life"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Early public life</span></h3>

      <p>Roosevelt was a <!--del_lnk--> Republican activist during his years in the Assembly, writing more bills than any other New York state legislator. Already a major player in state politics, he attended the Republican National Convention in 1884 and fought alongside the <!--del_lnk--> Mugwump reformers; they lost to the Stalwart faction that nominated <!--del_lnk--> James G. Blaine. Refusing to join other Mugwumps in supporting Democrat <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic nominee, he stayed loyal <a id="First_marriage" name="First_marriage"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">First marriage</span></h3>
      <p>On his 22nd birthday, Roosevelt married his first wife, 19-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Alice Hathaway Lee, on <!--del_lnk--> October 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1880, at the Unitarian Church in <!--del_lnk--> Brookline, Massachusetts. Alice was the daughter of the prominent banker <!--del_lnk--> George Cabot Lee and Caroline Haskell Lee. The couple first met in 1878. He proposed in June 1879. However, Alice waited another six months before accepting the proposal. They announced their engagement on <!--del_lnk--> Valentine&#39;s Day 1880. Alice Roosevelt died exactly four years later, only two days after the birth of their first child, also named <!--del_lnk--> Alice. In a tragic coincidence, Roosevelt&#39;s mother died of <!--del_lnk--> typhoid fever on the same day, also at the Roosevelt family home in Manhattan.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Although he noted her loss in his diary and made several references to her in the subsequent months, from the next year on Roosevelt refused to speak his first wife&#39;s name again (even omitting her name from his autobiography) and did not allow others to speak of her in his presence. With his daughter, Alice, the siblings were taught to call her &quot;sister,&quot; and Alice&#39;s half-brother Ted, Jr. would have to ask &quot;has anyone seen sister this morning?&quot;<p>This practice put an early strain on his relationship with his daughter who was given his late wife&#39;s name. However, as she grew into adulthood and better understood her father&#39;s deep moral convictions, the bond between them became strong. Alice continued to support her father&#39;s ideas after his death in 1919.<p>Later that year, Roosevelt left the General Assembly and his infant daughter Alice, whom he had left in the long-term care of his older sister, <!--del_lnk--> Bamie. In letters to Bamie, he would refer to Alice as Baby Lee. Roosevelt moved to his <!--del_lnk--> Maltese Cross ranch seven miles from <!--del_lnk--> Medora in the <!--del_lnk--> Badlands of the <!--del_lnk--> Dakota Territory to live a more simple life as a rancher and lawman.<p><a id="Life_in_Badlands" name="Life_in_Badlands"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Life in Badlands</span></h3>

      <p>Roosevelt built a second ranch he named Elk Horn thirty five miles north of the boomtown, <!--del_lnk--> Medora, North Dakota. On the banks of the &quot;Little Missouri&quot;, Roosevelt learned to ride, rope, and hunt. There, in the waning days of the <!--del_lnk--> American Old West, he rebuilt his life and began writing about frontier life for Eastern magazines. As a deputy sheriff, Roosevelt hunted down three outlaws who stole his river boat and were escaping north with it up the <!--del_lnk--> Little Missouri River. Capturing them, he decided against hanging them and sending his foreman back by boat, he took the thieves back overland for trial in <!--del_lnk--> Dickinson, guarding them forty hours without sleep and reading Tolstoy to keep himself awake. When he ran out of his own books he read a dime store western that one of the thieves was carrying.<p>While working on a tough project aimed at hunting down a group of relentless horse thieves, Roosevelt came across the famous <!--del_lnk--> Deadwood, South Dakota <!--del_lnk--> Sheriff <!--del_lnk--> Seth Bullock. The two would remain friends for life. (Morris, Rise of, 241-245, 247-250)<p>After the 1886-1887 winter wiped out his herd of cattle and his $60,000 investment (together with those of his competitors), he returned to the East, where in 1885, he had purchased <i><!--del_lnk--> Sagamore Hill</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Oyster Bay, New York. It would be his home and estate until his death. Roosevelt ran as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City in 1886 as &quot;The Cowboy of the Dakotas&quot; to assert his manliness. Despite his change of image, he still came in third.<p><a id="Second_Marriage" name="Second_Marriage"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Second Marriage</span></h3>
      <p>Following the election, he went to London in 1886 and married his childhood sweetheart, <!--del_lnk--> Edith Kermit Carow. They honeymooned in Europe, and Roosevelt climbed <!--del_lnk--> Mont Blanc, leading only the third recorded expedition to reach the summit, a feat which resulted in his induction into the <!--del_lnk--> British Royal Society. They had five children: <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Jr., <!--del_lnk--> Kermit, <!--del_lnk--> Ethel Carow, <!--del_lnk--> Archibald Bulloch &quot;Archie&quot;, and <!--del_lnk--> Quentin. &quot;Uncle Ted&quot; was the godfather and favorite uncle of <!--del_lnk--> Eleanor Roosevelt, whom he gave away in marriage to their fifth cousin <a href="../../wp/f/Franklin_D._Roosevelt.htm" title="Franklin D.

      <p>In the 1880s, he gained recognition as a serious historian. His <i>The Naval War of 1812</i> (1882) was the standard history for two generations. For that book, Roosevelt undertook extensive and original research going as far as computing British and American <!--del_lnk--> man-of-war <!--del_lnk--> broadside throw weights. As recently as <!--del_lnk--> 2006, no less than three American books on the birth of the US Navy and the War of 1812, quote from and comment extensively on Roosevelt&#39;s book.<p>By comparison, however, his hastily-written biographies of <i><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Hart Benton</i> (1887) and <i><!--del_lnk--> Governor Morris</i> (1888) are considered superficial. His major achievement was a four-volume history of the frontier, <i>The Winning of the West</i> (1889-1896), which had a notable impact on <!--del_lnk--> historiography as it presented a highly original version of the <!--del_lnk--> frontier thesis elaborated upon in 1893 by his friend <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Jackson Turner. Roosevelt argued that the harsh frontier conditions had created a new &quot;race&quot; or people--the American people. He was using a <!--del_lnk--> Lamarkean model in which new environmental conditions allow a new species to form. His many articles in upscale magazines provided a much-needed income, as well as cementing a reputation as a major national intellectual. He was later chosen president of the Uninted States <!--del_lnk--> American Historical Association<p><a id="Return_to_public_life" name="Return_to_public_life"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Return to public life</span></h2>

      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1888 presidential election, Roosevelt campaigned for <a href="../../wp/b/Benjamin_Harrison.htm" title="Benjamin Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> in the Midwest. President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the <!--del_lnk--> United States Civil Service Commission, where he served until 1895. In his term, he vigorously fought the <!--del_lnk--> spoilsmen and demanded the enforcement of civil service laws. In spite of Roosevelt&#39;s support for Harrison&#39;s reelection bid in the <!--del_lnk--> presidential election of 1892, the eventual winner, <a href="../../wp/g/Grover_Cleveland.htm" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> (a <!--del_lnk--> Bourbon Democrat), reappointed him to the same post.<p>In 1895, he became president of the New York City Board of <!--del_lnk--> Police Commissioners. During the two years that he held this post, Roosevelt radically changed the way a police department was run. The police force was reputed as one of the most corrupt forces in America. NYPD&#39;s history division records that Roosevelt was, &quot;an iron-willed leader of unimpeachable honesty, (who) brought a reforming zeal to the New York City Police Commission in 1895.&quot; Roosevelt and his fellow commissioners established new disciplinary rules, created a bicycle squad to police New York&#39;s traffic problems and implemented standardized 32 calibre pistol practice. Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms, annual physical exams, appointed 1,600 new recruits appointed not on the basis of political affiliation but solely for their physical and mental qualifications, opened admission to the department to ethnic minorities and women, established the first police meritorious service medals, shut down the corrupt police hostelries, and a Municipal Lodging House was established by the Board of Charities. Roosevelt required his officers to be registered with the Board. He also had telephones installed in station houses. Always an energetic man, he made a habit of walking officers&#39; beats late at night and early in the morning to make sure that they were on duty. He became caught up in public disagreements with commissioner Parker, who sought to negate or delay the promotion of many officers put forward by Roosevelt.<p><a id="Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy" name="Assistant_Secretary_of_the_Navy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</span></h3>

      <p>Upon the declaration of war in 1898 that would be known as the Spanish-American War, Roosevelt resigned from the Navy Department and, with the aid of U.S. Army Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Leonard Wood, organized the <!--del_lnk--> First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment out of a diverse crew that ranged from <!--del_lnk--> cowboys from the Western territories to <!--del_lnk--> Ivy League friends from New York. The newspapers called them the &quot;Rough Riders.&quot; Originally Roosevelt held the rank of <!--del_lnk--> Lieutenant Colonel and served under Colonel Wood, but after Wood was promoted to <!--del_lnk--> Brigadier General of Volunteer Forces, Roosevelt was promoted to Colonel and given command of the Regiment.<p>Under his leadership, the <!--del_lnk--> Rough Riders became famous for their dual charges up <!--del_lnk--> Kettle Hill and <!--del_lnk--> San Juan Hill in July 1898 (the battle was named after the latter hill). Out of all the Rough Riders, Roosevelt was the only one who had a horse, and was forced to dismount and walk up Kettle Hill on foot after his horse, Little Texas, became tired. Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the <a href="../../wp/m/Medal_of_Honor.htm" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honour</a> in 2001 for his actions.

      <p>On leaving the Army, Roosevelt re-entered New York state politics and was elected governor of New York in 1898 on the Republican ticket. He made such a concerted effort to root out corruption and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> machine politics&quot; that Republican boss <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Collier Platt forced him on McKinley as a running mate in <!--del_lnk--> the 1900 election, against the wishes of McKinley&#39;s manager Senator <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hanna. Roosevelt was a powerful campaign asset for the Republican ticket, which defeated <!--del_lnk--> William Jennings Bryan in a landslide based on restoration of prosperity at home and a successful war and new prestige abroad. Bryan stumped for Free Silver again, but McKinley&#39;s promise of prosperity through the Gold Standard, high tariffs, and the restoration of business confidence proved far more attractive to voters and he enlarged his margin of victory. Bryan had strongly supported the war against Spain, but denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism that would spoil America&#39;s innocence. Roosevelt countered with many speeches that argued it was best for the Filipinos to have stability, and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. Roosevelt&#39;s few months as Vice President (March to September, 1901) were uneventful.<p><a id="Presidency_1901-1909" name="Presidency_1901-1909"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Presidency 1901-1909</span></h2>

Vice President Roosevelt had been delivering a speech in Vermont when he got word of McKinley&#39;s shooting.

Wilcox would recall that &quot;the family and most of the household were in the country, but he [Roosevelt] was offered a quiet place to sleep and eat, and accepted it.&quot; Roosevelt took the oath of office in the <!--del_lnk--> Ansley Wilcox House at <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo, New York borrowing Wilcox&#39;s morning coat. Roosevelt did not swear on the <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Bible</a> nor on any other book, making him unique among presidents. <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hanna lamented that &quot;that damned cowboy is president now,&quot; giving expression to the fears of many old line Republicans. Roosevelt was the youngest person to assume the presidency, at 42, and he promised to continue McKinley&#39;s cabinet and his basic policies. Roosevelt did so, but after reelection in 1904, he moved to the political left, stretching his ties to the Republican Party&#39;s conservative leaders.<p><a id="Anthracite_coal_strike_of_1902" name="Anthracite_coal_strike_of_1902"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Anthracite coal strike of 1902</span></h3>

      <p>A national emergency was averted in 1902 when Roosevelt found a compromise to the anthracite coal strike by the <!--del_lnk--> United Mine Workers of America that threatened the heating supplies of most urban homes. Roosevelt called the mine owners and the labor leaders to the White House and negotiated a compromise. Miners were on strike for 163 days before it ended; they were granted a 10% pay increase and a 9-hour day (from the previous 10 hours), but the union was not officially recognized and the price of coal went up.<p><a id="Square_Deal" name="Square_Deal"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Square Deal</span></h3>
      <p>Theodore Roosevelt promised to continue McKinley&#39;s program, and at first he worked closely with McKinley&#39;s men. His 20,000-word address to the Congress in December 1901, asked Congress to curb the power of <!--del_lnk--> trusts &quot;within reasonable limits.&quot; They did not act but Roosevelt did, issuing 44 lawsuits against major corporations; he was called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> trust-buster.&quot;<p><!--del_lnk--> Mark Hanna was the rival power in the Republican party. Hanna died, and Roosevelt had an easy renomination and reelection in <!--del_lnk--> 1904. He won 336 of 476 <!--del_lnk--> electoral votes, and 56.4% of the total popular vote. He therefore became the first President who came into office due to the death of his predecessor to be elected in his own right.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Building on McKinley&#39;s effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the centre of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities.

      <p>Roosevelt firmly believed: &quot;The Government must in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the railways engaged in interstate commerce.&quot; Inaction was a danger, he argued: &quot;Such increased supervision is the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one hand or a still more radical policy on the other.&quot; His biggest success was passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Hepburn Act of 1906, granting the <!--del_lnk--> Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to set maximum railroad rates; it also stopped free passes given to friends of the railroad. At that time it was universally assumed that railroads would continue to be a vast and powerful force. No one dreamed they would eventually be challenged by truck and automobile traffic, and hence struggle to survive under the provisions of the Hepburn Act designed to protect merchants and consumers.<p>In response to public clamor, Roosevelt pushed Congress to pass the <!--del_lnk--> Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, as well as the <!--del_lnk--> Meat Inspection Act of 1906. These laws provided for labeling of foods and drugs, inspection of livestock and mandated sanitary conditions at meatpacking plants. Congress replaced Roosevelt&#39;s proposals with a version supported by the major meatpackers who worried about the overseas markets, and did not want small unsanitary plants undercutting their domestic market.<p><a id="Conservationist" name="Conservationist"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Conservationist</span></h3>

      <p>Roosevelt was the first American president to consider the long-term needs for efficient conservation of national resources, winning the support of fellow hunters and fishermen to bolster his political base. Roosevelt was the last trained observer to ever see a <!--del_lnk--> passenger pigeon, and on <!--del_lnk--> March 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1903, Roosevelt created the first National Bird Preserve, (the beginning of the Wildlife Refuge system), on Pelican Island, <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Assuming the <!--del_lnk--> conservationist role was a natural step for him, and he decided that it was overdue to put the issue high on the national agenda. He worked with all the major figures of the movement, especially his chief advisor on the matter <!--del_lnk--> Gifford Pinchot. Roosevelt urged congress to establish the <!--del_lnk--> United States Forest Service (1905), to manage government forest lands, and he appointed Gifford Pinchot to head the service. Roosevelt set aside more land for <!--del_lnk--> national parks and <!--del_lnk--> nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined, 194 million acres. In all, by 1909, the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres of <!--del_lnk--> national forests, 53 <!--del_lnk--> national wildlife refuges and 18 areas of &quot;special interest&quot;, including the <a href="../../wp/g/Grand_Canyon.htm" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. This environmental record was unequaled until President <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>&#39;s term, 90 years later. The <!--del_lnk--> Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the <!--del_lnk--> Badlands commemorates his conservationist philosophy. In 1903, Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with <!--del_lnk--> John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, but he rejected Muir&#39;s philosophy that privileged nature, and emphasized instead the more efficient use of nature. In 1907, with Congress about to block him, Roosevelt hurried to designate 16 million acres (65,000 km&sup2;) of new national forests. In May 1908, he sponsored the <!--del_lnk--> Conference of Governors held in the White House, with a focus on the most efficient planning, analysis and use of water, forests and other natural resources. Roosevelt explained, &quot;There is an intimate relation between our streams and the development and conservation of all the other great permanent sources of wealth.&quot; During his presidency, Roosevelt promoted the nascent conservation movement in essays for <i><!--del_lnk--> Outdoor Life</i> magazine. Roosevelt, like Pinchot (but unlike Muir), believed in the more efficient use of natural resources by corporations like lumber companies. To Roosevelt, conservation meant more and better usage and less waste, and a long-term perspective.<div class="thumb tleft">
      </div>
      <p>Roosevelt&#39;s conservationist leanings also impelled him to preserve national sites of scientific, particularly <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeological</a>, interest. The 1906 passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Antiquities Act gave him a tool for creating <!--del_lnk--> national monuments by presidential proclamation, without requiring Congressional approval for each monument on an item-by-item basis. The language of the Antiquities Act specifically called for the preservation of &quot;historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest,&quot; and was primarily construed by its creator, Congressman <!--del_lnk--> James F. Lacey (assisted by the prominent archaeologist <!--del_lnk--> Edgar Lee Hewett), as targeting the prehistoric ruins of the American Southwest. Roosevelt, however, applied a typically broad interpretation to the Act, and the first national monument he proclaimed, <!--del_lnk--> Devils Tower National Monument in <!--del_lnk--> Wyoming, was preserved for reasons tied more to <a href="../../wp/g/Geology.htm" title="Geology">geology</a> than archaeology.<p><a id="Foreign_policy" name="Foreign_policy"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Foreign policy</span></h3>
      <p>Roosevelt&#39;s administration was marked by an active approach to foreign policy. Roosevelt saw it as the duty of more developed (&quot;civilized&quot;) nations to help the underdeveloped (&quot;uncivilized&quot;) world move forward. In <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Panama Canal Zone, he used the Army&#39;s medical service, under <!--del_lnk--> Walter Reed and <!--del_lnk--> William C. Gorgas, to eliminate the <a href="../../wp/y/Yellow_fever.htm" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a> menace and install a new regime of public health. He used the army to build up the infrastructure of the new possessions, building railways, telegraph and telephone lines, and upgrading roads and port facilities.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Roosevelt dramatically increased the size of the navy, forming the <!--del_lnk--> Great White Fleet, which toured the world in 1907. Roosevelt also added the <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt Corollary to the <!--del_lnk--> Monroe Doctrine, which stated that the United States could intervene in <!--del_lnk--> Latin American affairs when corruption of governments made it necessary.<p>Roosevelt gained international praise for helping negotiate the end of the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War, for which he was awarded the <a href="../../wp/n/Nobel_Peace_Prize.htm" title="Nobel Peace Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. Roosevelt later arbitrated a dispute between <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a> over the division of <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Some historians have argued these latter two actions helped in a small way to avert a <!--del_lnk--> world war.<p><a id="Panama_Canal" name="Panama_Canal"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">Panama Canal</span></h4>
      <p>Roosevelt&#39;s most famous foreign policy initiative, following the <!--del_lnk--> Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, was the construction of the <a href="../../wp/p/Panama_Canal.htm" title="Panama Canal">Panama Canal</a>, which upon its completion shortened the route of freighters between <a href="../../wp/s/San_Francisco%252C_California.htm" title="San Francisco, California">San Francisco, California</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> by 8,000 miles (13,000 km).<p><a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a> first proposed the canal in their country as opposed to rival <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, and Colombia signed a treaty for an agreed-upon sum. At that time, <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> was a province of Colombia. According to the treaty, in 1902, the U.S. was to buy out the equipment and excavations from France, which had been attempting to build a canal since 1881. While the Colombian negotiating team had signed the treaty, ratification by the Colombian Senate became problematic.<p>The Colombian Senate balked at the price and asked for 10 million dollars over the original agreed upon price. When the U.S. refused to re-negotiate the price, the Colombian politicians proposed cutting the original French company that started the project out of the deal and giving that difference to Colombia. The original deal stipulated that the French company was to be reasonably compensated. Realizing that the Colombian Senate was no longer bargaining in good faith, Roosevelt tired of these last-minute attempts by the Colombians to cheat the French out of their entire investment.<p>Roosevelt ultimately decided, with the encouragement of Panamanian business interests, to help Panama declare independence from Colombia in 1903. A brief revolution, of only a few hours, followed the declaration, and Colombian soldiers were bribed $50 each to lay down their arms. On <!--del_lnk--> November 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1903, the Republic of Panama was created, with its constitution written in advance by the United States. Shortly thereafter, a treaty was signed with Panama. The U.S. paid $10 million to secure rights to build on and control the Canal Zone. Construction began in 1904 and was completed in 1914.<p>It took a long time to build the Panama Canal because illness spread quickly in Panama. Over 200 workers died of yellow fever and malaria, spread by mosquitoes. Roosevelt worked on clearing swamps and other areas in which the insects bred. Finally the health threat receded, and facilitated the construction of the Canal.<p><a id="The_Great_White_Fleet" name="The_Great_White_Fleet"></a><h4><span class="mw-headline">The Great White Fleet</span></h4>

      <p>As Roosevelt&#39;s administration drew to a close, the president dispatched a fleet consisting of four <!--del_lnk--> US Navy <!--del_lnk--> battleship squadrons and their escorts, on a world-wide voyage of <!--del_lnk--> circumnavigation from <!--del_lnk--> December 16, <!--del_lnk--> 1907, to <!--del_lnk--> February 22, <!--del_lnk--> 1909. With their hulls painted white except for the beautiful gilded scrollwork with a red, white, and blue banner on their bows, these ships would come to be known as The <!--del_lnk--> Great White Fleet. Roosevelt wanted to demonstrate to his country and the world that the US Navy was capable of operating in a global theatre, particularly in the Pacific. This was extraordinarily important at a time when tensions were slowly growing between the United States and Japan. The latter had recently shown its navy&#39;s competence in defeating the <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russians</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Russo-Japanese War and the US Navy fleet to the west was relatively small. The <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Fleet battleships only later came to be known as the &quot;Great White Fleet.&quot; When the fleet sailed into Yokahama, Japan, the Japanese went to extraordinary lengths to show that their country desired peace with the US. Thousands of Japanese school children waving American flags greeted the Navy brass as they came ashore. In February 1909, Roosevelt was in Hampton Roads, Virginia to witness the triumphant return of the fleet and indicate that he saw the fleet&#39;s long voyage as a fitting finish for his administration. Roosevelt said to the officers of the Fleet, &quot;Other nations may do what you have done, but they&#39;ll have to follow you.&quot; This parting act of <!--del_lnk--> grand strategy by Roosevelt greatly expanded the respect for as well as the role of the United States in the international arena. The visit of the Great White Fleet to Tokyo, Japan, which brought thousands of Japanese school children to line the beaches waving American flags purchased by the government, nevertheless, encouraged Japanese militarists who argued for an aggressive Japanese ship building and naval expansion program.<p><a id="Life_in_the_White_House" name="Life_in_the_White_House"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Life in the White House</span></h3>
      <p>Roosevelt relished the presidency and seemed to be everywhere at once. He took Cabinet members and friends on long, fast-paced hikes, boxed in the state rooms of the White House, romped with his children, and read voraciously. In 1908, he was permanently blinded in his left eye during one of his boxing bouts, but this injury was kept from the public at the time. His many enthusiastic interests and limitless energy led one ambassador to wryly explain, &quot;You must always remember that the President is about six.&quot;<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>During his presidency, Roosevelt tried but did not succeed to advance the cause of <!--del_lnk--> simplified spelling. He tried to force government to adopt the system, sending an order to the Public Printer to use the system in all public documents. The order was obeyed, and among the documents thus printed was the President&#39;s special message regarding the Panama Canal. The <i>New York World</i> translated the Thanksgiving Day proclamation:<blockquote>
       <p><i>When nerly three centuries ago, the first settlers kam to the kuntry which has bekom this great republik, tha confronted not only hardship and privashun, but terible risk of thar lives. . . . The kustum has now bekum nashnul and hallowed by immemorial usaj.</i></blockquote>
      <p>The reform annoyed the public, forcing him to rescind the order. Roosevelt&#39;s friend, literary critic <!--del_lnk--> Brander Matthews, one of the chief advocates of the reform, remonstrated with him for abandoning the effort. Roosevelt replied on <!--del_lnk--> December 16: &quot;I could not by fighting have kept the new spelling in, and it was evidently worse than useless to go into an undignified contest when I was beaten. Do you know that the one word as to which I thought the new spelling was wrong &mdash; thru &mdash; was more responsible than anything else for our discomfiture?&quot; Next summer Roosevelt was watching a naval review when a launch marked &quot;Pres Bot&quot; chugged ostentatiously by. The President waved and laughed with delight.<p>Roosevelt&#39;s oldest daughter, Alice, was a controversial character during Roosevelt&#39;s stay in the White House. When friends asked if he could rein in his elder daughter, Roosevelt said, &quot;I can be President of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both.&quot; In turn, Alice said of him that he always wanted to be &quot;the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral.&quot;<p>Roosevelt&#39;s contribution to the White House was the construction of the original <!--del_lnk--> West Wing, which he had built to free up the second floor rooms in the residence that formerly housed the president&#39;s staff. He and Edith also had the entire house renovated and restored to the <!--del_lnk--> federal style, tearing out the Victorian furnishings and details (including <!--del_lnk--> Tiffany windows) that had been installed over the previous three decades.<p><a id="Presidential_firsts" name="Presidential_firsts"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Presidential firsts</span></h3>

      <p>In March 1909, shortly after the end of his second term, Roosevelt left New York for a <!--del_lnk--> safari in Africa. Financed by <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Carnegie.htm" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt hunted for specimens for the <!--del_lnk--> Smithsonian Institution and for the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History in New York. His party, which included scientists from the Smithsonian and was led by <!--del_lnk--> Frederick Selous, the famous big game hunter and explorer, killed or trapped over 11,397 animals, from <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mole_%2528animal%2529.htm" title="Mole (animal)">moles</a> to <a href="../../wp/h/Hippopotamus.htm" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamuses</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephants</a>. 512 of the animals were big game animals, of which 262 were consumed by the expedition. This included six <!--del_lnk--> white rhinos. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>; the number of animals was so large, it took years to <!--del_lnk--> mount them. The Smithsonian was able to share many duplicate animals with other <!--del_lnk--> museums. Of the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, &quot;I can be condemned only if the existence of the <!--del_lnk--> National Museum, the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.&quot; Although based in the name of <a href="../../wp/s/Science.htm" title="Science">science</a>, there was a large social element to the safari. Interaction with many native peoples, local leaders, renowned professional hunters, and land owning families made the safari much more than a hunting excursion. Roosevelt wrote a detailed account of this adventure; &quot;African Game Trails&quot; describes the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and <!--del_lnk--> flora and <!--del_lnk--> fauna he collected in the name of science.<p><a id="Republican_Party_rift" name="Republican_Party_rift"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Republican Party rift</span></h3>
      <p>Roosevelt certified <a href="../../wp/w/William_Howard_Taft.htm" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a> to be a genuine &quot;progressive&quot; in <!--del_lnk--> 1908, when Roosevelt pushed through the nomination of his Secretary of War for the Presidency. Taft easily defeated three-time candidate <!--del_lnk--> William Jennings Bryan. Taft had a different progressivism, one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, not to mention the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk severe tensions inside the Republican Party&mdash;pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers&mdash;he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, on the one hand encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting <!--del_lnk--> Payne-Aldrich tariff of 1909 was too high for most reformers, but instead of blaming this on Senator <!--del_lnk--> Nelson Aldrich and big business, Taft took credit, calling it the best tariff ever. Again he had managed to alienate all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, so as to allow Taft to be his own man.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Unlike Roosevelt, Taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric. However, he was attentive to the law, so he launched 90 antitrust suits, including one against the largest corporation, U.S. Steel, for an acquisition that Roosevelt had personally approved. Consequently, Taft lost the support of antitrust reformers (who disliked his conservative rhetoric), of big business (which disliked his actions), and of Roosevelt, who felt humiliated by his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The left wing of the Republican Party began agitating against Taft. Senator <!--del_lnk--> Robert LaFollette of <!--del_lnk--> Wisconsin created the National Progressive Republican League (precursor to the <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Party (United States, 1924)) to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level. More trouble came when Taft fired <!--del_lnk--> Gifford Pinchot, a leading conservationist and close ally of Roosevelt. Pinchot alleged that Taft&#39;s Secretary of Interior <!--del_lnk--> Richard Ballinger was in league with big timber interests. Conservationists sided with Pinchot, and Taft alienated yet another vocal constituency.<p>Roosevelt, back from Europe, unexpectedly launched an attack on the federal courts, which deeply upset Taft. Not only had Roosevelt alienated big business, he was also attacking both the judiciary and the deep faith Republicans had in their judges (most of whom had been appointed by McKinley, Roosevelt or Taft.) In the 1910 Congressional elections, Democrats swept to power, and Taft&#39;s reelection in 1912 was increasingly in doubt. In 1911, Taft responded with a vigorous stumping tour that allowed him to sign up most of the party leaders long before Roosevelt announced.<p><a id="Election_of_1912" name="Election_of_1912"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Election of 1912</span></h3>

      <p>Late in 1911, Roosevelt finally broke with Taft and LaFollette and announced himself as a candidate for the Republican nomination. But Roosevelt had delayed too long, and Taft had already won the support of most party leaders in the country. Because of LaFollette&#39;s nervous breakdown on the campaign trail before Roosevelt&#39;s entry, most of LaFollette&#39;s supporters went over to Roosevelt, the new progressive Republican candidate.<p>Roosevelt, stepping up his attack on judges, carried 9 of the states with preferential primaries, LaFollette took two, and Taft only one. The 1912 Primaries represented the first extensive use of the Presidential Primary, a reform achievement of the progressive movement. However, these primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt&#39;s popularity with the electorate, were in no ways as important as primaries are today. First of all, there were fewer states where the common voter was given a forum to express himself, such as a primary. Many more states selected convention delegates either at party conventions, or in caucuses, which were not as open as today&#39;s caucuses. So while the man in the street still adored Roosevelt, most professional Republican politicians were supporting Taft, and they proved difficult to upset in non-primary states.<p>At the <!--del_lnk--> Republican Convention in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, despite being the incumbent, Taft&#39;s victory was not immediately assured. But after two weeks, Roosevelt, realizing that he would not be able to win the nomination outright, asked his followers to leave the convention hall. They moved to the <!--del_lnk--> Auditorium Theatre, and then Roosevelt, along with key allies such as <!--del_lnk--> Pinchot and <!--del_lnk--> Albert Beveridge created the <!--del_lnk--> Progressive Party, structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level. It was popularly known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Bull Moose Party&quot;, which got its name after Roosevelt told reporters, &quot;I&#39;m as tough as a bull moose.&quot; At the convention Roosevelt cried out, &quot;We stand at <!--del_lnk--> Armageddon and we battle for the Lord.&quot; The crusading rhetoric resonated well with the delegates, many of them long-time reformers, crusaders, activists and opponents of politics as usual. Included in the ranks were <!--del_lnk--> Jane Addams and many other feminists and peace activists. The platform echoed Roosevelt&#39;s 1907-08 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests.<p>While campaigning in <!--del_lnk--> Milwaukee, Wisconsin on <!--del_lnk--> October 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1912, a saloonkeeper named <!--del_lnk--> John Schrank failed in an <!--del_lnk--> assassination attempt on Roosevelt. Schrank <i>did</i> shoot the former President, but the bullet lodged in Roosevelt&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> chest only after hitting both his <a href="../../wp/s/Steel.htm" title="Steel">steel</a> <!--del_lnk--> eyeglass case and a copy of his speech he was carrying in his jacket. Roosevelt declined suggestions that he go to the hospital, and delivered his scheduled speech. He spoke vigorously for ninety minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, &quot;I don&#39;t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.&quot; Afterwards, doctors determined that he was not seriously wounded and that it would be more dangerous to attempt to remove the bullet than to leave it in his chest. Roosevelt carried it with him until he died.<!--del_lnk--> <p>Roosevelt failed to move the political system in his direction. He did win 4.1 million votes (27%), compared to Taft&#39;s 3.5 million (23%). However, Wilson&#39;s 6.3 million votes (42%) were enough to garner 435 electoral votes. Roosevelt had 88 electoral votes to Taft&#39;s 8 electoral votes. (This meant that Taft became the only incumbent President in history to actually come in <i>third</i> place in an attempt to be re-elected.) But <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania was Roosevelt&#39;s only <!--del_lnk--> Eastern state; in the <!--del_lnk--> Midwest he carried <!--del_lnk--> Michigan, <a href="../../wp/m/Minnesota.htm" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and <!--del_lnk--> South Dakota; in the <!--del_lnk--> West, <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Washington; he did not win any Southern states.

More important, he pulled so many progressives out of the Republican party that it took on a much more conservative cast for the next generation.<p><a name="1913-1914_South_American_Expedition"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">1913-1914 South American Expedition</span></h3>

      <p>His popular book <i>Through the Brazilian Wilderness</i> describes his expedition into the <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazilian">Brazilian</a> jungle in 1913 as a member of the <!--del_lnk--> Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition co-named after its leader, <a href="../../wp/b/Brazil.htm" title="Brazil">Brazilian</a> explorer <!--del_lnk--> C&acirc;ndido Rondon. The book describes all of the scientific discovery, scenic tropical vistas and exotic flora, fauna and wild life experienced on the expedition. A friend, Father <!--del_lnk--> John Augustine Zahm, had searched for new adventures and found them in the forests of South America. After a briefing of several of his own expeditions, he convinced Roosevelt to commit to such an expedition in 1912. To finance the expedition, Roosevelt received support from the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History, promising to bring back many new animal specimens. Once in South America, a new far more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida, the <!--del_lnk--> River of Doubt, and trace it north to the Madiera and thence to the <a href="../../wp/a/Amazon_River.htm" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a>. It was later renamed <!--del_lnk--> Rio Roosevelt in honour of the former President. Roosevelt&#39;s crew consisted of his 24-year-old son Kermit, Colonel <!--del_lnk--> C&acirc;ndido Rondon, a naturalist sent by the <!--del_lnk--> American Museum of Natural History named George K. Cherrie, Brazilian Lieutenant Joao Lyra, team physician Dr. Jos&eacute; Antonio Cajazeira, and sixteen highly skilled paddlers (called camaradas in <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a>). The initial expedition started, probably unwisely, on <!--del_lnk--> December 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1913, at the height of the rainy season. The trip up the River of Doubt started on <!--del_lnk--> February 27, <!--del_lnk--> 1914.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>During the trip up the river, Roosevelt contracted <a href="../../wp/m/Malaria.htm" title="Malaria">malaria</a> and a serious infection resulting from a minor leg wound. These illnesses so weakened Roosevelt that, by six weeks into the expedition, he had to be attended day and night by the expedition&#39;s physician, Dr. Cajazeira and his son, Kermit. By this time, Roosevelt considered his own condition a threat to the survival of the others. At one point, Kermit had to talk him out of his wish to be left behind so as not to slow down the expedition, now with only a few weeks rations left. Roosevelt was having chest pains when he tried to walk, his temperature soared to 103&deg;F (39&deg;C), and at times he was delirious. He had lost over fifty pounds (20 kg). Without the constant support of Dr. Cajazeira, and Rondon&#39;s leadership, Roosevelt would likely have perished.<p>Upon his return to New York, friends and family were startled by Roosevelt&#39;s physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. He might not have really known just how accurate that analysis would prove to be, because the effects of the South America expedition had so greatly weakened him that they significantly contributed to his declining health. For the rest of his life, he would be plagued by flareups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe that they would require hospitalization.<p>When Roosevelt had recovered enough of his strength, he found that he had a new battle on his hands. In professional circles, there was doubt about his claims of having discovered and navigated a completely uncharted river over 625 miles (1,000 km) long. Roosevelt would have to defend himself and win international recognition of the expedition&#39;s newly-named <!--del_lnk--> Rio Roosevelt. Toward this end, Roosevelt went to Washington, D.C., and spoke at a standing-room-only convention to defend his claims. His official report and its defense silenced the critics, and he was able to triumphantly return to his home in <!--del_lnk--> Oyster Bay.<p><a id="Writer" name="Writer"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Writer</span></h3>
      <p>Despite his weakened condition and slow recovery from his South America expedition, Roosevelt continued to write with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. As an editor of <i>Outlook</i> magazine, he had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, Roosevelt wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including his <i>Autobiography</i>, <i>Rough Riders</i> and <i>History of the Naval War of 1812</i>, ranching, explorations, and wildlife. His most important book was the 4 volume narrative <i>The Winning of the West,</i> which traced the origin of a new &quot;race&quot; of Americans to frontier conditions in the 18th century.<p><a id="World_War_I" name="World_War_I"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h2>
      <p>Roosevelt angrily complained about the foreign policy of President Wilson, calling it &quot;weak&quot;. This caused him to develop an intense dislike of Woodrow Wilson. When <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported <!--del_lnk--> Britain, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Allies of World War I because he admired their fight for civilization; he demanded a harsher policy against <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, especially regarding submarine warfare. In 1916, he campaigned energetically for <!--del_lnk--> Charles Evans Hughes and repeatedly denounced those Irish-Americans and German-Americans whose pleas for neutrality Roosevelt said were unpatriotic because they put the interest of Ireland and Germany ahead of America&#39;s. He insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hyphenated American&quot; who juggled multiple loyalties. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, Roosevelt sought to raise a volunteer infantry division, but Wilson refused.<p>Roosevelt&#39;s attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off-year elections of 1918. Roosevelt was popular enough to seriously contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918 because of the lingering malaria. His son <!--del_lnk--> Quentin, a daring pilot with the American forces in France, was shot down behind German lines in 1918. Quentin was his youngest son and probably the most like him. It is said that the death of his son distressed him so much that Roosevelt never recovered from his loss.<p><a id="Last_years" name="Last_years"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Last years</span></h2>

      <p>Despite his debilitating diseases, Roosevelt remained active to the end of his life. He was an enthusiastic proponent of the <a href="../../wp/s/Scouting.htm" title="Scouting">Scouting</a> movement. The <!--del_lnk--> Boy Scouts of America gave him the title of <b>Chief Scout Citizen</b>, the only person to hold such title. One early Scout leader said, &quot;The two things that gave Scouting great impetus and made it very popular were the uniform and Teddie Roosevelt&#39;s jingoism.&quot;<p>On <!--del_lnk--> January 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1919, at the age of 60, Roosevelt died in his sleep of a coronary <!--del_lnk--> embolism at Oyster Bay, and was buried in nearby Young&#39;s Memorial Cemetery. Upon receiving word of his death, his son, <!--del_lnk--> Archie, telegraphed his siblings simply, &quot;The old lion is dead.&quot; Woodrow Wilson&#39;s vice president at the time <!--del_lnk--> Thomas R.

      <p>Roosevelt intensely disliked being called &quot;Teddy,&quot; and was quick to point out this fact out to those who used the nickname, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career. He attended the <!--del_lnk--> Madison Square Presbyterian Church until the age of 16. Later in life, when Roosevelt lived at Oyster Bay he attended an <!--del_lnk--> Episcopal church with his wife. While in Washington he attended services at <!--del_lnk--> Grace Reformed Church. As President he firmly believed in the <!--del_lnk--> separation of church and state and thought it unwise to have <i><!--del_lnk--> In God We Trust</i> on currency, because he thought it sacrilegious to put the name of the Deity on something so common as money. He was also a <!--del_lnk--> Freemason, and regularly attended the Matinecock Lodge&#39;s meetings. He once said that &quot;One of the things that so greatly attracted me to Masonry that I hailed the chance of becoming a Mason was that it really did act up to what we, as a government, are pledged to &mdash; namely to treat each man on his merit as a man.&quot;<p>Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called &quot;the strenuous life.&quot; To this end, he exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times a week, a practice he regularly continued as President until one blow detached his left retina, leaving him blind in that eye (a fact not made public until many years later). Thereafter, he practiced <!--del_lnk--> jujutsu and continued his habit of <!--del_lnk--> skinny-dipping in the <!--del_lnk--> Potomac River during winter.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>He was an enthusiastic <!--del_lnk--> singlestick player and, according to <!--del_lnk--> Harper&#39;s Weekly, in 1905 showed up at a White House reception with his arm bandaged after a bout with General <!--del_lnk--> Leonard Wood. Roosevelt was also an avid reader, reading tens of thousands of books, at a rate of several a day in multiple languages. Along with <a href="../../wp/t/Thomas_Jefferson.htm" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> Roosevelt is often considered the most well read of any American politician.<p>His younger two sons made up a part of what was called the &quot;White House Gang&quot;.<p><a id="Legacy" name="Legacy"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Legacy</span></h2>

      <p>For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt&#39;s commanders recommended him for the <a href="../../wp/m/Medal_of_Honor.htm" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honour</a>, but his subsequent telegrams to the War Department complaining about the delays in returning American troops from <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> doomed his chances.

      <p>Overall, historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation&#39;s political system by permanently placing the presidency at centre stage and making character as important as the issues. His notable accomplishments include trust-busting and conservationism. However, he has been criticized for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered &quot;uncivilized&quot;. Even so, history and legend have been kind to him. His friend, historian <!--del_lnk--> Henry Adams, proclaimed, &quot;Roosevelt, more than any other living man ....showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter &mdash; the quality that mediaeval theology assigned to God &mdash; he was pure act.&quot; Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.<div style="clear:both;">

      <p>Roosevelt&#39;s 1901 saying &ldquo;Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick&rdquo; is still being occasionally quoted by politicians and columnists in different countries - not only in English but also in translation to various other languagues. For example, following the <!--del_lnk--> Second Lebanon War of August 2006, opponents of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israeli</a> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Ehud Olmert accused him of &quot;Speaking loudly and carrying a small stick&quot;.<p>The phrase is also used in a popular <!--del_lnk--> Bugs Bunny Cartoon in which Bugs runs for office against a crooked <!--del_lnk--> Yosemite Sam. Bugs in the dress of Roosevelt proclaims the phrase and Sam runs in and says &quot;I have a bigger stick and I use it too!&quot; Then Sam proceeds to bop Bugs with the stick on the top of the head.<p>As a charismatic President often considered larger than life, Roosevelt (or characters using his name loosely based on him) has appeared in numerous fiction books, television shows, films, and other media of popular culture.<div class="thumb tleft">

In the comic play and movie <!--del_lnk--> Arsenic and Old Lace part of the zany atmosphere is created by a character who holds the delusion that he is Theodore Roosevelt.<p>Roosevelt appeared as a guest host in the <i><!--del_lnk--> Histeria!</i> episode &quot;The Teddy Roosevelt Show&quot;. The episode opened with a sketch where Roosevelt meets with the show&#39;s &quot;writers&quot;, and it featured a sketch in which Roosevelt appears as <b>Panama Teddy</b> (a play on <!--del_lnk--> Indiana Jones) to help with the construction of the Panama Canal, and also a song based on his nickname &quot;Trust Buster&quot; (sung to the tune of the theme from <i><!--del_lnk--> Ghostbusters</i>).
