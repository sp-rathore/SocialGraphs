      <p>L.E. McCullough notes that the oldest surviving whistles date from the 12<sup>th</sup> century, but that, &quot;Players of the <i>feadan</i> are also mentioned in the description of the King of Ireland&#39;s court found in the <!--del_lnk--> Brehon Laws dating from the 3<sup>rd</sup> century A.D.&quot; The Tusculum whistle is a 14<!--del_lnk--> cm whistle with six finger holes, made of brass or bronze, found with pottery dating to the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> centuries; it&#39;s currently in the collection of the <!--del_lnk--> Museum of Scotland.<p>The word &quot;<!--del_lnk--> penny whistle&quot; was in use as early as 1730 and the word &quot;tin-whistle&quot; as early as 1825, but neither word seems to have been common until the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The first record of tin-plate whistles dates back to 1825 in Britain.<p>The first factory-made tin whistles were produced by <!--del_lnk--> Robert Clarke (? - 1882) in <a href="../../wp/m/Manchester.htm" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Norman Dannatt boasted that Robert Clarke&rsquo;s whistles &quot;produced a unique sound which, though attempts have been made to copy it, no-one has ever improved.&quot; Up to <!--del_lnk--> 1900, they were marketed as &quot;Clarke London Flageolets&quot; or &quot;Clarke Flageolets&quot;. The whistle&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> fingering system is similar to that of the six hole, simple system, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Irish flute&quot; (&quot;simple&quot; in comparison to <!--del_lnk--> Boehm system flutes). The six hole, diatonic system is also used on <!--del_lnk--> baroque flutes and other <!--del_lnk--> folk flutes, and was of course well known before <!--del_lnk--> Robert Clarke began producing his tin whistles circa 1843. Clarke&#39;s first whistles were pitched in high A and were later made in other keys suitable for Victorian parlor music. The company showed the whistles in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Great_Exhibition.htm" title="The Great Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a> of 1851.<p>In the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, some flute manufacturers such as <!--del_lnk--> Barnett Samuel and <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Wallis also sold whistles. These had a cylindrical brass tube. Like many old whistles, they had <a href="../../wp/l/Lead.htm" title="Lead">lead</a> fipple plugs; since lead is <!--del_lnk--> poisonous caution should be exercised before playing an old whistle.<p>The Generation whistle was introduced in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and also featured a brass tube with a lead fipple plug. The design was updated somewhat over the years, most notably the substitution of a plastic fipple for the lead plug design.<p>While whistles have most often been produced in higher pitches, the &quot;low&quot; whistle is not unknown historically. The Museum of Fine Arts, <a href="../../wp/b/Boston%252C_Massachusetts.htm" title="Boston">Boston</a> has in its collection an example of a 19<sup>th</sup> century low whistle from the famous Galpin collection. During the 1960s revival of traditional Irish music the low whistle was &quot;recreated&quot; by Bernard Overton at the request of <!--del_lnk--> Finbar Furey.<p><a id="Contemporary_tin_whistles" name="Contemporary_tin_whistles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary tin whistles</span></h2>
      <p>The most common tin whistles today are made of <!--del_lnk--> brass tubing, or <a href="../../wp/n/Nickel.htm" title="Nickel">nickel</a> <!--del_lnk--> plated brass tubing, with a <!--del_lnk--> plastic <!--del_lnk--> fipple (mouthpiece). Generation, Fead&oacute;g, Oak, Acorn, Soodlum&#39;s (now Walton&#39;s), and other brands fall in this category. The next most common form is the conical sheet metal whistle with a wooden stop in the wide end to form the fipple, the Clarke&#39;s brand being the most prevalent. Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the <!--del_lnk--> PVC whistle, and the wooden whistle.<p>Whistles are a prevalent starting instrument in <!--del_lnk--> Irish traditional music, since they are often cheap (under US$10), relatively easy to start with (no tricky <!--del_lnk--> embouchure such as found with the <a href="../../wp/f/Flute.htm" title="Flute">flute</a>), and the fingerings are identical to those on the traditional six holed flute (Irish flute, baroque flute). The tin whistle is the most popular instrument in Irish traditional music today.<p>In recent years a number of instrument builders have started lines of &quot;high-end,&quot; hand-made whistles, which can cost hundreds of dollars US each &mdash; expensive in comparison to cheap whistles, but nevertheless cheaper than most other instruments. These companies are typically either a single individual or a very small group of craftsmen who work closely together. It is common for builders of <!--del_lnk--> wooden flutes and <!--del_lnk--> Uilleann pipes to also build whistles. The instruments are distinguished from the inexpensive whistles in that each whistle is individually manufactured and &quot;voiced&quot; by a skilled person rather than made in a factory.<p><a id="Tuning" name="Tuning"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Tuning</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Whistle_keys" name="Whistle_keys"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Whistle keys</span></h3>
      <p>The whistle is <!--del_lnk--> tuned <!--del_lnk--> diatonically, which allows it to be used to easily play music in two major <!--del_lnk--> keys and their corresponding minor keys and <!--del_lnk--> modes. The whistle is identified by its lowest note, which is the <!--del_lnk--> tonic of the lowest <!--del_lnk--> major key. Note that this method of determining the key of the instrument is different from the method used to determine the key of a <!--del_lnk--> chromatic instrument, which is based on the relationship between notes on a score and sounded pitch. Whistles are available in a wide variety of different keys.<p>The most common whistles can easily play notes in the keys of D and G major. Since the D major key is lower these whistles are identified as <i>D whistles.</i> The next most common whistle tuning is a <i>C whistle,</i> which can easily play notes in the keys of C and F major. The C whistle is widely used in American <a href="../../wp/f/Folk_music.htm" title="Folk music">folk music</a>, whereas the D whistle is the most common choice for <!--del_lnk--> Celtic music.<p>Although the whistle is essentially a <!--del_lnk--> diatonic instrument, it is possible to get notes outside the principal major key of the whistle, either by <i>half-holing</i> (partially covering the highest open finger hole) or by <i>cross-fingering</i> (covering some holes while leaving some higher ones open). However, half-holing is somewhat more difficult to do correctly, and whistles are available in many keys, so for alternate keys a whistler will typically use a different whistle instead, reserving half-holing for <!--del_lnk--> accidentals. Some whistle designs by such manufacturers as Susato allow a single fipple, or mouthpiece, to be used on differently keyed bodies.<p><a id="Low_whistles" name="Low_whistles"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Low whistles</span></h4>
      <p>There are larger whistles, which by virtue of being longer and wider produce tones an octave (or in rare cases two octaves) lower. Whistles in this category are likely to be made of metal or plastic tubing, with a tuning-slide head, and are almost always referred to as <i>low whistles</i> but sometimes called <i>concert whistles</i>. The low whistle operates on identical principles to the standard whistles, but musicians in the tradition may consider it a separate instrument.<p>The term <i>soprano whistle</i> is sometimes used for the higher-pitched whistles when it is necessary to distinguish them from low whistles.<p><a id="Tuning_adjustment" name="Tuning_adjustment"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tuning adjustment</span></h3>
      <p>Whistles may or may not be <!--del_lnk--> tuneable. If they are, tuning is done by moving the mouthpiece in or out, either the mouthpiece itself sliding over the whistle body, as in the metal tube/plastic body model, or else with a tuning slide such that the mouthpiece and the upper part of the body form the &#39;head&#39; of the whistle which fits into the main body.<p><a id="Playing_technique" name="Playing_technique"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Playing technique</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Fingering_and_range" name="Fingering_and_range"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fingering and range</span></h3>
      <p>The notes are selected by opening or closing holes with the fingers. With all the holes closed, the whistle generates its lowest note, the <!--del_lnk--> tonic of a <!--del_lnk--> major scale. Successively opening holes from the bottom upward produces the rest of the notes of the scale in sequence: with the lowest hole open it generates the second, with the lowest two holes open, it produces the third and so on. With all six holes open, it produces the seventh.<p>In any flute, including the tin whistle, the second and higher octaves are achieved by increasing the air speed into the embouchure hole. This increases the frequency of the air pressure waves created. On a transverse flute this is generally done by narrowing the lip aperture. Since the size and direction of the tin whistle&#39;s windway, like that of the recorder and other fipple flutes, is fixed it is necessary to increase the speed of the air stream by <!--del_lnk--> overblowing. This can be done by blowing fractionally harder.<p>Fingering in the second octave is generally the same as in the first octave, though alternate fingerings are sometimes employed in the higher end of the octave to correct tuning. Also, the tonic note of the second octave is usually played with the top hole of the whistle uncovered instead of covering all holes as with the tonic note of the first octave; this makes it harder to accidentally drop into the first octave and is usually more in tune.<p>Various other notes (relatively flat or sharp with respect to those of the major scale) can be accessed by <i>cross fingering</i> techniques, and all the notes (except the lowest of each octave) can be flattened by <i>half holing</i>. Perhaps the most effective and most used cross fingering is that which produces a flattened form of the seventh note (B flat instead of B on a C whistle, for example, or C natural instead of C sharp on a D whistle). This makes available another major scale (F on a C whistle, G on a D whistle).<p>The standard range of the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C. It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, the result will be loud and out of tune.<p><a id="Ornamentation" name="Ornamentation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ornamentation</span></h3>
      <p>Traditional Irish whistle playing uses a number of <!--del_lnk--> ornaments to embellish the music, including cuts, strikes and rolls. Most playing is <!--del_lnk--> legato with ornaments to create breaks between notes, rather than tongued. The Irish and Celtic concept of the word &quot;ornamentation&quot; differs somewhat from that of <!--del_lnk--> classical music in that ornaments are more commonly changes in how a note is articulated rather than the addition of separately-perceived notes to the piece.<p>Common ornaments and articulations include:<dl>
       <dt>Cuts&nbsp;<dd><i>Cuts</i> are very briefly lifting a finger above the note being sounded without interrupting airflow into the whistle. For example, a player playing a low D on a D whistle can cut the note by very briefly lifting the first finger of his or her lower hand. This causes the pitch to briefly shift upward. The cut can be performed either at the very start of the note or after the note has begun to sound; some people call the latter a &quot;<i>double cut</i>&quot; or a &quot;<i>mid-note cut</i>.&quot;</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Strikes&nbsp;<dd><i>Strikes</i> or <i>taps</i> are similar to cuts except that a finger below the sounded note is briefly lowered to the whistle. For example, if a player is playing a low E on a D whistle the player could tap by quickly lowering and raising his or her bottom finger. Both cuts and taps are essentially instantaneous; the listener should not perceive them as separate notes.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Rolls&nbsp;<dd>A <i>roll</i> is a note with first a cut and then a strike. Alternately, a roll can be considered as a group of notes of identical pitch and duration with different articulations. There are two common types of rolls: <ul>
         <li>The <i>long roll</i> is a group of three slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded without a cut or strike, the second sounded with a cut, and the third sounded with a strike.<li>The <i>short roll</i> is a group of two slurred notes of equal pitch and duration, the first sounded with a cut and the second sounded with a strike.</ul>
      </dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Cranns&nbsp;<dd><i>Cranns</i> are ornaments borrowed from the <!--del_lnk--> Uilleann piping tradition. They are similar to rolls except that only cuts are used, not taps or strikes. On the tin whistle they are generally only used for notes where a roll is impossible, such as the lowest note of the instrument.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Slides&nbsp;<dd><i>Slides</i> are similar to <!--del_lnk--> portamentos in classical music; a note below or above (usually below) the intended note is fingered, and then the fingering is gradually shifted in order to smoothly raise or lower the pitch to the intended note. The slide is generally a longer duration ornament than, for example, the cut or the tap and the listener should perceive the pitch changing.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Tonguing&nbsp;<dd><i>Tonguing</i> is used sparingly as a means of emphasizing certain notes, such as the first note in a tune. Tin whistle players usually do not tongue most notes. To tongue a note a player briefly touches his or her tongue to the front of the roof of their mouth at the start of the note, creating a percussive <!--del_lnk--> attack.</dl>
      <dl>
       <dt>Vibrato&nbsp;<dd><i><!--del_lnk--> Vibrato</i> can be achieved on most notes by opening and closing one of the open holes, or by variation of breath pressure. Of the two, fingered vibrato is much more common than diaphragmatic (breath) vibrato, except on notes like the lowest note on the whistle where fingered vibrato is much more difficult.</dl>
      <p><a id="Repertoire" name="Repertoire"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Repertoire</span></h2>
      <p>A number of <!--del_lnk--> music genres commonly feature the tin whistle.<p><a id="Irish_and_Scottish_music" name="Irish_and_Scottish_music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Irish and Scottish music</span></h3>
      <p>Traditional music from <a href="../../wp/m/Music_of_Ireland.htm" title="Music of Ireland">Ireland</a> and, to a lesser extent, <!--del_lnk--> Scotland is by far the most common music to play on the tin whistle, and comprises the vast majority of published scores suitable for whistle players. Musicians who play Irish and Scottish music on the tin whistle perform both solo and as members of bands. While the tin whistle is very common in Irish music to the point that it could be called characteristic of the genre and fairly common in Scottish music, it is not a &quot;required&quot; instrument in either one.<p>As ornamentation and improvisation around a simple melody is characteristic of both genres, many traditional musicians frown upon the use of musical scores, believing that learning &quot;by ear,&quot; from recordings or live instruction, is the best way to learn these aspects of whistle performance. Hence, students of the tin whistle may be advised not to use musical scores, and will certainly be expected to spend a substantial amout of time listening to other performers even when scores are used. Scores are never used in live performances and usually discouraged in <!--del_lnk--> sessions. Nevertheless, it is a common practice to transcribe traditional tunes, both for the purpose of preserving melodies and as a learning tool. When traditional tunes are scored there are seldom if ever separate scores for individual instruments; hence, tin whistle players use the same score as all other musicians.<p><a id="Kwela" name="Kwela"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Kwela</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Kwela is a genre of <!--del_lnk--> music created in South Africa in the 1950s, and characterised by an upbeat, <a href="../../wp/j/Jazz.htm" title="Jazz">jazzy</a> tin whistle lead. Among all genres of music featuring the tin whistle, kwela is distinctive as the only one which is totally dominated by the instrument; the genre was created around the sound of the whistle. The low cost of the tin whistle made it an attractive instrument in the impoverished, <!--del_lnk--> apartheid-era townships; the <!--del_lnk--> Hohner tin whistle was especially popular in this genre. The kwela craze accounted for the sale of over a million tin whistles.<p><!--del_lnk--> Kwela was mostly superseded in South Africa by the <!--del_lnk--> mbaqanga genre in the late fifties, and with it the <a href="../../wp/s/Saxophone.htm" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a> largely supplanted the tin whistle as the lead instrument for music from the townships. However, kwela master <!--del_lnk--> Aaron &quot;Big Voice Jack&quot; Lerole continued to perform into the 1990s and a few kwela bands, such as <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London&#39;s</a> <!--del_lnk--> The Positively Testcard continue to record kwela music today.<p>Kwela musical scores are rarely published and many of the recordings of founding kwela artists are out of print and hard to find.<p><a id="Other_music" name="Other_music"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Other music</span></h3>
      <p>The tin whistle is used in many other types of music, though not to the extent that it could be called characteristic as with Irish music and kwela. It is not unusual to hear the tin whistle used in <a href="../../wp/b/Bluegrass_music.htm" title="Bluegrass music">bluegrass</a>, <!--del_lnk--> praise music, and <!--del_lnk--> film soundtracks, and published scores suitable for tin whistle performance are available in all of these genres. The tin whistle also appears in &quot;crossover&quot; genres like <!--del_lnk--> world music and <!--del_lnk--> folk metal.<p><a id="Notation" name="Notation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Notation</span></h2>
      <p>Tin whistle music collections are generally notated in one of three different formats.<p><a id="Standard_musical_notation" name="Standard_musical_notation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Standard musical notation</span></h3>
      <p>It is common to score music for the whistle using standard <!--del_lnk--> musical notation. The tin whistle is a <!--del_lnk--> transposing instrument and there is no real consensus on how tin whistle music should be written, or on how reading music onto the whistle should be taught. It can be said, however, that when music is scored for a soprano whistle, in the key in which it is to sound, then it will be written an octave lower than it sounds, so avoiding use of <!--del_lnk--> ledger lines and making it much easier to read.<p>Irish music and other <!--del_lnk--> Celtic music constitutes the majority of published scores for the whistle. Since the majority of that music is written in D major, G major, or one of the corresponding musical modes, use of the D major or G major key signatures is a <i><!--del_lnk--> de facto</i> standard. For example, the &quot;C whistle&quot; edition of Bill Ochs&#39;s popular <i>The Clarke Tin Whistle Handbook</i> is scored in D and differs from the D edition only in that the accompanying audio CD is played on a C whistle.<p>Reading directly onto the C whistle is popular for the obvious reason that its <i>home key</i> or <i>name key</i> is the <i>all-natural</i> major key (<!--del_lnk--> C major). Some musicians are encouraged to learn to read directly onto one whistle, while others are taught to read directly onto another, and learning to read directly onto a second whistle will tend to disturb, seriously, facility gained on the first.<p>The whistle player who wants music to read on to all whistles will need to learn the mechanics of written <!--del_lnk--> transposition, taking music with one <!--del_lnk--> key signature and rewriting it with another.<p><a id="Tablature" name="Tablature"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tablature</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Tablature notation for the tin whistle is a graphical representation of which tone holes the player should cover. The most common format is a vertical column of six circles, with holes to be covered for a given note shown filled with black, and a plus sign (+) at the top for notes in the second octave. Tablature is most commonly found in tutorial books for beginners.<p><a id="Abc_notation" name="Abc_notation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Abc notation</span></h3>
      <p>Since the majority of popular tin whistle music is traditional and out of copyright, it is common to share tune collections on the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Abc notation is the most common means of electronic exchange of tunes. It is also designed to be easy to read by humans, and many musicians learn to read it directly instead of using a computer program to transform it into a standard musical notation score.<p><a id="Well-known_performers" name="Well-known_performers"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Well-known performers</span></h2>

      <p>In 1973, <!--del_lnk--> Paddy Moloney (of <!--del_lnk--> The Chieftains) and <!--del_lnk--> Sean Potts released <i>Tin Whistles,</i> which helped to popularise the tin whistle in particular and <!--del_lnk--> Irish music in general. <!--del_lnk--> Mary Bergin&#39;s <i>Fead&oacute;ga St&aacute;in</i> (1979) and <i>Fead&oacute;ga St&aacute;in 2</i> (1993) were similarly influential.<p>Other notable players include <!--del_lnk--> Carmel Gunning, <!--del_lnk--> Micho Russell, <!--del_lnk--> Joanie Madden, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Finnegan, and <!--del_lnk--> Se&aacute;n Ryan.
