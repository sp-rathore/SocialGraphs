      <p>OLPC is based on <!--del_lnk--> constructionist learning theories pioneered by <!--del_lnk--> Seymour Papert, <!--del_lnk--> Alan Kay, and also on the principles expressed in <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Negroponte&rsquo;s book <i><!--del_lnk--> Being Digital</i>. The founding corporate members are <a href="../../wp/g/Google.htm" title="Google">Google</a>, <!--del_lnk--> News Corp, <!--del_lnk--> AMD, <!--del_lnk--> Red Hat, <!--del_lnk--> Brightstar and <!--del_lnk--> Nortel, each of whom donated two million dollars to the project. All three individuals and six companies are active participants in OLPC.<p>The organization gained much attention when <!--del_lnk--> Nicholas Negroponte and <a href="../../wp/k/Kofi_Annan.htm" title="Kofi Annan">Kofi Annan</a> unveiled a working prototype of the CM1 on <!--del_lnk--> November 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 at the <!--del_lnk--> World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in <!--del_lnk--> Tunis, Tunisia. Negroponte showed two prototypes of the laptop at the second phase of the World Summit: a non working physical model and a tethered version using an external board and separate keyboard. The device shown was a rough prototype using a standard development board. Negroponte estimated that the screen alone required three more months of development. The first working prototype was demonstrated at the project&#39;s Country Task Force Meeting on <!--del_lnk--> May 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. The production version is expected to have a larger display screen in the same size package. The laptops are scheduled to be available by the end of 2006 or early 2007.<p>At the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> World Economic Forum in <!--del_lnk--> Davos, Switzerland, the <!--del_lnk--> United Nations Development Program (UNDP) announced it would back the laptop. UNDP released a statement saying they would work with OLPC to deliver &ldquo;technology and resources to targeted schools in the least developed countries&rdquo;.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The OLPC board of directors announced on <!--del_lnk--> December 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 that <!--del_lnk--> Quanta Computers had been chosen as the <!--del_lnk--> original design manufacturer (ODM) for the $100 laptop project. The decision was made after the board reviewed bids from several possible manufacturing companies. The company emphasized that there was a lot of work that remains to be done: &ldquo;We still need to put a large amount of research and development into this, and will then hopefully be ready to make a finished product in the second half of next year 2006&rdquo;, according to Quanta. Over the next six months, a team at Quanta Research Institute is going to be focusing on the $100 laptop.<p><a id="Pricing" name="Pricing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Pricing</span></h3>
      <p>The project originally aimed for a price of 100 <!--del_lnk--> United States dollars. In May 2006, Negroponte told the Red Hat&#39;s annual user summit: &quot;It is a floating price. We are a nonprofit organization. We have a target of $100 by 2008, but probably it will be $135, maybe $140. That is a start price, but what we have to do is with every release make it cheaper and cheaper--we are promising that the price will go down.&quot; <p><a id="Participating_countries" name="Participating_countries"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Participating countries</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Intentionally_omitted_features" name="Intentionally_omitted_features"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Intentionally omitted features</span></h4>
      <p>In keeping with its goals of robustness and low power consumption, the design of the laptop intentionally omits all motor-driven moving parts; it has no hard drive, no optical (CD/DVD), or floppy drives and no fans. An ATA interface is unnecessary due to the lack of hard drive. There is also no PC Card slot, although an SD slot will be available.<p>Floppy disks, hard disks, CD drives, DVD drives, USB drives, and many other peripherals can be connected via the USB ports. Further expansion is available through an external SD card slot.<p>A built-in hand-<!--del_lnk--> crank generator was part of the original design, but Negroponte stated at a 2006 <!--del_lnk--> LinuxWorld talk that it was no longer integrated into the laptop itself, but optionally available as a hand- or foot-operated generator built into a separate power unit.<p><a id="Power_consumption" name="Power_consumption"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Power consumption</span></h4>
      <p>The power consumption design target is 4W total power consumption for the device in laptop mode; consumption in e-book mode is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.8W. By contrast, typical Apple laptops idle around 15W and peak at around 20W; with reduced backlight and CPU performance and Wifi/Bluetooth disabled, they can reach 11W; and even in sleep mode they consume 2W.<p>In e-book mode, all hardware sub-systems are powered down except the monochrome display (including any display backlighting). When the user moves to a different page the system wakes up, draws the new page on the display and then goes back to sleep.<p><a id="Display" name="Display"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Display</span></h4>
      <p>The first-generation OLPC laptops are expected to have a novel low-cost liquid crystal display. Later generations of the OLPC laptop are expected to use low-cost, low-power and high-resolution <!--del_lnk--> electronic paper displays.<p>The display is the most expensive component of the OLPC Laptop. In April 2005, Negroponte hired Mary Lou Jepsen&mdash;who is expected to join the Media Arts and Sciences faculty at the MIT Media Lab in September 2007&mdash;as OLPC <!--del_lnk--> Chief Technology Officer. Jepsen is developing a new display for the first-generation OLPC laptop, which is derived from the design of small LCDs used in portable DVD players, which she estimated would cost about $35.<p>Jepsen has described the removal of the filters that colour the RGB <!--del_lnk--> subpixels as the critical design innovation in the new <!--del_lnk--> liquid crystal display. Instead of using subtractive colour filters, the display uses a plastic <!--del_lnk--> diffraction grating and lenses on the rear of the LCD to illuminate the colored subpixels. This grating pattern is stamped using the same technology used to make <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVDs</a>. The grating splits the light from the white backlight into a spectrum. The red, green and blue components are diffracted into the correct positions to illuminate the corresponding R, G or B subpixels. This innovation results in a much brighter display and a corresponding reduction in backlight illumination: While the colour filters in a regular display typically absorb 85% of the light that hits them, this display absorbs little of that light.<p>The remainder of the LCD uses existing display technology and can be made using existing manufacturing equipment. Even the masks can be made using combinations of existing materials and processes.<p>The display is transmissive with backlighting when used in colour/DVD mode. The conventional <!--del_lnk--> cold cathode <!--del_lnk--> fluorescent lamp backlighting, which accounts for 30% of the cost of a conventional LCD, has been replaced with a lower-power, less fragile alternative such as white <!--del_lnk--> LEDs for use at low light levels. This form of backlighting should also improve the <!--del_lnk--> colour gamut of the display. The display is a reflective display (with no backlighting) when used in monochrome mode for displaying e-book pages. Mode change occurs with a change in use of the device. The landscape format colour display is used in laptop mode, whereas the portrait format monochrome display is used in e-book mode, so the displayed pages can be &ldquo;read vertically like a book&rdquo;. This is the so-called &ldquo;curl-up-in-bed mode&rdquo; to enable reading of e-books for an extended time in bright light such as sunlight. Negroponte has said at the Technology Review&rsquo;s Fifth Annual Emerging Technologies Conference that the monochrome display has four times the resolution of the colour display.<p>The dual-mode display was not operational in the WSIS prototype. The prototypes were shown with conventional transmission TFT LCDs.<p><a id="Wireless_networking" name="Wireless_networking"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Wireless networking</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> IEEE 802.11b support will be provided using a <!--del_lnk--> Wi-Fi &ldquo;Extended Range&rdquo; chipset. Jepsen has said the wireless chipset will be run at a low bitrate, 2<!--del_lnk--> Mbit/s maximum rather than the usual higher speed 5.5Mbit/s or 11Mbit/s to minimize power consumption.<p>Whenever the laptop is powered on it will participate in a <!--del_lnk--> mobile ad-hoc network with each node operating in a <!--del_lnk--> peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear and forwarding packets across the cloud. If a computer in the cloud has access to the <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> (either directly or indirectly) then all computers in the cloud will be able to access the net. The data rate across this network will not be high but similar networks like the store and forward <!--del_lnk--> Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications such as email to communicate outside the cloud rather than interactive uses, like web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming. Interactive network communication should be possible inside the cloud.<p>The conventional IEEE 802.11b system only handles traffic within a local cloud of wireless devices in a manner similar to an <!--del_lnk--> Ethernet network. Each node transmits and receives its own data but does not route packets between two nodes that cannot communicate directly. The OLPC laptop will use <!--del_lnk--> IEEE 802.11s to form the <!--del_lnk--> wireless mesh network.<p><a id="Keyboard_and_touchpad" name="Keyboard_and_touchpad"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Keyboard and touchpad</span></h4>
      <p>Negroponte and Jepsen have said the keyboard will be changed to suit local needs to match the standard keyboard for the country in which it is used. Some versions of prototype were shown at <!--del_lnk--> World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) with a detachable keyboard (tethered by a cord); however, the working prototype demonstrated in May 2006 had a conventional built-in keyboard.<p>Negroponte has demanded that the keyboard will not contain a <!--del_lnk--> caps lock key, which frees up keyboard real estate for new keys such as a &quot;view source&quot; key.<p>Beneath the keyboard is a large area that resembles a very wide <!--del_lnk--> touchpad that Jepsen referred to as the &ldquo;mousepad&rdquo;. Negroponte has said that this device can be used for &ldquo;<a href="../../wp/c/Calligraphy.htm" title="Calligraphy">calligraphy</a>&rdquo; presumably to support languages that use <!--del_lnk--> ideograms. This also implies that it will support both fingers and pen-like devices. The trackpad was not operational in the WSIS prototype.<p><a id="Enclosure" name="Enclosure"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Enclosure</span></h4>
      <p>The enclosure is dirt- and moisture-resistant and is constructed with 2mm-thick plastic&mdash;thicker than typical laptops.

      <p>All of the <!--del_lnk--> software on the laptop will be open source. The projected software as of November 2006 is:<ul>

       <br /><!--del_lnk--> Steve Jobs had offered <!--del_lnk--> Mac OS X free of charge for use in the laptop, but according to <!--del_lnk--> Seymour Papert, a professor emeritus at MIT who is one of the initiative&#39;s founders, the designers want an operating system that can be tinkered with: &ldquo;We declined because it&rsquo;s not open source.&rdquo; Therefore Linux was chosen.<p><!--del_lnk--> Jim Gettys, responsible for the laptops&#39; system software, has called for a re-education of programmers, saying that many applications use too much memory or even <!--del_lnk--> leak memory. &quot;There seems to be a common fallacy among programmers that using memory is good: on current hardware it is often much faster to recompute values than to have to reference memory to get a precomputed value.

      <p>Though generally well received at early stages, the project has been criticized as unrealistic.<p><a id="Technological_aspects" name="Technological_aspects"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Technological aspects</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <!--del_lnk--> Lee Felsenstein criticized the centralized, top-down, imperialistic design and distribution of the OLPC. Lee Felsenstein, currently of the <!--del_lnk--> Fonly Institute, draws upon his previous experience with distributed collaboration and <!--del_lnk--> open source hardware in the <!--del_lnk--> Homebrew Computer Club.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 9, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Intel Chairman <!--del_lnk--> Craig Barrett criticised the project for being a &quot;$100 gadget&quot;: &quot;... The problem is that gadgets have not been successful... It turns out what people are looking for is something that has the full functionality of a PC. Reprogrammable to run all the applications of a grown-up PC .... not dependent on servers in the sky to deliver content and capability to them, not dependent for hand cranks for power.&quot; On March 15, 2006, after having introduced the <!--del_lnk--> Ultra Mobile PC, <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Gates.htm" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> mocked the project, saying &ldquo;If you are going to go have people share the computer, get a broadband connection and have somebody there who can help support the user, geez, get a decent computer where you can actually read the text and you&#39;re not sitting there cranking the thing while you&#39;re trying to type.&rdquo;<p><a id="Good_use_of_money" name="Good_use_of_money"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Good use of money</span></h3>
      <p>At the <!--del_lnk--> UN conference in Tunisia, several <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> officials, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Marthe Dansokho of <a href="../../wp/c/Cameroon.htm" title="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mohammed Diop of <a href="../../wp/m/Mali.htm" title="Mali">Mali</a> were suspicious of the motives of the project, and claimed that the project was using an overly American mindset that presented solutions not applicable to specifically African problems. Dansokho said the project demonstrated misplaced priorities, stating that clean water and schools were more important for African women, who he stated would not have time to use the computers to research new crops to grow, and Diop specifically attacked the project as an attempt to exploit the governments of poor nations by making them pay for hundreds of millions of machines.<p>One criticism has been that the money of purchasing the laptops could be more favorably spent on libraries and schools. John Wood, founder of <!--del_lnk--> Room to Read, has emphasized what is affordable and can scale over high-tech solutions. While in favour of the One Laptop Per Child initative for providing education to children in the developing world at a cheaper rate, he has pointed out that a $2000 library can serve 400 children, costing just $5 a child to bring access to a wide range of books in the local languages (such as <!--del_lnk--> Khmer or <!--del_lnk--> Nepali) and English; also a $10,000 school can serve 400-500 children ($20&ndash;$25 a child). According to Wood, these are more appropriate solutions for education in the dense forests of <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> or rural <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>.<p>According to the OLPC wiki:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>It should be mentioned that a common criticism of the project is to say, &quot;What poor people need is food and shelter, not laptops.&quot; This comment, however, is ignorant of conditions in impoverished nations around the world. While it is true there are many people in the world who definitely need food and shelter, there are multitudes of people who live in rural or sub-urban areas and have plenty to eat and reasonable accommodations. What these people don&#39;t have is a decent shot at a good education.</td>

      <p>Another criticism is that developed countries are giving poorer children laptops before they give their own children laptops. It is claimed that many children in the United States and other developed countries would benefit much more from the use of a laptop than children in undeveloped countries. In fact, some states in the U.S. (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Maine and <!--del_lnk--> Georgia) are providing commercial laptops to pupils <!--del_lnk-->  and the OLPC FAQ responds to the question: &quot;Will the laptop be available for relatively developed nations?&quot; by stating &quot;We are exploring the possibility of developing a commercial version and we are in discussions with representatives from these nations about distribution of the non-commercial version. However, our priority is to make the laptop available first where there is the greatest need.&quot; The <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth of Massachusetts is one of the initial participants in OLPC.<p>The project has also received criticism due to the environmental and health impacts of hazardous materials found in computers. Many nations and organizations are working towards the development of &ldquo;<!--del_lnk--> Green Electronics&rdquo; (e.g. European Union with <!--del_lnk--> Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive). While any project on this scale will have <!--del_lnk--> environmental impact, OLPC has asserted that it is aiming to use as <!--del_lnk--> environmentally friendly materials as they can; also that the laptop and all OLPC-supplied accessories will be fully <!--del_lnk--> RoHS compliant; and that the laptop will use an order of magnitude less power than the typical consumer laptops available today (as of 2006), reducing the environmental burden of power generation..<p>Some people are criticizing the idea of not selling 2B1 on the open market. One concern is the possibility of <!--del_lnk--> arbitrage. If 2B1 is only made available in certain areas and to certain parties, a parallel black market for the laptops may develop. An arbitrageur could find a way to obtain the laptops for the going rate and resell them in the black market for a higher price. The presence of a black market could also encourage the intended owners to sell their laptops. Nicholas Negroponte addressed this concern during his presentation in the Emerging technologies Conference in September 2005:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

        <td>The grey market is a very serious issue. I don&#39;t want to be dismissive of it for a moment, and there are three ways of addressing it. Way number one is to have no market at all for it. I mean you can&#39;t sell it, who could buy it, and that isn&#39;t bullet proof. That&#39;s a little bit dreaming, but it&#39;s part of the equation. The second is to put the technologies into the device that help stop that. [The laptops distributed to middle schoolers in Maine are Apple iBooks] so they are not only great stuff to steal and we don&#39;t necessarily have corruption of that kind, but it&#39;s pretty transferable technology. They&#39;ve put little things so the machine disables itself after a while if it hasn&#39;t connected to the school. You can put GPS in it, you can put all sorts of stuff. But then the third one, which I&#39;m doing and I like is to make this machine so distinctive that it is socially a stigma to be carrying one if you are not a child or a teacher. Now you can obviously take it down to your basement, but I hope your spouse will even say: &quot;Oh God! Honey! What did you do?&quot; OK? you stole from the church. It&#39;s like a red cross on something. So I&#39;m hoping that the distinctiveness of the product will be the third one that maybe isn&#39;t thought of that often. So those three combined will I hope at least limit this to one percent or two percent. It&#39;s not going to be just going into it.</td>
