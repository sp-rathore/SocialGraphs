      <p>The <b>Oz books</b> form a <!--del_lnk--> book series that begins with <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, and that relates the &quot;history&quot; of the <!--del_lnk--> Land of Oz. Oz was originally created by author <!--del_lnk--> L. Frank Baum, who went on to write fourteen Oz books. Although most of the Oz books are strictly adventures, Baum&mdash;as well as many later Oz authors&mdash;styled themselves as &quot;Royal Historians&quot; of Oz. Later authors wrote 26 other &quot;official&quot; books after Baum&#39;s death. Many other authors have put their own twists on Oz, notably <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Maguire&#39;s revisionist <i><!--del_lnk--> Wicked</i>.<p>

      <p>The first fourteen books by the original author, <!--del_lnk--> L. Frank Baum, another nineteen by <!--del_lnk--> Ruth Plumly Thompson, and another seven books by various other authors comprise the &quot;Famous Forty&quot;, which is considered the classic original series (though many inconsistencies make it difficult to call it canonical). Most of the books in the &quot;Famous Forty&quot; were published by Reilly and Britton (later Reilly and Lee).<p>Other books were printed later, by different publishing houses. As the earlier works have fallen out of <!--del_lnk--> copyright into the <!--del_lnk--> public domain (including all of L. Frank Baum&#39;s titles), numerous other books have been written in the series by many authors and publishers, some of whom continue to publish new works today.<p>In fact, so many additional Oz books have been written, that merely attempting to document all such books is a weighty endeavor in and of itself (see: <!--del_lnk--> External links). Some small publishers have even specialised in publishing Oz <!--del_lnk--> pastiches, of which the most commercial are probably Books of Wonder, Hungry Tiger Press, and The International Wizard of Oz Club&mdash;and perhaps the <a href="../../wp/g/Graphic_novel.htm" title="Graphic novel">graphic novels</a> of <!--del_lnk--> Eric Shanower. There are also alternative series of Oz books, such as the sequels written in Russian by <!--del_lnk--> Alexander M. Volkov, or the books of Frank Baum&#39;s great-grandson, Roger S. Baum. Then there are the &quot;revisionist&quot; books of <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Maguire. The following list therefore contains Oz books written by the authors of the first &quot;Famous Forty&quot; (including those published in later years). Others, including Volkov and Maguire&#39;s are listed below.<p><a id="List_of_.22canonical.22_Oz_books_.28.22The_Famous_Forty.22.29" name="List_of_.22canonical.22_Oz_books_.28.22The_Famous_Forty.22.29"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">List of &quot;canonical&quot; Oz books (&quot;The Famous Forty&quot;)</span></h2>

Gottschalk as <i>The Tik-Tok Man of Oz</i>. Also in 1909, he wrote a play called <i>The Girl from Oz</i>. The manuscript is held in the archives at <!--del_lnk--> Syracuse University, but apparently its relation to Oz is little more than nominal (it is also known as <i>The Girl from Tomorrow</i> and was later adapted for radio by <!--del_lnk--> Frank Joslyn Baum, as is also the case with the short story, &quot;The Littlest Giant&quot;, a rather brutal tale designated in two lines to be in the Gillikin country of Oz. With Gottschalk writing the music, he wrote an unproduced stage version of <i>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</i> in November 1913, that was developed into the film scenario.<p><a id="Alternate_Oz" name="Alternate_Oz"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Alternate Oz</span></h2>
