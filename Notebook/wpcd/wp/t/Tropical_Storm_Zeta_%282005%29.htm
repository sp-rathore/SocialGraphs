      <p><b>Tropical Storm Zeta</b> was a late-developing <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical storm">tropical storm</a> over the central <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic which formed after the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> had officially ended, and continued into January. It extended the record number of storms in a season to twenty-eight.<p>Zeta developed late on <!--del_lnk--> December 29 and headed to the west.

Like the previous tropical cyclone <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Epsilon_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Epsilon (2005)">Hurricane Epsilon</a>, Zeta defied these predictions. The storm reached its peak strength on <!--del_lnk--> January 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 before finally dissipating on <!--del_lnk--> January 6. As Zeta never approached land there was no impact from the storm.<p>

      <p>Late on <!--del_lnk--> December 29, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, a tropical depression developed in the east-central Atlantic from a <!--del_lnk--> frontal <!--del_lnk--> trough and became a tropical storm early the next day. As this was more than four weeks after the official end of the season, the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre didn&#39;t operationally notice the system until after it had already become a tropical storm. Initially the storm headed to the northwest but stalled late on <!--del_lnk--> December 31 before heading westwards, gradually strengthening to winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) as it did so. As with the previous storm, <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Epsilon_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Epsilon (2005)">Hurricane Epsilon</a>, the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre continuously forecast that Zeta would weaken in response to high level shear but Zeta held onto its strength, like Epsilon had done.<p>Tropical Storm Zeta weakened slightly on <!--del_lnk--> January 2, before intensifying further to its peak strength with 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) winds. One of the models suggested that Zeta could strengthen further and become a hurricane but this did not occur. Tropical Storm Zeta continued to defy forecasts of weakening and on <!--del_lnk--> January 4 increasing frustration led NHC forecaster, Dr. <!--del_lnk--> Lixion Avila to say that he had &quot;run out of things to say&quot;.<p>The effects of wind shear finally took their toll late on <!--del_lnk--> January 4, and Zeta&#39;s convection began to die down. This led to Tropical Storm Zeta weakening to a minimal tropical storm. The NHC continued to overestimate how quickly Zeta would dissipate and early on <!--del_lnk--> January 5 they operationally downgraded Zeta to a depression, which was later confirmed to have been an error. Zeta continued to move west-northwestward, barely holding on to tropical storm status before becoming disorganized again. Zeta weakened into a tropical depression on <!--del_lnk--> January 6 and dissipated into a remnant later that day, finally ending the 2005 season. The remnant low retained its identity for a further day before it dissipated 660 miles (1060 km) southeast of <a href="../../wp/b/Bermuda.htm" title="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>.<p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>
      <p>Several of the crews that were taking part in the 2005 <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Rowing Race were affected with heavy seas and strong adverse winds from Tropical Storm Zeta. The ship <i>Liberty Star</i> made several reports of strong winds from Tropical Storm Zeta, including one of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) winds early on <!--del_lnk--> December 31, when the ship was about 45&nbsp;miles (75&nbsp;km) north of the centre of the storm.<p>Tropical Storm Zeta never threatened land so no coastal <!--del_lnk--> watches or warnings were issued. There was no reported damage or fatalities from Zeta.<p><a id="Records" name="Records"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Records</span></h2>
      <p>When Tropical Storm Zeta formed at 0600 <!--del_lnk--> UTC on <!--del_lnk--> December 31, it became the second latest-forming tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Atlantic, forming about six hours earlier than <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Alice did in 1954. Zeta is only the second <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic tropical cyclone on record to have existed in two calendar years (after Alice). Tropical Storm Zeta also extended the record number of storms to form in the 2005 season to twenty-eight, seven more than the previous record held by the <!--del_lnk--> 1933 season.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Zeta_%282005%29&quot;</div>
