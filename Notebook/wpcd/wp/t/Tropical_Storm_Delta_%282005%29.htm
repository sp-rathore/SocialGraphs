      <p><b>Tropical Storm Delta</b> was a late-forming tropical storm of the <a href="../../wp/2/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2005 Atlantic hurricane season">2005 Atlantic hurricane season</a> which struck the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands as a strong <!--del_lnk--> extratropical storm causing significant damage and then crossed over <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> with little impact there. It was the twenty-sixth tropical or subtropical storm of the season.<p>Tropical Storm Delta, like most late-season storms, developed out of an <!--del_lnk--> extratropical low. The storm only gradually gained tropical characteristics and was briefly a <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storm on <!--del_lnk--> November 22. Delta moved erratically for a few days before moving towards the Canary Islands. It became extratropical just before it passed to the north of the archipelago.<p>

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 22, a non-tropical area of low pressure in the central <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> began to gain some tropical characteristics. Late that afternoon the low became <!--del_lnk--> Subtropical Storm Delta, while located over 800 miles (1300 km) west-southwest of the Azores. Operationally the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre considered that the storm had already gained enough tropical characteristics to be classified as a tropical storm, but in post-storm analysis this was reconsidered.<p>The storm&#39;s convection became more organized and Delta became a tropical storm on <!--del_lnk--> November 24. It strengthened further to its peak strength of 70 mph (110 km/h) later that day, just below hurricane strength. The official forecast at this time predicted that Delta would strengthen further and become a minimal hurricane, but this did not occur. Delta maintained this strength for a few days as it moved slowly and erratically in the central Atlantic. As shear increased over the storm, a weakening trend began on <!--del_lnk--> November 25 and by the end of the next day Delta had weakened into a minimal tropical storm. Some of the computer models showed that the weakening tropical storm could be absorbed by a developing low to the west, which a few days later became <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Epsilon_%25282005%2529.htm" title="Hurricane Epsilon (2005)">Hurricane Epsilon</a>. This did not occur, and Tropical Storm Delta began to move to the northeast.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>As Delta accelerated to the northeast towards the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on <!--del_lnk--> November 27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted that there was a possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On <!--del_lnk--> November 28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The <!--del_lnk--> extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105 miles (165 km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a> early on <!--del_lnk--> November 29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that day over northwestern <a href="../../wp/a/Algeria.htm" title="Algeria">Algeria</a>.<p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>

      <p>Considerable damage was reported in the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands as a result of Delta, where it was described as a &quot;historic&quot; event, as hurricanes are extremely rare there. The islands of <!--del_lnk--> Tenerife and <!--del_lnk--> La Palma were hardest hit, with many uprooted trees and <!--del_lnk--> landslides reported there. The peak gust recorded at La Palma was 152&nbsp;km/h (95&nbsp;mph), and at Tenerife the maximum gust was 147&nbsp;km/h (90&nbsp;mph). One <!--del_lnk--> hospital had to be evacuated and several <!--del_lnk--> airports were closed across the islands. In all, over 225,000 customers lost <a href="../../wp/e/Electricity.htm" title="Electricity">electricity</a> and many lost <a href="../../wp/t/Telephone.htm" title="Telephone">telephone</a> service.<p>In addition, a famous natural tourist attraction, <!--del_lnk--> El Dedo de Dios (or God&#39;s finger), a geological feature which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium and an important landmark for the Canary Islands, was destroyed by Delta&#39;s winds and wave action along <!--del_lnk--> Gran Canaria&#39;s shore. Delta claimed seven lives; six of them were immigrants that were on a boat that sank off the Canary Islands and 12 were reported missing. The seventh was a result of winds throwing a man off a house while it was being repaired during the storm.<p>The total damage caused by Tropical Storm Delta throughout the Canaries was estimated to be over &euro;312 million ($364 million 2005 <!--del_lnk--> US dollars). Delta was also blamed for a 10-15% reduction of the islands tuna catch, as it kept the fishermen in port for several days.<p>Delta was described as a &quot;normal atmospheric disturbance&quot; in Morocco and no damage was reported there. In fact, it was welcomed as farmers needed the rain there to complete the sowing of <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereal</a> crops.<p>
