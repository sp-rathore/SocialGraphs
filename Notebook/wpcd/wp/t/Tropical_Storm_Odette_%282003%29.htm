      <p><b>Tropical Storm Odette</b> was a rare out-of-season tropical storm that affected the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> in December of 2003. The fifteenth tropical storm of the <a href="../../wp/2/2003_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2003 Atlantic hurricane season">2003 Atlantic hurricane season</a>, Odette formed near the coast of <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> a few days after the official end of the <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic hurricane season, and ultimately made landfall on the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> as a moderate tropical storm.<p>The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Dominican Republic from unusually heavy rainfall in December. Preparation preceding Odette&#39;s landfall resulted in only 8 deaths and 14 injuries. Total damage is unknown, though crop damage in the Dominican Republic totaled to over $8 million (2003 USD, $8.8 million 2006 USD).<p>

      <p>A cold front extended through the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> in late November. A low pressure area developed north of <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a> on <!--del_lnk--> December 1, and as it drifted northeastward, it slowly organized. Convection organized with the approach of a tropical wave, and on <!--del_lnk--> December 4, Tropical Depression Twenty formed 345 miles south of <!--del_lnk--> Kingston, Jamaica. Generally favorable conditions for development continued, and the depression became Tropical Storm Odette later on the 4th.<p>Odette strengthened in spite of being impacted by southwesterly shear, reaching its peak of 65 mph on <!--del_lnk--> December 6. The low-level circulation slowed down, while the storm&#39;s strong convection continued ahead of the storm. Because of this, the storm weakened slightly to a 60 mph tropical storm by the time it made landfall on <!--del_lnk--> Cabo Falso, Dominican Republic. It crossed the island, and upon reaching the Atlantic, lost much organization. On the 7th, Odette became extratropical, and continued northeast as an extratropical storm for two more days before dissipating.<p><a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>

      <p>Prior to Odette&#39;s predicted arrival, the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a> government issued for the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, mostly from those living near rivers. At least 2,000 shelters were set up, capable of housing up to 800,000 people. In addition, the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes. Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> tropical storm watch was issued between <!--del_lnk--> Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/<a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> border on the 4th 56 hours prior to landfall. This was raised to a tropical storm warning on the 5th while 32 hours before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warning were issued for all of the Haitian coastline and <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>. <p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>
      <p>While over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, Odette dropped heavy rainfall, including prior to its formation. For several days, the storm caused rains in <a href="../../wp/p/Panama.htm" title="Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Costa_Rica.htm" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>, and the east coast of <a href="../../wp/n/Nicaragua.htm" title="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>. In <a href="../../wp/c/Colombia.htm" title="Colombia">Colombia</a>, the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches (200 mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Columbiana. In <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, flooding several roads in <!--del_lnk--> Saint Ann and <!--del_lnk--> Saint Mary Parishes.

      <p>Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were relatively light across the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in <!--del_lnk--> Santo Domingo. The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours, amounting to a maximum of 9.07 inches (230 mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Isla Saona. Several other locations reported over 4 inches as well. The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding, forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains. In addition, a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo, destroying one house and uproofing several others.<p>The flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60,000 homes and destroyed 34. Gusty winds caused power outages. River flooding caused two bridges to collapse, isolating several communities. Landslides buried several roads, though authorities quickly repaired them. The rainfall also flooded fields, resulting in severe crop damage. As much as 85% of the banana crop was lost, while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season. Crop damage totaled to around $8 million (2003 USD, $8.8 million 2006 USD). In addition, excess flooding contaminated water supplies, leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation.<p>In all, Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries, mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides. In addition, two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks. Neighboring <a href="../../wp/h/Haiti.htm" title="Haiti">Haiti</a> experienced little from the storm.<p><a id="Puerto_Rico_and_United_States_Virgin_Islands" name="Puerto_Rico_and_United_States_Virgin_Islands"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands</span></h3>

      <p>Though Odette passed 280 miles to the west of <!--del_lnk--> Mayag&uuml;ez, Puerto Rico, the storm caused moderate rainfall across <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Virgin_Islands.htm" title="United States Virgin Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>. Rainfall in Puerto Rico was heaviest in the southeast, where a peak of 8.73 inches was recorded in <!--del_lnk--> Jajome Alto. The storm also caused up to 2.2 inches of rainfall in <!--del_lnk--> Christiansted on <!--del_lnk--> Saint Croix.<p>Odette&#39;s rainfall caused flooding throughout the <!--del_lnk--> island&#39;s rivers. The river flooding destroyed three bridges, resulting in $20,000 in damages (2003 USD). The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in <!--del_lnk--> Humacao. The rainfall also covered numerous roads, though overall damage was minimal throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>In all, 65,000 people were affected by Tropical Storm Odette. The Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers to the impacted areas, primarily in the area of <!--del_lnk--> Montecristi. The organization provided food and hygiene kits to thousands of people, as well as mosquito nets. The Red Cross also gave a 5,000 liter water tank for the citizens in Montecristi, an area without clean water or sanitation.<p><a id="Records" name="Records"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Records</span></h2>
      <p>When Odette formed on <!--del_lnk--> December 4, it became the first tropical storm since the beginning of the modern <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_cyclone.htm" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> record to form in the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> in the month of <!--del_lnk--> December; a documented December Caribbean hurricane occurred in <!--del_lnk--> 1822 . However, <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Karen, which formed in November of 1989, persisted until December while located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. In addition, Odette was the first Atlantic storm to form in the month of December since <!--del_lnk--> Hurricane Lili in 1984.<p>The 2003 season was the first season since <!--del_lnk--> 1953 to have a pre-season storm and a post-season storm, with <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Ana_%25282003%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Ana (2003)">Ana</a> in April and Odette.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Odette_%282003%29&quot;</div>
