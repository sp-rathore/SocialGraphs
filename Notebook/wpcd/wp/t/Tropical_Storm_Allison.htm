      <p><b>Tropical Storm Allison</b> was a <!--del_lnk--> tropical storm that devastated southeast <!--del_lnk--> Texas in June of the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. The first storm of the season, Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 15 days. The storm developed from a <!--del_lnk--> tropical wave in the northern <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 4, and struck the northern <!--del_lnk--> Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, then turned back to the south and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, making landfall on <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana and then moving across the southeast <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Mid-Atlantic. Allison was the first storm since <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 to strike the upper Texas coastline.<p>The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over 40&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> inches (1000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mm) in Texas. The worst of the flooding occurred in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston</a>, where most of Allison&#39;s damage occurred. There, 30,000 became homeless after the flooding destroyed 2,744 homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. 23 people died in Texas. Throughout its entire path, Allison caused $6.05&nbsp;billion (2006 USD) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana and southeastern <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania.<p>Following the storm, President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> declared 75 counties along Allison&#39;s path as disaster areas, which allowed the affected citizens to apply for aid. Allison is the only tropical storm to have its name retired without ever reaching hurricane strength.<p>

      <p>A tropical wave moved off the coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> on <!--del_lnk--> May 21. It moved westward across the shear-ridden <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, retaining little convection on its way. After moving across <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> and the southwestern <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, the wave entered the eastern North <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> on <!--del_lnk--> June 1. A low level circulation developed on the 2nd while 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) south-southeast of <!--del_lnk--> Salina Cruz, <a href="../../wp/m/Mexico.htm" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on the 3rd. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on the 4th, and developed deep convection on its eastern side. On <!--del_lnk--> June 5, the mid-level circulation extended to the surface, and organized into Tropical Storm Allison while just 140&nbsp;miles (225&nbsp;km) to the south of <!--del_lnk--> Galveston, Texas.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Allison initially had <!--del_lnk--> subtropical characteristics with an upper level low to the southwest of the circulation. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to a 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h) storm, though tropical storm force winds extended up to 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) east of the centre. Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near <!--del_lnk--> Freeport, Texas as a 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm late on <!--del_lnk--> June 5. The storm quickly weakened over land, and the National Hurricane Centre discontinued advisories early on the 6th. The depression drifted northward until reaching <!--del_lnk--> Lufkin, Texas, where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north. On <!--del_lnk--> June 8, the depression drifted to the south, then to the southwest. Early on the 10th, Allison again reached the <a href="../../wp/g/Gulf_of_Mexico.htm" title="Gulf of Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> just 22&nbsp;miles (35&nbsp;km) west of its original landfall location. Due to dry air and moderate westerly wind shear, the storm transformed into a subtropical cyclone. While the subtropical depression moved eastward, a new low level circulation redeveloped to the east, and Allison quickly made landfall on <!--del_lnk--> Morgan City, Louisiana on the 11th. Strong thunderstorms redeveloped over the circulation, and Allison strengthened into a subtropical storm over southeastern <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana.<div class="thumb tleft">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>Allison re-strengthened to reach winds of 45&nbsp;mph (72&nbsp;km/h), and an eyewall feature briefly existed. The feature was transient, and Allison quickly weakened back to a tropical depression. The depression tracked to the east-northeast through <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi, <!--del_lnk--> Alabama, <!--del_lnk--> Georgia, and <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina before becoming nearly stationary near <!--del_lnk--> Wilmington, North Carolina. It drifted through the state, and accelerated to the northeast in response to an approaching cold front. Allison reached the Atlantic Ocean on <!--del_lnk--> June 17, and briefly reintensified to a <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storm through baroclinic processes. Allison became extratropical while south of <!--del_lnk--> Long Island on the 18th, and was absorbed by the cold front on the 19th.<p><a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>
      <p>Shortly after forming, officials in <!--del_lnk--> Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for the western end of <!--del_lnk--> Galveston Island. This was due to fears of coastal flooding, as the area was not protected by the <!--del_lnk--> Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the <!--del_lnk--> Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in <!--del_lnk--> Surfside in <!--del_lnk--> Brazoria County. Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near <!--del_lnk--> Sabine Pass in <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson County, Texas, though few left. Also, when the <!--del_lnk--> National Hurricane Centre issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Warnings from <!--del_lnk--> Sargent, Texas to <!--del_lnk--> Morgan City, Louisiana, just 3 hours before tropical storm winds were observed.<p>After the storm made landfall, <!--del_lnk--> flash flood watches and warnings were issued for numerous areas in eastern Texas. In addition, traveling was discouraged due to the threat for flash flooding. During the flood event, the National Weather Service in Houston issued 99 flash flood warnings with an average lead time of 40&nbsp;minutes. In addition, there were only nine warnings that were false alarms. With an average lead time of 24&nbsp;minutes, the National Weather Service in <!--del_lnk--> Lake Charles, Louisiana issued 47&nbsp;flash flood warnings, of which eleven were false alarms. One flash flood occurred outside of the warning area. With an average lead time of 39&nbsp;minutes, the National Weather Service in New Orleans/Baton Rouge issued 87&nbsp;flash flood warnings, of which 30 were not followed by a flash flood. In addition, there were five flash floods not covered in the warning area.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> Tallahassee, Florida, a shelter was opened the day prior to Allison moving north through the area, with seven staff members housing 12&nbsp;people. Two other shelters were put on standby. Teams informed citizens in the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle of flood dangers.<p><a id="Impact" name="Impact"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Impact</span></h2>

      <p>Tropical Storm Allison was a major flooding disaster throughout its path from <!--del_lnk--> Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in <a href="../../wp/h/Houston%252C_Texas.htm" title="Houston, Texas">Houston, Texas</a>, where over 35&nbsp;inches (890&nbsp;mm) of rain fell. Allison killed 41&nbsp;people, of which 27 drowned from the flooding. The storm also caused over $5&nbsp;billion in damage (2001 USD, $6.05&nbsp;billion 2006 USD), making Allison the deadliest and costliest tropical storm on record in the United States.<p><a id="Texas" name="Texas"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Texas</span></h3>
      <p>Allison made landfall with a storm surge of two to three feet. Combined with waves on top, areas of <!--del_lnk--> Galveston Island experienced a wall of water 8&nbsp;feet (2.5&nbsp;m) in height, creating <!--del_lnk--> overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43&nbsp;mph (69&nbsp;km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77&nbsp;inches (248&nbsp;mm) in Galveston, 12.13&nbsp;inches (308&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast. Minimal beach erosion was reported. Impact was minimal near the coast.<p>While moving northward through <!--del_lnk--> Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts. Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in <!--del_lnk--> Manvel of <!--del_lnk--> Brazoria County, causing damage to one home. Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12 inches (200 to 300&nbsp;mm) were common in Galveston and <!--del_lnk--> Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40 inches (1033 mm) in northwestern <!--del_lnk--> Jefferson County. In the <!--del_lnk--> Port of Houston, a total of 36.99&nbsp;inches (940&nbsp;mm) was reported.<div class="thumb tright">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Houston experienced torrential rainfall in a short amount of time. 6.3&nbsp;inches (160&nbsp;mm) fell in just one hour, while 28.5&nbsp;inches (724&nbsp;mm) fell in only 12&nbsp;hours. The six-day rainfall in Houston amounted to 38.6&nbsp;inches (980&nbsp;mm). Two-thirds of the bayous and creeks in Harris County experienced 500-year flood events. Houston, which typically receives 46.07&nbsp;inches (1170&nbsp;mm) of rain in a year, experienced 35.7% of its expected total in the first nine days of June.<p>The deluge of rainfall flooded 95,000&nbsp;automobiles and 73,000&nbsp;houses throughout Harris County. Tropical Storm Allison destroyed 2,744&nbsp;homes, leaving 30,000&nbsp;homeless with residential damages totaling to $1.76&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $1.94&nbsp;billion 2006 USD). Residential neighborhoods inside and to the north of <!--del_lnk--> Interstate 610 were hardest hit.<p>Several hospitals in the <!--del_lnk--> Texas Medical Centre experienced severe damage from the storm. When the serious flooding began on <!--del_lnk--> June 9, hospitals evacuated more than 1,000&nbsp;patients. The flooding occurred through below-grade pedestrian tunnels that link many major buildings. Most lost power and backup power when basements, the area where power and research data were kept, flooded. The <!--del_lnk--> Baylor College of Medicine experienced the worst of the damage, totaling to $495&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $547&nbsp;million 2006 USD). There, the hospital lost 90,000&nbsp;research animals, 60,000&nbsp;tumor samples, and 25&nbsp;years of research data. Throughout the Medical centre, damage totaled to over $2&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $2.2&nbsp;billion 2006 USD). Most were reopened after a month, though it took much longer to become fully operational.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> underground tunnel system, which connects most large office buildings in Downtown Houston, was submerged, as were many streets and parking garages adjacent to the <!--del_lnk--> Buffalo Bayou. At the Theatre District, also in downtown, the Houston Symphony, Houston Grand Opera, and Alley Theatre lost millions of dollars of costumes, musical instruments, sheet music, archives and other artifacts. Local television stations ran all-night coverage of the deluge from <!--del_lnk--> June 8 through the next day, including <!--del_lnk--> KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio. By midnight <!--del_lnk--> June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was underwater, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground.<p>Despite massive flooding damage to entire neighborhoods there were no drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12&nbsp;deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in <!--del_lnk--> Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $5.7&nbsp;billion 2006 USD) throughout <!--del_lnk--> Texas.<p>Though Allison&#39;s flooding was extreme, it was not unprecedented. <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978 dropped over 46&nbsp;inches (1170&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in <!--del_lnk--> Bluff, Texas, which remains the record highest rainfall for a single storm in the state of Texas. In addition, <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Claudette in 1979 and a hurricane in 1921 produced rainfall totals of over 40&nbsp;inches (1015&nbsp;mm).<p><a id="Louisiana" name="Louisiana"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Louisiana</span></h3>

      <p>While making its first landfall, Allison&#39;s large circulation dropped severe rains on southwest <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana. Days later, Allison hit the state as a <!--del_lnk--> subtropical storm, dropping more heavy rains to the area. Rainfall totals peaked at 29.86&nbsp;inches (758&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Thibodaux, the highest rainfall total in Louisiana from a tropical cyclone since a previous <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Allison in 1989. Most of the southeastern portion of the state experienced over 10&nbsp;inches of rain (255&nbsp;mm). Winds were generally light, peaking at 38&nbsp;mph (61&nbsp;km/h) sustained in <!--del_lnk--> Lakefront with gusts to 53&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h) in <!--del_lnk--> Bay Gardene. The storm produced a storm surge of 2.5&nbsp;feet (0.75&nbsp;m) in <!--del_lnk--> Cameron as it was making landfall in Texas. While moving northward through Texas, the outer bands of the storm produced an <!--del_lnk--> F1 <a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornado</a> near <!--del_lnk--> Zachary, damaging several trees and a power line. A man was killed when a damaged power line hit his truck.<p>When Allison first made landfall, heavy rainfall flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10&nbsp;houses in <!--del_lnk--> Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000&nbsp;houses in <!--del_lnk--> St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in <!--del_lnk--> Saint Bernard Parish, and hundreds of houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800&nbsp;residents from their homes in <!--del_lnk--> East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The <!--del_lnk--> Bogue Falaya River in <!--del_lnk--> Covington crested past its peak twice to near record levels. The <!--del_lnk--> Amite and <!--del_lnk--> Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along the <!--del_lnk--> Bayou Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $72&nbsp;million 2006 USD).<p><a id="Southeast_United_States" name="Southeast_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Southeast United States</span></h3>

      </div>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> Mississippi, Allison produced heavy rainfall of over 10&nbsp;inches (255&nbsp;mm) in one night, while some areas in the southwestern portion of the state received over 15&nbsp;inches (380&nbsp;mm). The flooding damaged numerous houses and flooded many roadways. Thunderstorms from the storm produced four tornadoes, including one in <!--del_lnk--> Gulfport, Mississippi that damaged 10 houses. Severe thunderstorms in <!--del_lnk--> George County damaged 15 houses, destroyed 10, and injured five people. Damage in Mississippi totaled to over $1&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $1.1&nbsp;million 2006 USD). Rainfall in <!--del_lnk--> Alabama was moderate, with areas near <!--del_lnk--> Mobile experiencing more than 10&nbsp;inches (255&nbsp;mm). Heavy rainfall closed several roads in <!--del_lnk--> Crenshaw County. The storm, combined with a high pressure, produced coastal flooding in southern Alabama. Allison produced an <!--del_lnk--> F0 tornado in southwest <!--del_lnk--> Mobile County that caused minor roof damage and another F0 tornado in <!--del_lnk--> Covington County that caused minor damage to six homes and a church.<p>The storm, combined with a high pressure system, produced a strong pressure gradient, resulting in strong rip currents off the coast of <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The currents prompted sirens, which are normally used for storm warnings, to be activated in <!--del_lnk--> Pensacola Beach. The rip currents killed 5 off the coast of Florida. Outer rain bands from the storm dropped heavy rainfall across the <!--del_lnk--> Florida Panhandle of over 11&nbsp;inches (280&nbsp;mm) in one day. The <!--del_lnk--> Tallahassee Regional Airport recorded 10.13&nbsp;inches (257&nbsp;mm) in 24 hours, breaking the old 24 hour record set in 1969. Throughout the state, Allison destroyed 10&nbsp;homes and damaged 599, 196 severely, primarily in <!--del_lnk--> Leon County. Including the deaths from rip currents, Allison killed eight people in Florida and caused $20&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $22&nbsp;million 2006 USD) in damage.<p>Over <!--del_lnk--> Georgia, the storm dropped heavy rainfall of 10&nbsp;inches (255&nbsp;mm) in 24&nbsp;hours in locations. The deluge caused rivers to crest past their banks, including the <!--del_lnk--> Oconee River at <!--del_lnk--> Milledgeville which peaked at 33.7&nbsp;feet (10.3&nbsp;m). The rainfall, which was heaviest across the southwestern portion of the state, washed out several bridges and roads, and flooded many other roads. Georgia governor <!--del_lnk--> Roy Barnes declared a state of emergency for seven counties in the state. The storm also spawned two tornadoes. In <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina, Allison&#39;s outer bands produced 10&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/t/Tornado.htm" title="Tornado">tornadoes</a> and several funnel clouds, though most only caused minor damage limited to a damaged courthouse, snapped trees and downed power lines. Allison produced from 12 to 16&nbsp;inches (305 to 406&nbsp;mm) of rainfall in <!--del_lnk--> North Carolina, closing nearly all roads in <!--del_lnk--> Martin County and damaging 25&nbsp;homes. The severe flooding washed out a bridge in eastern <!--del_lnk--> Halifax County and flooded numerous cars. Wet roads caused nine traffic accidents throughout the state.<p><a id="Mid-Atlantic_and_Northeast_United_States" name="Mid-Atlantic_and_Northeast_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mid-Atlantic and Northeast United States</span></h3>

Several other rivers and creeks in southeastern Pennsylvania crested at over 10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m). The rainfall downed numerous weak trees and power lines, leaving 70,000 without power during the storm. The flooding washed out several roads and bridges, including a few <!--del_lnk--> SEPTA rail lines. In addition, the rainfall destroyed 241&nbsp;homes and damaged 1,386 others. Flooding at a <!--del_lnk--> Dodge dealership totaled 150&nbsp;vehicles. Hundreds of people were forced to be rescued from damaged buildings from flood waters. The flooding dislodged a clothes dryer in the basement of the &quot;A&quot; building of the Village Green Apartment Complex in Upper Moreland Township, breaking a natural gas line. The gas leak resulted in an explosion and an ensuing fire that killed six people. Firefighters were unable to render assistance as the building was completely surrounded by floodwaters. Additionally, one man drowned in his vehicle in a river. Damage in <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania totaled to $215&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $237&nbsp;million 2006 USD).<p>In <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey, the storm produced heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.1&nbsp;inches (205&nbsp;mm) in <!--del_lnk--> Tuckerton.

      <p>A few weeks after Allison, <!--del_lnk--> FEMA opened 6&nbsp;disaster recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The <!--del_lnk--> American Red Cross and the <!--del_lnk--> Salvation Army opened 48&nbsp;shelters at the peak of need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000&nbsp;meals. After the extensive damage to <!--del_lnk--> Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the <!--del_lnk--> Houston Police Academy. The team of 87&nbsp;medical personnel served over 1,000&nbsp;patients within two weeks of Allison&#39;s passage. Similarly, the <!--del_lnk--> National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. 35 volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>After nearly 50,000&nbsp;cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car&#39;s history. Following the extreme flooding, a <!--del_lnk--> mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people took advantage of the flood victims, including fraudulent contractors and suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.<p>By six months after the storm, around 120,000 <!--del_lnk--> Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05&nbsp;billion (2001 USD, $1.16&nbsp;billion 2006 USD). 17% of that was spent for temporary housing. In addition, Disaster Unemployment Assistance totaled to just under $1 million, while business loans totaled to $389&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $428&nbsp;million 2006 USD).<p>Like in Texas, a mosquito outbreak occurred in <!--del_lnk--> Louisiana. Only pesticides acceptable to the <!--del_lnk--> US Environmental Protection Agency and the <!--del_lnk--> US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners of the dangers of floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By three months after the storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $118&nbsp;million 2005 USD). $25&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $28&nbsp;million 2006 USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8 million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a> applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $1.4&nbsp;million 2006 USD). In <!--del_lnk--> Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $12.7&nbsp;million 2005 USD). $3.4&nbsp;million (2001 USD, $3.7&nbsp;million 2005 USD) of the total was to replace a <!--del_lnk--> SEPTA rail bridge over the <!--del_lnk--> Sandy Run Creek in <!--del_lnk--> Fort Washington.<p><a id="Retirement" name="Retirement"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Retirement</span></h2>
