      <p><b>Trafalgar Square</b> is a square in central <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> that commemorates the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Trafalgar (<!--del_lnk--> 1805), a <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Navy.htm" title="Royal Navy">British naval</a> victory of the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. The original name was to have been &quot;<a href="../../wp/w/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">King William the Fourth&#39;s</a> Square&quot;, but <!--del_lnk--> George Ledwell Taylor suggested the name &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot;. Its coordinates are <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;30&prime;28&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">0&deg;07&prime;39&Prime;W</span></span><span class="plainlinksneverexpand" id="coordinates"><!--del_lnk--> Coordinates: <!--del_lnk--> <span style="white-space:nowrap">51&deg;30&prime;28&Prime;N,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">0&deg;07&prime;39&Prime;W</span></span>.<p>The northern area of the square had been the site of the <!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Mews since the time of <a href="../../wp/e/Edward_I_of_England.htm" title="Edward I of England">Edward I</a>, while the southern end was the original <!--del_lnk--> Charing Cross, where the <!--del_lnk--> Strand from <!--del_lnk--> the City met <!--del_lnk--> Whitehall, coming north from <!--del_lnk--> Westminster. As the midpoint between these twin cities, Charing Cross is to this day considered the heart of London, from which all distances are measured.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1820s the <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">Prince Regent</a> engaged the landscape architect <!--del_lnk--> John Nash to redevelop the area. Nash cleared the square as part of his Charing Cross Improvement Scheme. The present architecture of the square is due to Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles Barry and was completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1845.<p>The square, a popular site for political <!--del_lnk--> demonstrations, is the site of <!--del_lnk--> Nelson&#39;s Column, and related sculptures of note.<p>

      <p>The square consist of a large central area surrounded by roadways on three sides, and stairs leading to the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Gallery%252C_London.htm" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a> on the other. The roads which cross the square form part of the busy <!--del_lnk--> A4 road, and prior to <!--del_lnk--> 2003, the square was surrounded by a one-way traffic system on all sides. <!--del_lnk--> Underpasses attached to <!--del_lnk--> Charing Cross tube station still allow pedestrians to avoid traffic. Recent works have reduced the width of the roads and closed the northern side of the square to traffic.<p><!--del_lnk--> Nelson&#39;s Column is in the centre of the square, surrounded by fountains designed by Sir <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Lutyens in 1939 and four huge <!--del_lnk--> bronze <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lions</a> sculpted by <!--del_lnk--> Sir Edwin Landseer; the metal used is said to have been recycled from the <!--del_lnk--> cannon of the French fleet. The column is topped by a <!--del_lnk--> statue of <!--del_lnk--> Lord Nelson, the <!--del_lnk--> admiral who commanded the British Fleet at <!--del_lnk--> Trafalgar.<p>On the north side of the square is the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Gallery%252C_London.htm" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a> and to its east the <!--del_lnk--> St Martin&#39;s-in-the-Fields church. The square adjoins <!--del_lnk--> The Mall via <!--del_lnk--> Admiralty Arch to the southwest. To the south is <!--del_lnk--> Whitehall, to the east <!--del_lnk--> Strand and <!--del_lnk--> South Africa House, to the north <!--del_lnk--> Charing Cross Road and on the west side is <!--del_lnk--> Canada House.<p>At the corners of the square are four <!--del_lnk--> plinths; the two northern ones were intended to be used for <!--del_lnk--> equestrian statues, and thus are wider than the two southern. Three of them hold <!--del_lnk--> statues: <a href="../../wp/g/George_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George IV of the United Kingdom">George IV</a> (northeast, <!--del_lnk--> 1840s), <!--del_lnk--> Henry Havelock (southeast, <!--del_lnk--> 1861, by <!--del_lnk--> William Behnes), and Sir <!--del_lnk--> Charles James Napier (southwest, <!--del_lnk--> 1855). <!--del_lnk--> Mayor of London <!--del_lnk--> Ken Livingstone controversially expressed a desire to see the two generals replaced with statues that &quot;ordinary Londoners would know&quot;. <!--del_lnk--> <p>On the lawn in front of the National Gallery are two statues, <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James II</a> to the west of the entrance portico and <a href="../../wp/g/George_Washington.htm" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> to the east. The latter statue, a gift from the state of <!--del_lnk--> Virginia, stands on soil that was imported from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>. This was done in order to honour Washington&#39;s declaration that he would never again set foot on British soil.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1888 the statue of General <!--del_lnk--> Charles George Gordon was erected. In <!--del_lnk--> 1943 the statue was removed and, in <!--del_lnk--> 1953, re-sited on the <!--del_lnk--> Victoria Embankment.<p>The Square has become an enormously important symbolic social and political location for visitors and Londoners alike, developing over its history from &quot;an <!--del_lnk--> esplanade peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country&rsquo;s foremost <i>place politique</i>,&quot; as historian <!--del_lnk--> Rodney Mace has written. Its symbolic importance was demonstrated in <!--del_lnk--> 1940 when the <a href="../../wp/n/Nazism.htm" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> <!--del_lnk--> SS developed secret plans to transfer Nelson&#39;s Column to <a href="../../wp/b/Berlin.htm" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> following an expected <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">German</a> invasion, as related by <!--del_lnk--> Norman Longmate in <i>If Britain Had Fallen</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1972).<p><a id="The_fourth_plinth" name="The_fourth_plinth"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The fourth plinth</span></h2>
      <p>The fourth plinth on the northwest corner was intended to hold a statue of <a href="../../wp/w/William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="William IV of the United Kingdom">William IV</a>, but remained empty due to insufficient funds. Later, agreement could not be reached over which monarch or military hero to place there.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1999, the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society of Arts conceived the idea of the <b>Fourth Plinth Project</b>, which temporarily occupied the plinth with a succession of works commissioned from three contemporary artists. These were:<ul>
       <li><i>Ecce Homo</i>, by <!--del_lnk--> Mark Wallinger (<!--del_lnk--> 1999)<li><i>Regardless of History</i>, by <!--del_lnk--> Bill Woodrow (<!--del_lnk--> 2000)<li><i>Monument</i>, by <!--del_lnk--> Rachel Whiteread (<!--del_lnk--> 2001)</ul>
      <p>Wallinger&#39;s <i>Ecce Homo</i> &mdash; whose title, in <!--del_lnk--> Latin, means &quot;behold the man&quot;, a <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">Biblical</a> reference &mdash; was of a life-sized man. Atop the huge plinth, designed for larger-than-life statuary, it looked minuscule. Some commentators said that, far from making the man look insignificant, his apparent tininess drew the eye powerfully; they interpreted it as a commentary on human delusions of grandeur.<p>Whiteread&#39;s <i>Monument</i>, by an artist already notable for her controversial <!--del_lnk--> Turner Prize-winning work &quot;House&quot; and the <!--del_lnk--> Judenplatz <!--del_lnk--> Holocaust Memorial in <a href="../../wp/v/Vienna.htm" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, was a cast of the plinth in transparent <!--del_lnk--> resin, and placed upside-down on top of the original. Following the exhibition project, some wished to see it continue in this role.<p>Various companies have used the plinth (often without permission) as a platform for publicity stunts, including a model of <a href="../../wp/d/David_Beckham.htm" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Madame Tussauds. The London-based American <!--del_lnk--> harmonica player <!--del_lnk--> Larry Adler jokingly suggested erecting a statue of <!--del_lnk--> Moby Dick, which would then be called the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Plinth of Whales&quot;.<p>The best use of the fourth plinth remains the subject of debate. On <!--del_lnk--> March 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2003 an appeal was launched by <!--del_lnk--> Wendy Woods, the widow of the anti-<!--del_lnk--> apartheid journalist <!--del_lnk--> Donald Woods, hoping to raise &pound;400,000 to pay for a nine-<!--del_lnk--> foot high statue of <a href="../../wp/n/Nelson_Mandela.htm" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> by <!--del_lnk--> Ian Walters. The relevance of the location is that <!--del_lnk--> South Africa House, the <a href="../../wp/s/South_Africa.htm" title="South Africa">South African</a> <!--del_lnk--> high commission, scene of many anti-apartheid demonstrations, is also located on Trafalgar Square.<p>A committee convened to consider the RSA&#39;s late-<!--del_lnk--> 1990s project concluded that it had been a success and &quot;unanimously recommended that the plinth should continue to be used for an ongoing series of temporary works of art commissioned from leading national and international artists&quot; <!--del_lnk--> . After several years in which the plinth stood empty, the new <!--del_lnk--> Greater London Authority assumed responsibility for the fourth plinth and started its own series of temporary exhibitions:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Marc Quinn: <i>Alison Lapper Pregnant</i> (<!--del_lnk--> September 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2005)<li><!--del_lnk--> Thomas Schutte: <i>Hotel for the Birds</i> (scheduled for April <!--del_lnk--> 2007)</ul>
      <p>Quinn&#39;s <i>Alison Lapper Pregnant</i> is a <!--del_lnk--> 3.6m marble <!--del_lnk--> torso-<!--del_lnk--> bust of <!--del_lnk--> Alison Lapper, an artist who was born with no arms and shortened legs due to a condition called <!--del_lnk--> phocomelia.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> television ident for the television station <!--del_lnk--> Channel 4 shows a <!--del_lnk--> CGI Channel 4 logo on top of the fourth plinth.<p><a id="Pigeons" name="Pigeons"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Pigeons</span></h2>

      <p>The square is a popular tourist spot in London, and used to be particularly famous for its <a href="../../wp/d/Dove.htm" title="Dove">pigeons</a> (<a href="../../wp/r/Rock_Pigeon.htm" title="Rock Pigeon">Rock Pigeons</a>). Feeding the pigeons was a popular activity with Londoners and tourists. The <!--del_lnk--> National Portrait Gallery displays a <!--del_lnk--> 1948 photograph of <!--del_lnk--> Elizabeth Taylor posing there with bird seed so as to be mobbed by birds. The desirability of the birds&#39; presence has long been contentious: their <!--del_lnk--> droppings look ugly on buildings and damage the stonework, and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered to be a health hazard. In <!--del_lnk--> 1996, police arrested one man who was estimated to have trapped 1500 birds for sale to a middleman; it is assumed that the birds ended up in the human <!--del_lnk--> food chain.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the sale of <!--del_lnk--> bird seed in the square was controversially terminated and other measures were introduced to discourage the pigeons, including the use of trained <!--del_lnk--> falcons. Supporters of the pigeons and some tourists continued to feed the birds, but, in <!--del_lnk--> 2003, <!--del_lnk--> Ken Livingstone enacted <!--del_lnk--> by-laws to ban the feeding of pigeons within the square <!--del_lnk--> . There are now relatively few birds in Trafalgar Square and it is used for festivals and hired out to film companies, in a way that was not feasible in the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s.<div class="center">

      <p>In 2003 the redevelopment of the north side of the square was completed. The work involved demolishing part of the wall and building a wide set of stairs. This construction includes two Saxon scissor lifts for disabled access, public toilets, and a small caf&eacute;. Plans for a large staircase had long been discussed, even in original plans for the square. The new stairs lead to a large terrace or <!--del_lnk--> piazza in front of the <a href="../../wp/n/National_Gallery%252C_London.htm" title="National Gallery, London">National Gallery</a>, in what was previously a road. Previously access between the square and the Gallery was via two busy crossings at the north east and north west corners of the square. The pedestrianisation plan was carried out in the face of protests from both road-users and pedestrians concerned that the diversion of traffic would lead to greater congestion elsewhere in London. However, this does not seem to have happened; the reduction in traffic due to the <!--del_lnk--> London congestion charge may be a factor.<p><a id="Christmas_ceremony" name="Christmas_ceremony"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Christmas ceremony</span></h2>
      <p>There has been a <!--del_lnk--> Christmas ceremony every year since <!--del_lnk--> 1947. A <!--del_lnk--> Norway Spruce (or sometimes a <!--del_lnk--> fir) is given by <a href="../../wp/n/Norway.htm" title="Norway">Norway</a>&#39;s capital <a href="../../wp/o/Oslo.htm" title="Oslo">Oslo</a> and presented as London&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Christmas tree, as a token of gratitude for Britain&#39;s support during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. (Besides the general war support, Norway&#39;s then <!--del_lnk--> King Haakon and his son <!--del_lnk--> Crown Prince Olav, as well as the country&#39;s government, lived in exile in London throughout the war.) As part of the tradition, the <!--del_lnk--> Lord Mayor of <!--del_lnk--> Westminster visits Oslo in the late autumn to take part in the chopping down of the tree, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mayor of Oslo then goes to London to light the tree at the Christmas ceremony.<p><a id="Political_demonstrations" name="Political_demonstrations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political demonstrations</span></h2>

      <p>Since its construction, Trafalgar Square has been a venue for political <!--del_lnk--> demonstrations, though the authorities have often attempted to ban them.<p>By March of the year <a href="../../wp/h/Horatio_Nelson%252C_1st_Viscount_Nelson.htm" title="Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson">Nelson&#39;s</a> column opened, the authorities had started banning <!--del_lnk--> Chartist meetings in the square. A general ban on political rallies remained in effect until the <!--del_lnk--> 1880s, when the emerging <!--del_lnk--> Labour movement, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> Social Democratic Federation, began holding protests there.<p>On &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Black Monday&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> 8 February <!--del_lnk--> 1886), protesters rallied against <!--del_lnk--> unemployment; this led to a <!--del_lnk--> riot in <!--del_lnk--> Pall Mall. A larger riot (called <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;) occurred in the square on <!--del_lnk--> 13 November <!--del_lnk--> 1887.<p>One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on <!--del_lnk--> 19 September <!--del_lnk--> 1961 by the <!--del_lnk--> Committee of 100, which included the philosopher <a href="../../wp/b/Bertrand_Russell.htm" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>. The protesters rallied for peace and against war and <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapon">nuclear weapons</a>.<p>Throughout the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s, a continuous anti-apartheid protest was held outside of South Africa House. More recently, the square has hosted the <!--del_lnk--> Poll Tax Riots (<!--del_lnk--> 1990) and <!--del_lnk--> anti-war demonstrations opposing the <!--del_lnk--> Afghanistan war and the <!--del_lnk--> Iraq war.<!--del_lnk--> <p>The Square was also scene to a large vigil held shortly after the <!--del_lnk--> terrorist bombings in London on Thursday <!--del_lnk--> 7 July <!--del_lnk--> 2005.<p><a id="Sports_events" name="Sports_events"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sports events</span></h2>
      <p>In recent years Trafalgar Square has become the location to the climax for <!--del_lnk--> victory parades for the <!--del_lnk--> England national rugby union team in the <!--del_lnk--> 2003 Rugby World Cup on the 9th December 2003 and on the 13th September 2005 was also the climax of the victory parade for the <!--del_lnk--> England national cricket team victory against the <!--del_lnk--> Australia national cricket team in <a href="../../wp/t/The_Ashes.htm" title="The Ashes">The Ashes</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 6 July <!--del_lnk--> 2005 Trafalgar Square was a gathering place for many London citizens to hear the announcement that they will host the <!--del_lnk--> 2012 Summer Olympics.<p><a id="VE_Day_celebrations" name="VE_Day_celebrations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">VE Day celebrations</span></h2>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day or VE Day) was <!--del_lnk--> May 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, the date when the Allies during the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War formally celebrated the defeat of <a href="../../wp/n/Nazi_Germany.htm" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the end of <a href="../../wp/a/Adolf_Hitler.htm" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Third Reich.<p>Trafalgar Square was filled with <!--del_lnk--> British subjects wanting to hear the formal announcement by Sir <a href="../../wp/w/Winston_Churchill.htm" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> that the war was over: it was packed to bursting point. Trafalgar Square was used as a place of celebration and people from all over the country came there. A diary extract told how a father took his three children and wife to Trafalgar Square, and they all held on to a piece of <!--del_lnk--> washing line so they didn&#39;t get lost in the massive crowd.<p>On Sunday <!--del_lnk--> 8 May <!--del_lnk--> 2005 the <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> held a concert to celebrate the 60th <!--del_lnk--> anniversary of <!--del_lnk--> VE Day which was hosted by <!--del_lnk--> Eamonn Holmes and <!--del_lnk--> Natasha Kaplinsky. Many people who lived during the war attended, and many of the much younger generation, but most importantly many old veterans came and told the stories of their hardships during the six years of war.<p><a id="New_Year_events" name="New_Year_events"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">New Year events</span></h2>
      <p>For many years, revellers celebrating the start of a <!--del_lnk--> New Year have gathered on the square, despite a lack of civic celebrations being arranged for them. The lack of official events in the square was partly because the authorities were concerned that actively encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding.<p>Hogmany at <a href="../../wp/e/Edinburgh.htm" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Scotland.htm" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> has instead been the focus for British New Year celebrations, although in recent years, a firework display from the <!--del_lnk--> London Eye and the banks of the Thames, near the square, has given spectators a fitting start to the New Year.<p><a id="Access" name="Access"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Access</span></h2>
