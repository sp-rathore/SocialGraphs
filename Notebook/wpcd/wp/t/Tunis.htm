      <p><b>Tunis</b> (<a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a>: &#x62A;&#x648;&#x646;&#x633;, <i>T&#x16B;nis</i>) is the <a href="../../wp/c/Capital.htm" title="Capital">capital</a> of the <!--del_lnk--> Tunisian Republic and also the <!--del_lnk--> Tunis Governorate, with a population of 699,700 in 2003. Informal estimates state that the population of greater Tunis approaches two million.<p>Situated on a large <a href="../../wp/m/Mediterranean_Sea.htm" title="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> gulf, (the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf of Tunis), behind the <!--del_lnk--> Lake of Tunis and the port of <!--del_lnk--> La Goulette (Halq al Wadi), the city extends along the coastal plain and the hills that surround it. At the centre of more modern development (colonial era and post) lies the old <!--del_lnk--> medina. Beyond this section lie the suburbs of Carthage, La Marsa, and Sidi Bou Said.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> medina is found at the centre of the city: a dense agglomeration of alleys and covered passages, full of intense scents and colours, boisterous and active trade, a surfeit of goods on offer ranging from leather to plastic, tin to the finest filigree, tourist souvenirs to the works of tiny crafts-shops.<p>Just through the Sea Gate (also known as the <i>Bab el Bahr</i> and the <i>Porte de France</i>), begins the modern city, or Ville Nouvelle, transversed by the grand Avenue Bourguiba (considered by many to be the Tunisian <!--del_lnk--> Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es), where the colonial-era buildings provide a clear contrast to smaller older structures. As the capital city of the country Tunis is the centre of Tunisian commercial activity, as well as focus of political and administrative life in the country. The expansion of the Tunisian economy in the last decades is reflected in the booming development of the outer city where one can see clearly the social challenges brought about by rapid modernization in Tunisia.<p>

The ancient city of <!--del_lnk--> Carthage is located just north of Tunis along the coast.<p>Tunis is located at <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 36&deg;50&prime;N 10&deg;9&prime;E</span> (<span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><!--del_lnk--> 36.8333&deg;&nbsp;N 10.15&deg;&nbsp;E</span>).<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Early_history" name="Early_history"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Early history</span></h3>
      <p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd millennium BCE a town, originally named Tunes, was founded by <!--del_lnk--> Libyans and also over time occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Berbers and <!--del_lnk--> Numidians. In the 9th century BCE, the city was taken over by <!--del_lnk--> Phoenicians from <!--del_lnk--> Carthage. The <!--del_lnk--> Berbers took control of Tunis in 395 BCE but it was soon lost when Agathocles invaded Africa and established his headquarters there. When Agathocles left Africa, the Carthaginians took control of the city once again.<p>In 146 <!--del_lnk--> BCE, the <!--del_lnk--> Romans destroyed Tunis (along with Carthage). However, the city was subsequently rebuilt under the rule of <a href="../../wp/a/Augustus.htm" title="Augustus">Augustus</a> and became an important town under Roman control and the centre of a booming agricultural industry.<p><a id="Islamic_Control" name="Islamic_Control"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Islamic Control</span></h3>
      <p>It was not until the 7th century, after the final destruction of Carthage, that the city achieved its own importance under the control of <!--del_lnk--> Arab <!--del_lnk--> Muslims. It was at this time that the <!--del_lnk--> medina of Tunis was first built.<p>From the 12th century to the 16th century, the old city was controlled by the <!--del_lnk--> Almohad and the <!--del_lnk--> Hafsids <!--del_lnk--> Berbers dynasties. During this time, Tunis was one of the richest and grandest cities in the <!--del_lnk--> Islamic world, with a population of about 100,000.<p><a id="Ottoman_rule_and_piracy" name="Ottoman_rule_and_piracy"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ottoman rule and piracy</span></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> took nominal control of the city in 1534. However, the former Sultan, <!--del_lnk--> Mulai-Hassan, fled to the court of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_V%252C_Holy_Roman_Emperor.htm" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Charles, who suffered at the hands of the <!--del_lnk--> corsairs, agreed to reinstate Mulai-Hassan in exchange for an acceptance of Charles&#39;s suzerainty by Mulai-Hassan. A naval expedition led by Charles himself was dispatched in 1535. The city was quickly recaptured; the victory against the pirates is recorded in a tapestry at the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Palace of Madrid. The resulting protectorate lasted until the Ottomans retook Tunis in 1574. After 1591, the Ottoman appointed governors (<!--del_lnk--> Beys) were relatively independent and piracy and trade continued to flourish.<p>In April 1655, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Robert Blake was sent to the Mediterranean to extract compensation from states that had been attacking English shipping. Only the Bey of Tunis refused to comply, with the result that Blake&#39;s 15 ships attacked the Bey&#39;s arsenal at Porto Farina (Ghar el Melh), destroying 9 Algerian ships and 2 shore batteries, the first time in naval warfare that shore batteries had been taken out without landing men ashore.<p><a id="European_colonialism" name="European_colonialism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">European colonialism</span></h3>
