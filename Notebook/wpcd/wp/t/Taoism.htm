      <p>The English word &quot;Taoism&quot; is used to translate the <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> terms <i>Daojiao</i> (&#x9053;&#x6559; &quot;teachings/religion of the Dao&quot;) and <i>Daojia</i> (&#x9053;&#x5BB6; &quot;school of the Dao&quot;). The character <i><!--del_lnk--> Tao</i> &#x9053; (or <i>Dao</i>, depending on the <!--del_lnk--> romanisation scheme) means &quot;path&quot; or &quot;way&quot;, but in <!--del_lnk--> Chinese religion and <!--del_lnk--> philosophy it has taken on more abstract meanings. The compound <i>Daojiao</i> refers to Daoism as a religion; <i>Daojia</i> refers to the activity of scholars in their studies. It must be noted that this distinction is itself controversial and fraught with <!--del_lnk--> hermeneutic difficulty.<p>Much uncertainty exists over the meaning of &quot;Taoism,&quot; not least because of its often being confused with such seemingly similar disciplines such as <!--del_lnk--> Zen. In some countries and contexts (for example, the &quot;Taoism&quot; organisations of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>), the label is applied to <!--del_lnk--> Chinese folk religion, which would otherwise not have a readily recognisable English name. However many, if not most, of its practitioners would not recognise &quot;Taoism&quot; (in any language) as the name of their religion. Moreover, the several forms of what we might call &quot;elite&quot; or &quot;organised&quot; Taoism often distinguish their ritual activities from those of the folk religion, which some professional &quot;Taoists&quot; (<i>Daoshi</i>) tend to view as debased.<p><!--del_lnk--> Chinese alchemy, <!--del_lnk--> astrology, <!--del_lnk--> cuisine, several <!--del_lnk--> Chinese martial arts, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese traditional medicine, <!--del_lnk--> fengshui, and many styles of <!--del_lnk--> qigong breath training disciplines have some relationship with Taoism.<p>

      <p>Depending on how it is defined, Taoism&#39;s origins may be traced to prehistoric Chinese religions; to the composition of the &quot;Tao Te Ching/Dao de Jing&quot; (<!--del_lnk--> 3rd or <!--del_lnk--> 4th century BCE); or to the activity of Zhang Daoling (<!--del_lnk--> 2nd century AD). Alternatively, one could argue that &quot;Taoism&quot; as a religious identity only arose later, by way of contrast with the newly-arrived religion of Buddhism, or with the fourth-century codification of the Shangching and Lingbao texts.<p>Other accounts credit Laozi (reputed author of the Tao Te Ching/Dao de Jing) as the teacher of both Buddha, and Confucius, and alledged Laozi to have had thirteen incarnates starting in the reign of <!--del_lnk--> Fuxi, one of the <!--del_lnk--> Three August Ones and Five Emperors up till his last as Laozi who lived over 900 years. They describe early Taoism (Daoism) to ancient picture writing, mysticism, and indigenous Ancestor worship. Symbology on tortoise shells predates early Chinese calligraphy and is the basis of written Chinese from artifacts dated from prior to 1600 BCE.<p>Legend has it that while passing through the hills of China, a bridge keeper asked Lao-Tzu to write a book containing his thoughts and beliefs, which yielded the text of <a href="../../wp/t/Tao_Te_Ching.htm" title="Tao Te Ching">Tao Te Ching</a>.<p><a id="Han_Dynasty_.28206_BCE.E2.80.93220_CE.29" name="Han_Dynasty_.28206_BCE.E2.80.93220_CE.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Han Dynasty (206 BCE&ndash;220 CE)</span></h3>
      <p>In the early <!--del_lnk--> Han, the Tao came to be associated with or conflated with the <!--del_lnk--> Yellow Emperor. A major text from this &quot;Huang-Lao&quot; movement would be the <i><!--del_lnk--> Huainanzi</i>, which interprets earlier Taoist teachings in light of the quest for immortality (including drugs, sexual practices, and breathing techniques). ..<p><!--del_lnk--> Zhang Daoling claimed to have begun receiving new revelations from Tai-Shang(commonly mistaken with Tai Shang Lao Jun)and went on to found the <i>Tianshi</i> (&quot;Celestial Masters&quot;) sect around them as the &quot;First Celestrial Master&quot;. He performed spiritual healing, and collected dues of &quot;five pecks of rice&quot; from his followers (thus providing an alternative name for his movement). Zhang Daoling&#39;s major message was that the world-order as his followers knew it would soon come to an end, and be succeeded by an era of &quot;Great Peace&quot; (<i>Taiping</i>). In fact their activities did hasten the downfall of the <!--del_lnk--> Han dynasty. The same could be said of their contemporaries and fellow Taoists, the <!--del_lnk--> Yellow Turban sect. Zhang&#39;s grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now <!--del_lnk--> Sichuan province.<p>Laozi received imperial recognition as a divinity in 166 CE. The <!--del_lnk--> Yin and Yang and <!--del_lnk--> &quot;five elements&quot; theories date from this time, but were not yet integrated into Taoism.<p>The name <i>Daojia</i> comes from the Han Dynasty. In <!--del_lnk--> Sima Qian&#39;s history (chapter 63) it refers to immortals; in Liu Xiang it refers to Laozi and Zhuangzi. <i>Daojiao</i> came to be applied to the religious movements mentioned above. The two terms were used interchangeably until modern times. (We owe the distinction to Confucian writers.) The earliest Han commentary on the <i>Dao De Jing</i> is actually that of Heshang Gong (the &quot;Riverside Master&quot;), a religious Taoist.<p><a id="Three_Kingdoms_Period_.28220.E2.80.93265.29" name="Three_Kingdoms_Period_.28220.E2.80.93265.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Three Kingdoms Period (220&ndash;265)</span></h3>
      <p>The Xuanxue (&quot;Mysterious Wisdom&quot;) school, including <!--del_lnk--> Wang Bi, focuses on the texts of Laozi and Zhuangzi but not necessarily on the organised religion.<p><a id="Six_Dynasties_.28316.E2.80.93589.29" name="Six_Dynasties_.28316.E2.80.93589.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Six Dynasties (316&ndash;589)</span></h3>
      <p>Taoist alchemist <!--del_lnk--> Ge Hong, also known as Baopuzi (&#x62B1;&#x6251;&#x5B50; The &quot;Master Embracing Simplicity&quot;) was active in the third and fourth centuries AD and had great influence on later Taoism. Major scriptures were produced during this time period, including The Shangqing (&#x4E0A;&#x6E05; &quot;Highest Purity&quot;) (365&ndash;370) and Lingbao (&#x9748;&#x5BF6; &quot;Sacred Treasure&quot;) scriptures (397&ndash;402) received at <!--del_lnk--> Maoshan. The Shangqing revelations were received by Yang Xi, a relative of Ge Hong&#39;s; the revelations emphasised meditative visualisation (&#x5167;&#x89C0; <i>neiguan</i>). They spoke of the Shangqing heaven, which stood above what had been previously considered the highest heaven by Celestial Master Taoists. Yang Xi&#39;s revelations consisted of visitations from the residents of this heaven (the &quot;Zhen Ren&quot;) many of whom were ancestors of a circle of aristocrats from southern China. These Zhen Ren spoke of an apocalypse which was to arrive in 384, and claimed that only certain people from this aristocratic circle had been chosen to be saved. For the first century of its existence, Shangqing Taoism was isolated to this aristocratic circle. However, Tao Hongjing (456&ndash;536) codified and wrote commentaries on Yang Xi&#39;s writings and allowed for the creation of Shangching Taoism as a popular religion. The Lingbao scriptures added some Buddhist elements such as chanted rituals, and an emphasis on universal salvation.<p>The <i>Huahujing</i> (&#x5316;&#x80E1;&#x7D93; &quot;Scripture of Conversion of Barbarians&quot;) claimed that Laozi went to India, where he taught less advanced doctrines under the name of Buddha. Buddhists found this claim objectionable, and emperors regularly condemned it. A similar claim is made in the <i>Xishengjing</i> (&#x897F;&#x5347;&#x7D93; the &quot;Scripture of Western Ascension&quot;).<p><a id="Tang_Dynasty_.28618.E2.80.93907.29" name="Tang_Dynasty_.28618.E2.80.93907.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tang Dynasty (618&ndash;907)</span></h3>
      <p>Taoism gained official status in China during the Tang dynasty, whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative. However, it was forced to compete with <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, its major rivals, for patronage and rank. Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Xuanzong (685&ndash;762), who ruled at the height of the <!--del_lnk--> Tang, wrote commentaries on texts from all three of these traditions, which exemplifies the fact that in many people&#39;s lives they were not mutually exclusive. This marks the beginning of a long-lived tendency within imperial China, in which the government supported (and simultaneously regulated) all three movements.<p>Emperor Tang Gaozong added the <i>Dao De Jing</i> to the list of &quot;classics&quot; (<i>jing,</i> &#x7D93;) to be studied for the imperial examinations; hence the appearance of <i>-jing</i> in its title.<p><a id="Song_Dynasty_.28960.E2.80.931279.29" name="Song_Dynasty_.28960.E2.80.931279.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Song Dynasty (960&ndash;1279)</span></h3>
      <p>Several Song emperors, most notably <!--del_lnk--> Huizong, were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Daozang.</i><p>The <!--del_lnk--> Quanzhen school of Taoism was founded during this period, and together with the Zhengyi Celestial Masters is one of the two schools of Taoism that have survived to the present.<p>The Song Dynasty saw an increasingly complex interaction between the elite traditions of organised Taoism as practised by ordained Taoist ministers (<i>daoshi</i>) and the local traditions of folk religion as practised by spirit mediums (<i>wu</i>) and a new class of non-ordained ritual experts known as <i>fashi</i>. This interaction manifested itself in the integration of &#39;converted&#39; local deities into the bureaucratically organised Taoist pantheon and the emergence of new exorcistic rituals, including the <!--del_lnk--> Celestial Heart Rites and the <!--del_lnk--> Thunder Rites.<p>Aspects of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were consciously synthesised in the <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial <!--del_lnk--> orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes.<p><a id="Yuan_Dynasty_.281279.E2.80.931367.29" name="Yuan_Dynasty_.281279.E2.80.931367.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Yuan Dynasty (1279&ndash;1367)</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Guomindang (China Nationalist Party) leaders embrace science, modernity, and Western culture, including (to some extent) Christianity. Viewing the popular religion as reactionary and parasitic, they confiscated some temples for public buildings, and otherwise attempted to control traditional religious activity.<p><a id="People.27s_Republic_of_China_.281949.E2.80.93present.29" name="People.27s_Republic_of_China_.281949.E2.80.93present.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">People&#39;s Republic of China (1949&ndash;present)</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China, officially atheistic, initially suppressed Taoism along with other religions. Much of the Taoist infrastructure was destroyed. Monks and priests were sent to labor camps. This practice intensified during the <!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution from <!--del_lnk--> 1966 to <!--del_lnk--> 1976, nearly eradicating most Taoist sites.<p><!--del_lnk--> Deng Xiaoping eventually restored some religious tolerance beginning in 1982. Subsequently, communist leaders have recognised Taoism as an important traditional religion of China and also as a potential lucrative focus for <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">tourism</a>, so many of the more scenic temples and <!--del_lnk--> monasteries have been repaired and reopened.<p>Taoism is one of five religions recognised by the PRC, which insists on controlling its activities through a state bureaucracy (the China Taoist Association). Sensitive areas include the relationship of the Zhengyi Taoists with their sect&#39;s lineage-holder (he lives in Taiwan); and the status of various traditional temple activities (astrology, shamanism) which have been criticised as &quot;superstitious&quot; or &quot;feudal&quot;.<p><a id="Adherents" name="Adherents"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Adherents</span></h2>
      <p>The number of &quot;Taoists&quot; is difficult to estimate, partly for definitional reasons (who counts as a Taoist?), and partly for practical ones (it is illegal for private parties to conduct surveys in China). The number of people practicing some aspect of the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese folk religion might number in the hundreds of millions. (<!--del_lnk--> Adherents.com estimates &quot;Traditional Chinese religion&quot; at nearly four hundred million). The number of people patronising <i>Daoshi</i> (Taoist &quot;priests&quot; or masters) would be smaller by several orders of magnitude, while the number of literary <i>Daojia</i> would be smaller yet. At the same time, most Chinese people and many others have been influenced in some way by Taoist tradition.<p>Geographically, Taoism flourishes best in regions populated by Chinese people: inland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, and various Chinese diaspora communities. Taoist literature and art has influenced the cultures of <!--del_lnk--> Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, and these countries&#39; folk religions have many common elements. &quot;Organized&quot; Taoism seems not to have attracted a non-Chinese following until modern times.<p><a id="Beliefs" name="Beliefs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Beliefs</span></h2>

      <p>Taoism is not a belief-centered religion, and there are no known Taoist creeds. At the same time, certain characteristic beliefs or assumptions can be identified. (See <!--del_lnk--> Taoist doctrine.)<p>Beyond the Chinese folk religion, various rituals, exercises, or substances are said to positively affect one&#39;s physical health (even to the point of immortality); align oneself spiritually with cosmic forces; or enable ecstatic spiritual journeys. These concepts seem basic to Taoism in its elite forms.<p><a id="Philosophical_Taoism_.28Daojia.29" name="Philosophical_Taoism_.28Daojia.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical Taoism (Daojia)</span></h3>
      <p>Philosophical Taoism does not refer to one Taoist school or group of philosophers. Philosophical Taoism is a part of Xuanxue and other lineages. Ultimately the distinction between &quot;philosophical&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; Taoism is as difficult to define as Taoism itself. &quot;Religious&quot; Taoists may never have read <a href="../../wp/l/Laozi.htm" title="Laozi">Laozi</a> or <!--del_lnk--> Zhuangzi or any of the <!--del_lnk--> Daozang, and being called a Taoist may even seem unfamiliar or artificial.<p>Philosophical Taoism emphasizes various themes found in the <i>Dao De Jing</i> such as &quot;nonaction&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> wu wei</i>), <!--del_lnk--> emptiness, detachment, the strength of softness (or flexibility), and <i>The Zhuangzi</i> such as receptiveness, spontaneity, the <!--del_lnk--> relativism of human ways of life, ways of speaking and guiding behaviour. Most philosophical debate concerns dao--what way we should follow, but really, Taoists more directly question what a dao is, how or if we can know it and emphasize more than other schools the ways social daos depend on and presuppose natural daos. Their more detached discussion and their reluctance to formulate or advocate a social dao of their own means their discussions tend to be more playful and paradoxical than dogmatic. This makes their tone strikingly different from Confucian and Mohist texts.<p>Taoist commentators have been puzzled by the opening lines of the <i>Dao De Jing</i>, which has usually been translated:<dl>
       <dd><i>The way which can be uttered, is not the eternal Way.</i><dd><i>The name which can be named, is not the eternal Name.</i></dl>
      <p>(The original words are<dl>
       <dd>&#x9053;&#x53EF;&#x9053;&#xFF0C;&#x975E;&#x5E38;&#x9053;&#x3002; (dao (ways) can be spoken, not usual ways)<dd>&#x540D;&#x53EF;&#x540D;&#xFF0C;&#x975E;&#x5E38;&#x540D;&#x3002; (names can be named, not usual names))</dl>
      <p>In Chinese, &quot;&#x9053;&quot; or &quot;Dao&quot; is used both as a noun and verb. &#39;Way&#39; works well for the noun, but the translation for the verb &quot;to speak&quot; seems unmatched in meaning, unless we think in terms of &quot;to advocate, to preach, to formulate etc.&quot; Notice in the second line, the noun and verb use of &#39;&#x540D;&#39; seem closer in meaning, &quot;names&quot; and &quot;to name&quot;. Concretely, a road is a dao--a guide for where to go or how to get where we want to go. However, daos can be marked in other ways--e.g. simply by pointing or putting signs &quot;along the way&quot; etc. Daoists are intrigued both by how daos are made by our walking (wearing a path) and by how we can read what way to go from natural signals (animal paths). The verb probably would be something like pointing, marking, setting an example or otherwise signaling which way to go.<p>It should also be noted that while the above has become a standard translation, scholars have noted it is grammatically and conceptually problematic. Grammatically, it has no article so could be read &quot;a/any dao can be dao-ed, (but) this is not the constant dao-ing. A name can be named, (but) this is not the constant naming&quot;. Conceptually, the character for &quot;constant&quot;(&#x5E38;) is used philosophically to describe a dao that does not need to change in different times or societies and reliably guides behaviour. Laozi later describes a dao as &quot;reversing&quot; and the texts emphasises opposites, i.e.: high and low, hard and soft, etc. The Mawangdui version of the text contains similar passages, vide: ch.1, 3, 40).<p>Thus, any terms we use to advocate a dao can be reversed and still guide behavior. The other term in the title (which, compounded with &#39;dao&#39;, formed the Chinese term for &#39;ethics&#39;) is &#39;de&#39; (or &#39;te&#39;). It is &quot;the dao within&quot; which may comprise the capacity we have to learn a way of life and the result of learning/practicing it. De should interpret the learned &quot;way of life&quot; into a correct pattern of behaviour--hence its usual translation as &quot;virtue&quot; or &quot;excellence.&quot; Other terms were later integrated into philosophical Taoism including <!--del_lnk--> yin and yang (closely related to <!--del_lnk--> Dialectical monism) and <!--del_lnk--> five elements (&#x4E94;&#x884C;, <i>wuxing</i>) theories, and the concept of <!--del_lnk--> qi. Originally belonging to rival philosophical schools, these themes entered Taoism by way of Han Confucianism which focused on cosmic cycles and portents to guide the ruler&#39;s deportment dress, and so forth. They blend into Daoism as examples of &quot;natural&quot; dao with which any viable human dao must harmonise.<dl>
       <dd><i>The way which can be uttered, is not the eternal Way.</i></dl>
      <p>While academic deconstructions of this phrase result in much confusion, there is also a much simpler interpretation by metaphor: The Way is like dancing. You can talk about dancing, but your talk about dancing isn&#39;t the dance itself.

      <p>Traditional Chinese religion is determinedly <!--del_lnk--> polytheistic. Its deities are arranged into a heavenly civil service that mirrors the bureaucracy of imperial China. Deities may be promoted or demoted. Many are said to have once been virtuous humans. The particular deities worshipped vary somewhat according to geography, and much more according to historical period (though the general pattern of worship is more constant).<p>There is also something of a disconnection between the set of gods which currently receive popular worship, and those which are the focus of elite Taoist texts and rituals. For example, the <!--del_lnk--> Jade Emperor is at the head of the popular pantheon, while the <!--del_lnk--> Celestial Masters&#39; altar recognizes the deified Laozi (<i>Laojun</i>, &quot;Lord Lao&quot;) and the <!--del_lnk--> Three Pure Ones in that position. Some texts explain that Laozi has sponsored the apotheosis of various other gods.<p><a id="Philosophical_Taoism" name="Philosophical_Taoism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical Taoism</span></h3>
      <p>While a number of immortals or other mysterious figures appear in the <i>Zhuangzi</i>, and to a lesser extent in the <i>Dao De Jing</i> (e.g., the &quot;mysterious female&quot; in chapter 6), these have generally not become the objects of cultic worship. We must not confuse Dao with the western concept of monotheism. The Dao is not personal, nor is it an unchanging spiritual entity similar to the Hindu Atman. The Chinese word Dao can mean a process or a path, but not an entity. It is only to be followed, not to be worshipped. Dao merely means the natural way of the universe. Being one with the Dao does not indicate an union with an eternal spirit in the Hindu sense, but merely live with the change and accept the way of nature; that of impermanence and flexiblility. Early texts describe Tao not as equal to &quot;the One,&quot; but as a principle underlying both the One and the Many. One revealing phrase used to describe it is <i>huntun</i> (roughly, &quot;chaotic mixture&quot;). In the wake of Wang Bi, philosophical Taoists have tended to describe it as &quot;nothingness,&quot; which is the origin of &quot;being.&quot; (Cf. the <!--del_lnk--> apophatic tendencies of theism, including <!--del_lnk--> negative theology.)<p><a id="Practices" name="Practices"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Practices</span></h2>

      <p>All forms of Chinese traditional religion involve <i>baibai</i> (&#x62DC;&#x62DC;)--bowing towards an altar, with a stick of incense in one&#39;s hand. This may be done at home, or in a temple, or outdoors; by an ordinary person, or a professional (such as a <i>Daoshi</i> &#x9053;&#x58EB;); and the altar may feature any number of deities or ancestral tablets. <i>Baibai</i> is usually done in accordance with certain dates of the lunar/solar calendar (see <!--del_lnk--> Chinese calendar).<p>At certain dates, food may be set out as a <!--del_lnk--> sacrifice to the gods and/or spirits of the departed. This may include slaughtered pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of <!--del_lnk--> Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear--not as a mere image, but as the actual item--in the spirit world, and be available for the departed spirit to use.<p>Also at certain dates, street parades take place. These are lively affairs which invariably involve firecrackers and flower-covered floats broadcasting traditional music. Street parades may also include <!--del_lnk--> lion dances and <!--del_lnk--> dragon dances; <!--del_lnk--> human-occupied puppets (often of the &quot;Seventh Lord&quot; and &quot;Eighth Lord&quot;); <i>jitong</i> (&#x4E69;&#x7AE5; male &quot;Mediums&quot;) who mutilate their skin with knives; <i>Bajiajiang</i>, which are <!--del_lnk--> gongfu-practicing honour guards in demonic makeup; and <!--del_lnk--> palanquins carrying god-images. The various participants are not considered performers, but rather possessed by the god in question.<p><!--del_lnk--> Fortune-telling--including <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a>, <!--del_lnk--> palmistry, <!--del_lnk--> phrenology, and <!--del_lnk--> divination--has long been considered a traditional Taoist pursuit. <!--del_lnk--> Mediumship is also widely encountered. We may distinguish between &quot;martial&quot; forms of mediumship (like the aforementioned <i>jitong</i>) and more literary forms in which the possessed medium communicates messages from the spirit world by writing them with a special utensil.<p>Isabelle Robinet&#39;s book <i>Taoist Meditation</i> describes various practices given in the <!--del_lnk--> Maoshan texts. These include controlling bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, and the breath; visualisation practices in which various internal organs are imaginally linked with corresponding gods and/or celestial bodies (e.g. the stars of the <i>bei tou</i>, the &quot;Big Dipper&quot;); and heavenly journeys via the Great Pole, which is reached by a limping shamanic dance called the &quot;Step of Wu&quot;.<p><a id="Philosophical_Taoism_2" name="Philosophical_Taoism_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical Taoism</span></h3>
      <p>The fundamental form of activity among philosophical Taoists seems to be the reading and writing of books. Taoists of this type tend to be civil servants, elderly retirees, or in modern times, university faculty. While there is considerable overlap with religious Taoism, there are often important divergences in interpretation. <!--del_lnk--> Wang Bi, one of the most influential philosophical commentators on the <a href="../../wp/l/Laozi.htm" title="Laozi">Laozi</a> (and <!--del_lnk--> Yijing) was in fact a Confucian.<p>For many educated Chinese people (the Literati), life was divided into a social aspect, where Confucian doctrine prevailed, and a private aspect, with Taoist aspirations. Night-time, exile, or retirement provided the opportunity to cultivate Taoism and reread Laozi and Zhuangzi. The Literati often dedicated this period of life to arts such as calligraphy, painting, and poetry, or personal researches into antiquities, medicine, folklore, and so on.<p><!--del_lnk--> The Vinegar Tasters (sometimes called Three Vinegar Tasters) is a popular painting (usually in scroll format) that explained Taoist ideals in relation to the <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucian school which began in the <a href="../../wp/1/10th_century.htm" title="10th century">10th century</a> and gained prominence in the <a href="../../wp/1/12th_century.htm" title="12th century">12th century</a>.

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Daozang (&#x9053;&#x85CF;, <i>Treasury of Tao</i>) is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Taoist canon.&quot; It was compiled during the <!--del_lnk--> Jin, <!--del_lnk--> Tang, <!--del_lnk--> Song, and <!--del_lnk--> Ming dynasties, and includes almost 1500 texts. Following the example of the Buddhist <a href="../../wp/t/Tripitaka.htm" title="Tripitaka">Tripitaka</a>, it is divided into three <i>dong</i> &#x6D1E; (&quot;caves,&quot; often translated &quot;grottoes&quot;), arranged here from highest to lowest:<dl>
       <dd>(1) The <i>Zhen</i> (&quot;real&quot;) grotto. Includes the Shangching texts.<dd>(2) The <i>Yuan</i> (&quot;primordial&quot;) grotto. Includes the Lingbao scriptures.<dd>(3) The <i>Shen</i> (&quot;divine&quot;) grotto. Includes texts predating the Maoshan revelations.</dl>
      <p>The <i><a href="../../wp/t/Tao_Te_Ching.htm" title="Tao Te Ching">Dao De Jing</a></i> constitutes an appendix (<i>fu</i>) to the first grotto. Other appendices include the <i>Taipingjing</i> (&quot;Scripture of Great Peace&quot;) as well as various alchemical texts, and scriptures from the Celestial Masters tradition.<p>However, Taoism is not a religion which regards the scripture as the primary source of truth. Daoshi generally do not consult published versions of the <!--del_lnk--> Daozang, but use texts which have been passed down from teacher to student (who are often relatives). The receipt of permission to do the ritual is considered more important than knowledge of the texts&#39; contents.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Quanzhen school does have a tradition of approaching Taoism through scriptural study, and the <!--del_lnk--> Yijing features more prominently than any other scripture, owing to its relevance for cosmology.<p>Some Chinese movements emphasise newly-revealed scriptures. In Taiwan, one often finds Buddhist texts being chanted in Taoist temples.<p><a id="Philosophical_Taoism_3" name="Philosophical_Taoism_3"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Philosophical Taoism</span></h3>
      <p>Philosophical Taoism has focused on the <i>Dao De Jing</i> and the <i>Zhuangzi</i>, and to a lesser extent the <i><!--del_lnk--> Liezi</i>. This form of Taoism, more than any other, has influenced Western commentators. Much of the philosophy of Taoism is derived from the following passage:<br /><i>The Tao is unknown</i><br /><i>And you need not know it.</i><p><a id="Taoist_symbols_and_images" name="Taoist_symbols_and_images"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Taoist symbols and images</span></h2>

While almost all Taoist organisations make use of it, one could also call it Confucian, <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucian or pan-Chinese. The <!--del_lnk--> yin and yang border should make a backwards &quot;S&quot; shape, with yang (white or red) on top. One is likely to see this symbol as decorations on Taoist organisation flags and logos, temple floors, or stitched into clerical robes.<p>Taoist temples may fly square or triangular flags. These are not merely decorative but function as <!--del_lnk--> talismans, and typically feature mystical writing or diagrams. Often a tree branch is used as a flagpole.<p>One sometimes sees a zigzag with seven stars, representing the Big Dipper (or the &quot;Bushel&quot;, the Chinese equivalent). Taoists see the North and South Poles as divine.<p>Taoist temples in southern China and Taiwan may often be identified by their roofs, which feature <!--del_lnk--> Chinese dragons and <!--del_lnk--> phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix being yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, as well as on the hairpin of a Celestial Master.<p><a id="Relations_with_other_religions_and_philosophies" name="Relations_with_other_religions_and_philosophies"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Relations with other religions and philosophies</span></h2>
      <p>The origins of Taoism and other philosophical schools are intimately related. The authorship of the <i>Dao De Jing</i> is assigned to Laozi, traditionally thought to be a teacher of Confucius, yet appears to be reacting against Confucian doctrine (suggesting the text comes after <a href="../../wp/c/Confucianism.htm" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>). Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu), the other &quot;defining&quot; philosopher of Daoism, reacted both to the Confucian-Mohist ethical disputes and to related developments in theory of &quot;names&quot; (language). There is little evidence of a link between Laozi and Zhuangzi--whose most frequent interactions are with Hui Shi (of the school of names). However, the chapters of the Zhuangzi written after his death include dialogues between Laozi and Confucius that mimic (or inspire?) the style of the <i>Dao de Jing</i>, suggesting the first association of the two texts dates from around that time. The &quot;history of thought&quot; contained in the Zhuangzi cites Laozi as a prior step (and demotes Hui Shi to a postscript). It includes the Mohists by name and the Confucians by implication and a cluster of other less well known thinkers.<p>The terms <i>Dao</i> and <i>De</i> (virtue/excellence) are shared terms of debate in this period. Most of the texts of ancient Chinese philosophy argued for some <i>dao</i> or other and advocated cultivating <i>de</i> in that favored <i>dao</i>. While <i>dao</i> was initially ethical-social norms, it quickly broadened to include the norms of language use and of claiming or attributing knowledge. This broadening dialectic about <i>dao</i> is what warrants describing the views of Laozi and Zhuangzi as Daoism. Daoism represents the view that the norms for language, knowledge, ethics and society are grounded in and continuous with natural norms. So any discussion of <i>dao</i> and <i>de</i> involves us in reflections on the nature of human society and its place in the universe as a whole.<p>These early Taoist texts reject numerous basic assumptions of Confucianism, embracing instead values based on nature, perspectivalism, and spontaneity. They express skepticism of conventional moralities and Mozi&#39;s Utilitarian or Mencius&#39; benevolence based revisions. Since politics was conceived by these traditional schools as a scheme for &quot;unifying&quot; all &quot;under the sky&quot; in their favored <i>dao</i>, Daoists tend toward <a href="../../wp/a/Anarchism.htm" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>, mistrustful of hierarchical social structures and particularly, governments. (Zhuangzi argues that the proponents of benevolence and morality are usually found at the gates of feudal lords who have stolen their kingdoms.) Although philosophical Taoist appear to be anarchist, it is clearly an over statement. <!--del_lnk--> Mitigated Anarchism would better categorise the philosophical Taoists, they tend to believe in the idea that the government should act in a &#39;non acting&#39; or &#39;wu wei&#39; manner. This means that they should only act when necessary and their actions should not be felt directly by the people, nor should they be visible to the people. Chapters 57-81 of the Dao De Ching all deal with government, ruling, and appeasing the people.<p>The entry of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> into China was via its dialectic with later Taoism which transformed them both. Over the centuries of Chinese interactions, Buddhism gradually found itself transformed from a competitor of Taoism, to a fellow inhabitant of the Chinese cultural ecosystem. Originally seen as a kind of foreign Taoism, its scriptures were translated into Chinese with Taoist vocabulary. <!--del_lnk--> Chan Buddhism in particular is inspired by crucial elements of philosophical Taoism, ranging from distrust of scripture, text and language to its more positive view of &quot;this life&quot;, practice, skill and the absorption in &quot;every-moment&quot;. In the <!--del_lnk--> Tang period Taoism incorporated such Buddhist elements as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the celibacy of the clergy, the doctrine of emptiness, and the amassing of a vast collection of scripture into tripartite organisation.<p>Ideological and political rivals in ancient times, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism have inevitably deeply influenced one another, and eventually achieved a kind of <i>modus vivendi</i> in which each has its own particular ecological niche within Chinese society. With time, most Chinese people likewise came to identify to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalised by the time of the <!--del_lnk--> Song dynasty, when aspects of the three schools were consciously synthesised in the <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucian school, which eventually became Imperial <!--del_lnk--> orthodoxy for state bureaucratic purposes. To this today orthodox Taoist teaching advocates all three schools originated from the same source.<p>Taoist thought partly inspired <!--del_lnk--> Legalist philosophers, whose theories were used by <a href="../../wp/q/Qin_Shi_Huang.htm" title="Qin Shi Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a>, founder of the Chinese Empire. The junction point can be found in the work of <!--del_lnk--> Hanfeizi, a prominent Legalist thinker who commented on the Tao Te Ching. Hanfeizi used some chapters of the book to justify a structured society based on law and punishment and on the undiscussed power of the Emperor.<p>Taoism up till early twentieth century maintained a school with gifted practioners with special powers including knowldege of <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Exorcism as a means to mend the ills of its followers but subsequently this was subjugated as myth and superstitions, leading to beliefs that they were <!--del_lnk--> shamanic practices from ancient Chinese traditions.<p>In spreading Catholic Christianity to China, Jesuit <!--del_lnk--> Matteo Ricci sought to ally the Church with Confucianism. In so doing the Jesuits encouraged the view that China lacked a <!--del_lnk--> high religion of its own (since Confucianism was not regarded as such). This was only a contemporary view, as neither Confucianism nor Taoism can be moulded into establishments directly comparable to Catholicism in its post <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_Ages.htm" title="Middle Ages">Middle Ages</a> expansionism. Until well into the twentieth century, Christians have tended to view religious Taoism as a hodgepodge of primitive superstitions, or even as a form of <!--del_lnk--> demonolatry due to insufficient understanding.<p>In the last century or so, Taoism (along with Confucianism and Buddhism) has become incorporated into the theology of the <!--del_lnk--> Way of Former Heaven sects, notably <!--del_lnk--> Yiguandao however this annexation is not a sanctioned move. The same could be said with respect to Vietnam&#39;s religion of <!--del_lnk--> Caodaism.<p>Western <!--del_lnk--> New Agers have embraced some aspects of Taoism: the name and concept of &quot;Tao&quot;, the names and concepts of <!--del_lnk--> yin and yang; an appreciation for Laozi and Zhuangzi, and a respect for other aspects of Chinese tradition such as qigong. At the same time, Western appropriations differ in subtle (or not so subtle) ways from their Asian sources. For example, the word &quot;Tao&quot; is used in numerous book titles which are connected to Chinese culture only tangentially. Examples would include <!--del_lnk--> Fritjof Capra&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Tao of Physics</i>, or <!--del_lnk--> Benjamin Hoff&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> The Tao of Pooh.<p>Taoism has also been a resource for those in environmental philosophy, who see the non-anthropocentric nature of Taoism as a guide for new ways of thinking about nature and environmental ethics. Some consider Taoism to fit naturally with the radical environmental philosophy of <!--del_lnk--> deep ecology. <i>Daoism and Ecology: Ways Within A Cosmic Landscape</i> edited by N. J. Girardot, James Miller, and Liu Xiaogan is currently the most thorough introduction to studies done on concepts of nature and ecology within Taoism.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism&quot;</div>
