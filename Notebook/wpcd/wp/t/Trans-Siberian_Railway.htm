      <p>The main route, the <b>Trans-Siberian</b>, runs from <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Vladivostok via southern <!--del_lnk--> Siberia and was built between <!--del_lnk--> 1891 and <!--del_lnk--> 1916. It is often associated with the main Russian <a href="../../wp/t/Train.htm" title="Train">train</a> that connects these two cities. At <!--del_lnk--> 9,288 kilometres (5,772 miles), spanning 8 <a href="../../wp/t/Time_zone.htm" title="Time zone">time zones</a> and taking about 7 days to complete its journey, it is the third longest single continuous service in the world, after the <!--del_lnk--> Donetsk-<!--del_lnk--> Vladivostok and <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>-<a href="../../wp/p/Pyongyang.htm" title="Pyongyang">Pyongyang</a> services, both of which follow the Trans-Siberian.<p>A second primary route is the <b>Trans-Manchurian</b>, which coincides with the Trans-Siberian as far as <!--del_lnk--> Tarskaya (a stop 12 km east of <!--del_lnk--> Karymskaya, in <!--del_lnk--> Chita Oblast), about 1000 km east of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Baikal.htm" title="Lake Baikal">Lake Baikal</a>. From Tarskaya the Trans-Manchurian heads southeast, via <!--del_lnk--> Harbin and <!--del_lnk--> Mudanjiang in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Northeastern Provinces (from where a connection to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a> is used by one of Moscow-Beijing trains), joining with the main route in <!--del_lnk--> Ussuriysk just north of <!--del_lnk--> Vladivostok. This is the shortest and the oldest rail route to Vladivostok.<p>The third primary route is the <b>Trans-Mongolian</b>, which coincides with the Trans-Siberian as far as <!--del_lnk--> Ulan Ude on Lake Baikal&#39;s eastern shore. From Ulan-Ude the Trans-Mongolian heads south to <!--del_lnk--> Ulaan-Baatar before making its way southeast to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1991, a fourth route running further to the north was finally completed, after more than five decades of sporadic work. Known as the <b><!--del_lnk--> Baikal Amur Mainline</b> (BAM), this recent extension departs from the Trans-Siberian line at <!--del_lnk--> Taishet several hundred miles west of <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Baikal.htm" title="Lake Baikal">Lake Baikal</a> and passes the lake at its northernmost extremity. It crosses the <!--del_lnk--> Amur River at <!--del_lnk--> Komsomolsk-na-Amure (north of <!--del_lnk--> Khabarovsk), and reaches the <!--del_lnk--> Pacific at <!--del_lnk--> Sovetskaya Gavan (i.e., &quot;Soviet Haven&quot;, a.k.a. <i>Sovgavan</i>, <i>Sovietgavan</i>, and earlier <i>Imperatorskaya Gavan</i>, i.e., &quot;Imperial Haven&quot;). While this route provides access to Baikal&#39;s stunning northern coast, it also passes through some rather forbidding terrain.<p><a id="Demand_and_design" name="Demand_and_design"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demand and design</span></h2>
      <p>In the late 19th century, the development of the Siberia was hampered by poor transportation links within the region as well as between Siberia and the rest of the country. Good roads suitable for wheeled transport were few and far apart. For about 5 months of the year, rivers were the main means of transportation; during the cold half of the year, cargo and passengers travelled by horse-drawn <!--del_lnk--> sleds over the winter roads, many of which were the same rivers, now ice-covered.<p>The first steamboat on the <!--del_lnk--> Ob, Nikita Myasnikov&#39;s &quot;Osnova&quot;, was launched in 1844; but the early starts were difficult, and it was not until 1857 that steamboat shippinig started developing in the Ob system in the serious way. Steamboats started operating on the <!--del_lnk--> Yenisei in 1863, on the <!--del_lnk--> Lena and <a href="../../wp/a/Amur.htm" title="Amur">Amur</a> in the 1870s.<p>While the comparably flat Western Siberia was at least fairly well served by the gigantic <!--del_lnk--> Ob-<!--del_lnk--> Irtysh-<!--del_lnk--> Tobol-<!--del_lnk--> Chulym river system, the mighty rivers of Eastern Siberia -- <!--del_lnk--> Yenisei, upper <!--del_lnk--> Angara (Angara below <!--del_lnk--> Bratsk was not easily navigable because of the rapids), <!--del_lnk--> Lena -- were mostly navigable only in the north-south direction. An attempt to somewhat remedy the situation by building the <!--del_lnk--> Ob-Yenisei Canal were not particularly successful. Only a railroad could be a real solution to the region&#39;s transportation problems.<p>The first railroad projects in Siberia emerged after the creation of the <!--del_lnk--> Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway. One of the first was the <!--del_lnk--> Irkutsk-<!--del_lnk--> Chita project, intended to connect the former to the <!--del_lnk--> Amur river, and consequently, to the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. On the initiative of <!--del_lnk--> Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky, surveys for a railroad in the <!--del_lnk--> Khabarovsk region were conducted.<p>Before <!--del_lnk--> 1880, the central government had virtually ignored these projects, because of the weakness of Siberian enterprises, a clumsy bureaucracy, and fear of financial risk. Financial minister Count <!--del_lnk--> Egor Kankrin wrote:<blockquote>
       <p>The idea of covering Russia with a railroad network not just exceeds any possibility, but even building the railway from Petersburg to <!--del_lnk--> Kazan must be found untimely by several centuries.</blockquote>
      <p>The abovementioned Irkutsk-Chita project, proposed by an American entrepreneur W. Collins, was rejected by the government, and a lesson was given to the major-general Muravyov-Amurskiy who <i>thoughtlessly showed benevolence</i> to the American project. Thus, the government tried to prevent the American and British sphere of influence in the Pacific from extending to Siberia.<p>By <!--del_lnk--> 1880, there were a large number of rejected and upcoming applications for permission to construct railways to connect Siberia with the Pacific but not eastern Russia. This worried the government and made connecting Siberia with central Russia a pressing concern.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The design process lasted 10 years. Along with the route actually constructed, alternative projects were proposed:<ul>
       <li>Southern route: via <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Barnaul, <!--del_lnk--> Abakan and <a href="../../wp/m/Mongolia.htm" title="Mongolia">Mongolia</a><li>Northern route: via <!--del_lnk--> Tyumen, <!--del_lnk--> Tobolsk, <!--del_lnk--> Tomsk, <!--del_lnk--> Yeniseysk and the modern <!--del_lnk--> Baikal Amur Mainline or even through <!--del_lnk--> Yakutsk.</ul>
      <p>According to a legend, the line originally had an unneeded 7km loop, which was due to the fact that during planning, the Russian Tsar accidentally had part of his finger in the way of plotting the route, and construction workers were too afraid of mentioning the mistake to the Tsar, resulting in them building the line including this &quot;error&quot;. (Lonely Planet, Trans-Siberian Railway, first edition. This legend is more often told about the much earlier <!--del_lnk--> Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway.)<p>Railwaymen fought against suggestions to save funds, for example, by installing ferryboats instead of bridges over the rivers until traffic increased. The designers insisted and secured the decision to construct an uninterrupted railway.<p>Unlike the rejected private projects, that intended to connect the <i>existing</i> cities demanding transport, the Trans-Siberian did not have such a priority. Thus, to save money and avoid collisions with land owners, it was decided to lay the road aside the existing cities. <!--del_lnk--> Tomsk was the largest city, and the most unfortunate, because the swampy banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Ob river near it was considered inappropriate for a bridge. The railway was laid 70 km to the south, just a blind branch line connected with Tomsk, depriving the city of the prospective transit rail traffic and trade.<p>The railway was instantly filled to its capacity with local traffic, mostly wheat. Together with low speed and low possible weights of trains, it upset the promised role as a transit route between <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> and <!--del_lnk--> East Asia. During the <!--del_lnk--> Russian-Japanese war, the military traffic to the East almost disorganized the civic freight flow.<p><a id="Construction" name="Construction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Construction</span></h2>

      <p>Full time construction on the Trans-Siberian Railway began in 1891 and was put into execution and overseen by <!--del_lnk--> Sergei Witte, who was then Finance Minister.<p>Similar to the <!--del_lnk--> First Transcontinental Railroad in the USA, Russian engineers started construction at both ends and worked towards the centre. From Vladivostok the railway was laid north along the right bank of the <!--del_lnk--> Ussuri River to <!--del_lnk--> Khabarovsk at the <!--del_lnk--> Amur River becoming the <b>Ussuri railway</b>.<p>In 1890, a bridge across the river <!--del_lnk--> Ural was built and the new railroad entered Asia. The bridge across the Ob River was built in 1898 and the small city Novonikolaevsk, founded in 1883, metamorphosed into a large Siberian centre&mdash;<!--del_lnk--> Novosibirsk city. In 1898, the first train reached Irkutsk and the shore of Lake Baikal. The railroad ran on to the East, across the Shilka and the Amur rivers and soon reached Khabarovsk. The Vladivostok-Khabarovsk branch was built a bit earlier, in 1897.<p>Convict labour, from <!--del_lnk--> Sakhalin Island and other places, and Russian soldiers were drafted into railway-building service. One of the largest obstacles was <a href="../../wp/l/Lake_Baikal.htm" title="Lake Baikal">Lake Baikal</a>, some 60 km (40 mi) east of Irkutsk. Lake Baikal is more than 640 km (400 mi) long and over 1,600 m (5,000 feet) deep. The line ended on each side of the lake and a special icebreaker ferryboat was purchased from England to connect the railway. In the winter sleighs were used to move passengers and cargo from one side of the lake to the other until the completion of the Lake Baikal spur along the southern edge of the lake. With the completion of the Amur River line north of the Chinese border in 1916, there was a continuous railway from Petrograd to Vladivostok that remains to this day the world&#39;s longest railway line.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The Trans-Siberian Railway gave a great boost to Siberian agriculture, facilitating substantial exports to central Russia and Europe. It influenced the territories it connected directly, as well as those connected to it by river transport. For instance, <!--del_lnk--> Altai Krai exported wheat to the railway via the Ob river.<p>As Siberian agriculture began to export cheap <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Grain">grain</a> towards the West, agriculture in Central Russia was still under economic pressure after the end of serfdom, which was <!--del_lnk--> formally cancelled in 1861. Thus, to defend the central territory and to prevent possible social destabilization, in <!--del_lnk--> 1896, the government introduced the <!--del_lnk--> Chelyabinsk tariff break (&#x427;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x44F;&#x431;&#x438;&#x43D;&#x441;&#x43A;&#x438;&#x439; &#x442;&#x430;&#x440;&#x438;&#x444;&#x43D;&#x44B;&#x439; &#x43F;&#x435;&#x440;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x43E;&#x43C;), a tariff barrier for grain passing through <!--del_lnk--> Chelyabinsk, and a similar barrier in <!--del_lnk--> Manchuria. This measure changed the nature of export: mills emerged to create bread from grain in <!--del_lnk--> Altai, <!--del_lnk--> Novosibirsk and <!--del_lnk--> Tomsk, and many farms switched to <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a> production. From 1896 untill <!--del_lnk--> 1913 Siberia exported averagely 501,932 tonnes (30,643,000 <!--del_lnk--> pood) of bread (grain, flour) annually.<p>The Trans-Siberian line remains the most important transportation link within <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>; around 30% of Russian exports travel on the line. While it attracts many foreign tourists, it also gets considerable use from domestic passengers.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Today the Trans-Siberian Railway carries about 20,000 containers per year to Europe, including 8,300 containers from <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. This is a fairly small amount, considering that for all means of transport combined Japan sends 360,000 containers to Europe per year. Thus, there is potential for growth, and the Russian Ministry of Transport planned to increase the number of containers shipped on the railway to 100,000 by the year 2005 and satisfy the passage and cargo needs of 120 trains per day. This required that stretches that were single track and formed a <!--del_lnk--> bottleneck would be made double track.<p><a id="Costs" name="Costs"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Costs</span></h2>
      <p>The train has 2nd class 4-berth compartments (called kup&eacute;) and 1st class 2-berth compartments (called spalny wagon or &#39;SV&#39;) and a restaurant car. One-way fares start at about $200 in a 4-berth sleeper or $320 in a 2-berth sleeper.  Prices increase dramatically if additional stops are needed. Russian train tickets can only be purchased within the Russian Federation or in Finland. Tickets can be purchased only 45 days in advance. Many travel agencies can arrange to have tickets purchased by proxy, but the 45 day limit is strictly enforced.<p><a id="Routes" name="Routes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Routes</span></h2>

      <p>There are many alternative routings between Moscow and Siberia. For example:<ul>
       <li>Some trains would leave Moscow from <!--del_lnk--> Kazansky Rail Terminal instead of <!--del_lnk--> Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal; this would shave some 20 km off the distances, because it provides a shorter exit from Moscow onto the Nizhny Novgorod main line.<li>One can take a night train from Moscow&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Kursky Rail Terminal to <!--del_lnk--> Nizhny Novgorod, make a stopover in the Nizhny and then transfer to a Siberia-bound train<li>From 1956 to 2001 many trains went between Moscow and Kirov via <!--del_lnk--> Yaroslavl instead of <!--del_lnk--> Nizhny Novgorod. This would add some 29 km to the distances from Moscow, making Vladivostok Kilometer 9288.<li>Other trains get from Moscow (Kazansky Terminal) to Yekaterinburg via <!--del_lnk--> Kazan.<li>Between Yekaterinburg and Omsk it is possible to travel via Kurgan <!--del_lnk--> Petropavl (in <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>) instead of Tyumen.<li>One can bypass Yekaterinburg altogether by travelling via <!--del_lnk--> Samara, <!--del_lnk--> Ufa, <!--del_lnk--> Chelyabinsk, and Petropavl; this was historically the earliest configuration.</ul>
      <p>Depending on the route taken, the distances from Moscow to the same station in Siberia may differ by several tens of kilometers.<p><a id="Trans-Manchurian_line" name="Trans-Manchurian_line"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Trans-Manchurian line</span></h3>

      <p>The Trans-Manchurian line, as e.g. used by train No.020, Moscow-Beijing follows the same route as the Trans-Siberian between <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Chita, and then follows this route to <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>:<ul>

      <p>The express train (No.020) travel time from Moscow to Beijing is just over 6 days.<p>There is no direct passenger service along the entire original Trans-Manchurian route (i.e., from Moscow -- or anywhere in Russia-west-of-Manchuria -- to Vladivostok via Harbin), due to the obvious administrative and technical (gauge break) inconveniences of crossing the border twice. However, assuming sufficient patience and possession of appropriate visas, it is still possible to travel all the way along the original route, with a few stopovers (e.g. in <!--del_lnk--> Harbin, <!--del_lnk--> Grodekovo, and <!--del_lnk--> Ussuriysk).    That would pass the following points from Harbin east:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Harbin (7573 km from Moscow)<li><!--del_lnk--> Mudanjiang (7928 km)<li><!--del_lnk--> Suifenhe (8121 km), the Chinese border station<li><!--del_lnk--> Grodekovo (8147 km), Russia<li><!--del_lnk--> Ussuriysk (8244 km)<li><!--del_lnk--> Vladivostok (8356 km)</ul>
