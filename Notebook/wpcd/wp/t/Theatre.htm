      <p><b>Theatre</b> or <b>theatre</b> (from French &quot;<i>th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>&quot;, from Greek &quot;theatron&quot;, <i>&theta;&#x3AD;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</i>, meaning &quot;place of seeing&quot;) is the branch of the <!--del_lnk--> performing arts concerned with <!--del_lnk--> acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, mime, puppets, music, dance, sound and spectacle &mdash; indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts. Bernard Beckerman, head of Hofstra University&#39;s department of drama, in his book, Dynamics of Drama, defines theatre as what &quot;occurs when one or more human beings, isolated in time and/or space, present themselves to another or others.&quot; In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as <a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">opera</a>, <!--del_lnk--> ballet, <!--del_lnk--> mime, <!--del_lnk--> kabuki, <!--del_lnk--> puppetry, <!--del_lnk--> classical Indian dance, <!--del_lnk--> Chinese opera, <!--del_lnk--> mummers&#39; plays, and <!--del_lnk--> pantomime.<p>

      <p>&quot;<a href="../../wp/d/Drama.htm" title="Drama">Drama</a>&quot; (literally translated, <i>Action,</i> from a verbal root meaning &quot;I do&quot;) is that branch of theatre in which speech, either from written text (<!--del_lnk--> plays), or <!--del_lnk--> improvised is paramount. The first theatre, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Theatre of ancient Greece</i>, created the definition of a theatre: an audience in a half-circle watching an elevated stage where actors use <!--del_lnk--> props staging plays. &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Musical theatre&quot; is a form of theatre combining <a href="../../wp/m/Music.htm" title="Music">music</a>, <!--del_lnk--> songs, <a href="../../wp/d/Dance.htm" title="Dance">dance</a> routines, and spoken <!--del_lnk--> dialogue. However, theatre is more than just what one sees on <a href="../../wp/s/Stage_%2528theatre%2529.htm" title="Stage (theatre)">stage</a>. Theatre involves an entire world behind the scenes that creates the costumes, sets and lighting to make the overall effect interesting. There is a particularly long tradition of <!--del_lnk--> political theatre, intended to educate audiences on contemporary issues and encourage social change. Various creeds, <!--del_lnk--> Catholicism for instance, have built upon the entertainment value of theatre and created (for example) <!--del_lnk--> passion plays, <!--del_lnk--> mystery plays and <!--del_lnk--> morality plays.<p>There is variety of philosophy, artistic process, and theatrical approach to creating plays and drama. Some are connected to political or spiritual ideologies, and some based on purely &quot;artistic&quot; concerns. Some processes focus on a story, some on theatre as event, some on theatre as catalyst for social change. According to <a href="../../wp/a/Aristotle.htm" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>&#39;s seminal theatrical critique <i><!--del_lnk--> Poetics</i>, there are six elements necessary for theatre: Plot, Character, Idea, Language, Song, and Spectacle. The 17th-century Spanish writer <!--del_lnk--> Lope de Vega wrote that for theatre one needs &quot;three boards, two actors, and one passion&quot;. Others notable for their contribution to theatrical philosophy are <!--del_lnk--> Konstantin Stanislavski, <!--del_lnk--> Antonin Artaud, <!--del_lnk--> Bertolt Brecht, <!--del_lnk--> Orson Welles, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Brook, <!--del_lnk--> Jerzy Grotowski.<p>The most recognizable figures in theatre are the <!--del_lnk--> directors, <!--del_lnk--> playwrights and <a href="../../wp/a/Actor.htm" title="Actor">actors</a>, but theatre is a highly collaborative endeavour. Plays are usually produced by a <!--del_lnk--> production team that commonly includes a <!--del_lnk--> scenic or set designer, <a href="../../wp/l/Lighting_designer.htm" title="Lighting designer">lighting designer</a>, <!--del_lnk--> costume designer, <!--del_lnk--> sound designer, <!--del_lnk--> dramaturg, <!--del_lnk--> stage manager, and <!--del_lnk--> production manager. The artistic staff are assisted by <!--del_lnk--> technical theatre personnel who handle creation and execution of the production.<p>Some believe it is important for actors to study all commonly taught acting methods to perfect their craft. Methods include: Meisner, Stanislavsky, Strasberg, and Hagen.<p><a id="Genres_of_theatre" name="Genres_of_theatre"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Genres of theatre</span></h2>

      <p>There are a variety of <!--del_lnk--> genres that writers, producers and directors can employ in theatre to suit a variety of tastes:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Musical theatre: A theatrical genre in which a story is told through the performance of singing (with instrumental music), spoken dialogue and often dance.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Natya Sacred classical Indian musical theatre that includes <!--del_lnk--> natya proper (mime) and <!--del_lnk--> nritta (pure dance).</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Rock opera: Same style as opera, except that the musical form is rock music.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Theatre for social change: Theatre that addresses a social issue and uses performance as a way of illustrating injustice to the audience.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Comedy: Comes from the Greek word <i>komos</i> which means celebration, revel or merrymaking. It does not necessarily mean funny, but more focuses on a problem that leads to some form of catastrophe which in the end has a happy and joyful outcome.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Farce: A comic dramatic piece that uses highly improbable situations, stereotyped characters, extravagant exaggeration, fast pacing and violent horseplay.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Pantomime: A form of musical drama in which elements of dance, mime, puppetry, slapstick, and melodrama are combined to produce an entertaining and comic theatrical experience, often designed for children. These are often presented around the holidays.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Romantic comedy: A medley of clever scheming, calculated coincidence, and wondrous discovery, all of which contribute ultimately to making the events answer precisely to the hero&#39;s or heroine&#39;s wishes, with the focus on love.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Comedy of situation: A comedy that grows out of a character&#39;s attempt to solve a problem created by a situation. The attempt is often bumbling but ends up happily.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Comedy of manners: Witty, cerebral form of dramatic comedy that depicts and often satirises the manners and affectations of a contemporary society. A comedy of manners is concerned with social usage and the question of whether or not characters meet certain social standards.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Commedia dell&#39;arte: Very physical form of comedy which was created and originally performed in Italy. Commedia uses a series of stock characters and a list of events to improvise an entire play.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Black comedy: Comedy that tests the boundaries of good taste and moral acceptability by juxtaposing morbid or ghastly elements with comical ones.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Melodrama: Originally, a sentimental drama with musical underscoring. Often with an unlikely plot that concerns the suffering of the good at the hands of the villains but ends happily with good triumphant. Featuring stock characters such as the noble hero, the long-suffering heroine, and the cold-blooded villain.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Tragedy: A drama that treats in a serious and dignified style the sorrowful or terrible events encountered or caused by a heroic individual. The word &quot;Tragedy&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;Tragos&quot; which is translated to &quot;Goat&quot;.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Tragicomedy: A drama that has a bitter/sweet quality, containing elements of tragedy and comedy.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Domestic drama: Drama in which the focus is on the everyday domestic lives of people and their relationships in the community that they live in.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Fantasy: The creation of a unique landscape on which a hero goes on a quest to find something that will defeat the powers of evil. Along the way, this hero meets a variety of weird and fantastic characters.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Morality play: A morality play is an allegory in which the characters are abstractions of moral ideas.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="../../wp/o/Opera.htm" title="Opera">Opera</a>: A theatrical genre in which a story is told and emotion is conveyed primarily through singing (with instrumental music).</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Physical theatre: Theatrical performance in which the primary means of communication is the body, through dance, mime, puppetry and movement, rather than the spoken word.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Theatre of the Absurd: Term coined by <!--del_lnk--> Martin Esslin, theatre in which characters are engaged in an absurd, that is meaningless, activity or life. Related to <a href="../../wp/e/Existentialism.htm" title="Existentialism">existentialism</a>.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>Meta-Theatre: A genre of theatre made popular with mostly modern audiences, although it did start back in the Elizabethan Era. Meta-Theatre is when a play often completely demolishes the so called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> fourth wall&quot; and completely engages the audience. Oftentimes about a group of actors, a director, writer and so on. It usually blurs the line between what is scripted and what goes on by accident.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Grand Guignol: Now broadly used to refer to any play with on-stage violence, the term originally referred to the bloody and gruesome melodramas produced at the Theatre du Grand Guignol in <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Total Theatre: The creation of <!--del_lnk--> Steven Berkoff, a style where the actors become both characters and set, often using just one prop throughout the entire play. The style uses features of greek theatre (eg. a <!--del_lnk--> chorus or <!--del_lnk--> didactic message), exageration and <!--del_lnk--> surrealism.</ul>
      <p>This list is somewhat incomplete and some regard it as <!--del_lnk--> eurocentric. None of the genres listed are actually <!--del_lnk--> mutually exclusive. The richness of live theatre today is such that its practitioners can borrow from all of these elements and more, and present something that is a multi-disciplinary melange of pretty much everything.<p><a id="Theatre_venues_and_styles" name="Theatre_venues_and_styles"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Theatre venues and styles</span></h2>
