      <p>Western history does not record what happened in Togo before the <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese arrived in the late <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">fifteenth century</a>. During the period from the <a href="../../wp/1/11th_century.htm" title="11th century">eleventh century</a> to the <a href="../../wp/1/16th_century.htm" title="16th century">sixteenth century</a>, various tribes entered the region from all directions: the <!--del_lnk--> Ew&eacute; from <a href="../../wp/n/Nigeria.htm" title="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Benin.htm" title="Benin">Benin</a>; and the <!--del_lnk--> Mina and <!--del_lnk--> Guin from <a href="../../wp/g/Ghana.htm" title="Ghana">Ghana</a>. Most settled in coastal areas. When the slave trade began in earnest in the sixteenth century, the Mina benefited the most. For the next two hundred years, the coastal region was a major raiding centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Slave Coast.&quot;<p>In an 1884 treaty signed at <!--del_lnk--> Togoville, Germany declared a protectorate over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. After World War II, the mandate became a UN trust territory administered by the United Kingdom and France. The residents of <!--del_lnk--> British Togoland voted to join the <!--del_lnk--> Gold Coast as part of the new independent nation of Ghana, and <!--del_lnk--> French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the <!--del_lnk--> French Union. Independence came in 1960 under <!--del_lnk--> Sylvanus Olympio. Decades of political instability followed that cultiminated in the very first <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;etat in Africa, when Lt. Col. <!--del_lnk--> &Eacute;tienne Eyad&eacute;ma usurped power in a coup January 13, 1967.<p>Gnassingbe Eyadema died in early 2005 after thirty-eight years in power, as Africa&#39;s longest sitting dictator. The military&#39;s immediate but short-lived installation of his son, <!--del_lnk--> Faure Gnassingbe, as president provoked widespread international condemnation. Mr Faure stood down and called elections which he won two months later. The opposition said the vote was rigged. The developments of 2005 led to renewed questions about a commitment to democracy made by Togo in 2004 in a bid to normalise ties with the EU, which cut off aid in 1993 over the country&#39;s human rights record. Moreover, up to 500 people were killed in the political violence surrounding the presidential poll, according to the UN. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighbouring countries.<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

The south of Togo is characterized by a plateau which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes. The land size is 21,925 <!--del_lnk--> square miles (56,785&nbsp;km&sup2;), with an average population density of 253 people per square mile (98/km&sup2;).in 1914 it changed from togoland to togo<p><a id="Administrative_divisions" name="Administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Togo&#39;s small <a href="../../wp/s/Sub-Saharan_Africa.htm" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan</a> economy is heavily dependent on both commercial and subsistence <a href="../../wp/a/Agriculture.htm" title="Agriculture">agriculture</a>, which provides employment for 65% of the labor force. <a href="../../wp/c/Cocoa.htm" title="Cocoa">Cocoa</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Coffee.htm" title="Coffee">coffee</a>, and <a href="../../wp/c/Cotton.htm" title="Cotton">cotton</a> together generate about 30% of export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal, with occasional regional supply difficulties. In the industrial sector, <!--del_lnk--> phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo&#39;s GNI per capita is US $380 (World Bank, 2005).<p>Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade centre. The government&#39;s decade-long effort, supported by the <!--del_lnk--> World Bank and the <!--del_lnk--> IMF, to implement economic reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with expenditures, has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity. The <!--del_lnk--> 12 January <!--del_lnk--> 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on following through on privatization, increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays), and possible downsizing of the <!--del_lnk--> military, on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999. Assuming no deterioration of the political atmosphere, growth should rise to 5% a year in 2000-2001.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>According to the <!--del_lnk--> CIA Factbook, 51% of the Togolese people follow <!--del_lnk--> indigenous African beliefs.

      <p>Togo&#39;s transition to democracy is stalled. Its democratic institutions remain nascent and fragile. President Eyad&eacute;ma, who ruled Togo under a one-party system for nearly twenty-five of his thirty-seven years in power, died of a heart attack on <!--del_lnk--> February 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2005. Under the constitution, the speaker of parliament, <!--del_lnk--> Fambar&eacute; Ouattara Natchaba, should have become president, pending a new election. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris. The Togolese army closed the nation&#39;s borders, forcing the plane to land in nearby Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the army announced that Eyad&eacute;ma&#39;s son <!--del_lnk--> Faure Gnassingb&eacute;, also known as Faure Eyad&eacute;ma, who had been the communications minister, would succeed him. The constitution of Togo declared that in the case of the president&#39;s death, the speaker of Parliament takes his place, and has sixty days to call new elections. However, on February 6th, Parliament retroactively changed the Constitution, declaring that Faure would hold office for the rest of his father&#39;s term, with elections deferred until 2008. The stated justification was that Natchaba was out of the country. <!--del_lnk--> . The government also moved to remove Natchaba as speaker <!--del_lnk-->  and replaced him with Faure Gnassingb&eacute;, who was sworn in on <!--del_lnk--> February 7, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, despite the international criticism of the succession. <!--del_lnk--> <p>The African Union described the takeover as a military <!--del_lnk--> coup d&#39;&eacute;tat. <!--del_lnk-->  International pressure came also from the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Within Togo, opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which several hundred died. In the village of <!--del_lnk--> An&eacute;ho reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a large scale massacre by government troop went largely unreported. In response, Gnassingb&eacute; agreed to hold <!--del_lnk--> elections and on <!--del_lnk--> February 25, Gnassingb&eacute; resigned as president, but soon afterwards accepted the nomination to run for the office in April. On <!--del_lnk--> April 24, 2005, Gnassingb&eacute; was elected president of Togo, receiving over 60% of the vote according to official results. However fraud was suspected as cause of his election, due to a lack of presence of the European Union or other such oversight. See the History section of this article for details. Parliament designated Deputy Speaker <!--del_lnk--> Bonfoh Abbass as interim president until the inauguration of the election winner.<!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Current_political_situation" name="Current_political_situation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Current political situation</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 3, 2005, Gnassingb&eacute; was sworn in as the new president garnering 60% of the vote according to official results. Disquiet has continued however with the opposition declaring the voting rigged, claiming the military stole ballot boxes from various polling stations in the South, as well as other election irregularities, such as telecommunication shutdown. <!--del_lnk-->  The European Union has suspended aid in support of the opposition claims, while the African Union and the United States have declared the vote &quot;reasonably fair&quot; and accepted the outcome. The Nigerian president and Chair of the AU, <!--del_lnk--> Olus&#x1EB9;gun &#x1ECC;basanj&#x1ECD;, has sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government, but rejected an AU Commission appointment of former <a href="../../wp/z/Zambia.htm" title="Zambia">Zambian</a> president, <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Kaunda, as special AU envoy to Togo (<!--del_lnk-->  and <!--del_lnk--> ). Later in June, President Gnassingbe named opposition leader <!--del_lnk--> Edem Kodjo as the prime Minister.<p>As of April 2006 reconciliation talks between the government and the opposition are in progress; said talks were suspended after Eyadema&#39;s death in 2005. In August the government and the opposition signed an accord providing for the participation of opposition parties in a transitional government.<p><a id="Culture_and_sport" name="Culture_and_sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture and sport</span></h2>
