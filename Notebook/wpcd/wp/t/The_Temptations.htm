      <p><b>The Temptations</b> (often abbreviated as <i>&quot;The Tempts&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;The Temps&quot;</i>) are an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> Motown <!--del_lnk--> singing group whose repertoire has included <!--del_lnk--> doo-wop, <!--del_lnk--> soul, <!--del_lnk--> psychedelia, <!--del_lnk--> funk, <!--del_lnk--> disco, <a href="../../wp/r/Rhythm_and_blues.htm" title="Rhythm and blues">R&amp;B</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> adult contemporary.<p>Formed in <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a> in 1960 as <i>The Elgins</i>, The Temptations have always featured five <!--del_lnk--> African American male vocalists/dancers. The group, known for its recognizable choreography, distinct harmonies, and onstage suits, has been said to be as influential to soul as <a href="../../wp/t/The_Beatles.htm" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are to <!--del_lnk--> rock . Having sold an estimated 22 million albums by 1982, The Temptations are one of the most successful groups in music history and were the definitive male vocal group of the 1960s . In addition, they have the second-longest tenure on Motown (behind <!--del_lnk--> Stevie Wonder), as they were with the label for a total of 40 years: 16 years from 1961 to 1977, and 24 more from 1980 to 2004 (from 1977 to 1980, they were signed to <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Records). <!--del_lnk--> As of 2006, The Temptations continue to perform and record for <!--del_lnk--> Universal Records with only one original member, founder <!--del_lnk--> Otis Williams, in its lineup.<p>Like its sister group <a href="../../wp/t/The_Supremes.htm" title="The Supremes">The Supremes</a>, The Temptations&#39; lineup has changed frequently over the years. The original group included members of two local Detroit vocal groups: second <!--del_lnk--> tenor/<!--del_lnk--> baritone <!--del_lnk--> Otis Williams, first tenor <!--del_lnk--> Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant and <!--del_lnk--> bass <!--del_lnk--> Melvin Franklin from <i>The Distants</i>; and first tenor/<!--del_lnk--> falsetto <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Kendricks and second tenor/baritone <!--del_lnk--> Paul Williams (no relation to Otis) from <i>The Primes</i>. Among the most notable future Temptations were lead singers <!--del_lnk--> David Ruffin and <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Edwards (both of whom became successful Motown solo artists after leaving the group), <!--del_lnk--> Richard Street (another former Distant), <!--del_lnk--> Damon Harris, <!--del_lnk--> Ron Tyson, <!--del_lnk--> Ali-Ollie Woodson, <!--del_lnk--> Theo Peoples, and <!--del_lnk--> G.C. Cameron.<p>Over the course of their career, The Temptations have released four number-one pop hit singles and 14 number-one R&amp;B hit singles. Their material has earned them three <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Awards, while two more awards were conferred upon the <!--del_lnk--> songwriters and <!--del_lnk--> producers who crafted their seminal 1972 hit &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Papa Was a Rollin&#39; Stone&quot;.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Birmingham, Alabama teenagers <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Kendricks, <!--del_lnk--> Paul Williams, Kel Osbourne, and Wiley Waller, who all shared a love of singing, formed a <!--del_lnk--> doo-wop group called The Caviliers in 1955. Reduced to a trio after Waller left the group in 1957, Kendricks, Williams, and Osbourne left Birmingham in order to break into the music business. After first moving to <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>, they settled in <a href="../../wp/d/Detroit%252C_Michigan.htm" title="Detroit, Michigan">Detroit</a>. <i>The Primes</i>, as the <!--del_lnk--> doo-wop trio was now called, were well-known around Detroit for their meticulous performances. Group manager Milton Jenkins even created a sister group for The Primes called <!--del_lnk--> The Primettes, recruiting <!--del_lnk--> junior high schoolers <!--del_lnk--> Florence Ballard, <!--del_lnk--> Mary Wilson, <!--del_lnk--> Diane Ross, and <!--del_lnk--> Betty McGlown for the spin-off act.<p><a id="The_Distants" name="The_Distants"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The Distants</span></h4>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Otis Williams had moved from <!--del_lnk--> Texarkana, Texas, to Detroit as a young boy. By 1958, he was the leader of <i>Otis Williams &amp; the Siberians</i>, a doo-wop group that included Williams, his friend <!--del_lnk--> Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, James &quot;Pee-Wee&quot; Crawford, Vernard Plain, and Arthur Walton. This quintet recorded the single &quot;Pecos Kid&quot; backed with &quot;All of My Life&quot; for a label run by local <!--del_lnk--> dee-jay Senator Bristol Bryant. The single never took off outside the local Detroit market, and the Siberians changed their name to <i>The El Domingoes</i> shortly afterward.<p>At this time, more changes took place. <!--del_lnk--> Montgomery, Alabama native <!--del_lnk--> Melvin Franklin replaced Arthur Walton as the bass singer, and Franklin&#39;s cousin <!--del_lnk--> Richard Street replaced Vernard Plain as lead singer. The group soon signed with Northern Records, run by Jonnie Mae Matthews, who renamed the group <i>The Distants</i>. The Distants recorded two singles for Northern, &quot;Come On&quot; (1959, featuring additional background vocals by <!--del_lnk--> The Andantes), and &quot;Alright&quot; (1960). Between these two releases, Albert &quot;Mooch&quot; Harrell replaced Pee-Wee Crawford. &quot;Come On&quot; was a local hit for the Distants, and the Warwick label picked the record up for national distribution. After the release of &quot;Alright&quot;, Matthews appointed Williams the group leader, and the group was renamed <i>Otis Williams &amp; the Distants</i>.<p><a id="Influences_and_colleagues" name="Influences_and_colleagues"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Influences and colleagues</span></h3>
      <p>The Primes and The Distants were but two of dozens of local male vocal acts, the most famous of which was <!--del_lnk--> The Miracles, led by <!--del_lnk--> Smokey Robinson. The Miracles were known for their excellent stage show, and their pop success was something for which both groups strived. Other important inspirations included <!--del_lnk--> The Cadillacs, <!--del_lnk--> Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers, <!--del_lnk--> The Drifters, and the <!--del_lnk--> Isley Brothers.<p>The various members of The Primes and The Distants who would later become part of The Temptations met a number of their later <!--del_lnk--> Motown bandmates, labelmates, and producers during the early part of their careers. Melvin Franklin had been a member of the recording group The Voice Masters, which also included among its ranks <!--del_lnk--> Lamont Dozier and <!--del_lnk--> David Ruffin. The musicians at the recording session for the Distants&#39; &quot;Come On&quot; included <!--del_lnk--> James Jamerson on <!--del_lnk--> bass; <!--del_lnk--> The Andantes on background vocals; and, on <!--del_lnk--> tambourine, <!--del_lnk--> Norman Whitfield.<p><a id="Forming_The_Temptations" name="Forming_The_Temptations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Forming The Temptations</span></h3>
      <p>Although &quot;Come On&quot; sold decently in the Detroit area, the Distants never saw much of their share from the record sales, and the second single was not as successful. After receiving an offer from <!--del_lnk--> Berry Gordy of <!--del_lnk--> Motown Records, the group got out of its contract with Matthews and left Northern. At the same time, it lost Mooch Harrell, Richard Street, and the rights to use its name. Street would front a new group of Distants for the local Thelma label during the early 1960s.<p>The Distants were acquainted with The Primes, as both groups made the same rounds to local record hops, talent shows, and concerts. The two groups were friendly rivals. Kel Osbourne left the Primes and moved to <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams returned to Alabama. While in Detroit visiting relatives, Eddie Kendricks called Otis Williams, who, needing two more members for an audition for Gordy, offered Kendricks a place in the Distants. Kendricks agreed, with one condition &mdash; that he could bring Paul Williams with him. Otis Williams agreed, and Kendricks and Paul Williams moved back to Detroit to join the group.<p>The new lineup of Otis Williams, Franklin, Bryant, Kendricks, and Paul Williams took on the name <i>The Elgins</i> and auditioned for Motown in March 1961. Gordy agreed to sign the group to his Miracle Records imprint, but discovered just before signing that there was already a singing group called The Elgins. The quintet quickly began tossing about ideas for a new name on the steps of Motown&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Hitsville U.S.A. headquarters. At Miracle Records employee Billy Mitchell and Otis Williams&#39; suggestion, <i>The Temptations</i> became the group&#39;s new moniker. The <i>Elgins</i> name would re-surface at Motown in 1965, when Gordy renamed a quartet called <i>The Downbeats</i> as <i><!--del_lnk--> The Elgins</i>.<p>The Temptations released two singles on Miracle, &quot;Oh Mother of Mine&quot; and &quot;Check Yourself&quot;, before it was closed and merged with the Gordy label (to avoid confusion with <!--del_lnk--> The Miracles singing group). All seven of The Temptations&#39; singles released between 1961 and 1963 failed to make it onto the US pop singles charts; the 1962 single &quot;Dream Come True&quot; made it to number 22 on the R&amp;B chart. Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks split most of the leads during this period, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead.<p>Many <!--del_lnk--> songwriter and <!--del_lnk--> producer teams had been trying to craft a hit for The Temptations, including Berry Gordy, <!--del_lnk--> Mickey Stevenson, Clarence Paul, and <!--del_lnk--> Norman Whitfield. Gordy had in fact written the song &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Do You Love Me&quot; for The Temptations in 1961, but when he was unable to get a hold of the group, he recorded the song with <!--del_lnk--> The Contours instead. Miracles lead singer <!--del_lnk--> Smokey Robinson produced his first Temptations single, the Paul Williams-led &quot;I Want a Love I Can See&quot;, in 1963, and proved to have the best rapport with the group.<p>Bryant, who preferred his day job as a <!--del_lnk--> milkman to performing, soon became restless and uncooperative. After a performance at the 1963 Motown company <!--del_lnk--> Christmas party, Bryant was fired from the group. His replacement was <!--del_lnk--> Whynot, Mississippi native <!--del_lnk--> David Ruffin, younger brother of Motown artist <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Ruffin.<p><a id="The_.22Classic_5.22_Era" name="The_.22Classic_5.22_Era"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The &quot;Classic 5&quot; Era</span></h3>
      <p>In January 1964, Robinson co-wrote and produced &quot;<!--del_lnk--> The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot; with Kendricks on lead; the single became The Temptations&#39; first Top 20 hit that April. While traveling as part of Motown&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Motortown Revue later that year, Robinson and fellow Miracle Ronald White wrote a song for the emotive Ruffin to sing lead on, which The Temptations recorded in the fall of 1964. That song, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> My Girl,&quot; became The Temptations&#39; first number-one pop hit in March 1965, and is their signature song to this day.<p>David Ruffin&#39;s emergence as lead singer gave way to the Temptations&#39; most successful period, today referred to as the &quot;Classic 5&quot; era, during which Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Otis Williams, and Paul Williams recorded many of the group&#39;s most familiar hits. After the success of &quot;My Girl&quot;, Ruffin sang lead on the next three Temptations singles, &quot;It&#39;s Growing&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Since I Lost My Baby&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> My Baby&quot;, all of which made it to the Top 20 in 1965. The <!--del_lnk--> b-side to &quot;My Baby&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Don&rsquo;t Look Back&quot;, featured a lead from Paul Williams, and was a <!--del_lnk--> sleeper hit on the R&amp;B charts.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1966, <!--del_lnk--> Norman Whitfield became The Temptations&#39; new main producer, after his &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ain&#39;t Too Proud to Beg&quot; performed better than Smokey Robinson&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Get Ready&quot; on the US pop charts. Whitfield began pushing the group away from Smokey Robinson&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> ballad-based production towards a harder-edged and <!--del_lnk--> brass-heavy soul sound reminiscent of the work of <!--del_lnk--> James Brown.<p>Nearly all of the pre-1968 Whitfield-produced Temptations singles featured David Ruffin on lead vocals, including the R&amp;B number-one/pop Top 10 hits &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Beauty is Only Skin Deep&quot; and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> (I Know) I&#39;m Losing You&quot;. Other singles from this period included &quot;You&#39;re My Everything&quot;, on which Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin share lead vocals, and &quot;All I Need&quot;, produced by Whitfield&#39;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; <!--del_lnk--> Frank Wilson.<p>Whitfield&#39;s writing partners during this period included <!--del_lnk--> Roger Penzabene, Temptations road show manager Cornelius Grant, and <!--del_lnk--> Edward Holland, Jr.. After Eddie Holland left Motown with the rest of the <!--del_lnk--> Holland-Dozier-Holland songwriting/production team in <!--del_lnk--> 1967, <!--del_lnk--> Barrett Strong, the singer on Motown&#39;s first hit, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Money (That&#39;s What I Want)&quot;, began working with Whitfield and Penzabene on Temptations material. Two of Whitfield, Strong, and Penzabene&#39;s collaborations, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Wish It Would Rain&quot; and &quot;I Could Never Love Another (After Loving You)&quot;, became hits in 1968. Strong became Whitfield&#39;s sole lyricist after Penzbene&#39;s death in December 1967.<p><a id="Exit_David_Ruffin" name="Exit_David_Ruffin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exit David Ruffin</span></h3>
      <p>Between 1964 and 1968, The Temptations went from unknown hopefuls to international stars. The group appeared frequently on television shows such as <i><!--del_lnk--> American Bandstand</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Ed Sullivan Show</i>, and catered to middle America with a pop standards album (<i><!--del_lnk--> The Temptations in a Mellow Mood</i>, 1967) and performances at the <!--del_lnk--> Copacabana in <a href="../../wp/n/New_York_City.htm" title="New York City">New York City</a> and other such supper clubs. Outside of music, the Temptations were made honorary members of <!--del_lnk--> Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.<p>Initially laid back and even-keeled, by 1967 David Ruffin felt that he was almost single-handedly responsible for the group&#39;s success. He demanded special treatment, riding to and from gigs in a private <!--del_lnk--> mink-lined <!--del_lnk--> limousine with his then-girlfriend, singer <!--del_lnk--> Tammi Terrell (well-known for her duets with <a href="../../wp/m/Marvin_Gaye.htm" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>), instead of in the group limousine the other four Temptations used. Ruffin missed a number of rehearsals, concerts, and group meetings; and began regularly using <!--del_lnk--> cocaine. In addition, Ruffin wanted top billing. After seeing how Motown had made <!--del_lnk--> Diana Ross the focus of <a href="../../wp/t/The_Supremes.htm" title="The Supremes">The Supremes</a> by renaming the group &quot;Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes&quot;, Ruffin demanded that his group be renamed, as well &mdash; to &quot;David Ruffin &amp; the Temptations.&quot;<p>There was general agreement among the rest of The Temptations that Ruffin needed to be replaced. Otis Williams insists that Ruffin was given fair warning that if he did not change his attitude, he would be fired. When Ruffin missed a June 1968 engagement at a <a href="../../wp/c/Cleveland%252C_Ohio.htm" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a> supper club to instead attend a show performed by his new girlfriend (<!--del_lnk--> Dean Martin&#39;s daughter Gail), it was decided that he had crossed the line. The other four Temptations drew up legal documentation firing Ruffin from the group, and <!--del_lnk--> Dennis Edwards, formerly of <!--del_lnk--> The Contours, was brought in as the new lead singer. Edwards and Ruffin were good friends, and Ruffin at first went along with the changing of the guard. Shortly afterward, however, Ruffin began turning up at The Temptations&#39; shows, jumping onstage during performances of the songs he once sang lead on and stealing the spotlight. The audiences were delighted, but The Temptations and Motown were frustrated and embarrassed. Extra security guards were hired to prevent Ruffin from attending The Temptations&#39; performances. Ruffin sued Motown in October 1968, seeking a release from the label, and Motown settled by offering Ruffin a solo recording deal.<p>Beginning in 1968, Berry Gordy commissioned a number of collaborations for The Temptations with their old colleagues Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes, including a joint tour, two studio albums (<i><!--del_lnk--> Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join the Temptations</i>, which featured the number-two hit single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I&#39;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;, and <i><!--del_lnk--> Together</i>), and two <!--del_lnk--> NBC <a href="../../wp/t/Television.htm" title="Television">television</a> specials, <i><!--del_lnk--> TCB</i> (aired <!--del_lnk--> December 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1968) and <i><!--del_lnk--> G.I.T. on Broadway</i> (aired <!--del_lnk--> November 12, <!--del_lnk--> 1969). The tracks for <i>Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes Join the Temptations</i> included Dennis Edwards&#39; first studio recordings with the Temptations.<p><a id="Psychedelic_soul" name="Psychedelic_soul"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Psychedelic soul</span></h3>
      <p>Rough-voiced Dennis Edwards&#39; addition to the Temptations coincided with producer Norman Whitfield&#39;s adoption of a new sound for the group. In the fall of 1968, Whitfield began producing <!--del_lnk--> psychedelic-based material for The Temptations, derived primarily from the sound of <!--del_lnk--> funk band <!--del_lnk--> Sly &amp; the Family Stone. This new style, which debuted with the Top 10 hit single &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Cloud Nine&quot; in October 1968, was a marked departure from the David Ruffin-era ballads. The instrumentation was <!--del_lnk--> funkier, the beat was hard-driving, and all five Temptations traded lead vocals <i>&agrave; la</i> the Family Stone. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, the centerpiece of the group&#39;s landmark <i><!--del_lnk--> Cloud Nine</i> LP, was a Top 10 hit and won Motown its first <!--del_lnk--> Grammy Award, for <!--del_lnk--> Best R&amp;B Vocal Group Performance <!--del_lnk--> of 1969.<p>The blending of the Motown sound and psychedelic rock sound resulted in a new subgenre of music called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> psychedelic soul&quot;, also evident in the work of Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> Reflections&quot;, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Love Child&quot;), Marvin Gaye (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot;), and the music of <!--del_lnk--> The Fifth Dimension and <!--del_lnk--> War. More Temptations psychedelic soul singles would follow in 1969 and 1970, among them &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Run Away Child, Running Wild&quot; (a number-one R&amp;B hit), &quot;<!--del_lnk--> I Can&#39;t Get Next to You&quot; (a number-one pop hit), &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Psychedelic Shack&quot; , &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Ball of Confusion (That&#39;s What the World is Today)&quot;, and &quot;Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the World)&quot;.<p><a id="Exit_Eddie_Kendricks_and_Paul_Williams" name="Exit_Eddie_Kendricks_and_Paul_Williams"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Exit Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams</span></h3>
      <p>Paul Williams had <a href="../../wp/s/Sickle-cell_disease.htm" title="Sickle-cell disease">sickle-cell disease</a> and frequently was in poor health. By the late-1960s, he had developed <!--del_lnk--> alcoholism, which, when combined with complications from sickle-cell, made it hard for him to continue with the group. <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">Oxygen</a> tanks were kept in the wings of performance venue stages for Williams, and the other four Temptations made valiant efforts to raid his alcohol stashes and drain his <!--del_lnk--> cognac bottles. By 1969, former Distant Richard Street, now lead singer of Motown act <!--del_lnk--> The Monitors, was touring with the group as a backup replacement for Williams. For most shows, Street would sing Williams&#39; parts (save for his solo numbers) from offstage behind a curtain, while Williams danced and <!--del_lnk--> lip-synched onstage. At other shows, and during most of the second half of 1970, Street took Williams&#39; place onstage.<p>As Paul Williams&#39; health failed, Eddie Kendricks became detached from the group. He regularly picked fights with Otis Wlliams and Melvin Franklin over the group&#39;s leadership. In addition, Kendricks was uncomfortable with the psychedelic soul material the group was now performing, preferring the material from the earlier days. Kendricks rekindled his friendship with David Ruffin, who persuaded him to quit The Temptations and go solo. After another confrontation between himself, Williams, and Franklin during a November 1970 Copacabana engagement, Kendricks walked out in-between shows and did not return. Both Kendricks and Williams agreed at this time that Kendricks would be leaving the group.<p>Before Kendricks officially left the Temptations, he and Paul Williams recorded the lead vocals for &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me)&quot;, a lush, wistful ballad that became Kendricks&#39; Temptations swan-song. Released as a single in January 1971, &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; began steadily climbing the US pop singles chart. By the time &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; hit number-one in March, Kendricks had negotiated his release from the group and signed a solo deal with Motown&#39;s Tamla imprint.<p>In April 1971, Paul Williams quit The Temptations, after a <!--del_lnk--> doctor declared that he was unable to continue performing. Richard Street officially took his place, while Williams remained on The Temptations&#39; payroll as an advisor and choreographer. After Williams had recovered enough to perform again, Motown made plans for a Paul Williams solo career, but he committed <!--del_lnk--> suicide on <!--del_lnk--> August 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1973.<p>Kendricks&#39; original replacement was to have been Ricky Owens from <!--del_lnk--> The Vibrations. However, Owens gave poorly received performances during the few shows he performed with the group, and he was dropped after only a few weeks. During most of the spring of 1971, the Temptations remained a quartet, and recorded the single &quot;It&#39;s Summer&quot; without a fifth member. By May, they had found a permanent replacement first tenor in twenty-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Damon Harris.<p><a id="The_Temptations_in_the_early_1970s" name="The_Temptations_in_the_early_1970s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Temptations in the early 1970s</span></h3>
      <p>Otis Williams, Dennis Edwards, Melvin Franklin, Richard Street, and Damon Harris continued recording and performing, and Norman Whitfield continued producing hits for them. Among these were Top 40 hits such as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Superstar (Remember How You Got Where You Are)&quot; (1971), a message from The Temptations to the estranged David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, and &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; (1972).<p>The fall of 1972 saw the release of Norman Whitfield&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> magnum opus, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Papa Was a Rollin&#39; Stone&quot;. Originally a three-minute record written and produced for <!--del_lnk--> The Undisputed Truth, Whitfield took the sombre tune and created a sprawling, dramatic twelve-minute version for The Temptations. An edited seven-minute version was released as a single in September 1972, hitting number-one on the pop charts and number-five on the R&amp;B charts. In 1973, &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#39; Stone&quot; won The Temptations their second Grammy for <!--del_lnk--> Best R&amp;B Performance by a Group. Whitfield and arranger/conductor Paul Riser won the award for <!--del_lnk--> Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance with the instrumental version of &quot;Papa&quot; on the single&#39;s b-side, and Whitfield and Barrett Strong won the songwriters&#39; Grammy for <!--del_lnk--> Best R&amp;B Song.<p>After &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#39; Stone&quot;, Whitfield stopped working with Barrett Strong, and began writing The Temptations&#39; material on his own. The success of &quot;Papa&quot; led Whitfield to create more elongated, operatic pieces, including the Top 40 hit &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (1973) and several of the tracks on the resulting <i><!--del_lnk--> Masterpiece</i> album. Tensions developed between Whitfield and The Temptations, who found Whitfield arrogant and difficult to work with. The group cited his habitual tardiness, his emphasis of the instrumental tracks over the vocals on many of his productions, and the declining singles and albums sales as other sources of conflict. Otis Williams complained about Whitfield&#39;s actions and the Temptations&#39; stagnant sales to Berry Gordy, who intervened and reassigned them to <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey Bowen, co-producer of the 1967 <i>In a Mellow Mood</i> album.<p>The final Norman Whitfield-produced Temptations album, <i><!--del_lnk--> 1990</i>, was released in late 1973, and included the Top 30 single &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;. Whitfield left Motown shortly afterwards, and in 1975 established <!--del_lnk--> Whitfield Records, taking with him The Undisputed Truth, <!--del_lnk--> Willie Hutch, and <!--del_lnk--> Rose Royce, who performed the instrumental track for &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;.<p><a id="Dry_spell" name="Dry_spell"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Dry spell</span></h3>
      <p>Bowen&#39;s first LP with The Temptations was 1975&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> A Song For You</i>, which included a cover of the titular <!--del_lnk--> Leon Russell tune (popularized with soul audiences by <!--del_lnk--> Donny Hathaway), along with the pop Top 40/R&amp;B number-one hits &quot;Happy People&quot; (featuring <!--del_lnk--> The Commodores as the instrumentalists) and &quot;Shakey Ground&quot; (featuring instrumentation by <!--del_lnk--> P-Funk&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Eddie Hazel and his band), and &quot;Glasshouse&quot;, the group&#39;s final Top 40 Pop hit. Damon Harris was fired from the group during the recording of <i>A Song for You</i>, as his behaviour and work ethic were deemed unprofessional; his replacement was <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> native Glenn Leonard.<p>A number of producers, including Bowen, <!--del_lnk--> Brian Holland, James Carmichael, and even The Temptations themselves tried producing hits for the next three LP&#39;s, <i><!--del_lnk--> House Party</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> Wings of Love</i>, and <i><!--del_lnk--> The Temptations Do the Temptations</i>, but each single performed worse than the last.<p>In 1977, The Temptations left Motown for <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Records, citing Motown&#39;s inattention as the reason for their declining sales and popularity. Shortly after leaving Motown, Dennis Edwards left the group to begin a Motown solo career, which did not materialze at this time. The Atlantic Temptations releases, with Louis Price as the main lead vocalist in Edwards&#39; place, did no better than their Motown releases. Berry Gordy fought to re-sign The Temptations to Motown, finally succeeding in 1980.<p><a id="Return_to_Motown_and_Reunion" name="Return_to_Motown_and_Reunion"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Return to Motown and <i>Reunion</i></span></h3>
      <p>Upon the return to Motown, Price departed from the group, and Dennis Edwards returned to the lineup. Berry Gordy co-wrote and produced The Temptations&#39; first single under the new contract, &quot;Power&quot;, which missed the Top 40 but hit number 11 on the R&amp;B charts. Two years of underperforming singles and albums followed until Motown began planning a Temptations reunion tour in 1982.<p>Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin, whose solo careers had by now run dry, agreed to rejoin the group for the <i><!--del_lnk--> Reunion</i> album and tour. Melvin Franklin&#39;s nephew, Motown <!--del_lnk--> funk star <!--del_lnk--> Rick James, had previously used The Temptations as backup vocalists on his 1981 hit &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Super Freak&quot;, and wrote, produced, and guested on the <i>Reunion</i> album&#39;s lead single, &quot;Standing on the Top&quot;.<p>&quot;Standing on the Top&quot;, which featured Ruffin, Kendricks, and Dennis Edwards on lead, went to number-six on the R&amp;B charts. The <i>Reunion</i> tour with all seven Temptations (Ruffin, Kendricks, Otis Williams, Franklin, Edwards, Richard Street, and Glenn Leonard) was financially successful, but ended up a stressful venture: Kendricks&#39; voice had weakened after decades of <!--del_lnk--> chain smoking, and Ruffin, still addicted to <!--del_lnk--> cocaine, missed a number of the performances. At the conclusion of the <i>Reunion</i> tour, Ruffin and Kendricks were fired, and they began touring and performing together as a duo. Glenn Leonard also left at this time, and was replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Ron Tyson.<p><a id="From_the_1980s_to_the_1990s" name="From_the_1980s_to_the_1990s"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">From the 1980s to the 1990s</span></h3>
      <p>By this time, The Temptations&#39; releases were no longer performing well on the pop charts, though they sometimes made the R&amp;B Top 20. &quot;Love on My Mind Tonight&quot; made it to number 17, and &quot;Sail Away&quot;, produced by a returning Norman Whitfield, peaked at number 13. In 1984, Edwards left the group for a second chance at a solo career, and was replaced with <!--del_lnk--> Ali-Ollie Woodson, who had been a potential candidate to replace Edwards back in 1977. Woodson&#39;s first lead on a Temptations single was 1984&#39;s &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady&quot;. &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;, co-written by himself and Otis Williams, and co-produced by Al McKay and Ralph Johnson, formerly of <!--del_lnk--> Earth, Wind and Fire. The single became a notable success on R&amp;B radio, reaching number-two on the R&amp;B charts, but did not cross over to pop audiences. Woodson remained with The Temptations until 1987, when he was replaced by a returning (for the second time) Dennis Edwards.<p>The following year, Otis Williams published his autobiography, <i>Temptations</i>, co-written with Patricia Romanowski. It chronicled the careers of The Temptations from the Primes/Distants days to the present, focusing on the lives of Williams and his best friend Melvin Franklin. An updated version was published in 2002.<p>Dennis Edwards left The Temptations for the third and final time in late 1989, with Ali-Ollie Woodson re-joining the lineup. The same year, The Temptations were inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, honoring Edwards, Franklin, Otis Williams, David Ruffin, Eddie Kendrick, and, posthumously, Paul Williams. After reuniting at the induction ceremony, Edwards, Ruffin, and Kendrick made plans to tour and record as &quot;Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards, Former Leads of The Temptations&quot;. The tour was carried out, much to the chagrin of Otis Williams and Motown, but production on the album was cut short when Ruffin, age 50, died on <!--del_lnk--> June 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1991 after overdosing on cocaine. Kendrick was diagnosed with <a href="../../wp/l/Lung_cancer.htm" title="Lung cancer">lung cancer</a> but continued to perform; he died on <!--del_lnk--> October 5, <!--del_lnk--> 1992 at the age of 52 in his native Birmingham.<p>Richard Street left The Temptations in 1992 after a twenty-year association with the group, with <!--del_lnk--> Theo Peoples taking his place. Two years later, Melvin Franklin was forced to leave the group because of failing health; he died on <!--del_lnk--> February 23, <!--del_lnk--> 1995 at the age of 52 after suffering a <!--del_lnk--> brain seizure. <!--del_lnk--> Ray Davis from <!--del_lnk--> Parliament/<!--del_lnk--> Funkadelic assumed the bass role for the 1995 pop standards album <i><!--del_lnk--> For Lovers Only</i> (which contained two tracks led by Melvin Franklin). He left after <!--del_lnk--> throat cancer diagnosis that year, replaced by Harry McGilberry, a former member of The Futures. <i>For Lovers Only</i> would also be the last for lead Ali Woodson; he left in <!--del_lnk--> 1996, and was replaced by new member Terry Weeks.<p>The new lineup, consisting of Otis Williams, Ron Tyson, Theo Peoples, Harry McGilberry, and Terry Weeks, continued, and was featured in the halftime show of <!--del_lnk--> Super Bowl XXXII, which marked the 40th anniversary of Motown. In 1998, The Temptations released <i><!--del_lnk--> Phoenix Rising</i>, their first million-selling album in over twenty years. The album was anchored by the Theo-led single &quot;Stay&quot;, a number-one hit on the adult contemporary charts that featured a <!--del_lnk--> sample from The Temptations&#39; &quot;My Girl&quot;. During the recording of the album, however, Theo Peoples departed, to be replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Barrington &quot;Bo&quot; Henderson (the album featured both Peoples and Henderson on different tracks).<p><a id="The_Temptations_mini-series" name="The_Temptations_mini-series"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Temptations</i> mini-series</span></h3>

      <p>Several former-Temptations continue to perform outside of the group in spin-off or offshoot acts.<p>Following David Ruffin&#39;s death, Dennis Edwards and Eddie Kendricks, along with other members, began touring as &quot;The Temptations&quot; , and following Kendrick&#39;s death, &quot;Dennis Edwards and the Temptations&quot;. This prompted a legal battle between Edwards and Otis Williams. It was decided that Edwards&#39; group would be called &quot;The Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards&quot;, the name that Edwards tours under to this day. Ali-Ollie Woodson, who led the Temptations during much of the 1980s and 1990s, at one time fronted an act called <i>Ali-Ollie Woodson &amp; the Emperors of Soul</i>--<i><!--del_lnk--> Emperors of Soul</i> being the name of the 1994 Temptations <!--del_lnk--> boxed set. However, Woodson joined Dennis Edwards and his Temptations Review in 2006. The Temptations Review&#39;s current lineup includes:Dennis Edwards, Mike Patillo, David Sea (who was a member of Ruffin/Kendrick/Edwards and an original consideration to replace Edwards in 1984), Chris Arnold, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, who replaced Bernard Gibson).<p>Damon Harris formed his own group in the early 1990s, also called <i>The Temptations Review</i>, in later years named <i>The Temptations Tribute</i>. Richard Street leads a group simply billed <i>Richard Street</i>. Glenn Leonard also leads a group, <i>The Temptations Experience</i>, from which Joe Herndon left to join the Temptations  His spot was filled by former Temptations bass Ray Davis, and, following Davis&#39; death on <!--del_lnk--> July 5, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Harry McGilberry, another former Temptations bass. Prior to his stint in Leonard&#39;s group, Joe Herndon had also performed in Harris&#39;s group.<p><a id="Musical_style" name="Musical_style"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Musical style</span></h2>
      <p>The Temptations&#39; songs depended upon the individual members&#39; interaction as a group; unlike many other R&amp;B groups, each member of the Temptations was a lead singer of some capacity. Although the group always had an appointed main lead singer who dominated most the lead vocals (from Paul Williams to David Ruffin, Dennis Edwards, and later singers such as Louis Price, Ali-Ollie Woodson, and G. C. Cameron), that singer was never given more of a promotional push than the other members. Co-lead songs, with two or more of the singers sharing the lead vocals, are common in the Temptations catalog, particularly among the psychedelic-era recordings of the late 1960s/early 1970s.<p><a id="The_.22Motown_Sound.22" name="The_.22Motown_Sound.22"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The &quot;Motown Sound&quot;</span></h3>
      <p>The group would alter their style several times over the years following their first Motown hit, adapting to the popular styles of the day while retaining their signiture visual and vocal styles. The earliest Temptations recordings reflect the influence of producers Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson, featuring a blend of black rhythm and blues and white pop music that came to be later identified as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Motown Sound&quot;. Backed by Motown&#39;s stalwart studio band, <!--del_lnk--> The Funk Brothers, pre-1966 Temptations recordings were built around songs (usually ballads like &quot;My Girl&quot;) with simple, direct lyrics supported by an R&amp;B rhythm section with orchestral strings and horns added for pop appeal. During this period, each recording usually featured only one lead singer, usually David Ruffin or Eddie Kendricks, although Paul Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Otis Williams each had solo numbers of their own at various times.<p>Like most Motown groups, <!--del_lnk--> melisma and other complicated vocalization techniques were eschewed by the Temptations for a more direct, yet obviously <!--del_lnk--> gospel-rooted vocal approach, to make the songs more palpable for white audiences. Creative control remained primarily in Smokey Robinson&#39;s hands, although the Temptations, most frequently Eddie Kendricks, periodically co-wrote some of their material. Kendricks also handled the vocal arrangements for all of the Temptations&#39; material.<p>In 1966, Norman Whitfield changed the group&#39;s dynamic, moving them away from the previous one lead singer model and adding elements derived from the rougher soul of artists like James Brown, <!--del_lnk--> Wilson Pickett, and the performers at <!--del_lnk--> Stax Records. Whitfield and his lyricists crafted Temptations songs with shifts of dynamics, syncopated horn stabs, and more intricate harmony arrangements which spotlighted each singer&#39;s unique vocal range. Onstage, this change was reflected in the group&#39;s use of a custom-made four-headed microphone, which allowed each member freedom to perform without having to all crowd around one or two microphones. Under Whitfield&#39;s control, the Temptations retained their white pop appeal, but also gained popularity amongst black audiences as well.<p><a id="Psychedelic_and_cinematic_soul" name="Psychedelic_and_cinematic_soul"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Psychedelic and cinematic soul</span></h3>
      <p>When David Ruffin was replaced by Dennis Edwards, and Sly &amp; the Family Stone became popular, Whitfield again restructured the Temptations&#39; sound, this time driving the group almost completely into a &quot;psychedelic soul&quot; sound. Recordings from this period (such as &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and &quot;Psychedelic Shack&quot;, featured echoed vocal tracks, distorted <a href="../../wp/g/Guitar.htm" title="Guitar">guitar</a> lines with prominet use of the wah-wah pedal, hard-hitting drums, and various <!--del_lnk--> stereo effects and <!--del_lnk--> sound effects. The majority of these songs feature at least two lead singers; often, all five Temptations sang lead, trading bars <i>a la</i> The Family Stone. Dennis Edwards, whose vocal style had a rougher, more Southern-soul based sound than David Ruffin&#39;s, was featured prominently on most of these recordings.<p>The lyrics for these songs, inspired heavily by <!--del_lnk--> Sly Stone&#39;s concurrent works, centered primarily around social issues such as <!--del_lnk--> integration, the <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_War.htm" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and self-consciousness. Ballads in the group&#39;s traditional style were still being recorded as b-sides and album fillers (the exception being &quot;Just My Imagination&quot;). Many of the psychedelic soul recordings were presented in extended-length mixes longer than the typical three-minute Motown song. Tracks such as the album version of &quot;Run Away Child, Running Wild&quot; from <i>Cloud Nine</i>, &quot;Take a Stroll Thru Your Mind&quot; from <i>Psychedelic Shack</i>, and &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Smiling Faces Sometimes&quot; from <i>Sky&#39;s the Limit</i>, all run at least eight minutes in length. Much of the running time for each song consists of instrumental passages without vocals, at Whitfield&#39;s insistence.<p>&quot;Psychedelic soul&quot; soon gave way to &quot;cinematic soul&quot;: long recordings with detailed orchestration and extended instrumental introductions and bridging passages, oten focusing on lyrics about the <!--del_lnk--> ghettos and inner cities of black America. These songs were heavily influenced by the work of singer/songwriters <!--del_lnk--> Isaac Hayes and <!--del_lnk--> Curtis Mayfield. Unlike Hayes and Mayfield, the Temptations had no creative control over their recordings, and were not fond of the tweleve and thirteen-minute long songs that Norman Whitfield was now producing for them. Whitfield&#39;s contributions were the focal point of Temptations albums such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Solid Rock</i>, <i><!--del_lnk--> All Directions</i>, and particularly <i><!--del_lnk--> Masterpiece</i>.<p><a id="From_funk_to_disco_to_adult_contemporary" name="From_funk_to_disco_to_adult_contemporary"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">From funk to disco to adult contemporary</span></h3>
      <p>After Whitfield was dismissed as the Temptations&#39; producer in 1974, the group altered its sound to accommodate a balance of both up-tempo dance material and ballads. The vocal arrangements began to again focus primarily on one lead singer per track, although leads were still being periodically shared. In addition, the Temptations themselves, after fighting Motown and Berry Gordy for creative control, began to write and produce some of their material. From this point on, the Temptations focused almost exclusively on songs about romance; songs about social issues similar to the Whitfield-era recordings were periodically recorded as well.<p>Mid-1970s Temptations recordings focused significantly on <!--del_lnk--> funk music influences from artists such as <!--del_lnk--> Funkadelic and Sly &amp; the Family Stone; members of both acts contributed to Temptations material during this period. The group&#39;s ballads, reduced to filler material during much of the Whifield period, were restored to the lush sound of the earlier Smokey Robinson-produced hits. After a brief diversion into <!--del_lnk--> disco in the late-1970s, the Temptations settled into an <!--del_lnk--> adult contemporary-rooted form of R&amp;B, a style in which they continue to record. As the ages of its members increased, the Temptations&#39; live shows have focused on less intricate choreography, although dancing remains an important aspect of the group&#39;s act.<p><a id="Legacy_and_influence" name="Legacy_and_influence"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Legacy and influence</span></h2>
      <p>The Temptations&#39;, with their tailored suits and detailed choreography, set the bar for male soul and R&amp;B groups. Before The Temptations became popular, most black vocal groups were rough, high-energy acts with rawer vocals and more improvisational dance movements. Only a few performers, including contemporaries <a href="../../wp/m/Marvin_Gaye.htm" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Sam Cooke, showed the refined style that would be popularized by The Temptations.<p>Berry Gordy insisted his acts be equally appealing to white and black audiences, and employed a creative team to help tailor Motown talent for crossover success. Paul Williams and Motown <!--del_lnk--> choreographer <!--del_lnk--> Cholly Atkins created The Temptation&#39;s trademark precise and energetic, yet refined, dance steps. The most famous of these, the &quot;Temptation Walk&quot;, or &quot;Temptation Strut&quot;, was adapted from similar moves by a 1950s act called <!--del_lnk--> The Flamingos and a 1960s act called <!--del_lnk--> The Vibrations. From those two sources, Paul Williams crafted the group&#39;s signature dance routine.<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, a number of soul groups showed significant influence from the Temptations, among them <!--del_lnk--> The Delfonics, <!--del_lnk--> The Stylistics, <!--del_lnk--> George Clinton&#39;s original <!--del_lnk--> Parliaments, <!--del_lnk--> The Dramatics, and Motown&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> The Jackson 5. These acts, and others, showed the influence of The Temptations in both their vocal performances and their onstage choreography. Several more recent soul and R&amp;B vocal groups, including the <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Gill-led version of <!--del_lnk--> New Edition, <!--del_lnk--> Jodeci, <!--del_lnk--> BLACKstreet, <!--del_lnk--> Dru Hill, and, most notably, 1990s Motown act <!--del_lnk--> Boyz II Men, also showed significant influence from The Temptations.<p>Temptations songs have been covered by scores of musicians, from R&amp;B singers such as <!--del_lnk--> Luther Vandross (&quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot;), to pop vocalists such as <!--del_lnk--> Bette Midler (&quot;Just My Imagination&quot;), to rock bands such as <!--del_lnk--> Rare Earth (&quot;Get Ready&quot;), <a href="../../wp/d/Duran_Duran.htm" title="Duran Duran">Duran Duran</a> (&quot;Ball Of Confusion (That&#39;s What The World Is Today)&quot;) and <a href="../../wp/t/The_Rolling_Stones.htm" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> (&quot;Ain&#39;t Too Proud to Beg&quot;). In 1991, <a href="../../wp/g/Great_Britain.htm" title="Great Britain">British</a> singer <!--del_lnk--> Rod Stewart collaborated with The Temptations on the single &quot;The Motown Song&quot;.<p>The lives and careers of The Temptations were one of several inspirations for <!--del_lnk--> Robert Townsend&#39;s 1991 film about a 1960s Motown-esque male group, <i><!--del_lnk--> The Five Heartbeats</i>.<p><a id="Personnel" name="Personnel"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Personnel</span></h2>
