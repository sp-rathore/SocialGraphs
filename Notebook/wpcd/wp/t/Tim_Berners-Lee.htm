      <p><b>Sir Timothy John &quot;Tim&quot; Berners-Lee</b>, <!--del_lnk--> KBE (born <!--del_lnk--> June 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1955 in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>) is the <!--del_lnk--> inventor of the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> and director of the <!--del_lnk--> World Wide Web Consortium, which oversees its continued development. Informally, in technical circles, he is sometimes called &quot;TimBL&quot; or &quot;TBL&quot;.<p>

</script><a id="Background_and_early_career" name="Background_and_early_career"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Background and early career</span></h2>
      <p>Berners-Lee was born in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a>, the son of <!--del_lnk--> Conway Berners-Lee and <!--del_lnk--> Mary Lee Woods. His parents, both mathematicians, were employed together on the team that built the <!--del_lnk--> Manchester Mark I, one of the earliest computers. They taught Berners-Lee to use mathematics everywhere, even at the dinner table. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School (which has dedicated a new hall in his honour) before moving on to study his O-Levels and A-Levels at <!--del_lnk--> Emanuel School in <!--del_lnk--> Wandsworth where he learned about computer science. He is an <!--del_lnk--> alumnus of <!--del_lnk--> Queen&#39;s College (where he played <!--del_lnk--> tiddlywinks for Oxford, against rival Cambridge), <!--del_lnk--> Oxford University (which has dedicated a computer room in his honour), where he built a <a href="../../wp/c/Computer.htm" title="Computer">computer</a> with a <!--del_lnk--> soldering iron, <!--del_lnk--> TTL <!--del_lnk--> gates, an <!--del_lnk--> M6800 processor and an old television. While at Oxford, he was caught <!--del_lnk--> hacking with a friend and was subsequently banned from using the university computer.<p>He was employed at <!--del_lnk--> Plessey Controls Limited (in <!--del_lnk--> Poole whose main business is traffic lights) in <!--del_lnk--> 1976 as a programmer. He met his first wife Jane while at Oxford and they married soon after they started work in Poole. Jane also worked at <!--del_lnk--> Plessey Telecommunications Limited in Poole. In <!--del_lnk--> 1978, he worked at <!--del_lnk--> D.G. Nash Limited (also in Poole) where he wrote typesetting software and an operating system.<p><a id="World_Wide_Web" name="World_Wide_Web"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">World Wide Web</span></h2>

      <p>While an independent contractor at <!--del_lnk--> CERN from June to December <!--del_lnk--> 1980, Berners-Lee proposed a project based on the concept of <!--del_lnk--> hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. While there, he built a prototype system named <!--del_lnk--> ENQUIRE.<p>After leaving <!--del_lnk--> CERN in 1980 to work at John Poole&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Image Computer Systems Ltd., he returned in <!--del_lnk--> 1984 as a fellow. In 1989, CERN was the largest <a href="../../wp/i/Internet.htm" title="Internet">Internet</a> node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet: &quot;I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the <!--del_lnk--> TCP and <!--del_lnk--> DNS ideas and &mdash; ta-da! &mdash; the World Wide Web.&quot; . He wrote his initial proposal in March of 1989, and in 1990, with the help of <!--del_lnk--> Robert Cailliau, produced a revision which was accepted by his manager, <!--del_lnk--> Mike Sendall. He used similar ideas to those underlying the Enquire system to create the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a>, for which he designed and built the first web browser and editor (called <!--del_lnk--> WorldWideWeb and developed on <!--del_lnk--> NEXTSTEP) and the first Web server called <!--del_lnk--> httpd (short for HyperText Transfer Protocol <!--del_lnk--> daemon).<p>The first Web site built was at <!--del_lnk--> http://info.cern.ch/   and was first put online on <!--del_lnk--> August 6, <!--del_lnk--> 1991. It provided an explanation about what the World Wide Web was, how one could own a browser and how to set up a Web server. It was also the world&#39;s first Web directory, since Berners-Lee maintained a list of other Web sites apart from his own.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1994, Berners-Lee founded the <!--del_lnk--> World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the <!--del_lnk--> Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. In <!--del_lnk--> December 2004 he accepted a chair in <!--del_lnk--> Computer Science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, <!--del_lnk--> University of Southampton, UK, where he will be working on his new project &mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Semantic Web.<p>Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that their standards must be based on royalty-free technology, so they can be easily adopted by anyone. <p><a id="Weaving_the_Web" name="Weaving_the_Web"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Weaving the Web</i></span></h2>
      <p>In Berners-Lee&#39;s book <i><b>Weaving the Web</b></i>, several recurring themes are apparent:<ul>
       <li>It is just as important to be able to edit the Web as browse it. (<!--del_lnk--> Wiki is a step in this direction, although Berners-Lee considers it merely a shadow of the <!--del_lnk--> WYSIWYG functionality of his first browser.)<li>Computers can be used for background tasks that enable humans to work better in groups.<li>Every aspect of the Internet should function as a Web, rather than a hierarchy. Notable current exceptions are the <!--del_lnk--> Domain Name System and the domain naming rules managed by <!--del_lnk--> ICANN.<li>Computer scientists have a moral responsibility as well as a technical responsibility.</ul>
      <p><a id="Recognition" name="Recognition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recognition</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> University of Southampton was the first to recognise Berners-Lee&#39;s contribution to developing the <a href="../../wp/w/World_Wide_Web.htm" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> with an honorary degree in <!--del_lnk--> 1996 and he currently holds a Chair of Computer Science in the School of Electronics and Computer Science. He was the first holder of the <!--del_lnk--> 3Com Founders Chair at <!--del_lnk--> MIT, and is also now a Senior Research Scientist there. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> British Computer Society, an Honorary Fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> Institution of Electrical Engineers, and a member of the <!--del_lnk--> American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<li>In <!--del_lnk--> 1997 he was made an Officer in the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the British Empire, became a Fellow of the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Society in <!--del_lnk--> 2001, and received the <!--del_lnk--> Japan Prize in <!--del_lnk--> 2002. In <!--del_lnk--> 2002 he received the <!--del_lnk--> Principe de Asturias award in the category of Scientific and Technical Research. He shared the prize with <!--del_lnk--> Lawrence Roberts, <!--del_lnk--> Robert Kahn and <!--del_lnk--> Vinton Cerf. Also in 2002, the British public named him among the <!--del_lnk--> 100 Greatest Britons of all time, according to a <a href="../../wp/b/BBC.htm" title="BBC">BBC</a> poll spanning the entire history of the nation.<li>On <!--del_lnk--> April 15, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 he was named as the first recipient of <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Millennium Technology Prize for inventing the World Wide Web. The cash prize, worth one million <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">euros</a> (about &pound;663,000 or USD$1.2 million), was awarded on <!--del_lnk--> June 15, in <a href="../../wp/h/Helsinki.htm" title="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Finland.htm" title="Finland">Finland</a> by President of the Republic of Finland, <!--del_lnk--> Tarja Halonen.<li>He was given the rank of <!--del_lnk--> Knight Commander (the second-highest rank in the <!--del_lnk--> Order of the British Empire) by <a href="../../wp/e/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> as part of the New Year&#39;s Honours on <!--del_lnk--> July 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2004. <li>On <!--del_lnk--> July 21, <!--del_lnk--> 2004 he was presented with the degree of <!--del_lnk--> Doctor of Science (<!--del_lnk--> honoris causa) from <!--del_lnk--> Lancaster University. <li>On <!--del_lnk--> January 27, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 he was named Greatest Briton of 2004 for his achievements as well as displaying the key English characteristics of &quot;diffidence, determination, a sharp sense of humour and adaptability&quot; as put by David Hempleman-Adams, a panel member. <!--del_lnk--> Time Magazine included Berners-Lee in its list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, published in 1999.</ul>
