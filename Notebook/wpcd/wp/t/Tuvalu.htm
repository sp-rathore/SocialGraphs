      <p>Tuvaluans are a Polynesian people who settled the islands around 2000 years ago coming from Tonga and Samoa. During pre-contact times, there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands. 8 of the 9 islands of Tuvalu were inhabited, thus, the name Tuvalu means &quot;eight standing together&quot; in the <!--del_lnk--> Tuvaluan language.<p>Tuvalu was first sighted by <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europeans</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1568 with the arrival of <!--del_lnk--> Alvaro de Menda&ntilde;a y Neyra from <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a>, who encountered the island of <!--del_lnk--> Nui but was unable to land. No other Europeans turned up again until the late <!--del_lnk--> 1700s, when further European explorers reached the area. By the early <!--del_lnk--> 1800s, whalers were in the Pacific, though visiting Tuvalu only infrequently due to the difficulties of landing ships on the atoll, and no settlements were established by them. Peruvian slave raiders (&quot;<!--del_lnk--> blackbirders&quot;) combed the Pacific between <!--del_lnk--> 1862 and <!--del_lnk--> 1864 and Tuvalu was one of the hardest hit Pacific island groups with over 400 people taken from <!--del_lnk--> Funafuti and <!--del_lnk--> Nukulaelae, none of whom returned. In <!--del_lnk--> 1865, the <!--del_lnk--> London Missionary Society, Protestant congregationalists, began their process of evangelization of Tuvalu, and conversion to <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> was complete by the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s. Also in the late 1800s, European traders began to live on the islands hoping to profit from local resources.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1892, the islands became part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <!--del_lnk--> protectorate known as the Ellice Islands. The protectorate was incorporated into the <!--del_lnk--> Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1916. In <!--del_lnk--> 1943 during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Tuvalu was selected as an operations base for Allied forces battling Japanese in the Pacific. Thousands of marines were stationed there until December <!--del_lnk--> 1945. In <!--del_lnk--> 1974, ethnic differences within the colony caused the <!--del_lnk--> Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the <!--del_lnk--> Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands (later <a href="../../wp/k/Kiribati.htm" title="Kiribati">Kiribati</a>). The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in <!--del_lnk--> 1978. Tuvalu Independence Day is celebrated on <!--del_lnk--> October 1st. In 1979 Tuvalu signed a treaty of friendship with the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, which recognized Tuvalu&#39;s possession of four small islands formerly claimed by the United States.<p>As low lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf, the island communities of Tuvalu are especially susceptible to changes in sea level and storm patterns that hit the island undissipated. The extent and causes of sea level change are disputed, however it is estimated that a sea level rise of 20-40 centimetres (8-16&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> in) in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable. The <!--del_lnk--> South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission suggest that while Tuvalu is vulnerable to climate change, there are additional environmental problems such as population growth and poor coastal management, which are affecting sustainable development on the island, they rank the country as extremely vulnerable using the <!--del_lnk--> Environmental Vulnerability Index.  While some commentators have called for the relocation of the population of Tuvalu to Australia, New Zealand or Kioa (Fiji), the current Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> Maatia Toafa says his government does not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population would need to be evacuated. New Zealand has agreed to accept an annual quota of 75 evacuees.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>

She is represented in Tuvalu by a <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General, who is appointed upon the advice of the Prime Minister. The local <!--del_lnk--> unicameral parliament, or <i>Fale I Fono</i>, has 15 members and is elected every four years. Its members elect a <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister who is the <!--del_lnk--> head of government. The Cabinet is appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. Some elders also exercise informal authority on a local level. There are no formal political parties and election campaigns are largely on the basis of personal/family ties and reputation.<p>The highest court in Tuvalu is the High Court, there are eight Island Courts with limited jurisdiction. Rulings from the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal in Fiji.<p>Tuvalu has no regular military forces, and spends no money on the military.

      <p>Tuvalu consists of four reef islands and five true <!--del_lnk--> atolls. Its small, scattered group of atolls has poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres (less than 10&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;mi.) making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The land is very low lying with narrow coral atolls. The highest elevation is five meters (16&nbsp;ft) above the sea level. Funafuti is the largest atoll of the nine low reef islands and atolls that form the Tuvalu volcanic island chain. It comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres (15.6&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mi) (N-S) by 18.4 kilometres (11.4&nbsp;mi) (W-E), centred on 179&deg;7&rsquo;E and 8&deg;30&rsquo;S.

      <p>Tuvalu has almost no natural resources, and its main form of income consists of foreign aid. Virtually the only jobs in the islands that pay a steady wage or salary are with the government. Subsistence farming and fishing remain the primary economic activities, particularly off the capital island of Funafuti. Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins, fishing licences and worker remittances.<p>About 800 Tuvaluans work in <a href="../../wp/n/Nauru.htm" title="Nauru">Nauru</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> phosphate mining industry or aboard foreign ships as sailors. Substantial income is received annually from an international <!--del_lnk--> trust fund established in 1987 by <a href="../../wp/a/Australia.htm" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/New_Zealand.htm" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a>, and the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and supported also by <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>.

The <!--del_lnk--> US government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu, with 1999 payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries at about $9 million, a total which is expected to rise annually. In an effort to reduce its dependence on foreign aid, the government is pursuing public sector reforms, including <!--del_lnk--> privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts of up to 7%.<p>In 1998, Tuvalu began deriving revenue from use of its area code for <!--del_lnk--> &quot;900&quot; lines and from the sale of its &quot;<!--del_lnk--> .tv&quot; Internet domain name. In <!--del_lnk--> 2000, Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet <!--del_lnk--> domain name &quot;<!--del_lnk--> .tv&quot; for $50 million in royalties. However, the Canadian entrepreneur who negotiated the deal, Jason Chapnik, was unable to raise the $50 million in the contracted time period, and the contract eventually fell into other hands.<p>Due to its remoteness, tourism does not provide much income; only a handful of tourists visit Tuvalu annually. Almost all visitors are government officials, aid workers, non-governmental organization officials or consultants.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>The island population has more than doubled since 1980 and was estimated to reach 11,810 in July 2006. The population of Tuvalu is primarily of <!--del_lnk--> Polynesian ethnicity, about 4% of the population in <!--del_lnk--> Micronesian. About 97% of the Tuvaluans are members of the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Tuvalu, a <!--del_lnk--> Protestant <a href="../../wp/c/Christianity.htm" title="Christianity">Christian</a> church. The religion has been mixed with some elements of the indigenous religions. Other religions practiced on the island include Seventh-Day Adventist (1.4%) and <!--del_lnk--> Baha&#39;i (1%).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Tuvaluan language is spoken by virtually everyone, while <!--del_lnk--> Gilbertese is spoken by some people on Nui. English is also an official language, but is not spoken in daily use.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>The traditional community system still to a large extent survives on Tuvalu. Each family has its own task, or <i>salanga</i>, to perform for the community, such as fishing, house building or defence. The skills of a family are passed on from father to son.<p>A traditional sport played in Tuvalu is <i><!--del_lnk--> kilikiti</i>, which is similar to <a href="../../wp/c/Cricket.htm" title="Cricket">cricket</a>.<p>Traditional music prior to European contact included poems performed in a sort of monotonal recitation, though this tradition has since become extinct , as well as <!--del_lnk--> work songs which the women performed to encourage the men while they worked.<p>The most famous form of Tuvaluan dance music, <i><!--del_lnk--> fatele</i>, is influenced by European <!--del_lnk--> melody and <!--del_lnk--> harmony  and is competitive, with each island divided into two sides .<p>The two primary traditional dances of Tuvalu are the <i><!--del_lnk--> fakanu</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> fakaseasea</i>. Of these, the <i>fakanu</i> has since died out, though the <i>fakaseasea</i> lives on, performed only by elders .<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu&quot;</div>
