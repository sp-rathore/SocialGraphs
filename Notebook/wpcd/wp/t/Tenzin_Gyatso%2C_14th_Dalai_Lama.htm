      <p>Gyatso was born to a farming family as <b>Lhamo Thondup</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Wylie: <i>Lha-mo Don-&#39;grub</i>; also spelled &quot;Dhondrub&quot;) on <!--del_lnk--> 6 July <!--del_lnk--> 1935 in far northeastern <!--del_lnk--> Amdo province in the village of Taktser, a small and poor settlement that stood on a hill overlooking a broad valley. His parents, Choekyong and Diki Tsering, were moderately wealthy farmers among about twenty other families making a precarious living off the land raising <a href="../../wp/b/Barley.htm" title="Barley">barley</a>, <!--del_lnk--> buckwheat, and <a href="../../wp/p/Potato.htm" title="Potato">potatoes</a>. He was the fifth surviving child of nine children; counting the children that did not live there would have been 16 children. The eldest child of his family being his sister Tsering Dolma, who was sixteen years older than he. His eldest brother, <!--del_lnk--> Thupten Jigme Norbu, has been recognised as the rebirth of the high <!--del_lnk--> lama, <!--del_lnk--> Takser Rinpoche. His sister <!--del_lnk--> Jetsun Pema went on to depict their mother in the 1997 film <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Years in Tibet</i>. His other elder brothers are Gyalo Thondup and Lobsang Samden. When the Dalai Lama was about two years old, a search party was sent out to find the new <!--del_lnk--> incarnation of the Dalai Lama. Among other omens, the head on the embalmed body of the <!--del_lnk--> thirteenth Dalai Lama (originally facing south) had mysteriously turned to face the northeast, indicating the direction in which the next Dalai Lama would be found. Shortly afterwards, the <!--del_lnk--> Regent <!--del_lnk--> Reting Rinpoche had a <!--del_lnk--> vision indicating Amdo (as the place to search) and a one-story house with distinctive guttering and tiling. After extensive searching, they found that Thondup&#39;s house resembled that in Reting&#39;s vision. They thus presented Thondup with various relics and toys &mdash; some had belonged to the previous Dalai Lama while others hadn&#39;t. Thondup correctly identified all items owned by the previous Dalai Lama, stating &quot;It&#39;s mine! It&#39;s mine!&quot;<p>Thondup was recognised as the rebirth of the Dalai Lama and renamed <b>Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshe Tenzin Gyatso</b> (&quot;Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Compassionate, Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom&quot;). Tibetan Buddhists normally refer to him as <i>Yeshe Norbu</i> (&quot;Wish-Fulfilling Gem&quot;) or just <i>Kundun</i> (&quot;the Presence&quot;). In the West he is often called by followers &quot;His Holiness the Dalai Lama&quot;, which is the <!--del_lnk--> style that the Dalai Lama himself uses on his website. Tenzin Gyatso began his monastic education at the age of six. At age eleven, he met <!--del_lnk--> Heinrich Harrer after spying him in Lhasa through his telescope. Harrer effectively became young Tenzin&#39;s tutor, teaching him about the outside world. The two remained friends until Harrer&#39;s death in 2006. At age twenty-five, he sat for his final examination in <a href="../../wp/l/Lhasa.htm" title="Lhasa">Lhasa</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Jokhang Temple during the annual Monlam (prayer) Festival in 1959. He passed with honours and was awarded the Lharampa degree, the highest-level <i><!--del_lnk--> geshe</i> degree (roughly equivalent to a doctorate in <!--del_lnk--> Buddhist philosophy).<p><a id="Life_as_the_Dalai_Lama" name="Life_as_the_Dalai_Lama"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Life as the Dalai Lama</span></h2>

      <p>As well as being one of the most influential spiritual leaders of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama traditionally claims to be Tibet&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Head of State and most important political ruler. At the age of fifteen, faced with possible conflict with the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>, on 17 November 1950, Tenzin Gyatso was enthroned as the temporal leader of Tibet; however, he was only able to govern for a brief time. In October of that year, an army of the People&#39;s Republic of China entered the territory controlled by the Tibetan administration, easily breaking through the Tibetan defenders.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s Liberation Army stopped short of the old border between Tibet and <!--del_lnk--> Xikang and demanded negotiations. The Dalai Lama sent a delegation to <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>, and, although he rejected the subsequent <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, he did try to work with the Chinese government until 1959. During that year, there was a major uprising among the Tibetan population. In the tense political environment that ensued, the Dalai Lama and his entourage began to suspect that China was planning to kill him. Consequently, he fled to <!--del_lnk--> Dharamsala, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> March 17 of that year, entering India on <!--del_lnk--> March 31 during the Tibetan uprising.<p><a id="Exile_in_India" name="Exile_in_India"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Exile in India</span></h3>
      <p>The Dalai Lama met with the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister of India, <!--del_lnk--> Jawaharlal Nehru, to urge India to pressure China into giving Tibet an autonomous government when relations with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> were not proving successful. Nehru did not want to increase tensions between China and <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, so he encouraged the Dalai Lama to work on the <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen Point Agreement Tibet had with China. Eventually in 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet and set up the <!--del_lnk--> government of Tibet in Exile in <!--del_lnk--> Dharamsala, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, which is often referred to as &quot;Little Lhasa&quot;.<p>After the founding of the exiled government, he rehabilitated the Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements. He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children what he believed to be traditional <!--del_lnk--> language, <!--del_lnk--> history, <!--del_lnk--> religion, and <!--del_lnk--> culture. The <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts was established in 1959, and the <!--del_lnk--> Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies became the primary university for Tibetans in India. He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.<p>The Dalai Lama appealed to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> on the question of Tibet, which resulted in three resolutions adopted by the General Assembly in 1959, 1961, and 1965. These resolutions required China to respect the human rights of <!--del_lnk--> Tibetans and their desire for <!--del_lnk--> self-determination. In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the <!--del_lnk--> Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A Tibetan <!--del_lnk--> parliament-in-exile is elected by the Tibetan <!--del_lnk--> refugees scattered all over the world, and the <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Government in Exile is likewise elected by the Tibetan parliament.<p>At the <!--del_lnk--> Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1987 in <a href="../../wp/w/Washington%252C_D.C..htm" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, he proposed a <!--del_lnk--> Five-Point Peace Plan regarding the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a &quot;zone of <a href="../../wp/p/Peace.htm" title="Peace">peace</a>&quot; and for the end of movement by <!--del_lnk--> ethnic Chinese into Tibet. It also called for &quot;respect for fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms&quot; and &quot;the end of China&#39;s use of Tibet for <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> production, testing, and disposal.&quot; Finally, it urged &quot;earnest negotiations&quot; on the future of Tibet.<p>He proposed a similar plan at <!--del_lnk--> Strasbourg, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, on <!--del_lnk--> 15 June <!--del_lnk--> 1988. He expanded on the Five-Point Peace Plan and proposed the creation of a self-governing <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democratic</a> Tibet, &quot;in association with the People&#39;s Republic of China&quot;. This plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. In October 1991, he expressed his wish to return to Tibet to try to form a mutual assessment on the situation with the Chinese local government. At this time he feared that a violent uprising would take place and wished to avoid it. The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People&#39;s Republic of China sets no preconditions for the return, which they have refused to do.<p>The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on <!--del_lnk--> 6 July <!--del_lnk--> 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home. <!--del_lnk--> Patriarch Alexius II of the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church said, &quot;I confess that the <!--del_lnk--> Russian Orthodox Church highly appreciates the good relations it has with the followers of Buddhism and hopes for their further development&quot;. President <!--del_lnk--> Chen Shui-bian of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> attended an evening celebrating the Dalai Lama&#39;s birthday that was entitled &quot;Traveling with Love and Wisdom for 70 Years&quot; at the <!--del_lnk--> Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in <a href="../../wp/t/Taipei.htm" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>. The President invited him to return to Taiwan for a third trip in 2005. His previous trips were in 2001, and 1997.<p><a id="Foreign_relations" name="Foreign_relations"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Foreign relations</span></h3>

      <p>Following the invasion, the Dalai Lama had little choice but to work with the 1951 <!--del_lnk--> Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet with the People&#39;s Republic of China. His brothers moved to <!--del_lnk--> Kalimpong in India and, with the help of the Indian and American governments, organized pro-independence literature and the smuggling of weapons into Tibet. Armed struggles broke out in Amdo and Kham in 1956 and later spread to Central Tibet. However, the movement was a failure and forced to retreat to <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a> or go underground. Following normalisation of relations between the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> and the People&#39;s Republic of China, American support was cut off in the early 1970s. The Dalai Lama then began to formulate his policy towards a peaceful solution in which he would be reinstated in a <!--del_lnk--> democratic <!--del_lnk--> autonomous Tibet.<p><a id="Social_stances" name="Social_stances"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Social stances</span></h3>
      <p>The Dalai Lama endorsed the founding of the Dalai Lama Foundation in order to promote peace and ethics worldwide. The Dalai Lama is not believed to be directly involved with this foundation. He has also stated his belief that modern scientific findings take precedence over ancient religions.<p>He is reported to have said regarding <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality, &quot;If the two people have taken no vows [of chastity], and neither is harmed, why should it not be acceptable?&quot; He has repeatedly affirmed his belief that gays and lesbians should be accepted by society, although he has also stated that for Buddhists homosexual behaviour is considered sexual misconduct, meaning that homosexual sex is acceptable for society in general but not in Buddhism or for Buddhists. As he explains in his book <i>Beyond Dogma</i>: &quot;homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact.&quot; However, more recently (1997) he has said that the basis of this teaching was unknown to him and that he has &quot;willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context.&quot;<p>The Dalai Lama is generally opposed to <!--del_lnk--> abortion, although he has taken a nuanced position, as he explained to the <!--del_lnk--> New York Times:<dl>
       <dd>Of course, abortion, from a Buddhist viewpoint, is an act of killing and is negative, generally speaking. But it depends on the circumstances. If the unborn child will be <!--del_lnk--> retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent, these are cases where there can be an exception. I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance.<dd>&mdash; The Dalai Lama, <i>New York Times</i>, <!--del_lnk--> November 28, <!--del_lnk--> 1993</dl>
      <p>He has also expressed his concern for environmental problems:<dl>
       <dd>On the global level, I think the ecology problem is very serious. I hear about some states taking it very seriously. That&#39;s wonderful! So this blue planet is our only home, if something goes wrong at the present generation, then the future generations really face a lot of problems, and those problems will be beyond human control; so that&#39;s very serious. Ecology should be part of our daily life.<dd>&mdash; The Dalai Lama, <!--del_lnk--> University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, <!--del_lnk--> September 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2006</dl>
      <p>In 1996, he described himself as half-Marxist, half-Buddhist:<dl>
       <dd>Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of Marxism is founded on moral principles, while capitalism is concerned only with gain and profitability. Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilization of the means of production. It is also concerned with the fate of the working classes&mdash;that is the majority&mdash;as well as with the fate of those who are underprivileged and in need, and Marxism cares about the victims of minority-imposed exploitation. For those reasons the system appeals to me, and it seems fair. . . I think of myself as half-Marxist, half-Buddhist.<dd>&mdash;Friendly Feudalism: The Tibet Myth and Dalai Lama&#39;s answer on various topics</dl>

      <p>In October 1998, The Dalai Lama&#39;s administration acknowledged that it received $1.7 million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. Government through the <!--del_lnk--> Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and also trained a resistance movement in Colorado (USA). When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 whether the organization did a good or bad thing in providing its support, the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, &quot;thousands of lives were lost in the resistance&quot; and further, that &quot;the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country&#39;s affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese.&quot;<p>British journalist <!--del_lnk--> Christopher Hitchens wrote a scathing criticism of the Dalai Lama in 1998, which questioned his alleged support for <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>&#39;s <a href="../../wp/n/Nuclear_weapon.htm" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> testing, the &quot;selling of indulgences&quot; to Hollywood celebrities like <!--del_lnk--> Richard Gere, and his statements condoning <!--del_lnk--> prostitution.<p>There has also been criticism that <!--del_lnk--> feudal Tibet was not as benevolent as the Dalai Lama had portrayed. Critics have suggested that in addition to <!--del_lnk--> serfdom there were conditions that effectively constituted <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a>. Also the <!--del_lnk--> penal code included forms of <!--del_lnk--> corporal punishment, in addition to <!--del_lnk--> capital punishment. In response, the Dalai Lama has since condemned some of ancient Tibet&#39;s feudal practices and has added that he was willing to institute reforms before the Chinese invaded. However, historian <!--del_lnk--> Michael Parenti believes there was a connection between Dalai Lama&#39;s 1959 fleeing Tibet and the then PRC Central Government&#39;s decision to gradually phase out serfdom in Tibet.<p><a id="International_influence" name="International_influence"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">International influence</span></h2>

      <p>The Dalai Lama has been successful in gaining Western sympathy for Tibetan self-determination, including vocal support from numerous Hollywood celebrities, most notably the actor <!--del_lnk--> Richard Gere, as well as lawmakers from several major countries.<p>Tenzin Gyatso has on occasion been denounced by the Chinese government as a supporter of Tibetan independence. Over time, he has developed a public position stating that he is not in favour of Tibetan <!--del_lnk--> independence and would not object to a status in which Tibet has internal <!--del_lnk--> autonomy while the PRC manages some aspects of Tibet&#39;s defense and foreign affairs. In his &#39;Middle Way Approach&#39;, he laid down that the Chinese government can take care of foreign affairs and defence, and that Tibet should be managed by an elected body.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 18, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, <i><!--del_lnk--> TIME Magazine</i> placed Tenzin Gyatso on its list of the world&#39;s 100 most influential people.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 22, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, the <a href="../../wp/p/Parliament_of_Canada.htm" title="Parliament of Canada">Parliament of Canada</a> voted unanimously to make Tenzin Gyatso an <!--del_lnk--> honorary citizen of Canada.
