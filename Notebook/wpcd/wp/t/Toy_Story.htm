      <div class="notice spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p>The story begins with a boy named <!--del_lnk--> Andy playing with his toys, such as a <!--del_lnk--> Mr. Potato Head, a <!--del_lnk--> plastic dinosaur toy, and his favorite toy, <!--del_lnk--> Woody, a cowboy toy. He takes Woody into the living room and plays with him some more, with a short interruption talking to his mom about his birthday party later that day and the soon-coming move to a new house. After playing with Woody, Andy starts helping his mom by carrying his baby sister to her. While he is gone, all the toys come to life. The party makes all the toys extremely nervous, wondering if Andy will get a toy that will replace them. Woody sends the small green soldiers downstairs to spy on the party. At the end of the party, Andy&#39;s mom pulls out a surprise gift from behind her, which turns out to be a <!--del_lnk--> Buzz Lightyear toy in doll form. Buzz does not seem to be aware that he is a piece of plastic, believing himself to be on a mission to save the universe from Evil <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Zurg. The other toys take to him immediately, being impressed by his many features. Only Woody is unconvinced, showing jealousy towards Buzz, who might replace him as Andy&#39;s favorite toy.<p>Eventually, when Andy is told he can take only one toy with him on a trip to Pizza Planet, Woody tries to shove Buzz behind Andy&#39;s dresser, but instead knocks him out the window. When the other toys learn of Woody&#39;s actions, they try to attack him, but he is rescued when Andy, unable to find Buzz, takes Woody on the trip. At a stop at a <!--del_lnk--> Dinoco gas station for gas, Woody finds that Buzz grabbed ahold of the family&#39;s minivan and is with them. The two begin to fight, knocking each other out of the minivan, and are left behind when it drives away. Woody convinces Buzz to hitch a lift on a Pizza Planet truck, in order to reunite with Andy. Woody finds Andy there, but Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger, climbs into a toy crane game, thinking it is a spaceship. Woody goes in after him, but the two eventually are grabbed by Sid Phillips, who lives next door to Andy and is known to torture and destroy toys, simply to amuse himself.<p>Left alone in Sid&#39;s room, Woody and Buzz come upon a group of mis-matched toys, the results of Sid&#39;s many &quot;experiments&quot;. Woody and Buzz reacted in fear when they thought that the mis-matched toys were cannibals. Meanwhile at Andy&#39;s house, the toys were continuing to look for Buzz in the bushes. But when Andy and his mother came home, he noticed that Woody was gone. The other toys wonder what has become of the two. Some are worried for both Buzz and Woody, while others express the hope that Woody has met a bad end. The next day, at Sid&#39;s house, Woody and Buzz, having been mistreated by Sid, (Sid managed to burn Woody&#39;s forhead with a magnifying glass) try to escape, only to run into Sid&#39;s maniac dog, Scud. Eventually getting out of Sid&#39;s room, Buzz comes upon a television where he sees a commercial for the Buzz Lightyear line of toys. Watching it, he realizes that Woody was right. He was a toy this whole time, not a space ranger. In one last desperate attempt to prove he is not a toy, Buzz tries to fly out of a window by jumping off the guardrail of the stairs on the second floor, only to fall to the floor, losing an arm in the process. He is found by Sid&#39;s sister Hannah, who takes him away to put him in her tea party.<p>Woody finally finds Buzz in Hannah&#39;s room, dressed as &quot;Mrs. Nesbit&quot; and attending a tea party. While Woody formulates a plan of escape, Buzz is too depressed to care. When Woody throws a string of Christmas tree lights across the way to the toys in Andy&#39;s room, Buzz refuses to back him up. The mixed-up toys then return and swarm over Buzz, to Woody&#39;s dismay. But it turns out they were only repairing him. Before Woody can make friends with them, however, Sid returns with his new acquisition: a firework rocket. He decides to blow up Buzz with it, but is stymied by rainfall.<p>The next day, Sid takes Buzz out to blow him up, leaving Woody alone in the room. Of course, it was also when Andy and his family is going to move. Andy, still depressed to lose Woody and Buzz, just found the cardboard spaceship of Buzz, and a cowboy hat. Woody calls out to the mixed-up toys to tell them a plan to escape. After a daring escape through the house and past Scud, Woody and the other toys end up in the yard with Sid. They decide to break the rules and they allow Sid to see that they can move on their own. Woody even speaks to him, telling him to &quot;play nice.&quot; This freaks Sid out and he runs screaming into the house, where his sister frightens him with a dolly.<p>Now freed from Sid, Woody and Buzz attempt to catch Andy&#39;s moving van just as it is pulling away from the house. After saying farewell to the mixed-up toys, a harrowing chase follows, with Scud chasing them and Andy&#39;s toys not helping, since they still believe Woody intentionally got rid of Buzz. Luckily, they get rid of Scud and let the toys believe in Woody to see that he is helping Buzz. Eventually, with the help of R/C, Andy&#39;s remote control car, and strategic use of Sid&#39;s rocket, Woody and Buzz return to Andy, whose mother thinks they were in the car all along.<p>The next Christmas, we see a scene similar to the birthday party, with the toys again worried about the new ones. Mr. Potato Head is pleased to learn that Andy&#39;s baby sister has gotten a Mrs. Potato Head. The answer comes in the form of Andy&#39;s final present, when a dog&#39;s bark is heard.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p><i>Toy Story</i> began its life as an extension of Pixar&#39;s short <i><!--del_lnk--> Tin Toy</i>, which featured Tinny, a mechanical drummer who tries to find his way in a baby&#39;s play room. The original plot called for Tinny to butt heads with a <!--del_lnk--> ventriloquist&#39;s dummy. Ultimately, Tinny was found to be too immobile for the storyline and he was developed as a &quot;space toy&quot;, first named Lunar Larry, but eventually becoming Buzz Lightyear. Meanwhile, the original ventriloquist&#39;s dummy was designed to be sneaky, mean and borderline evil. When tests proved that the character was too unsympathetic, his character was gradually modified until he became the Woody of the film.<p>Other changes the film underwent during development include:<ul>
       <li>Tim Allen and Tom Hanks both state that Pixar wanted this to tell the story of how new Hollywood was taking over old Hollywood and legends of the past were being forgotten while new young guns were becoming the names on everybody&#39;s lips. Allen states Pixar wanted <!--del_lnk--> Jim Carrey to play Buzz Lightyear (representing new Hollywood) and <!--del_lnk--> Paul Newman to play Woody (representing old Hollywood). Hanks states that Pixar wanted <!--del_lnk--> Johnny Depp to play Buzz Lightyear (representing new Hollywood) and <!--del_lnk--> Gregory Peck to play Woody (representing old Hollywood). Both state that they couldn&#39;t get either those pair because of the low budget they were given for the film.<li>Billy Crystal was originally offered the role of Buzz, but turned it down.<li><!--del_lnk--> Bill Murray was considered for the role of Buzz but lost the producers number, Murray states he would have accepted the role and he deeply regrets losing the number, he believes that had he done the movie it would have been him inducted into the <!--del_lnk--> Disney Hall Of Fame not Allen.<li>The part of Woody&#39;s girlfriend was originally intended to be filled by a <!--del_lnk--> Barbie doll, but Mattel refused to consent to her use.<li>Disney required several re-workings of the film, even going so far as to threaten to shut the production down.<li>Scenes of Woody having nightmares over losing his position as &quot;favorite toy&quot; were cut for time, but later incorporated into <i><!--del_lnk--> Toy Story 2.</i></ul>
