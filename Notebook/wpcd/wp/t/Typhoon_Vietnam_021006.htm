<h2>Typhoon causes destruction in Vietnam</h2><p><strong>02/10/2006</strong></p>
<img src="../../wp/m/Mother_child_Vietnam.jpg" width="321" height="279" alt="mother and child, SOS Children's Village Vietnam" class="left" /><p>Vietnam&rsquo;s central coastline fell victim to the latest natural disaster at the weekend, as typhoon Xangsane continued on its path of devastation through South East Asia. </p><p>The typhoon, which killed over 70 people and badly damaged homes and electricity and water supplies in the Philippines earlier in the week, moved on to Vietnam at the weekend, hitting the coastal provinces of Danang, Thua Thien-Hue, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai. </p><p>Saturday morning saw the typhoon reach Vietnam, where the city of Danang was particularly badly hit. The strong winds and heavy rain caused considerable damage to buildings, including those of the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village. Trees were uprooted, many roofs were blown away and in some cases houses were simply washed away. Fortunately the damage caused to the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village was limited (about 25% of the roofs were blown off) and no one was hurt, although 15 people are known to have died as a result of the typhoon in Vietnam. </p><p>The SOS School in Danang is currently providing temporary shelter for ten families from the neighbouring community and SOS Children is supporting a number of other families in the neighbourhood affected by the natural disaster with basic supplies.</p><p><strong>Relevant Countries:</strong> <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines_A.htm">Philippines</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_A.htm">Vietnam</a>.</p>
