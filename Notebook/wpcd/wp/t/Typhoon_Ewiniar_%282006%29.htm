      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> June 29, a persistent tropical disturbance was classified as a tropical depression by the <!--del_lnk--> JTWC while east of <a href="../../wp/p/Palau.htm" title="Palau">Palau</a>. The depression moved northwestward and was upgraded to Tropical Storm 04W by the JTWC the next day on <!--del_lnk--> June 30, while the JMA named the storm Tropical Storm Ewiniar at around the same time. The name &quot;Ewiniar&quot; was submitted by the <a href="../../wp/f/Federated_States_of_Micronesia.htm" title="Federated States of Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a>, and refers to a traditional storm god of <!--del_lnk--> Chuuk.<p>Ewiniar moved west-northwestward over the next two days, bringing heavy rain and localized flooding to the <!--del_lnk--> Yap Islands. Ewiniar turned to the northwest and reached its peak intensity of 130&nbsp;knots (240&nbsp;km/h or 150&nbsp;mph) on the U.S. method of measuring windspeeds by one-minute averages, or 100&nbsp;knots (185&nbsp;km/h or 115&nbsp;mph) on the international method of measuring windspeeds by ten-minute averages, and its minimum pressure of 930&nbsp;hPa&nbsp;(mbar). Ewiniar turned northward and brushed eastern <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a>, forcing evacuations in many cities.<p>Ewiniar gradually weakened as it moved over colder waters, and made landfall in <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> on <!--del_lnk--> July 10 as a severe tropical storm, having briefly threatened to make landfall on impoverished <a href="../../wp/n/North_Korea.htm" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>. Ewiniar passed within 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;miles) of <a href="../../wp/s/Seoul.htm" title="Seoul">Seoul</a> as it moved across the country before becoming extratropical over the <!--del_lnk--> Sea of Japan the next day.<p>Ewiniar had also earlier brushed the <!--del_lnk--> Ry&#x16B;ky&#x16B; Islands of <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>.<p><a id="Preparations" name="Preparations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Preparations</span></h2>

The municipal flood control headquarters in <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> also asked officials to prepare for the approaching typhoon, which was forecast to begin affecting the city on <!--del_lnk--> July 9.<p><a id="Japan" name="Japan"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Japan</span></h3>

The <!--del_lnk--> USS <i>Essex</i> also evacuated the area on <!--del_lnk--> July 7.

      <p>Early in its life as a tropical cyclone, Ewiniar affected <!--del_lnk--> Yap and <a href="../../wp/p/Palau.htm" title="Palau">Palau</a>, which fall under the warning jurisdiction of the <!--del_lnk--> National Weather Service office in Tiyan, <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a>. Ewiniar caused coastal flooding in Yap of up to 5&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m), especially near the port and around the Colonia Bay area. Ewiniar also caused an island-wide power outage in Yap, although according to an NWS post-storm report, damage was minimised on Yap due to steadier structures after <!--del_lnk--> Super Typhoon Sudal of 2004 tore through the islands. Damage was also reported to agriculture due to salt spray. The total amount of damage caused was estimated to be just over <!--del_lnk--> $100 thousand (2006 USD).<p>About 2.4&nbsp;inches (61&nbsp;mm) of rain fell on Yap, while <!--del_lnk--> Koror in Palau reported a 24-hour total of 1.88&nbsp;inches (48&nbsp;mm) of rain through 6&nbsp;a.m. UTC on <!--del_lnk--> July 3. The peak wind gusts reported were 53&nbsp;knots (98&nbsp;km/h, 61&nbsp;mph) on <!--del_lnk--> Yap at the Weather Service Office (WSO) in Yap and 46&nbsp;knots (85&nbsp;km/h, 53&nbsp;mph) at the WSO in Koror. During its course through the islands, Tropical Storm Ewiniar also necessitated <!--del_lnk--> tropical storm warnings and watches for <!--del_lnk--> Ngulu, <!--del_lnk--> Yap, <!--del_lnk--> Koror and <!--del_lnk--> Kayangel. No deaths in Yap or Palau were reported due to Ewiniar.<p><a id="People.27s_Republic_of_China_2" name="People.27s_Republic_of_China_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">People&#39;s Republic of China</span></h3>
      <p>Typhoon Ewiniar killed at least 34 people in <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">China</a>, with areas as far northwest as <!--del_lnk--> Gansu and <!--del_lnk--> Shanxi affected by landslides. It is not known if the landslides were triggered directly as a result of Ewiniar, or whether it was caused by a combination of Ewiniar and other weather. Therefore, the deaths that can be attributed to Ewiniar from the landslides are assumed to be indirectly caused, and not directly. Average rainfall reported in <!--del_lnk--> Shandong was 3.4&nbsp;mm (0.133&nbsp;inches) per hour from 6&nbsp;a.m. <!--del_lnk--> July 9 through midnight <!--del_lnk--> July 10 (totalling about 61.2&nbsp;mm or 2.4&nbsp;inches). At least 300 flights out of <a href="../../wp/b/Beijing.htm" title="Beijing">Beijing</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Capital International Airport had to be delayed due to thunderstorms and effects of Ewiniar, while <!--del_lnk--> Air China and <!--del_lnk--> China Eastern Airlines cancelled flights to <a href="../../wp/s/South_Korea.htm" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> heading out of China.<p>As Ewiniar did not affect the mainland directly, there are little to no reports of major damage.<p><a id="Japan_2" name="Japan_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Japan</span></h3>
      <p>Ewinar hammered <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa with heavy rain, creating mass confusion and troubles for tourists. Flights and ferries out of <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa to neighbouring islands were cancelled, and as many as 3,500 tourists were left stranded at various airports because most hotels were already near full capacity. Other tourists reportedly stayed in the homes of some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to higher ground.<p>The highest winds reported during the storm were 34.9&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> m/s (78&nbsp;mph, 126&nbsp;km/h). These winds blew sand about 7&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;in) deep off the beach and into residents&#39; yards.<p>Typhoon Ewinar caused a reported 20,000,000&nbsp;<a href="../../wp/j/Japanese_yen.htm" title="Japanese yen">yen</a> (<a href="../../wp/u/United_States_dollar.htm" title="United States dollar">$</a>173,778) worth of sugar cane and vegetable damage, and farmers experienced profit losses when ripe fruits were unable to be shipped to Asian markets.<p>Seven people were injured in <!--del_lnk--> Nanjo from a fallen signboard, while an elderly woman in <!--del_lnk--> Nago City and a young girl in <!--del_lnk--> Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.<p><a id="South_Korea_2" name="South_Korea_2"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">South Korea</span></h3>
