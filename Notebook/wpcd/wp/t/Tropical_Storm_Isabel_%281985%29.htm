      <p><b>Tropical Storm Isabel</b> was the ninth tropical storm of the <!--del_lnk--> 1985 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm&#39;s track extended from the <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> to the southeastern <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> during the second week of October. Prior to developing into a tropical cyclone, it produced torrential rainfall, resulting in great damage and loss of life in <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Isabel later made landfall in northeastern <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, and moved out to sea without producing great damage.<p>

      <p>A tropical wave moved off the coast of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> on <!--del_lnk--> September 29. As it moved westward across the <a href="../../wp/a/Atlantic_Ocean.htm" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, the wave entered the eastern <a href="../../wp/c/Caribbean_Sea.htm" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> on <!--del_lnk--> October 5. On <!--del_lnk--> October 7, an area of disturbed weather on the northern edges of the wave organized into a tropical depression while south of <!--del_lnk--> Hispaniola. Shortly after forming, the depression attained tropical storm status and received the name of Isabel, although further intensification was limited by interaction with the lands of the <a href="../../wp/d/Dominican_Republic.htm" title="Dominican Republic">Dominican Republic</a>.<p>Located on the western edge of a mid-Atlantic high pressure system, Isabel moved northward over the Dominican Republic, and on the night of <!--del_lnk--> October 7, it moved northward through the southeastern <a href="../../wp/t/The_Bahamas.htm" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. Located over open waters, the storm quickly strengthened, and its winds reached a peak of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h) late on the 8th, while to the northeast of the Bahamas. An approaching <!--del_lnk--> cold front quickly weakened the storm, and a high pressure system behind the front pushed a weakened Isabel to the west-northwest and towards land.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Convection steadily waned as it moved west-northwestward, and Isabel made landfall near <!--del_lnk--> Fernandina Beach, Florida as a 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) tropical storm late on <!--del_lnk--> October 10. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and Isabel remained near the <!--del_lnk--> Georgia coastline until exiting near <!--del_lnk--> Savannah late on the 11th.

      <p>Heavy rainfall caused great damage and loss of life in <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> as a tropical wave. When it hit <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, damage was very minor due to its disorganization.

      <p>An upper level trough to the west of the precursor tropical wave enhanced rainshower activity across the northeastern Caribbean Sea. Because of this, portions of <a href="../../wp/p/Puerto_Rico.htm" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a> experienced rainfall totals of 22 inches (560 mm) in 24 hours, while some areas received around 2.8 inches (70 mm) per hour.  In the south-centre portion of the island, rainfall peaked at 31.67 inches (805 mm).  This deluge of rain came five months after another rainfall event, and resulted in widespread mudslides across the island.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>One such landslide occurred in Mameyes, a barrio on the southern portion of the island in <!--del_lnk--> Ponce. An entire sheet of <!--del_lnk--> bedrock in the mountainous region outside of the city collapsed under the oversaturated soil, burying much of the city. The landslide was responsible for at least 129 deaths, and caused severe damage in the area. More than 100 homes were destroyed, and many others were later condemned. The mudslide, which by some estimates could have killed up to 300 people, was among the worst landslide disasters in <a href="../../wp/n/North_America.htm" title="North America">North American</a> history. <p>Elsewhere on the island, at least 51 more people were killed from Isabel, though an exact total is unknown. The rainfall seriously damaged 8 bridges and 36 roads, and destroyed the approach slabs on one bridge in <!--del_lnk--> Coamo, killing eight people when they drove their cars through the opening. Thirteen individuals perished in the <!--del_lnk--> El Tuque portion of Ponce when a wall collapsed and flooded the area. In <!--del_lnk--> Santa Isabel, nineteen bodies were retrieved from the <!--del_lnk--> Paso Seco River, which was close to overflowing. Also in town, another bridge was deestroyed. The flooding also left 60 cities without power and 35,000 people without telephone service. Across the island, the storm damaged nearly 3,000 homes, leaving 4,400 homeless to be housed in 44 public shelters. Eleven water-filtration plants and 13 sewage treatment plants were closed following the storm, leaving 21% of the island without drinkable water. In all, the storm caused around $447 million (1985 USD, $793 million 2005 USD) in damage. <p><a id="Conspiracy_theory" name="Conspiracy_theory"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Conspiracy theory</span></h4>
      <p>According to a conspiracy theory on the island, an explosion in a fireworks factory led to the mudslide disaster in Mameyes. This is supported by a report that rescue dogs detected gunpowder in the area, as well as people experiencing a blast when the mudslide occurred. However, this news was supposedly kept quiet so the citizens could receive aid from FEMA. <p><a id="Southeast_United_States" name="Southeast_United_States"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Southeast United States</span></h3>

      <p>When Isabel made landfall on northeastern <a href="../../wp/f/Florida.htm" title="Florida">Florida</a>, the storm retained little convection.

Overall, damage was relatively light.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>Just days after the storm, the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="United States House of Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> passed a resolution to provide Puerto Rico with all necessary assistance in the cleanup. Days later, President <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> declared the island as a Federal Disaster Area when requested to by <!--del_lnk--> Puerto Rican Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon]]. A memorial service with some 3,000 people attending was held for 23 of the casualties, and a memorial park was proposed to be built where the landslide ravine was. <!--del_lnk--> FEMA provided $63 million (1985 USD, $111.8 million 2005 USD) in aid.<p><a id="Lack_of_Retirement" name="Lack_of_Retirement"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lack of Retirement</span></h3>
      <p>Despite the great amount of damage, the name Isabel was not retired by the <!--del_lnk--> World Meteorological Organization and it remained on the list of names for the <!--del_lnk--> 1991 season. Due to inactivity the name was not used again until the <a href="../../wp/2/2003_Atlantic_hurricane_season.htm" title="2003 Atlantic hurricane season">2003 season</a>, when the name <!--del_lnk--> Isabel was retired and replaced with <b>Ida</b> on the list of names for the 2009 season.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Isabel_%281985%29&quot;</div>
