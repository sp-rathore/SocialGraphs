      <p><b>Timken 1111</b>, also called the <b>Timken Four Aces</b>, was a <!--del_lnk--> 4-8-4 <!--del_lnk--> steam locomotive built in 1930 by <!--del_lnk--> American Locomotive Company (ALCO) to serve as a demonstration unit for new roller bearings produced by the <!--del_lnk--> Timken Roller Bearing Company. It was the first locomotive built with <!--del_lnk--> roller bearings rather than friction bearings.<p>

      <p>Timken chose a 4-8-4 on which to demonstrate the company&#39;s bearings so the locomotive could be used in all types of railroad work, especially on heavy freight and fast <!--del_lnk--> passenger trains. A total of 52 different parts manufacturers agreed to supply their parts for the locomotive &quot;on account&quot; until the locomotive operated over 100,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles (161,000&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km). The suppliers&#39; names were placed on a plaque that was fastened to the tender for the duration of the demonstration period.<p>Assembly took place at ALCO&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Schenectady, New York, plant, the former <!--del_lnk--> Schenectady Locomotive Works.<p><a id="In-service_demonstration" name="In-service_demonstration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">In-service demonstration</span></h2>
      <p>The locomotive&#39;s first demonstration runs were hauling freight on the <!--del_lnk--> New York Central Railroad. After those demonstrations, it was used on thirteen other major railroads, including the <!--del_lnk--> Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, <!--del_lnk--> New Haven Railroad and <a href="../../wp/p/Pennsylvania_Railroad.htm" title="Pennsylvania Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> (PRR), in both freight and passenger service. The PRR used the locomotive on a passenger train where it hauled twelve <!--del_lnk--> passenger cars through the <!--del_lnk--> Allegheny Mountains so well that the train did not require the use of <!--del_lnk--> helpers and arrived at its destination three minutes early.<p>At some of the <!--del_lnk--> stations on the locomotive&#39;s demonstration runs, <!--del_lnk--> publicity stunts were held where the locomotive would be pulled by as few as three men (or as was done in <a href="../../wp/c/Chicago.htm" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a>, by three women); these publicity stunts were designed to show that the roller bearings produced so little <!--del_lnk--> friction that the locomotive could easily be moved by hand.<p>By August 1931, the locomotive had been used for over almost 90,000&nbsp;miles (145,000&nbsp;km) when it was delivered to the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Pacific Railroad, the fifteenth railroad to trial the locomotive, for its final demonstration runs. With a <!--del_lnk--> dynamometer car in tow, the Northern Pacific was able to drive the locomotive as fast as a sustained 88&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph (142&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h) while pulling the <i><!--del_lnk--> North Coast Limited</i> passenger train past <!--del_lnk--> Willow Creek, Montana.<p><a id="Regular_use_and_disposition" name="Regular_use_and_disposition"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Regular use and disposition</span></h2>
      <p>The Northern Pacific was pleased enough with the locomotive&#39;s performance to purchase it from Timken on <!--del_lnk--> February 8, <!--del_lnk--> 1933, after it crossed the 100,000&nbsp;mile mark. The railroad renumbered it to 2626, classifying it internally as locomotive class A-1 (this locomotive was the class&#39;s sole member), and used it in passenger service between <a href="../../wp/s/Seattle%252C_Washington.htm" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Yakima, Washington, and later shifted its service to passenger trains between Seattle and <!--del_lnk--> Missoula, Montana. Northern Pacific used the locomotive for 23 years before retiring it from active service. The locomotive&#39;s last run was made on <!--del_lnk--> August 4, <!--del_lnk--> 1957 when it pulled a passenger train from Seattle to <!--del_lnk--> Cle Elum and return.<p>Efforts were made at preservation for the locomotive, and the Timken Company even seriously considered purchasing the locomotive and moving it back to the company&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Canton, Ohio, headquarters under its own power. But the locomotive was scrapped before Timken and Northern Pacific could complete their negotiations.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timken_1111&quot;</div>
