No one before Tycho had attempted to make so many redundant observations, and the mathematical tools to take advantage of them had not yet been developed. He did what others before him were unable or unwilling to do &mdash; to catalogue the planets and stars with enough accuracy so as to determine whether the Ptolemaic or Copernican system was more valid in describing the heavens.<p>

      <p>Tycho Brahe was born <i>Tyge Ottesen Brahe (de Knutstorp)</i>, adopting the Latinised form <i>Tycho</i> at around age fifteen (sometimes written <i>T&yuml;cho</i>). He is often misnamed <i>Tycho de Brahe</i>. He was born at his family&#39;s ancestral seat of <!--del_lnk--> Knutstorp <!--del_lnk--> Castle, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> to <!--del_lnk--> Otte Brahe and <!--del_lnk--> Beate Bille. His twin brother died before being <!--del_lnk--> baptized. (Tycho wrote a Latin ode (Wittendorf 1994, p. 68) to his dead twin which was printed as his first publication in 1572). He also had two sisters, one older (<!--del_lnk--> Kirstine Brahe) and one younger (<!--del_lnk--> Sophia Brahe). Otte Brahe, Tycho&#39;s father, was a <!--del_lnk--> nobleman and an important figure in the <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Danish</a> King&#39;s court. His mother, Beate Bille, also came from an important family that had produced leading churchmen and politicians. In his youth he lived at <!--del_lnk--> Hvedborg Manor, <!--del_lnk--> Funen, <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> with his uncle and attended <!--del_lnk--> Horne Church in nearby Horne.<p>Tycho later wrote that when he was around two, his uncle, Danish nobleman <!--del_lnk--> J&oslash;rgen Brahe, &quot;<i>... without the knowledge of my parents took me away with him while I was in my earliest youth.</i>&quot; Apparently this did not lead to any disputes nor did his parents attempt to get him back. Tycho lived with his childless uncle and aunt, J&oslash;rgen Brahe and <!--del_lnk--> Inger Oxe, in the <!--del_lnk--> Tostrup Castle until he was six years old. Around 1552 his uncle was given the command of Vordingborg Castle to which they moved, and where Tycho began a Latin education until he was 12 years old.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> April 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1559, Tycho began his studies at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Copenhagen. There, following the wishes of his uncle, he studied law but also studied a variety of other subjects and became interested in <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>. It was, however, the <!--del_lnk--> eclipse which occurred on <!--del_lnk--> August 21, <!--del_lnk--> 1560, particularly the fact that it had been predicted, that so impressed him that he began to make his own studies of astronomy helped by some of the professors. He purchased an <!--del_lnk--> ephemeris and books such as <!--del_lnk--> Sacrobosco&#39;s <i>Tractatus de Sphaera</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Apianus&#39;s <i>Cosmographia seu descriptio totius orbis</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Regiomontanus&#39;s <i>De triangulis omnimodis</i>.<blockquote>
       <p><i>I&#39;ve studied all available charts of the planets and stars and none of them match the others. There are just as many measurements and methods as there are astronomers and all of them disagree. What&#39;s needed is a long term project with the aim of mapping the heavens conducted from a single location over a period of several years.</i> &mdash; Tycho Brahe, <!--del_lnk--> 1563 (age 17).</blockquote>
      <p>Tycho realized that progress in the science of astronomy could be achieved not by occasional haphazard observations, but only by systematic and rigorous observation, night after night, and by using instruments of the highest accuracy obtainable. He was able to improve and enlarge the existing instruments, and construct entirely new ones. Tycho&#39;s naked eye measurements of planetary <!--del_lnk--> parallax were accurate to the <!--del_lnk--> arcminute. His sister, Sophia, assisted Tycho in many of his measurements. These jealously guarded measurements became the possessions of Kepler following his death. Tycho was the last major astronomer to work without the aid of a <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescope</a>, soon to be turned toward the sky by <a href="../../wp/g/Galileo_Galilei.htm" title="Galileo Galilei">Galileo</a>.<p>While a student, Tycho lost part of his <!--del_lnk--> nose in a <!--del_lnk--> duel with <!--del_lnk--> rapiers with <!--del_lnk--> Manderup Parsbjerg, a fellow Danish nobleman. This occurred in the <!--del_lnk--> Christmas season of <!--del_lnk--> 1566, after a fair amount of drinking, while the just turned 20-year-old Tycho was studying at the <!--del_lnk--> University of Rostock in <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>. Attending a dance at a professor&#39;s house, he quarrelled with Parsbjerg. A subsequent duel (in the dark) resulted in Tycho losing the bridge of his nose. A consequence of this was that Tycho developed an interest in <a href="../../wp/m/Medicine.htm" title="Medicine">medicine</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>. For the rest of his life, he was said to have worn a replacement made of <a href="../../wp/s/Silver.htm" title="Silver">silver</a> and <a href="../../wp/g/Gold.htm" title="Gold">gold</a> blended into a flesh tone, and used an adhesive balm to keep it attached. However, in <!--del_lnk--> 1901 Tycho&#39;s tomb was opened and his remains were examined by medical experts. The nasal opening of the <!--del_lnk--> skull was rimmed with green, a sign of exposure to <a href="../../wp/c/Copper.htm" title="Copper">copper</a>, not silver or gold. Some historians have speculated that he wore a number of different <!--del_lnk--> prosthetics for different occasions, noting that a copper nose would have been more comfortable and less heavy than one of precious metals.<p><a id="Death_of_his_father" name="Death_of_his_father"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death of his father</span></h3>
      <p>His foster father, uncle J&oslash;rgen Brahe, died in 1565 of pneumonia after rescuing <!--del_lnk--> Frederick II of Denmark from drowning. In April 1567, Tycho returned home from his travels and his father wanted him to take up law, but Tycho was allowed to make trips to Rostock, then on to Augsburg (where he built a great quadrant), Basel, and Freiburg. At the end of 1570 he was informed about his father&#39;s ill health, so he returned to Knudstrup, where his father died on <!--del_lnk--> May 9, <!--del_lnk--> 1571. Soon after, his other uncle Steen Bille helped him build an observatory and alchemical laboratory at Herrevad Abbey.<p><a id="Family_life" name="Family_life"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Family life</span></h3>
      <p>In 1572, in Knudstrup, Tycho fell in love with <!--del_lnk--> Kirsten J&oslash;rgensdatter, a commoner whose father, Pastor Jorgen Hansen, was the <!--del_lnk--> Lutheran clergyman of Knudstrup&#39;s village church. Under Danish law, when a nobleman and a common woman lived together openly as husband and wife, and she wore the keys to the household at her belt like any true wife, their alliance became a binding <!--del_lnk--> morganatic marriage after three years. The husband retained his noble status and privileges; the wife remained a commoner. Their children were legitimate in the eyes of the law, but they were commoners like their mother and could not inherit their father&#39;s name, <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms, or land property. (Skautrup 1941, pp. 24-5)<p>Kirsten J&oslash;rgensdatter gave birth to their first daughter, Kirstine (named after Tycho&#39;s late sister who died at 13) on October 12, 1573. Together they had eight children, six of whom lived to adulthood. In <!--del_lnk--> 1574, they moved to Copenhagen where their daughter Magdalene was born. Kirsten and Tycho lived together for almost thirty years until Tycho&#39;s death.<p><a id="Tycho.27s_Elk" name="Tycho.27s_Elk"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tycho&#39;s Elk</span></h3>
      <p>Tycho was said to own one percent of the entire wealth of <a href="../../wp/d/Denmark.htm" title="Denmark">Denmark</a> at one point in the 1580s and he often held large social gatherings in his castle. He kept a dwarf named Jepp (who Tycho believed was clairvoyant) as a court <!--del_lnk--> jester who sat under the table during dinner. <!--del_lnk--> Pierre Gassendi wrote that Tycho also had a tame <!--del_lnk--> elk, and that his mentor the Landgraf <!--del_lnk--> Wilhelm of <!--del_lnk--> Hesse-Kassel asked about an animal faster than a deer. Tycho replied writing there were none, but he could send his tame <!--del_lnk--> elk. When Wilhelm replied he would accept one in exchange for a horse, Tycho replied with the sad news that the elk just died on a visit to entertain a nobleman at <!--del_lnk--> Landskrona. Apparently during dinner the elk had drunk a lot of beer and fell down the stairs, and died.<p><a id="Death" name="Death"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h3>
      <p>Tycho died on <!--del_lnk--> October 24, <!--del_lnk--> 1601, several days after straining his bladder during a banquet. It had been said that to leave the banquet before it concluded would be the height of bad manners, and so he remained. His bladder, stretched to its limit, exploded; however, this is regarded as impossible by most physicians. He died after eleven agonizing days. Other sources say that he ate so much food that his digestives tracts ruptured, causing death by internal bleeding.<p>Recent investigations have suggested that Tycho did not die from urinary problems but most likely from <a href="../../wp/m/Mercury_%2528element%2529.htm" title="Mercury (element)">mercury</a> poisoning: toxic levels of it have been found in his hair and hair-roots. Tycho may have poisoned himself unintentionally by imbibing some mercury-containing medicine. Some have even speculated that Tycho may have been murdered, possibly by Kepler - though there is no evidence for this. Yet another theory is that he was treating his syphilis with mercury leading to an overdose.<p>Tycho Brahe&#39;s body is currently interred in a tomb in the <!--del_lnk--> Church of Our Lady in front of T&yacute;n near <!--del_lnk--> Old Town Square near the <!--del_lnk--> Astronomical Clock in <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a>.<p><a id="Career:_observing_the_heavens" name="Career:_observing_the_heavens"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Career: observing the heavens</span></h2>

      <p><a id="Supernova" name="Supernova"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Supernova</span></h3>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> November 11, <!--del_lnk--> 1572, Tycho observed (from <!--del_lnk--> Herrevad Abbey) a very bright star which unexpectedly appeared in the constellation <!--del_lnk--> Cassiopeia, now named <!--del_lnk--> SN 1572. Since it had been maintained since <a href="../../wp/a/Ancient_history.htm" title="Ancient history">antiquity</a> that the world beyond the orbit of the moon, i.e. that of the fixed stars, was eternal and unchangeable (a fundamental axiom of the <!--del_lnk--> Aristotelian world view: celestial immutability), other observers held that the phenomenon was something in the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Tycho, however, observed that the <!--del_lnk--> parallax of the object did not change from night to night, suggesting that the object was far away. Tycho argued that a nearby object should appear to shift its position with respect to the background. He published a small book, <i>De Stella Nova</i> (<!--del_lnk--> 1573), thereby coining the term <!--del_lnk--> nova for a &quot;new&quot; star (we now know that Tycho&#39;s star in Cassiopeia was a <!--del_lnk--> supernova 7500 light years from earth, today known as <!--del_lnk--> SN 1572). This discovery was decisive for his choice of astronomy as a profession. Tycho was strongly critical of those who dismissed the implications of the astronomical appearance, writing in the preface to <i>De Stella Nova</i>: &quot;O crassa ingenia. O caecos coeli spectatores&quot; (&quot;Oh thick wits. Oh blind watchers of the sky&quot;).<p>Tycho&#39;s discovery was the inspiration for <a href="../../wp/e/Edgar_Allan_Poe.htm" title="Edgar Allan Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>&#39;s poem, <i><!--del_lnk--> Al Aaraaf</i>. In 1998, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sky &amp; Telescope</i> magazine published an article by Donald W. Olson, Marilynn S. Olson and Russell L. Doescher arguing, in part, that Tycho&#39;s supernova was also the same &quot;star that&#39;s westward from the pole&quot; in Shakespeare&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> Hamlet</i>.<p><a id="Heliocentrism" name="Heliocentrism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Heliocentrism</span></h3>

      <p>Kepler tried, but was unable, to persuade Tycho to adopt the <a href="../../wp/h/Heliocentrism.htm" title="Heliocentrism">heliocentric model</a> of the <a href="../../wp/s/Solar_System.htm" title="Solar system">solar system</a>. Tycho believed in a modified <!--del_lnk--> geocentric model known as the <!--del_lnk--> Tychonic system, for the same reasons that he argued that the supernova of 1572 was not near the Earth. He argued that if the Earth were in motion, then nearby stars should appear to shift their positions with respect to background stars. In fact, this effect of <!--del_lnk--> parallax does exist; but it could not be observed with the naked eye, or even with the telescopes of the next two hundred years, because even the nearest stars are much more distant than most astronomers of the time believed possible. The Tychonic system is very similar to the Copernican one, except that it has a static earth instead of a static sun.<p>In the years following <!--del_lnk--> Galileo&#39;s observation of the <!--del_lnk--> phases of Venus in 1610, which made the <!--del_lnk--> Ptolemaic system intractable, the Tychonic system became the major competitor with Copernicanism, and was adopted by the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> for many years as its official astronomical conception of the universe.<p><a id="Uraniborg.2C_Stjerneborg.2C_and_Ben.C3.A1tky_nad_Jizerou" name="Uraniborg.2C_Stjerneborg.2C_and_Ben.C3.A1tky_nad_Jizerou"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Uraniborg, Stjerneborg, and Ben&aacute;tky nad Jizerou</span></h3>

These were <!--del_lnk--> Uraniborg and <!--del_lnk--> Stjerneborg. Uraniborg also had a laboratory for his <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemical</a> experiments.<p>Because Tycho disagreed with <!--del_lnk--> Christian IV, the new king of his country, he left Hven in <!--del_lnk--> 1597 and moved to <a href="../../wp/p/Prague.htm" title="Prague">Prague</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1599.

      <p>Tycho was the preeminent observational astronomer of the pre-telescopic period, and his observations of <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stellar</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planetary</a> positions achieved unparalleled accuracy for their time. For example, Tycho measured Earth&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> axial tilt as 23 degrees and 31.5 minutes, which he claimed to be more accurate than Copernicus by 3.5 minutes. After his death, his records of the motion of the planet <!--del_lnk--> Mars enabled Kepler to discover the <!--del_lnk--> laws of planetary motion, which provided powerful support for the <!--del_lnk--> Copernican <!--del_lnk--> heliocentric theory of the solar system.<p>Tycho himself was not a Copernican, but proposed a system in which the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a> orbited the <a href="../../wp/e/Earth.htm" title="Earth">Earth</a> while the other planets orbited the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. His system provided a safe position for astronomers who were dissatisfied with older models but were reluctant to accept the Earth&#39;s motion. It gained a considerable following after <!--del_lnk--> 1616 when Rome decided officially that the heliocentric model was contrary to both philosophy and Scripture, and could be discussed only as a computational convenience that had no connection to fact. His system also offered a major innovation: while both the geocentric model and the heliocentric model as set forth by Copernicus relied on the idea of transparent rotating crystalline spheres to carry the planets in their orbits, Tycho eliminated the spheres entirely.<p>He was aware that a star observed near the horizon appears with a greater <!--del_lnk--> altitude than the real one, due to atmospheric <!--del_lnk--> refraction, and he worked out tables for the correction of this source of error.<p>To perform the huge number of products needed to produce much of his astronomical data, Tycho relied heavily on the then-new technique of <i><!--del_lnk--> prosthaphaeresis</i>, an algorithm for approximating products based on trigonometric identities that predated logarithms.<p><a id="Astrology" name="Astrology"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Astrology</span></h3>
      <p>Like the <!--del_lnk--> fifteenth century <!--del_lnk--> astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Regiomontanus, Tycho Brahe appears to have accepted <!--del_lnk--> astrological prognostications on the principle that the <!--del_lnk--> heavenly bodies undoubtedly influenced (yet did not determine) <a href="../../wp/l/Landform.htm" title="Landform">terrestrial</a> events, but expressed <!--del_lnk--> skepticism about the <!--del_lnk--> multiplicity of interpretative schemes, and increasingly preferred to work on establishing a sound <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematical">mathematical</a> <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>. Two early tracts, one entitled <i>Against Astrologers for Astrology</i>, and one on a new method of dividing the <!--del_lnk--> sky into <!--del_lnk--> astrological houses, were never published and are unfortunately now lost.<p>Tycho also worked in the area of <!--del_lnk--> weather prediction, produced <!--del_lnk--> astrological interpretations of the <!--del_lnk--> supernova of <!--del_lnk--> 1572 and the <a href="../../wp/c/Comet.htm" title="Comet">comet</a> of <!--del_lnk--> 1577, and furnished his patrons Frederick II and <!--del_lnk--> Rudolph II with <!--del_lnk--> nativities and other predictions (thereby strengthening the ties between patron and client by demonstrating value). An <!--del_lnk--> astrological <!--del_lnk--> worldview was fundamental to Tycho&#39;s entire <a href="../../wp/p/Philosophy.htm" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> of <a href="../../wp/n/Nature.htm" title="Nature">nature</a>. His interest in <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>, particularly the <!--del_lnk--> medical alchemy associated with <!--del_lnk--> Paracelsus, was almost as long-standing as his study of <!--del_lnk--> astrology and astronomy simultaneously, and <!--del_lnk--> Uraniborg was constructed as both <!--del_lnk--> observatory and <!--del_lnk--> laboratory.<p>In an introductory <!--del_lnk--> oration to the course of lectures he gave in <a href="../../wp/c/Copenhagen.htm" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1574, Tycho defended <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a> on the grounds of correspondences between the heavenly bodies, terrestrial substances (metals, stones etc.) and bodily <!--del_lnk--> organs (<!--del_lnk--> medical astrology). He was later to emphasise the importance of studying <a href="../../wp/a/Alchemy.htm" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Astrology.htm" title="Astrology">astrology</a> together with a pair of emblems bearing the mottoes: <i>Despiciendo suspicio</i> (&quot;By looking down I see upward&quot;) and <i>Suspiciendo despicio</i> (&quot;By looking up I see downward&quot;). As several scholars have now argued, Tycho&#39;s commitment to a relationship between <!--del_lnk--> macrocosm and microcosm even played a role in his rejection of <!--del_lnk--> Copernicanism and his construction of a third world-system.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Named after Tycho</span></h2>
