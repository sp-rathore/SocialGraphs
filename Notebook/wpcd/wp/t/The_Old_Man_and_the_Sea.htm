      <p><i><b>The Old Man and the Sea</b></i> is a <!--del_lnk--> novella by <a href="../../wp/e/Ernest_Hemingway.htm" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> written in <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> in 1951 and published in <!--del_lnk--> 1952. It was the last major work of <a href="../../wp/f/Fiction.htm" title="Fiction">fiction</a> to be produced by Hemingway and published in his lifetime. One of his most famous works, it centers upon an aging Cuban <!--del_lnk--> fisherman who struggles with a giant <!--del_lnk--> marlin far out in the <!--del_lnk--> Gulf Stream. Though it has been the subject of disparate <!--del_lnk--> criticism, it is noteworthy in twentieth century fiction and in Hemingway&#39;s canon, reaffirming his worldwide literary prominence and significant in his selection for the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Literature in <!--del_lnk--> 1954.<p>

      <p>Most biographers maintain that the years following Hemingway&#39;s publication of <i><!--del_lnk--> For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> in 1940 until 1952 were the bleakest in his literary career. The novel <i><!--del_lnk--> Across the River and Into the Trees</i> (1950) was almost unanimously disparaged by critics as <!--del_lnk--> self-parody. Evidently his participation as an <!--del_lnk--> Allied <!--del_lnk--> correspondent in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> did not yield fruits equivalent to those wrought of his experiences in <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">World War I</a> (<i><!--del_lnk--> A Farewell to Arms</i>, 1929) or the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish Civil War (<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>).<p>Hemingway had initially planned to use Santiago&#39;s story, which became <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, as part of a larger work, which he referred to as &quot;The Sea Book.&quot; Some aspects of it did appear in the <!--del_lnk--> posthumously published <i><!--del_lnk--> Islands in the Stream</i>. Positive feedback he received on Santiago&#39;s story led him to write it as an independent work. The book is a novella because it has no chapters or parts and is a bit longer than a short story.<p>The novel first appeared, in its 26,500-word entirety, as part of the <!--del_lnk--> September 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1952 edition of <!--del_lnk--> <i>Life</i> magazine. 5.3 million copies of that issue were sold within two days. The majority of concurrent criticism was extravagantly positive, while a streak of dissenting criticism has since emerged.<p>The title was misprinted on the cover of an early edition as <i>The Old Men and the Sea</i>.<p><a id="Inspiration_for_character" name="Inspiration_for_character"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Inspiration for character</span></h3>
      <p>While Hemingway was living in Cuba beginning in 1940 with his third wife <!--del_lnk--> Martha Gellhorn, one of his favorite pastimes was to sail and fish in his boat, named the <i>Pilar</i>. General biographical consensus holds that the model for Santiago in <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, at least in part, the Cuban fisherman <!--del_lnk--> Gregorio Fuentes.<p>Fuentes, born in 1897 on <!--del_lnk--> Lanzarote in the <!--del_lnk--> Canary Islands, migrated to Cuba when he was six years old and met Hemingway there in 1928. In the 1930s, Hemingway hired him to look after his boat. During Hemingway&#39;s Cuban years a strong friendship formed between Hemingway and Fuentes. For almost thirty years, Fuentes served as the captain of the <i>Pilar</i>; this included time during which Hemingway did not live in Cuba.<p>Fuentes, suffering from <a href="../../wp/c/Cancer.htm" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, died in 2002; he was 104 years old. Prior to his death, he donated Hemingway&#39;s <i>Pilar</i> to the Cuban <a href="../../wp/g/Government.htm" title="Government">government</a>. He never read <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>.<p><a id="Plot_summary" name="Plot_summary"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plot summary</span></h2>
      <div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> recounts an epic battle between an old, experienced fisherman and a giant marlin said to be the largest catch of his life.<p>It opens by explaining that the fisherman, who is named Santiago (but only directly referred to outside of dialogue as &quot;the old man&quot;), has gone 84 days without catching a fish. He is apparently so <!--del_lnk--> unlucky that his young <!--del_lnk--> apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man and been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen. Still dedicated to the old man, however, the boy visits Santiago&#39;s shack each night, hauling back his fishing gear, feeding him, and discussing American <a href="../../wp/b/Baseball.htm" title="Baseball">baseball</a>&mdash;most notably Santiago&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> idol, <!--del_lnk--> Joe DiMaggio. Santiago tells Manolin that on the next day, he will venture far out into the Gulf to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.<p>Thus on the eighty-fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his <!--del_lnk--> skiff far into the Gulf. He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. Unable to pull in the great marlin, Santiago instead finds the fish pulling his skiff. Two days and two nights pass in this manner, during which the old man bears the tension of the line with his body. Though he is wounded by the struggle and in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, often referring to him as a brother.<p>On the third day of the ordeal, the fish begins to circle the skiff, indicating his tiredness to the old man. Santiago, now completely worn out and almost in delirium, finds the strength to stab the marlin with a <!--del_lnk--> harpoon and kill him during one of his great lunges out of the water.<p>Santiago straps the marlin to his skiff and heads home, thinking about the high price the fish will bring him at the <a href="../../wp/m/Market.htm" title="Market">market</a> and how many people he will feed. The old man determines that because of the fish&#39;s great dignity, no one will be worthy of eating the marlin.<p>While Santiago continues his <!--del_lnk--> journey back to the shore, <a href="../../wp/s/Shark.htm" title="Shark">sharks</a> are attracted to the trail of blood left by the marlin in the water. The first, a great <!--del_lnk--> mako shark, Santiago kills with his harpoon, losing that weapon in the process. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his <!--del_lnk--> knife to the end of an <!--del_lnk--> oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; in total, seven sharks are slain. But by night, the sharks have devoured the marlin&#39;s entire carcass, leaving only its skeleton. The old man castigates himself for sacrificing the marlin. Finally reaching the shore before dawn on the next day, he struggles on the way to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and enters a very deep sleep.<p>Ignorant of the old man&#39;s journey, a group of fishermen gathers the next day around the boat where the fish&#39;s skeleton is still attached. <!--del_lnk--> Tourists at the nearby <!--del_lnk--> caf&eacute; mistakenly take it for a shark. Manolin, worried during the old man&#39;s endeavor, cries upon finding him safe asleep. The boy brings him newspapers and coffee. When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of <a href="../../wp/l/Lion.htm" title="Lion">lions</a> on the African beach.<div class="notice metadata spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>
      <p><a id="Literary_significance_.26_criticism" name="Literary_significance_.26_criticism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Literary significance &amp; criticism</span></h2>
      <p>One of the most celebrated favorable critical readings of the novella&mdash;and one which has defined analytical considerations since&mdash;came in 1957 with <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Waldmeir&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> essay entitled &quot;<i>Confiteor Hominem:</i> Ernest Hemingway&#39;s Religion of Man.&quot; Perhaps the most memorable claim therein is his answer to the <!--del_lnk--> rhetorical question,<dl>
       <dd>Just what is the book&#39;s message?<dd>The answer assumes a third level on which <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> must be read&mdash;as a sort of allegorical commentary on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones of <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway&#39;s works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating what might be called his philosophy of Manhood to the level of a religion. (351)</dl>
      <p>Waldmeir was one of the most prominent critics to wholly consider the function of the novella&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Christian imagery, made most evident through Santiago&#39;s blatant reference to the <!--del_lnk--> crucifixion following his sighting of the sharks that reads:<dl>
       <dd><i>Ay,</i> he said aloud. There is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a man might make, involuntarily, feeling the <!--del_lnk--> nail go through his hands and into the wood. (Hemingway 107)</dl>
      <p>Waldmeir analyzes this line, supplemented with other instances of similar <!--del_lnk--> symbolism, in such a way that allows him to claim that <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was a seminal work in raising what he calls Hemingway&#39;s &quot;philosophy of <!--del_lnk--> Manhood&quot; to a religious level. Regardless of whether one agrees with this logic, his hallmark criticism, curiously sycophantic in tone, stands as one of the most durable, positive treatments of the novella.<p>On the other hand, one of the most outspoken critics who has emerged in the camp of dissenting opinion of the work is <!--del_lnk--> Robert P. Weeks. His notorious 1962 piece, &quot;Fakery in <i>The Old Man and the Sea,</i>&quot; presents a series of points that he claims show how the novella is a weak and unexpected divergence from the typical, realistic Hemingway. In juxtaposing this novella against Hemingway&#39;s previous works, he explains that<dl>
       <dd>The difference, however, in the effectiveness with which Hemingway employs this characteristic device in his best work and in <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> is illuminating. The work of fiction in which Hemingway devoted the most attention to natural objects, <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, is pieced out with an extraordinary quantity of fakery, extraordinary because one would expect to find no inexactness, no romanticizing of natural objects in a writer who loathed <!--del_lnk--> W.H. Hudson, could not read <a href="../../wp/h/Henry_David_Thoreau.htm" title="Henry David Thoreau">Thoreau</a>, deplored Melville&#39;s rhetoric in <i>Moby Dick</i>, and who was himself criticized by other writers, notably Faulkner, for his devotion to the facts and his unwillingness to &quot;invent.&quot; (188)</dl>
      <p>While his dismissal is mostly limited to the story at hand (he refers to previous Hemingway works as &quot;earlier glories&quot;), the evident range of critical interpretations is a curiosity for a work so widely renowned as a masterpiece.<p><a id="Awards_and_nominations" name="Awards_and_nominations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Awards and nominations</span></h2>
      <p><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> led to numerous accolades for Hemingway, including the <!--del_lnk--> 1953 <!--del_lnk--> Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. He also earned the Award of Merit Medal for the <a href="../../wp/n/Novel.htm" title="Novel">Novel</a> from the <!--del_lnk--> American Academy of Letters that same year. Most prestigiously, the <!--del_lnk--> Nobel Prize in Literature came in <!--del_lnk--> 1954, &quot;for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.&quot;<p><a id="Film_and_television_adaptations" name="Film_and_television_adaptations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Film and television adaptations</span></h2>
      <p>Of the several films that have been made based on the novella, the most notable, produced in 1958, stars <!--del_lnk--> Spencer Tracy as Santiago and <!--del_lnk--> Felipe Pazos as Manolin. It was adapted by <!--del_lnk--> Peter Viertel and directed by <!--del_lnk--> John Sturges, <!--del_lnk--> Henry King (uncredited) and <!--del_lnk--> Fred Zinnemann (uncredited). It won the <!--del_lnk--> Academy Award for <!--del_lnk--> Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, and was nominated in the categories of <!--del_lnk--> Best Actor in a Leading Role (Spencer Tracy) and <!--del_lnk--> Best Cinematography. It should be noted that Hemingway thought that Tracy was (literally) unfit for the role, having been known to call Tracy a &quot;fat lard&quot; among other names. The small boat used by Tracy in the film was built at the Havana Shipyards, Astilleros Palmer, where some of the movie&#39;s scenes were filmed.<p>Another prominent version is a 1990 <!--del_lnk--> television movie starring <!--del_lnk--> Anthony Quinn as Santiago and <!--del_lnk--> Francesco Quinn as the young Santiago. This version introduces two characters not in the novella, Tom Pruitt and Mary Pruitt, played by <!--del_lnk--> Gary Cole and <!--del_lnk--> Patricia Clarkson, respectively.<p>In 1999, the <!--del_lnk--> centennial of Hemingway&#39;s birth, director <!--del_lnk--> Alexandr Petrov released an <!--del_lnk--> animated, large-format film of the novella, created from 29,000 hand-painted images. The project was initiated in 1995 after Petrov&#39;s first meeting with <!--del_lnk--> Productions Pascal Blais, a <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canadian</a> animation company. It received the Academy Award for <!--del_lnk--> Best Animated Short Film.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea&quot;</div>
