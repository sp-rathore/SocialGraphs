      <p><i><b>The Lorax</b></i> (<!--del_lnk--> ISBN 0394823370)is a <!--del_lnk--> children&#39;s story written by <a href="../../wp/d/Dr._Seuss.htm" title="Dr. Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a> and first published in <!--del_lnk--> 1971. The tale chronicles the plight of the <!--del_lnk--> environment and the Lorax (a &quot;mossy, bossy&quot; man-like creature), who speaks for the trees against the greedy <!--del_lnk--> Once-ler.<p>The book is commonly recognized as a <!--del_lnk--> parable concerning industrialized society, using the literary element of personification to give life to industry as the Once-ler (whose face is never shown in all of the story&#39;s illustrations) and to the environment as the Lorax.<p><i>The Lorax</i> is arguably Seuss&#39; most controversial work, having been <!--del_lnk--> banned in some schools and libraries for its political content. <div class="notice metadata spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><!--del_lnk--> Spoiler warning: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
      <p>A boy comes to a dark, desolate corner of town called &quot;the Street of the Lifted Lorax,&quot; to learn who the Lorax was and how he got &quot;lifted and taken away.&quot; Through a &quot;whisper-ma-phone,&quot; the Once-ler tells the boy what happened. When the Once-ler first arrived at this place, it was a beautiful, sunny forest where the Swomee-Swans sang, the Humming-Fish hummed, and Brown Bar-ba-loots played in the shade while eating the fruit of the Truffula Trees, colorful woolly trees spread throughout the area. Enchanted by these gorgeous trees, the Once-ler built a small shop, where he chopped down a tree and knitted a Thneed, an odd-looking but versatile garment that he insisted &quot;everyone needs.&quot; Out of the stump popped a strange little man called the Lorax, who claimed to &quot;speak for the trees.&quot; The Lorax first pooh-poohed the Once-ler&#39;s creation, until someone came along and bought it. Spurred by greed, the Once-ler invited all his relatives to town where they started a huge Thneed-making business, chopping down Truffula Trees left and right, much to the Lorax&#39;s distress. The skies gradually got darker and more polluted, forcing the Lorax to send the Bar-ba-loots, the swans, and the fish off in search of a better place to live. The Once-ler, while upset to see the animals go, dismissed the Lorax&#39;s pleadings until the last Truffula Tree got chopped down, leaving the Once-ler alone with the Lorax and a failed business in a desolate place under a dark <a href="../../wp/s/Smog.htm" title="Smog">smoggy</a> sky. With a &quot;sad backward glance,&quot; the Lorax picked himself up by the &quot;seat of the pants&quot; and floated away through a hole in the smog. At the end of the story, the Once-ler reveals that he has one last Truffula seed left, and instructs the boy to start a new forest so that &quot;the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.&quot;<p><a id="Interpretation" name="Interpretation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Interpretation</span></h2>
      <p>The Once-ler ran his <a href="../../wp/c/Company_%2528law%2529.htm" title="Company (law)">company</a> with the exclusive goal of increasing its sales and <!--del_lnk--> profits as rapidly as possible, a common practice in a <a href="../../wp/c/Corporation.htm" title="Corporation">corporate</a> <!--del_lnk--> market economy: &quot;business is business and business must grow.&quot; In the process he ignored the long-term <!--del_lnk--> sustainability of his business and environmental concerns such as <a href="../../wp/b/Biodiversity.htm" title="Biodiversity">biodiversity</a> and habitat loss. In his old age he tells a curious boy about the splendor of nature in his youth and the growth and crash of industry at the far end of town.<p>Discovering the potential for profit in a lush forest of Truffula trees, the Once-ler began <!--del_lnk--> clearcutting it to mass-market Thneeds made from the Truffula tree tufts. The Lorax vehemently protested the destruction of the Truffula forest, stating that the Once-ler was crazy with <!--del_lnk--> greed and that his business was destroying the Truffula ecosystem, causing mass migrations of native <!--del_lnk--> fauna, including the bear-like Bar-ba-loots and species of fish and birds. The Once-ler didn&#39;t listen; he continued clearcutting the trees and dumping industrial waste into nearby ponds. Eventually the Once-ler&#39;s Thneed business consumed every single Truffula tree, eliminating the Truffula forest ecosystem and putting his own company out of business. The Once-ler&#39;s relatives abandoned him, and the Lorax flew away, leaving behind a small pile of rocks inscribed with the word &quot;UNLESS.&quot;<p>With age the Once-ler has come to realize the folly of his ways and the importance of conservation. Speaking to the boy in the story, and directly to the reader, the Once-ler explains that &quot;unless&quot; people take an active and caring role in their environment, &quot;nothing is going to get better, it&#39;s not.&quot; The Once-ler then gives the boy the very last Truffula seed, telling him to grow a new tree and eventually a forest and protect it from unsustainable industrial practices, and that then perhaps the Lorax and his animal friends would return.<p><a id="Trivia" name="Trivia"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
      <ul>
       <li><i>The Lorax</i> has the distinction of being the only book that Seuss himself ever changed after publication, by removing the Lorax&#39;s line, &quot;I hear things are just as bad up at <!--del_lnk--> Lake Erie!&quot; which he found to be out of place in his fantasy work, as it referred to a real world place.</ul>
      <ul>
       <li>The Lorax resembles United States President <a href="../../wp/t/Theodore_Roosevelt.htm" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, the first US President to make conservation a priority for his administration and who established the <!--del_lnk--> United States Forest Service.</ul>
