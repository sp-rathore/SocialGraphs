      <p>Tofu is made by coagulating soy milk and pressing the resulting curds. Although pre-made soy milk may be used, most tofu producers begin with their own soy milk, which is produced by soaking, grinding, boiling, and straining dried (or, more rarely, fresh) <!--del_lnk--> soybeans.<p><!--del_lnk--> Coagulation of the protein and oil (<!--del_lnk--> emulsion) suspended in the boiled soy milk is the most important step in the production of tofu. This process is accomplished with the aid of coagulants. Two types of coagulants (salts and acids) are used commercially . The third type of coagulant, enzymes, is not yet used commercially but shows potential for producing both firm and &quot;silken&quot; tofu:<ol>
       <li><b>Salt coagulants</b><ul>
         <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Calcium sulfate</b> (<a href="../../wp/g/Gypsum.htm" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>) and <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium_chloride.htm" title="Calcium chloride">calcium chloride</a>&nbsp;: The traditional, and most widely used coagulant to produce Chinese style tofu. It produces a tofu that is tender but slightly brittle in texture. The coagulant itself has no perceivable taste. Use of this coagulant also makes a tofu that is rich in calcium, an important mineral for treating and preventing <!--del_lnk--> osteoporosis. As such, many tofu manufacturers choose to use this coagulant to be able to market their tofu as a good source of calcium.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Magnesium chloride</b>: The coagulant used to make Japanese style tofu with smooth and tender texture. In Japan, a white powder called <i>nigari</i>, which consists primarily of magnesium chloride, is produced from <!--del_lnk--> seawater after the <!--del_lnk--> sodium chloride is removed and the water evaporated. Depending on its production method, <i>nigari</i> may also contain small quantities of <!--del_lnk--> magnesium sulfate (Epsom salt), <!--del_lnk--> potassium chloride, <a href="../../wp/c/Calcium_chloride.htm" title="Calcium chloride">calcium chloride</a>, and trace amounts of other naturally occurring salts. Although the term <i>nigari</i> is derived from <i>nigai</i>, the Japanese word for &quot;bitter,&quot; neither <i>nigari</i> nor pure magnesium chloride imparts a perceivable taste to the finished tofu.</ul>
       <li><b>Acid coagulants</b><ul>
         <li><b><!--del_lnk--> Glucono delta-lactone</b> (GDL): A naturally occurring organic acid also used in cheese making, which produces a very fine textured tofu that is almost jelly-like. This coagulant is used especially for &quot;silken&quot; and softer tofus, and confers an almost inperceptable sour taste to the finished product.  Commonly used together with Calcium sulphate to give soft tofus a smooth tender texture.</ul>
       <li><b>Enzyme coagulants</b><ul>
         <li>Among <!--del_lnk--> enzymes that have been shown to produce tofu are <!--del_lnk--> papain, and alkaline and neutral proteinases from microorganisms. In the case of papain, the enzyme to substrate ratio, by weight, was held constant at 1:400. An aliquot of 1% crude papain was added to &quot;uncooked&quot; soy milk at room temperature and heated to 90&ndash;100 celsius .</ul>
      </ol>
      <p>Contemporary tofu manufacturers may choose to use one or more of these coagulants, since they each play a role in producing a desired texture in the finished tofu. Different textures result from different pore sizes and other microsopic features in tofus produced using each coagulant. The coagulant mixture is dissolved into water, and the solution is then stirred into boiled soy milk until the mixture curdles into a soft gel.<p>The curds are processed differently depending on the form of tofu that is being manufactured. For soft silken tofu (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh"><!--del_lnk--> &#x5AE9;<!--del_lnk--> &#x8C46;<!--del_lnk--> &#x8150;</span>; <i>n&egrave;n do&ugrave;fu</i>) or tofu flower (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh"><!--del_lnk--> &#x8C46;<!--del_lnk--> &#x82B1;</span>, <i>d&ograve;uhu&#x101;</i>) the soy milk is curdled directly in the tofu&#39;s selling package. For standard firm Asian tofu, the soy curd is cut and strained of excess liquid using <!--del_lnk--> cheese cloth or <!--del_lnk--> muslin and then lightly pressed to produce a soft cake. Firmer tofus, such as Asian dry tofu (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh"><!--del_lnk--> &#x8373;<!--del_lnk--> &#x4E7E;</span>) or Western types of tofu, are further pressed to remove even more liquid. The tofu curds are allowed to cool and become firm. The finished tofu can then be cut into pieces, flavoured or further processed.<p>Although tartness is sometimes desired in dessert tofu, the acid used in flavouring is usually not the primary coagulant since it is not desirable to the flavour or texture of the resulting tofu to add it in a sufficiently high concentration as to induce coagulation. A sour taste in tofu and a slight cloudiness in its storing liquid is also usually an indication of bacterial growth and, hence, spoilage.<p><a id="Varieties" name="Varieties"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Varieties</span></h2>
      <p>There is a wide variety of tofu available in the both western and eastern markets. Despite the daunting variety, tofu products can be split into two main categories: <i>fresh tofu</i>, which is produced directly from soy milk, and <i>processed tofu</i>, which is produced from fresh tofu. Tofu production also creates important side products which are often used in various cuisines.<p><a id="Fresh_tofu" name="Fresh_tofu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Fresh tofu</span></h3>
      <p>Depending on the amount of water that is extracted from the tofu curds, fresh tofu can be divided into three main varieties.<div class="thumb tright">

In Korea and Japan, traditional soft tofu is made with <!--del_lnk--> seawater. <i><!--del_lnk--> Tofu flower</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8C46;&#x82B1;</span>, <i>do&ugrave; hu&#x101;</i> or <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8C46;&#x8150;&#x82B1;</span>, <i>do&ugrave;fu hu&#x101;</i> in Chinese), or <i>tofu brain</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8C46;&#x8150;&#x8166;</span>, <i>do&ugrave;fu na&#x1D2;</i> in Chinese), often eaten as a dessert, but sometimes with salty pickles or hot sauce added instead, is another type of soft tofu with an even higher moisture content. Because it is nearly impossible to pick up this type of tofu with <!--del_lnk--> chopsticks, it is generally eaten with a spoon.<li><b>Asian firm tofu</b> (simply called <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8C46;&#x8150;</span> <i>do&ugrave;fu</i> in Chinese; <span lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">&#x6728;&#x7DBF;&#x8C46;&#x8150;</span>, <i>momend&#x14D;fu</i> in <!--del_lnk--> Japanese, lit. &quot;cotton tofu&quot;): Although drained and pressed, this form of fresh tofu still contains a great amount of moisture. It has the firmness of raw meat but bounces back readily when pressed. The texture of the inside of the tofu is similar to that of a firm custard. The skin of this form of tofu has the pattern of the muslin used to drain it and is slightly more resilient to damage than its inside. Can be picked up easily with <!--del_lnk--> chopsticks.  <li><b>Western firm/dried tofu</b> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8C46;&#x4E7E;</span>, <i>do&ugrave; g&#x101;n</i> in Chinese, lit. &quot;dry tofu&quot;): An extra firm variety of tofu with the least amount of moisture of all fresh tofus. It has the firmness of fully cooked meat and a somewhat rubbery feel similar to <!--del_lnk--> paneer. When sliced thinly, this tofu can be crumbled easily. The skin of this form of tofu has the pattern of the muslin used to drain and press it. Western firm tofu is milled and reformed after the pressing and sometimes lacks the skin with its cloth patterning. One variety of dried tofu pressed especially flat and is sliced into long strings with a cross section smaller than 2&nbsp;mm &times; 2&nbsp;mm. Shredded dried tofu (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8373;&#x4E7E;&#x7D72;</span>, <i>do&ugrave; g&#x101;n s&#x12B;</i> in Chinese), which looks like loose cooked <!--del_lnk--> noodles, and can be served cold, stir-fried, or similar in style to Japanese <i><!--del_lnk--> aburage</i>. </ul>
      <p>Fresh tofu is usually sold completely immersed in water to maintain its moisture content. <p><a id="Processed_tofu" name="Processed_tofu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Processed tofu</span></h3>
      <p>Many forms of processed tofus exist, due to the varied ways in which fresh tofu can be used. Some of these techniques likely originate from the need to preserve tofu before the days of refrigeration, or to increase its shelf life and longevity. Other production techniques are employed to create tofus with unique textures and flavours .<p><a id="Fermented" name="Fermented"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Fermented</span></h4>

The blocks of tofu smell strongly of certain pungent cheeses, and are described by many as rotten and fecal. Despite its strong odour, the flavour and mouthfeel of stinky tofu is appreciated by aficionados, who describe it as delightful. The texture of this tofu is similar to the soft Asian tofu that it is made from. The rind that stinky tofu develops from frying is said to be especially crisp, and is usually served with <!--del_lnk--> soy sauce, sweet sauce, and/or hot sauce.</ul>

This tofu has a fuller texture and flavour than silken tofu, which can be attributed to the presence of egg fat and protein.</ul>

Although, tofu is often sold preprocessed into fried items, pre-fried tofu is seldom eaten directly and requires additional cooking. Depending on the type of tofu used, the texture of deep fried tofu may range from crispy on the outside and custardy on the inside, to puffed up like a plain <!--del_lnk--> doughnut.

Like the origins of <a href="../../wp/c/Cheese.htm" title="Cheese">cheese</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Butter.htm" title="Butter">butter</a>, the exact origin of tofu production may never be known or proven.<p>What is known is that tofu production is an ancient technique. Tofu was widely consumed in ancient China, and techniques for its production and preparation were eventually spread to many other parts of Asia.<p><a id="Three_theories_of_origin" name="Three_theories_of_origin"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Three theories of origin</span></h3>
      <p>The most commonly held of the three theories of tofu&#39;s origin maintains that tofu was invented in Northern China around <!--del_lnk--> 164 BC by Lord <!--del_lnk--> Liu An, a prince during the <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty. Although this is possible, the paucity of concrete information about this period makes it difficult to conclusively determine whether or not Liu An invented the method for making tofu. Furthermore, in Chinese history, important inventions were often attributed to important leaders and figures of the time. <p>Another theory states that the production method for tofu was discovered accidentally when a slurry of boiled, ground soybeans was mixed with impure sea salt. Such sea salt would likely have contained calcium and magnesium salts, allowing the soy mixture to curdle and produce a tofu-like gel.<sup id="ref_sundubu"><small>1</small></sup> This may have possibly been the way that tofu was discovered, since soy milk has been eaten as a savory soup in ancient as well as modern times. Despite its technical plausibility, there is little evidence to prove or disprove that tofu production originated in this way.<p>The last group of theories maintains that the ancient Chinese learned the method for the curdling of soy milk by emulating the milk curdling techniques of the <!--del_lnk--> Mongolians or <!--del_lnk--> East Indians. For, despite their advancement, no technology or knowledge of culturing and processing milk products existed within ancient Chinese society. The primary evidence for this theory lies with the etymological similarity between the Chinese term for Mongolian fermented milk (<i>rufu</i>, which literally means &quot;milk spoiled&quot;) and the term <i>doufu</i> or tofu. Although intriguing and possible, there is no evidence to substantiate this theory beyond the point of academic speculation.<p><a id="Established_history_of_tofu" name="Established_history_of_tofu"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Established history of tofu</span></h3>
      <p>Although its development likely preceded Liu An, tofu is known to have been a commonly produced and consumed food item in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> by the <!--del_lnk--> 2nd century BC. Although the varieties of tofu produced in ancient times may not have been identical to those of today, descriptions from writings and poetry of the <!--del_lnk--> Song and <!--del_lnk--> Yuan Dynasty show that the production technique for tofu had already been standardized by then, to the extent that they would be similar to tofu of contemporary times.<p>Tofu and its production technique were subsequently introduced into <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Nara period (late <!--del_lnk--> eighth century) as well as other parts of <!--del_lnk--> East Asia. This spread likely coincided with the spread of <a href="../../wp/b/Buddhism.htm" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> as it is an important source of proteins in the religion&#39;s vegetarian diet. Since then, tofu has become a <!--del_lnk--> staple in many countries, including <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a>, with subtle regional variations in production methods, texture, flavour, and usage.<p>Tofu was not well known to most Westerners before the middle of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>.

Soy <!--del_lnk--> phytoestrogens (<!--del_lnk--> isoflavones: genistein and daidzein) adsorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels.

      <p>Unless one purchases it in sterilized containers, tofu does require some choosing when purchasing and some care while storing:<ul>
       <li>Tofu can easily be spoiled if not refrigerated properly during <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transportation</a>; any trace of sour odour or taste is a tell-tale sign of staleness or spoilage.<li>Smaller <!--del_lnk--> supermarkets may sell sour tofu because some do not use refrigerated trucks for delivery.<li>Once purchased, unpackaged tofu should be kept in the <!--del_lnk--> refrigerator. The water in which the tofu is kept should be changed on a daily basis and the tofu should be consumed or cooked within several days. Tofu in sealed packages can be kept from one to several weeks in the refrigerator. Tofu packaged in aseptic <!--del_lnk--> Tetra Brik containers has a shelf life of one year if unopened.</ul>
      <h2> <span class="mw-headline">Myths</span></h2>
      <p>The Chinese have a myth that if one eats tofu, one should not eat or drink honey for fear that this might cause death.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu&quot;</div>
