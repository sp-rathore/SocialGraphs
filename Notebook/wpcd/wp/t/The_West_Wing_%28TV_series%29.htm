It was produced by <!--del_lnk--> John Wells. The series is set in the <!--del_lnk--> West Wing of the <!--del_lnk--> White House, the location of the <!--del_lnk--> Oval Office and offices of presidential senior staff, during the fictional <!--del_lnk--> Democratic <!--del_lnk--> administration of <!--del_lnk--> Josiah Bartlet (<!--del_lnk--> Martin Sheen).<p><i>The West Wing</i> was produced by <!--del_lnk--> Warner Bros. Television. It first aired on <!--del_lnk--> NBC in 1999, and has been broadcast by many <!--del_lnk--> networks in <!--del_lnk--> dozens of other countries. The series ended its seven year run on <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>The show received positive reviews from critics, <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political science</a> professors, and former White House staffers. In total, <i>The West Wing</i> won two <!--del_lnk--> Golden Globe Awards and 26 <!--del_lnk--> Emmy Awards, tying with <!--del_lnk--> Hill Street Blues for the most Emmy Awards ever won by a television drama series. Included in this record-equalling haul were four straight awards for Outstanding Drama Series (2000&ndash;2003). The show&#39;s popularity waned in later years, but it remained popular among high-income viewers, a key demographic for the show and its advertisers.<p>

      <p>Additions to the cast following the first season include <!--del_lnk--> Joshua Malina as speech writer and campaign guru <!--del_lnk--> Will Bailey, <!--del_lnk--> Mary McCormack as deputy National Security Advisor <!--del_lnk--> Kate Harper, <!--del_lnk--> Kristin Chenoweth as communications advisor <!--del_lnk--> Annabeth Schott, <!--del_lnk--> Jimmy Smits as <!--del_lnk--> Texas <!--del_lnk--> Congressman <!--del_lnk--> Matt Santos, and <!--del_lnk--> Alan Alda as <!--del_lnk--> Senator <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Vinick of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>.<p>Each of the principal actors made approximately $75,000 an episode, with Sheen&#39;s most recently confirmed salary being $300,000. Rob Lowe also had a six-figure salary, reported to be $100,000, because his character originally was supposed to have a more central role. Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes, particularly by Janney, Schiff, Spencer, and Whitford. During contract negotiations in 2001, the four were threatened with breach-of-contract suits by Warner Bros. However, by banding together, they were able to convince the studio to more than double their salaries. Two years later, the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries, a few months after Warner Bros. had signed new licensing deals with NBC and <!--del_lnk--> Bravo.<p>The show suffered an unexpected loss by the death of John Spencer, who played Leo McGarry. Spencer passed away from a fatal heart attack on <!--del_lnk--> December 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 &mdash; about a year after his character experienced a nearly fatal heart attack on the show. A brief memorial message from Martin Sheen ran before &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Running Mates&quot;, the first new episode that aired after Spencer&#39;s death. The loss of Spencer&#39;s character, McGarry, was addressed by the series beginning with the episode &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Election Day&quot;, which aired on <!--del_lnk--> April 2, <!--del_lnk--> 2006.<p>Different performers had been originally considered for many of the roles. Bradley Whitford states in an interview on the Season 1 DVD that he was originally cast as Sam, though the character of Josh was the role Whitford had wanted and auditioned for. In addition, Josh&#39;s character been written specifically for him by Aaron Sorkin. In the same interview, Janel Moloney states that she had originally auditioned for the role of C.J., and that the role she eventually received, Donna, was not meant to be a recurring character. Other actors who were seriously considered include <!--del_lnk--> Alan Alda and <!--del_lnk--> Sidney Poitier for the President, <!--del_lnk--> Judd Hirsch for Leo, <!--del_lnk--> Eugene Levy for Toby, and <!--del_lnk--> CCH Pounder for C.J.<p><a id="Plot" name="Plot"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>

      <p><i>The West Wing</i>, like many serial dramas, stretches storylines over several episodes or entire seasons. In addition to these larger storylines, each episode also contains smaller arcs which usually begin and end within an episode. Plot synopses, both for individual episodes and overall seasons, are included with a <!--del_lnk--> list of <i>The West Wing</i> episodes.<p>Most episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues. Plots can range from behind-closed-doors negotiating with Congress (&quot;Five Votes Down&quot;) to personal issues like sex (&quot;Pilot&quot;, &quot;Take Out The Trash Day&quot;) and drugs (a major plotline throughout the first and second seasons). The typical episode loosely follows the president and his staff through their day. A large, fully connected set of the White House allows the producers to create shots with very few cuts and long, continuous <!--del_lnk--> master shots of staff members walking and talking through the hallways. These &quot;walks-and-talks&quot; became a trademark of the show.<p>In the first season, the administration is in the middle of its first year and is still having trouble settling in and making progress on legislative issues. The second season brings scandal as the White House is rocked by allegations of criminal conduct and the president must decide whether he will run for a second term. The third and fourth seasons take an in-depth look at the campaign trail and the specter of both foreign and domestic terrorism. In the fifth season, the president begins to encounter more issues on the foreign front, while at home he must face off with the newly elected <a href="../../wp/s/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives.htm" title="Speaker of the United States House of Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> over the future of the federal budget. The sixth season chronicles the quest to replace Bartlet in the next election, following the primary campaign of several candidates from both parties. In the seventh season, the president must face a leak of confidential information from inside the White House, while the Democratic and Republican candidates battle to replace him in the general election.<p><a id="Show.27s_evolution" name="Show.27s_evolution"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Show&#39;s evolution</span></h2>
      <p>The series developed from the 1995 theatrical film <i><!--del_lnk--> The American President</i>, for which <!--del_lnk--> Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay. Unused plot elements from the film inspired Sorkin to create <i>The West Wing</i>.<p>Sorkin intended to centre the show on Sam Seaborn, Bartlet&#39;s deputy communications director, with the president in an unseen or a secondary role. However, Bartlet&#39;s screen time gradually increased, and his role expanded as the series progressed. Positive critical and public reaction to Sheen&#39;s sometimes <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Clintonesque</a> performance raised his character&#39;s profile, decreasing Lowe&#39;s perceived significance. This shift is one of the reasons for Lowe&#39;s eventual departure from the show in the fourth season.<p>For the first four seasons, Sorkin wrote almost every episode of the series, occasionally reusing plot elements, character names, and actors from his previous work, <i><!--del_lnk--> Sports Night</i>, a <!--del_lnk--> sitcom in which he began to develop his signature dialogue style of rhythmic, snappy, and intellectual banter. Fellow executive producer and director <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Schlamme developed the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Walk and Talk,&quot; a continuous shot tracking in front of the characters as they walk from one place to another that became part of <i>The West Wing&#39;</i>s signature visual style. Sorkin&#39;s hectic writing schedule often led to cost overruns and schedule slips, and he opted to leave the show after the fourth season, following increasing personal problems, including a very public arrest for possession of illegal drugs. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Schlamme also left the show after the fourth season. <!--del_lnk--> John Wells, the remaining executive producer, took the helm after their departure.<p>The perceived switch of emphasis from Sorkin&#39;s dialogue-centric style of writing to Wells&#39; focus on plot-driven drama angered some of the show&#39;s fan base. Some disliked the switch so passionately that they actively campaigned for the series to be cancelled, citing Sorkin&#39;s departure as the sole cause of its &quot;decline&quot;. However, many viewers continued to tune into <i>The West Wing</i> regularly, with the show consistently averaging eight million viewers a week at the close of its run.<p>The show aired its series finale on Sunday, May 14, 2006.<p><a id="Critical_reactions" name="Critical_reactions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Critical reactions</span></h2>
      <p><i>The West Wing</i> offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">America</a>&#39;s most powerful address, <!--del_lnk--> 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Many criticisms have been written concerning the show&#39;s legitimacy, political slant, and film merits.<p><a id="Realism" name="Realism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Realism</span></h3>
      <p><i>The West Wing</i> is not completely accurate in its portrayal of the actual West Wing because of the certain amount of melodrama that must be added to each episode to captivate viewers. However, former White House staffers agree that the show &quot;captures the feel [of the West Wing], shorn of a thousand undramatic details.&quot;<p>Former <!--del_lnk--> White House Press Secretary <!--del_lnk--> Dee Dee Myers as well as expert pollster <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Caddell served as consultants for the show since the beginning, helping writers and actors depict the West Wing accurately. Other former White House staffers, such as <!--del_lnk--> Peggy Noonan and <!--del_lnk--> Gene Sperling, have served as consultants for brief periods.<p>A documentary special in the third season attempts to lend legitimacy to the show&#39;s depiction of the real West Wing. Many former West Wing denizens applauded the show&#39;s depiction of the real West Wing, including advisor <!--del_lnk--> David Gergen, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State <!--del_lnk--> Henry Kissinger, Chief of Staff <!--del_lnk--> Leon Panetta, Deputy Chief of Staff <!--del_lnk--> Karl Rove, and former Presidents <a href="../../wp/g/Gerald_Ford.htm" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>.<p>While some critics often praise <i>The West Wing</i> for its writing, others fault the show for its unrealistic optimism in the face of all odds. A large part of this criticism rises from the perceived naivet&eacute; of the characters. Television critic Heather Havrilesky asks &quot;... how do you go from innocent <!--del_lnk--> millipede to White House staffer without becoming soiled or disillusioned by the dirty realities of politics along the way?&quot; However, many fans believe that the show&#39;s scripts changed for the worse after Sorkin left the show in 2003.<p><a id="Social_impact" name="Social_impact"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Social impact</span></h3>
      <p>Despite acclaim for the veracity of the series, Sorkin believes, &quot;My obligation isn&#39;t to the truth ... my obligation is to captivate you for however long I&#39;ve asked for your attention.&quot; Former White House aide Matthew Miller notes that Sorkin &quot;captivates viewers by making the human side of politics more real than life &mdash; or at least more real than the picture we get from the news.&quot; Miller also notes that by portraying politicians with empathy, the show has created a &quot;subversive competitor&quot; to the cynical views of politics in media. In the essay &quot;<i>The West Wing</i> and the West Wing&quot;, author Myron Levine agrees, stating that the series &quot;presents an essentially positive view of public service and a healthy corrective to anti-Washington stereotypes and public cynicism.&quot;<p>Dr. Staci L. Beavers, associate professor of <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political science</a> at <!--del_lnk--> California State University, San Marcos, wrote a short essay, <i>The West Wing as a Pedagogical Tool</i>, concerning the viability of <i>The West Wing</i> as a teaching tool. She concludes, &quot;While the series&rsquo; purpose is for-profit entertainment, <i>The West Wing</i> presents great pedagogical potential.&quot; <i>The West Wing</i>, in her opinion, gives greater depth to the political process usually espoused only in stilted <!--del_lnk--> talking points on shows like <i><!--del_lnk--> Face the Nation</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Meet the Press</i>. However, the merits of a particular argument may be obscured by the viewer&#39;s opinion of the character. Beavers also notes that characters with opposing viewpoints are often set up to be &quot;bad people&quot; in the viewer&#39;s eyes. These characters are assigned undesirable characteristics having nothing to do with their political opinions, such as being romantically involved with a main character&#39;s love interest. In Beavers&#39;s opinion, a critical analysis of the show&#39;s political views can present a worthwhile learning experience to the viewer.<p>One of the stranger impacts of the show occurred on <!--del_lnk--> January 31, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, when <i>The West Wing</i> was said to have played a hand in defeating <a href="../../wp/t/Tony_Blair.htm" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>&#39;s government in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>, during the so called &quot;<i>West Wing</i> Plot&quot;. The plan was allegedly hatched after a <!--del_lnk--> Conservative <!--del_lnk--> Member of Parliament watched the episode, &quot;<!--del_lnk--> A Good Day&quot;.<p><a id="The_Left_Wing" name="The_Left_Wing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Left Wing</i></span></h3>
      <p><i>The West Wing</i> is sometimes called <i><!--del_lnk--> The Left Wing</i> by detractors because of its portrayal of the ideal <!--del_lnk--> liberal administration and an alleged penchant to demonize conservatives. Some view the show as a <!--del_lnk--> revisionist look at the Clinton presidency: an attempt to solidify the Clinton legacy and to make America forget the <!--del_lnk--> Whitewater and <!--del_lnk--> Lewinsky scandals. On the other hand, some Republicans have admired the show since its inception, regardless of the departure of Sorkin and the show&#39;s resulting shift toward the centre. In his 2001 article &quot;Real Liberals versus the <i>West Wing</i>&quot;, Mackubin Owens pointed out,<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Some praise the show for helping to bridge the gap between the left and the <!--del_lnk--> right in America.

      <p>In its first season, <i>The West Wing</i> attracted critical attention in the film community with a record nine <!--del_lnk--> Emmy wins. The show has been praised for its high production values and continuously recognized for its <!--del_lnk--> cinematic achievements. With a budget of $6 million per episode, many consider each week&#39;s show to be a small feature film. However, many in the film community believe that the true genius of the show was Sorkin&#39;s rapid-fire and witty scripts.<p><i>The West Wing</i> is most famously noted for developing the &quot;walk-and-talk&quot;&mdash;long <!--del_lnk--> Steadicam <!--del_lnk--> tracking shots showing characters walking down hallways while involved in long conversations. In a typical &quot;walk-and-talk&quot; shot, the camera leads two characters down a hallway as they speak to each other. One of these characters generally breaks off and the remaining character is then joined by another character, who initiates another conversation as they continue walking. These &quot;walks-and-talks&quot; create a dynamic feel for what would otherwise be long expository dialogue, and have become a staple for dialogue-intensive television show scenes. <p><a id="Awards" name="Awards"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Awards</span></h3>

      <p><i>The West Wing</i> often features extensive discussion of current or recent political issues. After the real-world election of Republican President <a href="../../wp/g/George_W._Bush.htm" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> in 2000, many wondered whether the liberal show could retain its relevance and topicality. However, by exploring many of the same issues facing the Bush administration from a Democratic point of view, the show continued to appeal to a broad audience of both Democrats and Republicans.<p>In its second season President Bartlet admonished fictional radio host Dr. Jenna Jacobs for her views regarding <!--del_lnk--> homosexuality at a private gathering at the White House. Dr. Jacobs is a caricature of radio personality <!--del_lnk--> Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who strongly disapproves of homosexuality. Many of the president&#39;s <a href="../../wp/b/Bible.htm" title="Bible">biblical</a> references in his comments to Dr. Jacobs, which can be heard <!--del_lnk--> here, are thought to have come from a letter circulated online in early May 2000.<p>The Bartlet administration experienced a scandal during the second and third seasons that has been compared to the <!--del_lnk--> Monica Lewinsky affair. President Bartlet was diagnosed with <a href="../../wp/m/Multiple_sclerosis.htm" title="Multiple sclerosis">relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis</a> (MS) in 1992. The scandal centered around President Bartlet&#39;s nondisclosure of his illness to the electorate during the election. He is investigated by an opposition <!--del_lnk--> Congress for defrauding the public and eventually accepted a Congressional <!--del_lnk--> censure. Multiple sclerosis advocacy groups have praised the show for its accurate portrayal of the symptoms of MS and stressing that it is not fatal. The National MS Society commented:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>Following the <a href="../../wp/s/September_11%252C_2001_attacks.htm" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the start of the third season was postponed for a week, as were most American television premieres that year. A script for a special episode was quickly written and began filming on <!--del_lnk--> September 21. The episode &quot;Isaac and Ishmael&quot; aired on <!--del_lnk--> October 3 and addressed the sobering reality of <a href="../../wp/t/Terrorism.htm" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> in America and the wider world, albeit with no specific reference to <!--del_lnk--> September 11. While &quot;Isaac and Ishmael&quot; received mixed critical reviews, it illustrated the show&#39;s flexibility in addressing current events. The episode is not part of <i>The West Wing</i> <!--del_lnk--> continuity.<p>While the September 11th attacks did not occur in <i>The West Wing</i> continuity, the country did enter into a variation of the <!--del_lnk--> War on Terrorism. The war began in the show&#39;s third season, when a plot to blow up the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Gate Bridge was uncovered; in response, the President ordered the assassination of terrorist leader Abdul Shareef. At the end of the fourth season, the conflict escalated when <!--del_lnk--> Zoey Bartlet (<!--del_lnk--> Elisabeth Moss), the president&#39;s youngest daughter, was kidnapped by Qumari extremists. The result of this kidnapping was the bombing of Qumar. This storyline drew similarities to the real-world <!--del_lnk--> U.S. invasion of Afghanistan as well as U.S. relations with <a href="../../wp/s/Saudi_Arabia.htm" title="Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, as it brought the Middle East to the forefront of U.S. foreign relations and elevated terrorism as a serious threat in <i>The West Wing</i> universe.<p>In the sixth and seventh seasons, <i>The West Wing</i> explores a leak of top-secret information by a senior staffer at the White House. This leak has been compared to the events surrounding the <!--del_lnk--> Valerie Plame affair. In the storyline, the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Space_Station.htm" title="International Space Station">International Space Station</a> is damaged and can no longer produce <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> for the <!--del_lnk--> astronauts to breathe. With other methods of rescue unavailable, the president is reminded of the existence of a top-secret military space shuttle. Following the president&#39;s inaction, the shuttle story is leaked to a White House reporter, Greg Brock (analogous to <!--del_lnk--> Judith Miller), who prints the story in the <i><!--del_lnk--> New York Times</i>. Brock will not reveal his source and goes to jail for failing to do so, as did Miller. In order to stop the investigation, in which authorities suspect Chief of Staff C.J. Cregg, Toby Ziegler admits to leaking the information, and the President is forced to dismiss him. In comparison, the Plame affair is still under investigation, but charges have been brought against <!--del_lnk--> Lewis Libby, the vice president&#39;s chief of staff, who has since resigned. Richard Armitage, an official in the Bush State Department, has also acknowledged leaking information to reporters.<p>Other issues explored in <i>The West Wing</i> include:<ul>

      <p>All contemporary domestic government officials in The West Wing universe have been fictional. President Bartlet has made three appointments to the fictional Supreme Court and maintains a full cabinet, although the names and terms of all members have not been revealed. Some cabinet members, such as the <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of Defense, appear more often than others. Many other government officials, such as mayors, governors, judges, representatives, and senators, have been mentioned and seen as well.<p><a id="Foreign" name="Foreign"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Foreign</span></h3>
      <p>While several real-world leaders exist in the show&#39;s universe, most foreign countries have fictional rulers.

However, when a peace accord was worked out between <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Palestinian Authority at the start of the show&#39;s sixth season, the <!--del_lnk--> Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was the fictional Nizar Farad, not Arafat.<p>Entire countries are invented as composite pictures that epitomize many of the problems that plague real nations in certain areas of the world. <!--del_lnk--> Qumar, an oil-rich, terrorist-sponsoring <a href="../../wp/m/Middle_East.htm" title="Middle East">Middle Eastern</a> state is repeatedly a source of trouble for the Bartlet administration. According to maps on the show, Qumar appears to consist of a small part of southern <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, including the important <!--del_lnk--> Strait of Hormuz. Elsewhere, <!--del_lnk--> Equatorial Kundu is an <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> nation blighted by <a href="../../wp/a/AIDS.htm" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> and a civil war resembling the 1994 <a href="../../wp/r/Rwandan_Genocide.htm" title="Rwandan genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>.<p><a id="Real_world_events" name="Real_world_events"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Real world events</span></h3>

      <p>The last real president who is known to have existed in the show&#39;s universe is <a href="../../wp/r/Richard_Nixon.htm" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. Presidents who served between Nixon and Bartlet include Democrat D. Wire Newman (<!--del_lnk--> James Cromwell) and Republican Owen Lassiter (now deceased). It was not disclosed whether Newman and Lassiter served directly before President Bartlet. It is clear, however, that Newman (loosely based on <a href="../../wp/j/Jimmy_Carter.htm" title="Jimmy Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>) lost an election to Lassiter (based on <a href="../../wp/r/Ronald_Reagan.htm" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>), who then proceeded to serve for two full terms. In an episode centering around Lassiter&#39;s funeral, Bartlet and Newman were shown to be the only two surviving former Presidents who had served full terms.<p>The passage of time on the show relative to that of the real world has always been somewhat ambiguous when marked by events of smaller duration (e.g., votes, campaigns). Sorkin has noted in a <a href="../../wp/d/DVD.htm" title="DVD">DVD</a> <!--del_lnk--> commentary track for the second season episode &quot;18th and Potomac&quot; that he has tried to avoid tying <i>The West Wing</i> to a specific period of time. Despite this, real years are occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of elections and President Bartlet&#39;s two-term administration.<p>The show&#39;s presidential elections have been held in 2002 and 2006, setting them off by two years from actual presidential elections in the United States (e.g., 1996, 2000, 2004, etc.). The election timeline in <i>The West Wing</i> matched up with that of the real world until the middle of the fifth season, when it appears that a year was lost. For example, the filing deadline for the <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire primary, which would normally fall in January 2006, appeared in an episode airing in January 2005.<p>In interviews, John Wells stated that the series began one and a half years into Bartlet&#39;s first term and that the election to replace Bartlet was being held at the correct time. There is evidence against this claim, which is discussed further in the <!--del_lnk--> main article.<p><a name="1998_presidential_election"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">1998 presidential election</span></h3>
      <p>Bartlet&#39;s first campaign for president is never significantly explored in the series. Bartlet won the election with 48% of the popular vote, 48 million votes, and a 303&ndash;235 margin in the <!--del_lnk--> Electoral College. Bartlet faced three debates with his <!--del_lnk--> Republican opponent. It is mentioned that Bartlet won the third and final debate, which was held on <!--del_lnk--> October 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1998, in <!--del_lnk--> St Louis, <!--del_lnk--> Missouri, and that this helped swing a close election in his favour.<p>The campaign for the Democratic nomination was extensively addressed. In the episodes &quot;In the Shadow of Two Gunmen&quot; and &quot;Bartlet for America&quot;, flashbacks are used to tell how Bartlet defeated Texas Senator <!--del_lnk--> John Hoynes (<!--del_lnk--> Tim Matheson) and <!--del_lnk--> Washington Senator William Wiley for the Democratic nomination. The flashbacks also revealed how Leo McGarry persuaded Bartlet, who was then governor of <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire, to run for president and how Bartlet ultimately selected John Hoynes as his choice as running mate.<p><a name="2002_presidential_election"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2002 presidential election</span></h3>

      <p><i>The West Wing</i>&#39;s 2002 presidential election pitted Bartlet and Vice President John Hoynes against Florida Governor <!--del_lnk--> Robert Ritchie (<!--del_lnk--> James Brolin) and his running mate, Jeff Heston. Bartlet faced no known opposition for renomination, though Democratic Senator Stackhouse did launch a brief independent campaign for the presidency. Ritchie, not originally expected to contend for the nomination, emerged from a field of seven other Republican candidates by appealing to the party&#39;s conservative base with simple, homey sound bites.<p>Bartlet&#39;s staff contemplated replacing Vice President John Hoynes on the ticket with <!--del_lnk--> Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <!--del_lnk--> Admiral <!--del_lnk--> Percy Fitzwallace (<!--del_lnk--> John Amos), among others. After it was clear that Ritchie would be the Republican nominee, Bartlet dismissed the idea, declaring that he wanted Hoynes in the number two spot, &quot;Because I could die.&quot;<p>Throughout the season it was anticipated that the race would be close, but a stellar performance by Bartlet in the sole debate between the candidates gave Bartlet a landslide victory in both the popular and electoral vote.<p><a name="2006_presidential_election"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">2006 presidential election</span></h3>

      <p>A speed-up in <i>The West Wing</i>&#39;s timeline, in part due to the expiration of many cast members&#39; contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs, resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season. The sixth season extensively detailed the Democratic and Republican primaries. The seventh season covers the lead-up to the general election, the election, and the transition to a new administration. The timeline slowed down to concentrate on the general election race. The election, normally held in November, took place across two episodes originally broadcast on <!--del_lnk--> April 2 and <!--del_lnk--> April 9, 2006.<p>Congressman <!--del_lnk--> Matt Santos (D-<!--del_lnk--> TX) was nominated on the fourth ballot at the <!--del_lnk--> Democratic National Convention, staged as the sixth season finale. Santos was planning to leave <a href="../../wp/u/United_States_Congress.htm" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> before being recruited to run for the presidency by Josh Lyman. Santos polled in the low single digits in the <!--del_lnk--> Iowa caucus and was virtually out of the running in the <!--del_lnk--> New Hampshire primary before a last-ditch direct television appeal vaulted him to a third-place finish with 19% of the vote. Following allusions during the Bartlet administration, Josh Lyman, Santos&#39;s campaign manager, convinced Leo McGarry to become Santos&#39;s running mate. However, <!--del_lnk--> John Spencer, the actor portraying Leo McGarry, died on December 16, 2005.<p>Senator <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Vinick (R-<a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">CA</a>) (<!--del_lnk--> Alan Alda) secured the Republican nomination, defeating <!--del_lnk--> Glen Allen Walken (<!--del_lnk--> John Goodman) and the <!--del_lnk--> Reverend <!--del_lnk--> Don Butler (<!--del_lnk--> Don S. Davis), among others. Initially, Vinick wanted Butler to become his running mate. However, Butler did not want to be considered because of Vinick&#39;s stance on <!--del_lnk--> abortion. Instead, <a href="../../wp/w/West_Virginia.htm" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a> Governor <!--del_lnk--> Ray Sullivan (<!--del_lnk--> Brett Cullen) was chosen as Vinick&#39;s running mate. Vinick was portrayed throughout the sixth season as virtually unbeatable because of his popularity in <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>, a typically Democratic state, his moderate views, and his wide crossover appeal. Vinick, however, has faced difficulty with the <!--del_lnk--> pro-life members of his party as a <!--del_lnk--> pro-choice candidate, and criticism for his support of nuclear power following a serious accident at a Californian nuclear power station.<p>On the evening of the election, Leo McGarry suffered a massive <a href="../../wp/m/Myocardial_infarction.htm" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> and was pronounced dead at the hospital, with the polls still open on the <!--del_lnk--> West Coast. The Santos campaign released the information immediately, while <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Vinick refused to use Leo&#39;s death as a &quot;stepstool&quot; to the presidency. Santos emerged as the winner in his home state of <!--del_lnk--> Texas, while Vinick won his home state of <a href="../../wp/c/California.htm" title="California">California</a>. The election came down to <!--del_lnk--> Nevada, where both candidates needed a victory to secure the presidency. Vinick had told his staff repeatedly that he would not allow his campaign to demand a recount of the votes if Santos was declared the winner. Josh Lyman was seen giving Santos the same advice, although the Santos campaign did send a team of lawyers down to Nevada. Matthew Vincente Santos was pronounced the winner of the election, having won Nevada by 30,000 votes, with an electoral margin of 272&ndash;266.<p>Santos organizes his administration, choosing Josh Lyman as Chief of Staff, who in turn called on former colleague Sam Seaborn for Deputy Chief. In need of experienced cabinet members, Santos tapped Arnold Vinick as <!--del_lnk--> Secretary of State, believing the senior statesman to be one of the best strategists available and respected by foreign leaders.<p>President Bartlet&#39;s final act as President of the United States is pardoning Toby Ziegler. The series ends with Bartlet returning to New Hampshire. Having said his goodbyes to his closest staff, former President Bartlet tells President Santos &quot;Make me proud, Mr. President&quot;, to which Santos responds, &quot;I&#39;ll do my best, Mr. President.&quot;<p>According to executive producer Lawrence O&#39;Donnell, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided that the last episodes would be rescripted by <!--del_lnk--> John Wells, executive producer of <i><!--del_lnk--> ER</i> and <i>The West Wing.</i><div class="notice metadata spoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>
