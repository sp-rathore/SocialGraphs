      <p><b>Topology</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>topos</i>, &quot;place,&quot; and <i>logos</i>, &quot;study&quot;) is a branch of <a href="../../wp/m/Mathematics.htm" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> that is an extension of <a href="../../wp/g/Geometry.htm" title="Geometry">geometry</a>. Topology begins with a consideration of the nature of space, investigating both its fine structure and its global structure. Topology builds on <!--del_lnk--> set theory, considering both sets of points and families of sets.<p>The word <i>topology</i> is used both for the area of study and for a family of sets with certain properties described below. Of particular importance in the study of topology are <!--del_lnk--> functions or maps that are <i><!--del_lnk--> homeomorphisms</i>. Informally, these functions can be thought of as those that stretch space without tearing it apart or sticking distinct parts together.<p>When the discipline was first properly founded, toward the end of the <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th century</a>, it was called <i>geometria situs</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>geometry of place</i>) and <i>analysis situs</i> (<a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>analysis of place</i>). From around 1925 to 1975 it was an important growth area within mathematics.<p>Topology is a large branch of mathematics that includes many subfields. The most basic division within topology is into <!--del_lnk--> point-set topology, which investigates such concepts as <!--del_lnk--> compactness, <!--del_lnk--> connectedness, <!--del_lnk--> countability, and <!--del_lnk--> algebraic topology, which investigates such concepts as <!--del_lnk--> homotopy, <!--del_lnk--> homology, and <!--del_lnk--> knot theory.<p>See also: <!--del_lnk--> topology glossary for definitions of some of the terms used in topology; <!--del_lnk--> topological space for a more technical treatment of the subject.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>The branch of mathematics now called topology began with the investigation of certain questions in geometry. <a href="../../wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm" title="Leonhard Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1736 paper on <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg</i> is regarded as one of the first topological results.<p>The term &quot;topologie&quot; was introduced in German in 1847 by <!--del_lnk--> Johann Benedict Listing in <i>Vorstudien zur Topologie</i>, Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, G&ouml;ttingen, pp. 67, 1848. However, Listing had already used the word for ten years in correspondence. &quot;Topology&quot;, its English form, was introduced in 1883 in the journal <!--del_lnk--> <i>Nature</i> to distinguish &quot;qualitative geometry from the ordinary geometry in which quantitative relations chiefly are treated&quot;. The term <b>topologist</b> in the sense of a specialist in topology was used in 1905 in the magazine <i><!--del_lnk--> Spectator</i>.<p>Modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of <!--del_lnk--> set theory, developed by <a href="../../wp/g/Georg_Cantor.htm" title="Georg Cantor">Georg Cantor</a> in the later part of the 19th century. Cantor, in addition to setting down the basic ideas of set theory, considered point sets in <!--del_lnk--> Euclidean space, as part of his study of <!--del_lnk--> Fourier series.<p><!--del_lnk--> Henri Poincar&eacute; published <i><!--del_lnk--> Analysis Situs</i> in 1895, introducing the concepts of <!--del_lnk--> homotopy and <!--del_lnk--> homology, which are now considered part of algebraic topology.<p><!--del_lnk--> Maurice Fr&eacute;chet, unifying the work on function spaces of Cantor, <!--del_lnk--> Volterra, <!--del_lnk--> Arzel&agrave;, <!--del_lnk--> Hadamard, Ascoli and others, introduced the <!--del_lnk--> metric space in 1906. A metric space is now considered a special case of a general topological space. In 1914, <!--del_lnk--> Felix Hausdorff coined the term &quot;topological space&quot; and gave the definition for what is now called a <!--del_lnk--> Hausdorff space. In current usage, a topological space is a slight generalization of Hausdorff spaces, given in 1922 by <!--del_lnk--> Kazimierz Kuratowski.<p>For further developments, see <!--del_lnk--> point-set topology and <!--del_lnk--> algebraic topology.<p><a id="Elementary_introduction" name="Elementary_introduction"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Elementary introduction</span></h2>

      <p>Topological spaces show up naturally in almost every branch of mathematics. This has made topology one of the great unifying ideas of mathematics. <i><!--del_lnk--> General topology</i>, or <i><!--del_lnk--> point-set topology</i>, defines and studies properties of spaces and maps such as <!--del_lnk--> connectedness, <!--del_lnk--> compactness and <!--del_lnk--> continuity. <i><!--del_lnk--> Algebraic topology</i> uses structures from <!--del_lnk--> abstract algebra, especially the <a href="../../wp/g/Group_%2528mathematics%2529.htm" title="Group (mathematics)">group</a> to study topological spaces and the maps between them.<p>The motivating insight behind topology is that some geometric problems depend not on the exact shape of the objects involved, but rather on the way they are put together. For example, the square and the circle have many properties in common: they are both one dimensional objects (from a topological point of view) and both separate the plane into two parts, the part inside and the part outside.<p>One of the first papers in topology was the demonstration, by <a href="../../wp/l/Leonhard_Euler.htm" title="Leonhard Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, that it was impossible to find a route through the town of K&ouml;nigsberg (now <!--del_lnk--> Kaliningrad) that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. This result did not depend on the lengths of the bridges, nor on their distance from one another, but only on connectivity properties: which bridges are connected to which islands or riverbanks. This problem, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Seven Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg</i>, is now a famous problem in introductory mathematics, and led to the branch of mathematics known as <!--del_lnk--> graph theory.<p>Similarly, the <!--del_lnk--> hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology says that &quot;one cannot comb the hair on a ball smooth&quot;. This fact is immediately convincing to most people, even though they might not recognize the more formal statement of the theorem, that there is no nonvanishing <!--del_lnk--> continuous <!--del_lnk--> tangent vector <!--del_lnk--> field on the <a href="../../wp/s/Sphere.htm" title="Sphere">sphere</a>. As with the <i>Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg</i>, the result does not depend on the exact shape of the sphere; it applies to pear shapes and in fact any kind of blob (subject to certain conditions on the smoothness of the surface), as long as it has no holes.<p>In order to deal with these problems that do not rely on the exact shape of the objects, one must be clear about just what properties these problems <i>do</i> rely on. From this need arises the notion of <i>topological equivalence</i>. The impossibility of crossing each bridge just once applies to any arrangement of bridges topologically equivalent to those in K&ouml;nigsberg, and the hairy ball theorem applies to any space topologically equivalent to a sphere.<p>Intuitively, two spaces are topologically equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist can&#39;t tell the <!--del_lnk--> coffee mug out of which she is drinking from the <!--del_lnk--> doughnut she is eating, since a sufficiently pliable donut could be reshaped to the form of a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.<p>A simple introductory exercise is to classify the lowercase letters of the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_alphabet.htm" title="Latin alphabet">English alphabet</a> according to topological equivalence. (The lines of the letters are assumed to have non-zero width.) In most fonts in modern use, there is a class {a, b,d, e,o, p,q} of letters with one hole, a class {c, f,h, k,l, m,n, r,s, t,u, v,w, x,y, z} of letters without a hole, and a class {i, j} of letters consisting of two pieces. g may either belong in the class with one hole, or (in some fonts) it may be the sole element of a class of letters with two holes, depending on whether or not the tail is closed. For a more complicated exercise, it may be assumed that the lines have zero width; one can get several different classifications depending on which font is used. Letter topology is of practical relevance in stencil typography: The font <!--del_lnk--> Braggadocio, for instance, can be cut out of a plane without falling apart.<p><a id="Mathematical_definition" name="Mathematical_definition"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Mathematical definition</span></h2>

      <p>Let <b>X</b> be any set and let <i><b>T</b></i> be a family of subsets of <b>X</b>. Then <i><b>T</b></i> is a <b>topology</b> on <b>X</b> if<ol>
       <li>Both the empty set and <b>X</b> are elements of <i><b>T</b></i>.<li>Any union of elements of <i><b>T</b></i> is an element of <i><b>T</b></i>.<li>Any intersection of finitely many elements of <i><b>T</b></i> is an element of <i><b>T</b></i>.</ol>
      <p>If <i><b>T</b></i> is a topology on <b>X</b>, then <b>X</b> together with <i><b>T</b></i> is called a <b>topological space</b>.<p>A set in <i><b>T</b></i> is called <b>open</b>. The complement of a set in <i><b>T</b></i> is called <b>closed</b>. If neither a set nor its complement is in <i><b>T</b></i>, then the set is neither open nor closed.<p>A <!--del_lnk--> function or map from one topological space to another is called <b>continuous</b> if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the <!--del_lnk--> real numbers to the real numbers, then this definition of continuous is equivalent to the definition of continuous in <a href="../../wp/c/Calculus.htm" title="Calculus">calculus</a>. If a continuous function is <!--del_lnk--> one-to-one and <!--del_lnk--> onto and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a <!--del_lnk--> homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered to be topologically the same. The square and the circle are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.<p><a id="Some_theorems_in_general_topology" name="Some_theorems_in_general_topology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Some theorems in general topology</span></h2>

      <p>Occasionally, one needs to use the tools of topology but a &quot;set of points&quot; is not available.
