      <p>Tigers are the heaviest cats found in the wild. Although different subspecies of tiger have different characteristics, in general male tigers weigh between 200 and 320&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilograms (440 and 700&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> lb) and females between 120 and 181&nbsp;kg (265 and 400&nbsp;lb). On average, males are between 2.6 and 3.3&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (8&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in to 10&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in) in length, and females are between 2.3 and 2.75 metres (7&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in and 9&nbsp;ft) in length. Of the living subspecies, <!--del_lnk--> Sumatran tigers are the smallest, and <!--del_lnk--> Amur (or Siberian) tigers are the largest.<p>Most tigers have orange coats, a fair (whitish) medial and ventral area and stripes that vary from brown or hay to pure black. The form and density of stripes differs between subspecies, but most tigers have in excess of 100 stripes. The now-extinct <!--del_lnk--> Javan tiger may have had far more than this. The pattern of stripes is unique to each animal, and thus could potentially be used to identify individuals, much in the same way as <!--del_lnk--> fingerprints are used to identify people. This is not, however, a preferred method of identification, due to the difficulty of recording the stripe pattern of a wild tiger. It seems likely that the function of stripes is <!--del_lnk--> camouflage, serving to hide these animals from their prey. The stripe pattern is found on a tiger&#39;s skin and if shaved, its distinctive camouflage pattern would be preserved.<p>Like most cats, tigers are believed to have some degree of <!--del_lnk--> colour vision.<p>There is a well-known mutation that produces the <!--del_lnk--> white tiger, an animal which is rare in the wild, but widely bred in zoos due to its popularity. The white tiger is not a separate sub-species, but only a colour variation. There are also unconfirmed reports of a <!--del_lnk--> &quot;blue&quot; or slate-coloured tiger, and largely or totally <!--del_lnk--> black tigers, and these are assumed, if real, to be intermittent mutations rather than distinct species. Similar to the lion, the tiger has the ability to roar.<p><a id="Hunting_methods" name="Hunting_methods"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Hunting methods</span></h2>

      <p>Most tigers live in forests or grasslands, for which their camouflage is ideally suited, and where it is easy to hunt prey that are faster or more agile. Among the big cats, only the tiger and <!--del_lnk--> jaguar are strong <!--del_lnk--> swimmers; tigers are often found bathing in <a href="../../wp/p/Pond.htm" title="Pond">ponds</a>, <!--del_lnk--> lakes, and <a href="../../wp/r/River.htm" title="River">rivers</a> and are known to kill while swimming. Tigers hunt alone and eat primarily medium to large sized <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a> such as <!--del_lnk--> sambar deer, but they also have the capability to eat much smaller prey such as birds, and other such things, <!--del_lnk--> wild pigs, young <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">gaur</a>, <!--del_lnk--> water buffalo and domestic <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a>. They also kill such formidable predators as <!--del_lnk--> sloth bear, <a href="../../wp/d/Dog.htm" title="Dog">dogs</a>, <!--del_lnk--> leopards, <!--del_lnk--> crocodiles and <!--del_lnk--> pythons as prey, and occasionally prey on creatures as small as <!--del_lnk--> langurs, <!--del_lnk--> peacocks and <!--del_lnk--> hares. Old and injured tigers have been known to attack <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> or domestic cattle and are then termed as man-eaters or cattle-lifters which often leads to them being captured, shot or poisoned.<p>Adult <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephants</a> are too dangerous to tigers to serve as common prey, but conflicts between elephants and tigers do sometimes take place.<p>Tigers often ambush their prey as other cats do, overpowering their prey from any angle, using their body size and strength to knock prey off balance. Even with great masses, Tigers can reach speeds of about 60&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h (37&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph). Once prone, the tiger bites the back of the neck, often breaking the prey&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> spinal cord, piercing the <!--del_lnk--> windpipe, or severing the <!--del_lnk--> jugular vein or <!--del_lnk--> carotid artery. Tigers prefer to bite the throats of large prey. After biting, the tiger then uses its muscled forelimbs to hold onto the prey, bringing it to the ground. The tiger remains latched onto the neck until its prey dies.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Sundarbans mangrove swamps of <!--del_lnk--> Bengal have had a higher incidence of man-eaters, where some healthy tigers have been known to hunt humans as prey.<p>In the wild, tigers can leap as high as 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) and as far as 9-10&nbsp;m (30-33&nbsp;ft), making them one of the highest-jumping mammals (just slightly behind <!--del_lnk--> cougars in jumping ability).<p>They have been reported to carry domestic livestock weighing 50&nbsp;kg (110&nbsp;lb) while easily jumping over fences 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) high. Their heavily muscled forelimbs are used to hold tightly onto the prey and to avoid being dislodged, especially by large prey such as gaurs. <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">Gaurs</a> and <a href="../../wp/w/Water_Buffalo.htm" title="Water Buffalo">water buffalo</a> weighing over a ton have been killed by tigers weighing about a sixth as much. A single blow from a tiger&#39;s paw can kill a full-grown <!--del_lnk--> wolf or <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">human</a>, or can heavily injure a 150&nbsp;kg (330&nbsp;lb) <!--del_lnk--> Sambar deer.<p><a id="Biology_and_ecology" name="Biology_and_ecology"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Biology and ecology</span></h2>
      <p>Adult tigers are territorial and fiercely defensive. A tigress may have a territory of 20&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km&sup2; while the territories of males are much larger, covering 60-100&nbsp;km&sup2;. Male territories may overlap those of many females, but males are intolerant of other males within their territory. Because of their aggressive nature, territorial disputes are violent and often end in the death of one of the males. Males will fight other males for territory. To identify his territory the male marks trees by <!--del_lnk--> spraying urine and anal gland secretions on trees as well as by marking trails with <!--del_lnk--> scat. Males show a behaviour called <!--del_lnk--> flehmen, a grimacing face, when identifying a female&#39;s reproductive condition by sniffing their urine markings.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A female is only receptive for a few days and mating is frequent during that time period. A pair will copulate frequently and noisily, like other cats. The gestation period is 103 days and 3&ndash;4 cubs of about 1&nbsp;kg (2&nbsp;lb) each are born. The females rear them alone. Wandering male tigers may kill cubs to make the female receptive. At 8 weeks, the cubs are ready to follow their mother out of the den. The cubs become independent around 18 months of age, but it is not until they are around 2&ndash;2&frac12; years old that they leave their mother. The cubs reach sexual maturity by 3&ndash;4 years of age. The female tigers generally own territory near their mother, while males tend to wander in search of territory, which they acquire by fighting and eliminating a territorial male. Over the course of her life, a female tiger will give birth to an approximately equal number of male and female cubs. Tigers breed well in captivity, and the captive population in the United States may rival the wild population of the world.<p>In the wild, tigers mostly feed on deer, <!--del_lnk--> wild boar, and wild <a href="../../wp/c/Cattle.htm" title="Cattle">cattle</a>, including <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">gaur</a> and <!--del_lnk--> water buffaloes, young <!--del_lnk--> rhinos and young <!--del_lnk--> elephants, and sometimes, even <!--del_lnk--> leopards and <a href="../../wp/b/Bear.htm" title="Bear">bears</a>. Tigers have been known to kill crocodiles on occasion,  although predation is rare and the predators typically avoid one another. <!--del_lnk--> Siberian tigers and <!--del_lnk--> brown bears are a serious threat to each other and both tend to avoid each other. Statistically though, the Siberian tiger has been the more successful in battles between the two animals because bears taken by tigers are often smaller sized bears, however tigers can and do kill larger brown bears. Even female tigers, which are considerably smaller than male tigers, are capable of taking down and killing adult gaurs by themselves. <!--del_lnk--> Sambar, <!--del_lnk--> wild boar and <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">gaur</a> are the tiger&#39;s favoured prey in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>. Young elephant and rhino calves are occasionally taken when they are left unprotected by their herds. A case where a tiger killed an adult female Indian rhino has been observed. <p>Tigers prefer large prey such as <!--del_lnk--> sambar, <a href="../../wp/g/Gaur.htm" title="Gaur">gaur</a> and wild <!--del_lnk--> water buffalo because they provide more meat and last for many days, avoiding the need for another hunt. In all of their range, tigers are the top predators and do not compete with other carnivores other than the <!--del_lnk--> dhole or Indian wild dog, which makes up for its relative lack of strength by numbers. They do not prey on large animals such as adult elephants and rhinos, although they will prey on their young whenever they have an opportunity. However, a desperate tiger will attack anything it regards as potential food, including humans.<p>Tigers have been studied in the wild using a variety of techniques. The populations of tigers were estimated in the past using plaster casts of their <!--del_lnk--> pugmarks. In recent times, camera trapping has been used instead. Newer techniques based on <a href="../../wp/d/DNA.htm" title="DNA">DNA</a> from their scat are also being evaluated. Radio collaring has also been a popular approach to tracking them for study in the wild.<p><a id="Extinction_risk" name="Extinction_risk"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Extinction risk</span></h3>

      <p><a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">Humans</a> are the tiger&#39;s most significant predator, as tigers are often poached illegally for their <!--del_lnk--> fur. Also, their bones and nearly all body parts are used in <!--del_lnk--> traditional Chinese medicine for a range of purported uses including pain killers and <!--del_lnk--> aphrodisiacs. <!--del_lnk--> Poaching for fur and destruction of <!--del_lnk--> habitat have greatly reduced tiger populations in the wild. A century ago, it is estimated there were over 100,000 tigers in the world; now numbers are down to below 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals.<p>At the <!--del_lnk--> Kalachakra <!--del_lnk--> Tibetan Buddhist festival in south India in January 2006 the <a href="../../wp/t/Tenzin_Gyatso%252C_14th_Dalai_Lama.htm" title="Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a> preached a ruling against using, selling, or buying wild animals, their products, or derivatives. The result when Tibetan pilgrims returned to Tibet afterwards was much destruction by Tibetans of their wild animal skins including tiger and <!--del_lnk--> leopard skins used as ornamental garments. Time will show whether this causes a thankfully needed long-term slump in the demand for poached tiger and leopard skins. <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk-->  <!--del_lnk--> <p><a id="Subspecies" name="Subspecies"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Subspecies</span></h2>
      <p>There are nine <!--del_lnk--> subspecies of tiger, three of which are <!--del_lnk--> extinct and one of which is almost certain to become <!--del_lnk--> extinct in the near future. Their historical range (severely diminished today) ran through <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <!--del_lnk--> India, <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a> and <!--del_lnk--> south-east Asia, including the <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesian islands</a>.

       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Bengal tiger</b> or the <b>Royal Bengal tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris tigris</i>) is found in parts of <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bangladesh.htm" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="../../wp/n/Nepal.htm" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="../../wp/b/Bhutan.htm" title="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>, and <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>. It lives in varied habitats - grasslands, subtropical and tropical rainforests, scrub forests, wet and dry deciduous forests and mangroves. The Indian government&#39;s estimated population figure for these tigers is between 3,100 and 4,500, some 3,000 of which are found in India alone. However, many Indian tiger conservationists doubt this number, seeing it as overly optimistic. The number of Bengal tigers in India may be fewer than 2,000, as most of the collected statistics are based on pugmark identification, which often gives a biased result. Even though this is the most &#39;common&#39; tiger, these tigers are under severe pressure from both habitat destruction and poaching. In <!--del_lnk--> 1972, India launched a massive wildlife conservation project, known as <!--del_lnk--> Project Tiger, to protect the depleting numbers of tigers in India. The project helped increase the population of these tigers from 1,200 in the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s to 3,000 in the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s and is considered as one of the most successful wildlife conservation programs. At least one Tiger Reserve (<!--del_lnk--> Sariska) has lost its entire tiger population to poaching. Male Bengal tigers range anywhere from 200 to 295&nbsp;kg (440-650&nbsp;lb) and females range between 120-180&nbsp;kg (264-400&nbsp;lb). Males in the wild usually weigh 205 to 227&nbsp;kg (450-500&nbsp;lb), while the average female will weigh about 140&nbsp;kg (310&nbsp;lb). However, the northern Indian and the Nepalese Bengal tigers are considerably bulkier than those found in other places, with recorded instances of shot males that weighed more than 300&nbsp;kg (660&nbsp;lb). One large male killed in Nepal in 1942 weighed 320&nbsp;kg (706&nbsp;lb), while another, killed in 1910 in India, weighed 317&nbsp;kg (700&nbsp;lb). The largest Bengal tiger ever shot was a male 3.3&nbsp;m (11&nbsp;ft) in total length and weighed close to 390&nbsp;kg (857&nbsp;lb); this giant was killed in 1967.</ul>

       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Indochinese tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris corbetti</i>), also called <i>Corbett&#39;s</i> tiger, is found in <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, China, <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Burma">Burma</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Estimates of its population vary between 1,200 to 1,800, but it seems likely that the number is in the lower part of the range. The largest current population is in Malaysia, where illegal <!--del_lnk--> poaching is strictly controlled, but all existing populations are at extreme risk from <!--del_lnk--> habitat fragmentation and <!--del_lnk--> inbreeding. In Vietnam, almost three-quarters of the tigers killed provide stock for Chinese pharmacies. Also, the tigers are seen by poor natives as a resource through which they can ease <a href="../../wp/p/Poverty.htm" title="Poverty">poverty</a>. Indochinese tigers are smaller and darker than Bengal tigers. Males weigh from 150-190&nbsp;kg (330-420&nbsp;lb) on average while females are smaller at 110-140&nbsp;kg (242-308&nbsp;lb).</ul>

       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Malayan tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris jacksoni</i>), exclusively found in the southern (<a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysian</a>) part of the <!--del_lnk--> Malay Peninsula, was not considered a subspecies in its own right until 2004. The new classification came about after a study by Luo et al. from the <!--del_lnk--> Laboratory of Genomic Diversity Study, part of the <!--del_lnk--> National Cancer Institute of the United States. Recent counts showed there are 600-800 tigers in the wild, making it the third largest tiger population behind the Bengal tiger and the Indochinese tiger. The Malayan tiger is a national icon in Malaysia, appearing on its <!--del_lnk--> coat of arms and in logos of Malaysian institutions, such as <!--del_lnk--> Maybank.</ul>

       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Sumatran tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris sumatrae</i>) is found only on the Indonesian island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. The wild population is estimated at between 400 and 500, seen chiefly in the island&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> national parks. Recent genetic testing has revealed the presence of unique genetic markers, indicating that it may develop into a separate species, if it is not made extinct. This has led to suggestions that Sumatran tigers should have greater priority for conservation than any other subspecies. <!--del_lnk--> Habitat destruction is the main threat to the existing tiger population (logging continues even in the supposedly protected national parks), but 66 tigers were recorded as being shot and killed between 1998 and 2000, or nearly 20% of the total population. The Sumatran tiger is the smallest of all living tiger subspecies. Adult males weigh between 100-130&nbsp;kg (220-286&nbsp;lb), females 70-90&nbsp;kg (154-198&nbsp;lb). Their small size is an adaptation to the thick, dense forests of the Sumatra island where they reside, as well as the smaller-sized prey. On <!--del_lnk--> February 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2007 a pregnant Sumatran Tiger was caught by people from Rokan Hilir village at Riau province. Indonesian fauna conservation officials are planning to transfer her to the <!--del_lnk--> Bogor Safari Park in <!--del_lnk--> Java.</ul>

       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> Amur tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris altaica</i>), also known as the <i>Siberian</i>, <i>Manchurian</i> or <i>North China</i> tiger, is confined completely to the <a href="../../wp/a/Amur.htm" title="Amur">Amur</a> region in far eastern <!--del_lnk--> Siberia, where it is now protected. The last two censuses (1996 and 2005) found 450-500 Amur tigers within their single and more or less continuous range making it one of the largest undivided tiger populations in the world. Considered the largest subspecies, with the exception of the northern Indian and the Nepalese Bengal tigers, the largest wild Amur tiger on record weighed 384&nbsp;kg (845&nbsp;lb), while two captive ones weighed 465&nbsp;kg (1025&nbsp;lb) and 423&nbsp;kg (932&nbsp;lb). Some Bengal tigers can grow to the same length as Amur tigers. Weights can vary substantially depending on whether the tiger has been fully fed or has an empty belly. The average weight of a male Amur tiger is around 227&nbsp;kg (500&nbsp;lb), but they can be anywhere from 205 to 364&nbsp;kg (450-800&nbsp;lb). The Amur tiger is also noted for its thick coat, distinguished by a paler golden hue and a smaller number of stripes. The Amur tiger is the largest and heaviest of all living felines. A six-month old Amur tiger can be as big as a fully grown <!--del_lnk--> leopard.</ul>

      <ul>
       <li>The <b><!--del_lnk--> South China tiger</b> (<i>Panthera tigris amoyensis</i>), also known as the <i>Amoy</i> or <i>Xiamen</i> tiger, is the most critically endangered subspecies of tiger and will almost certainly become extinct. It is also considered to be the first of all tiger subspecies. This subspecies is one of the smallest tiger species. The length of the South China tiger ranges from 2.2-2.6&nbsp;m (87-104&nbsp;in) for both males and females. Males weigh between 127 and 177&nbsp;kg (280-390&nbsp;lb) while females weigh between 100 and 118&nbsp;kg (220-260&nbsp;lb). It seems likely that the last known wild South China tiger was shot and killed in <!--del_lnk--> 1994, and no live tigers have been seen in their natural habitat for the last 20 years. In 1977, the Chinese government passed a law banning the killing of wild tigers, but this appears to have been too late to save the subspecies. There are currently 59 known captive South China tigers, all within China, but these are known to be descended from only six animals. Thus, the <!--del_lnk--> genetic diversity required to maintain the subspecies no longer exists, making its eventual extinction very likely. Currently, there are breeding efforts to reintroduce these tigers to the wild by 2008.</ul>

      <p>Tigers are uncommon in the fossil record. The distinct fossils of tigers were discovered in <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene deposits &ndash; mostly in Asia. Nevertheless, tiger fossils 100,000 years old have been found in <!--del_lnk--> Alaska. Possibly because of a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska during the ice ages, this Alaskan tiger might have been a North American population of Siberian tiger. In addition, some scientists have discovered similarities between tiger bones and those of the <!--del_lnk--> American lion, an extinct big cat that dominated much of North America as recently as 10,000 years ago. Some have used these observations to conclude that the American lion was a New World tiger species.<p>Tiger fossils have also turned up in <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a>. These fossils indicate that the Japanese tiger was no bigger than the island subspecies of tigers of recent ages. This may be due to the phenomenon in which body size is related to environmental space (see <!--del_lnk--> island dwarfism), or in the case of a large predator like a tiger, availability of prey.<div class="thumb tright">
