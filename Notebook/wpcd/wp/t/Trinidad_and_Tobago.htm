      <p>The <b>Republic of Trinidad and Tobago</b> is an <!--del_lnk--> archipelagic <!--del_lnk--> state in the southern <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean, lying northeast of the <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South American</a> nation of <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> and south of <a href="../../wp/g/Grenada.htm" title="Grenada">Grenada</a> in the <!--del_lnk--> Lesser Antilles. It also shares maritime boundaries with <a href="../../wp/b/Barbados.htm" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> to the northeast and <a href="../../wp/g/Guyana.htm" title="Guyana">Guyana</a> to the southeast. The country covers an area of 5,128 <!--del_lnk--> square kilometres (1,979&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> sq&nbsp;mi) and consists of two main islands, <b><!--del_lnk--> Trinidad</b> and <b><!--del_lnk--> Tobago</b>, and <!--del_lnk--> 21 smaller islands. Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the main islands; Tobago is much smaller, comprising about 6% of the total area and 4% of the population.<p>Originally settled by <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians of South American origin at least 7,000 years ago, Trinidad and Tobago was occupied by <!--del_lnk--> Arawakan- and <!--del_lnk--> Cariban-speaking peoples at the time of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">European</a> contact in 1498. A history of <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slavery</a> and <!--del_lnk--> indentureship has left the country with a mixture of <!--del_lnk--> African, <!--del_lnk--> Indian, <!--del_lnk--> mixed-race, <!--del_lnk--> European, Middle Eastern and <!--del_lnk--> Chinese people. All these groups have left an imprint on the national culture. Trinidad and Tobago became independent nation in 1962 and a republic in 1976.<p>Officially Trinidadians or Tobagonians, people from Trinidad and Tobago the people are often informally referred to as <i>Trinbagonians</i> or <i><!--del_lnk--> Trinis</i>. Unlike most of the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago is a primarily industrialised country whose economy is based on <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> and <!--del_lnk--> petrochemicals. Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its pre-<!--del_lnk--> Lenten <!--del_lnk--> Carnival and as the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> steelpan, <!--del_lnk--> calypso and <!--del_lnk--> limbo.<p>The capital city <!--del_lnk--> Port of Spain, is currently a leading candidate (along with <!--del_lnk--> Miami) to serve as the headquarters of the Permanent Secretariat of the <!--del_lnk--> Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA-ALCA).<p>

      <p>Both Trinidad and Tobago were originally settled by <!--del_lnk--> Amerindians of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South American</a> origin. Trinidad was first settled by pre-agricultural Archaic people at least 7,000 years ago, making it the earliest-settled part of the Caribbean. Ceramic-using agriculturalists settled Trinidad around <!--del_lnk--> 250 BCE and then moved further up the Lesser Antillean chain. At the time of <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="European">European</a> contact Trinidad was occupied by various <!--del_lnk--> Arawakan- and <!--del_lnk--> Cariban-speaking tribes including the Nepoya, Suppoya and Yao, while Tobago was occupied by the <!--del_lnk--> Island Caribs and <!--del_lnk--> Galibi. The Amerindian name for Trinidad was <!--del_lnk--> Kairi or <!--del_lnk--> Iere which is usually translated as <i>The Land of the <!--del_lnk--> Hummingbird</i>, although others have reported that it simply meant <i>island</i>. <a href="../../wp/c/Christopher_Columbus.htm" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> encountered the island of Trinidad on <!--del_lnk--> July 31, <!--del_lnk--> 1498 and named it after the <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity.htm" title="Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>. Columbus reported seeing Tobago, which he named <i>Bella Forma</i>, but did not land on the island. The name Tobago is probably derived from <a href="../../wp/t/Tobacco.htm" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>.<p>The <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spanish</a> established a presence in Trinidad, but due to a lack of settlers, eventually allowed any <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic European to settle on the island, leading to substantial immigration from France and elsewhere. Meanwhile, Tobago changed hands between <!--del_lnk--> British, <!--del_lnk--> French, <!--del_lnk--> Dutch and <!--del_lnk--> Courlanders. Britain consolidated its hold on both islands during the <a href="../../wp/n/Napoleonic_Wars.htm" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and they were combined into the <!--del_lnk--> colony of Trinidad and Tobago in <!--del_lnk--> 1899. As a result of these colonial struggles Amerindian, Spanish, French and English <!--del_lnk--> place names are all common in the country. <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">African</a> slaves and <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a>, and free African <!--del_lnk--> indentured labourers arrived to supply labour in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Emigration from <a href="../../wp/b/Barbados.htm" title="Barbados">Barbados</a> and the other Lesser Antilles, <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, and <a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> also impacted on the ethnic make-up of the country.<p>Although originally a <!--del_lnk--> sugar colony, <!--del_lnk--> cacao dominated the economy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. After the collapse of the cacao crop (due to disease and the <!--del_lnk--> Great Depression) <a href="../../wp/p/Petroleum.htm" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> increasingly came to dominate the economy. The Depression and the rise of the oil economy led to changes in the social structure.<p>The presence of <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> military bases in <!--del_lnk--> Chaguaramas and <!--del_lnk--> Cumuto in Trinidad during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a> profoundly changed the character of society. In the post-war period, the wave of <!--del_lnk--> decolonisation that swept the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> led to the formation of the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies Federation in <!--del_lnk--> 1958 as a vehicle for independence. Chaguaramas was the proposed site for the federal capital. The Federation dissolved after the withdrawal of <a href="../../wp/j/Jamaica.htm" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, and Trinidad and Tobago elected for independence in <!--del_lnk--> 1962.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1976 the country severed its links with the <a href="../../wp/b/British_monarchy.htm" title="British monarchy">British monarchy</a> and became a <!--del_lnk--> republic within the <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth.<p>In 1990, 114 members of the <!--del_lnk--> Jamaat al Muslimeen, led by <!--del_lnk--> Yasin Abu Bakr, stormed the <!--del_lnk--> Red House (the seat of <!--del_lnk--> Parliament), and <!--del_lnk--> Trinidad and Tobago Television, the only television station in the country at the time, and held the country&#39;s government hostage for six days before surrendering (<i>see <!--del_lnk--> Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt</i>).<p>Petroleum, petrochemicals and <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> continue to be the backbone of the economy. Tourism is the mainstay of the economy of Tobago, and the island remains a favorite destination for many European tourists. Trinidad and Tobago is one of the most prosperous nations in the Caribbean, although less so than it was during the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> oil boom&quot; between <!--del_lnk--> 1973 and <!--del_lnk--> 1983. Recently, economic turmoil has caused an increase in violence and political instability.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>Trinidad and Tobago is a <a href="../../wp/l/Liberal_democracy.htm" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> with a <!--del_lnk--> two-party system and a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral parliamentary system based on the <a href="../../wp/w/Westminster_System.htm" title="Westminster System">Westminster System</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Head of State of Trinidad and Tobago is the <!--del_lnk--> President, currently <!--del_lnk--> Professor Emeritus <!--del_lnk--> George Maxwell Richards. The <!--del_lnk--> Head of Government is the <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister. The President is elected by an <!--del_lnk--> Electoral College consisting of the full membership of both houses of <!--del_lnk--> Parliament. The <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister is appointed by the <!--del_lnk--> President. The President is required to appoint the leader of the party who in his opinion has the most support of the members of the House of Representatives to this post; this has generally been the leader of the party which won the most seats in the previous election (except in the case of the <!--del_lnk--> 2001 General Elections).<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Parliament consists of two chambers, the <!--del_lnk--> Senate (31 seats) and the <!--del_lnk--> House of Representatives (36 seats, will increase to 41 seats after the next election). The members of the Senate are appointed by the president. Sixteen Government Senators are appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister, six Opposition Senators are appointed on the advice of the Leader of the Opposition and nine Independent Senators are appointed by the President to represent other sectors of civil society. The 36 members of the House of Representatives are elected by the people for a maximum term of five years.<p>Since <!--del_lnk--> December 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2001, the governing party has been the <!--del_lnk--> People&#39;s National Movement led by <!--del_lnk--> Patrick Manning; the <!--del_lnk--> Opposition party is the <!--del_lnk--> United National Congress led by <!--del_lnk--> Kamla Persad-Bissessar (<!--del_lnk--> Leader of the Opposition).<p>Trinidad and Tobago is a leading member of the <!--del_lnk--> Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the <!--del_lnk--> CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME).

      <p>Trinidad and Tobago are southeasterly islands of the <!--del_lnk--> Antilles or <!--del_lnk--> West Indies, situated between 10&deg; 2&#39; and 11&deg; 12&#39; N <!--del_lnk--> latitude and 60&deg; 30&#39; and 61&deg; 56&#39; W <!--del_lnk--> longitude. At the closest point, Trinidad is just 11&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> kilometres (7&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> miles) off the <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuelan</a> coast. Covering an area of 5,128&nbsp;square kilometres (1,979&nbsp;sq mi), the country consists of the two main islands, <!--del_lnk--> Trinidad and <!--del_lnk--> Tobago, and <!--del_lnk--> 21 smaller islands &ndash; including <!--del_lnk--> Chacachacare, <!--del_lnk--> Monos, <!--del_lnk--> Huevos, <!--del_lnk--> Gaspar Grande (or Gasparee), <!--del_lnk--> Little Tobago, and <!--del_lnk--> St. Giles Island. Trinidad is 4,768 square kilometres (1,841&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) in area (comprising 93.0% of the country&#39;s total area) with an average length of 80&nbsp;kilometres (50&nbsp;mi) and an average width of 59&nbsp;kilometres (37&nbsp;mi). Tobago has an area of about 300 square kilometres (115&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), or 5.8% of the country&#39;s area, is 41&nbsp;kilometres (25.5&nbsp;mi) long and 12&nbsp;kilometres (7.5&nbsp;mi) at its greatest width.<p>The terrain of the islands is a mixture of mountains and plains. The highest point in the country is found on the <!--del_lnk--> Northern Range at <!--del_lnk--> El Cerro del Aripo which is situated at 940&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> metres (3,085&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> ft) above sea level. The climate is tropical. There are two seasons annually: the <!--del_lnk--> dry season for the first six months of the year, and the <!--del_lnk--> wet season in the second half of the year. Winds are predominantlly from the northeast and are dominated by the <!--del_lnk--> northeast <!--del_lnk--> trade winds. Unlike most of the other Caribbean islands, Trinidad and Tobago have frequently escaped the wrath of major devastating hurricanes including <a href="../../wp/h/Hurricane_Ivan.htm" title="Hurricane Ivan">Hurricane Ivan</a>, the most powerful storm to pass close to the islands in recent history in September <!--del_lnk--> 2004.<p>As the majority of the population live in Trinidad, this is the location of most major towns and cities. There are three major municipalities in Trinidad: <!--del_lnk--> Port of Spain, the capital, <!--del_lnk--> San Fernando, and <!--del_lnk--> Chaguanas. Of these three, Chaguanas is the fastest growing. The largest town in Tobago is <!--del_lnk--> Scarborough.<p>Trinidad is made up of a variety of soil types, the majority being fine sands and heavy clays. The alluvial valleys of the Northern Range and the soils of the <i><!--del_lnk--> East-West Corridor</i> being the most fertile.<p>The Northern Range consists mainly of Upper <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and <a href="../../wp/c/Cretaceous.htm" title="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> rocks, mostly <!--del_lnk--> andesites and <!--del_lnk--> schists. The Northern Lowlands (<!--del_lnk--> East-West Corridor and <!--del_lnk--> Caroni Plains) consist of <!--del_lnk--> Pleistocene or younger soft sands and clays with superficial gravel terraces and river and swamp alluvia. South of this, the <!--del_lnk--> Central Range is a folded anticlinal uplift consisting of Cretaceous and <a href="../../wp/e/Eocene.htm" title="Eocene">Eocene</a> rocks, with <a href="../../wp/m/Miocene.htm" title="Miocene">Miocene</a> formations along the southern and eastern flanks. The <!--del_lnk--> Naparima Plains and the <!--del_lnk--> Nariva Swamp form the southern shoulder of this uplift. The Southern Lowlands consist of Miocene and <a href="../../wp/p/Pliocene.htm" title="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> sands, clays, and gravels.

      <p>Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment site for international businesses. A leading performer the past four years has been the booming <a href="../../wp/n/Natural_gas.htm" title="Natural gas">natural gas</a> sector. <a href="../../wp/t/Tourism.htm" title="Tourism">Tourism</a> is a growing sector, although not proportionately as important as in many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from low <!--del_lnk--> inflation and a trade surplus. The year 2002 was marked by solid growth in the <!--del_lnk--> oil sector, offset in part by domestic political uncertainty. The three major banks are Republic Bank Limited, Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and First Citizens Bank. The 2002 to 2006 period has been marked with striking economic trends , high inflation fueled by massive government spending on construction programs and massive growth due to high oil prices. The total GDP has doubled during this period and now stands near 90 billion US dollars. It is feared that, high inflation and a bubble economy created by high oil prices may lead to a crash if the bubble were to burst, fall in oil prices or natural disaster.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Of the country&#39;s 1.3 million inhabitants (as of 2005), most (96%) reside on the island of Trinidad with most of the remainder (4%) on Tobago. The ethnic composition of Trinidad and Tobago reflects a history of conquest and immigration. Two major ethnic groups - <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Trinidadians and <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Trinidadians - account for almost 80% of the population, while people of <!--del_lnk--> Mixed-race, Euro-Trinidadian/<!--del_lnk--> European, Sino-Trinidadian/<!--del_lnk--> Chinese and Arab-Trinidadian/<a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syrian</a>-<a href="../../wp/l/Lebanon.htm" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> descent make up most of the rest of the population. According to the <!--del_lnk--> 1990 census, Indo-Trinidadians make up 40.3% of the population, Afro-Trinidadians 39.5%, <!--del_lnk--> Mixed-race people 18.4%, Euro-Trinidadian 0.6% and Chinese, Syrians and others 1.2%. Euro-Trinidadians, especially those descendant of the former <!--del_lnk--> plantocracy, are often referred to as <!--del_lnk--> French Creoles, even if they are descended from Spanish, British, or German settlers. The mixed-race <!--del_lnk--> Cocoa Payols are descendant of the original <!--del_lnk--> Spanish settlers and later immigrants from <a href="../../wp/v/Venezuela.htm" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. The Trinidadian <!--del_lnk--> Portuguese population includes both whites and mixed people. The small Amerindian population is largely mixed-race. The <!--del_lnk--> Carib population, which is descendant of the indigenous inhabitants, is primarily organised around the <!--del_lnk--> Santa Rosa Carib Community.<p><!--del_lnk--> Emigration from Trinidad and Tobago, as with other Caribbean nations, has historically been high; most emigrants go to the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Britain. Emigration has continued, albeit at a lower rate, even as the birth rate sharply dropped to levels typical of industrialised countries. Largely because of this phenomenon, as of 2006, Trinidad and Tobago has the lowest <!--del_lnk--> population growth rate in the world (-0.87%).<p><a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is the country&#39;s only official language, but <!--del_lnk--> Bhojpuri, locally known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a>, is also spoken by a few Indo-Trinidadians and widely used in popular music such as chutney and chutney soca. The main spoken language, <!--del_lnk--> Trinidadian English is either classified as a <!--del_lnk--> dialect or variety of English or as an <!--del_lnk--> English Creole (<!--del_lnk--> Trinidadian Creole English). The major spoken language in Tobago is <!--del_lnk--> Tobagonian Creole English. Both languages contain elements from a number and variety of African languages; Trinidadian English, however, is also largely influenced by French and French Creole and by Bhojpuri/Hindi. The creole languages and other vernaculars are normally spoken in informal situations, and there is not yet a formalized system of writing (other than as in standard English). Short-term visitors need not be concerned about learning Creole, as virtually everyone speaks English. Although Patois (a variety of <!--del_lnk--> French Creole) was once the most widely spoken language on the island (and also on the Venezuelan Paria coast), it is now rarely heard.<p>Due to Trinidad&#39;s location on the coast of <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a>, the country has been slowly redeveloping a connection with the <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a>-speaking peoples, but has been impeded by the fact that in 2004, only 1,500 inhabitants spoke Spanish.2. <cite id="fn_1500speakers" style="font-style: inherit;"><b>^</b>&nbsp;</cite> In 2004 the government initiated the <i>Spanish as a First Foreign Language (SAFFL)</i> initiative <!--del_lnk--> , with a public launch in March 2005. Government regulations now require Spanish to be taught to all beginning at the primary school level, while thirty percent of public employees are to be linguistically competent within five years. Venezuelans often come to Trinidad and Tobago to learn English, and many English schools have expanded to feature both English and Spanish.<p><a id="Religion" name="Religion"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Religion</span></h2>
      <p>Many different religions are present in Trinidad and Tobago. The largest two are the <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Catholic_Church.htm" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholics</a> (26%) and <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hindus</a> (22%); the <!--del_lnk--> Anglicans (8%), <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Muslims</a> (6%), <!--del_lnk--> Seventh-day Adventists (4%), <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterians and <!--del_lnk--> Methodists are among the smaller faiths. Two <!--del_lnk--> Afro-Caribbean <!--del_lnk--> syncretic faiths, the <!--del_lnk--> Shouter or <!--del_lnk--> Spiritual Baptists and the <!--del_lnk--> Orisha faith (formerly called <!--del_lnk--> Shangos, a less than complimentary term) are among the fastest growing religious groups, as are a host of American-style <!--del_lnk--> evangelical and <!--del_lnk--> fundamentalist churches usually lumped as &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Pentecostal&quot; by most Trinidadians (although this designation is often inaccurate).<p><a id="Human_rights" name="Human_rights"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Human rights</span></h2>
      <p>According to reports of Amnesty International, tortures and unfair trials are perpetrated in Trinidad and Tobago. There are several cases known of incorrect application of death penalty.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cat o&#39; nine tails is still used to flog prisoners - occasionally even women and boys under 16 - apparently in breech of the provisions of the &quot;Corporal Punishment (Offenders over Sixteen) Act&quot; of 1953. On 11 March, 2005 the Government of Trinidad &amp; Tobago was ordered by the <!--del_lnk--> Inter-American Court of Human Rights to pay US$ 50,000 for &quot;moral damages&quot; to a prisoner who had received 15 strokes of the &quot;Cat&quot; plus expenses for his medical and psychological care. It is unclear whether the Court&#39;s decisions were met.<p>Homosexuality is prohibited and punished with imprisonment; under Article 8 (18/1) of the Immigration Act, homosexuals are not allowed to enter the country.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>

      <p>Trinidad and Tobago is famous for its pre-<!--del_lnk--> Lenten <!--del_lnk--> Carnival. It is also the birthplace of <!--del_lnk--> calypso music and the <!--del_lnk--> steelpan, which is widely claimed to be the only acoustic musical instrument invented during the 20th century. The diverse cultural and religious background allows for many festivities and ceremonies throughout the year. Other indigenous art forms include <!--del_lnk--> soca (a derivate of calypso), <!--del_lnk--> Parang (Venezuelan-influenced Christmas music), <!--del_lnk--> chutney, and <!--del_lnk--> pichakaree (musical forms which blend the music of the Caribbean and India) and the famous <!--del_lnk--> Limbo dance.<p>The artistic scene is vibrant.

Naipaul and <a href="../../wp/s/Saint_Lucia.htm" title="Saint Lucia">St. Lucian</a>-born <!--del_lnk--> Derek Walcott.
