      <p>Tokyo&#39;s rise to importance can be largely attributed to two men: <!--del_lnk--> Tokugawa Ieyasu and <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Meiji. In 1603, after unifying the warring states of Japan, <!--del_lnk--> Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made <!--del_lnk--> Edo (now Tokyo) his base. As a result, the city developed rapidly and grew to become one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>. It became the de facto capital of Japan even while the emperor lived in <!--del_lnk--> Kyoto, the imperial capital. (See <!--del_lnk--> Edo.)<p>After 263 years, the shogunate was overthrown under the banner of <!--del_lnk--> restoring imperial rule. In <!--del_lnk--> 1869, the figurehead 17-year-old <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Meiji moved to Edo, which was <!--del_lnk--> renamed &quot;Tokyo&quot; (&quot;Eastern Capital&quot;) the year before. Tokyo was already the nation&#39;s political, economic, and cultural centre, and the emperor&#39;s residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well with the former Edo Castle becoming the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Palace. The <!--del_lnk--> city of Tokyo was established, and continued to be the capital until it was abolished as a municipality in 1943 and merged with the &quot;Metropolitan Prefecture&quot; of Tokyo.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Tokyo, like <a href="../../wp/o/Osaka.htm" title="Osaka">Osaka</a>, has been designed since about the turn of the century (1900) to be rail-centric, that is centered around major train stations in a high density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level. This differs from other world cities such as <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles that are low density automobile centric, and though <!--del_lnk--> expressways have been built, the basic design hasn&#39;t changed to this day.<p>Tokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes and has recovered remarkably from both. One was the <!--del_lnk--> Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923, and the other was <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> firebombings in 1945 were almost as devastating as the atomic bombs of <!--del_lnk--> Hiroshima and <!--del_lnk--> Nagasaki combined. Large areas of the city were flattened.<p>After the war, Tokyo was completely rebuilt, and showcased to the world during the city&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> 1964 Summer Olympics. Tokyo became the largest city in the world in 1965 (taking the lead from New York). The 1970s brought new high-rise developments such as <!--del_lnk--> Sunshine 60, a new and controversial <!--del_lnk--> airport at <!--del_lnk--> Narita (well outside Tokyo), and a population increase to about 11 million (in the metropolitan area).<p>Tokyo&#39;s subway and commuter rail network became the busiest in the world as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during an economic <!--del_lnk--> bubble: many got rich quick, but the bubble burst in the early 1990s and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with real estate shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> lost decade&quot; from which it is now slowly recovering.<p>Tokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include <!--del_lnk--> Ebisu Garden Place, Tennozu Isle, Shiodome, <!--del_lnk--> Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (now also a <!--del_lnk--> Shinkansen station), and Tokyo Station (Marunouchi side). Buildings of significance are demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as <!--del_lnk--> Omotesando Hills. Land reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the <!--del_lnk--> Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment centre.<p>Tokyo was hit by powerful <a href="../../wp/e/Earthquake.htm" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1703, <!--del_lnk--> 1782, <!--del_lnk--> 1812, <!--del_lnk--> 1855 and <!--del_lnk--> 1923. The <!--del_lnk--> 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people.<p>There have been various plans proposed for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, in order to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial within Japan and have yet to be realized.<p>Due to evolution in the method in which Japanese letters are <!--del_lnk--> transliterated into their <!--del_lnk--> roman representation, older texts may refer to the city as &quot;Tokio.&quot;<p><a id="Geography_and_administrative_divisions" name="Geography_and_administrative_divisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography and administrative divisions</span></h2>

      <p>Tokyo Metropolis consists of three major parts: the <!--del_lnk--> twenty-three special wards (constituting the former Tokyo City); Tama area; and the islands.<p>The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of <!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Bay and measures about 90&nbsp;km east to west and 25&nbsp;km north to south. It borders <!--del_lnk--> Chiba Prefecture to the east, <!--del_lnk--> Yamanashi Prefecture to the west, <!--del_lnk--> Kanagawa Prefecture to the south, and <!--del_lnk--> Saitama Prefecture to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (&#x591A;&#x6469;&#x5730;&#x65B9;) stretching westwards.<p>Also within the administrative bounaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> directly south: the <!--del_lnk--> Izu Islands, which are almost parallel to the Izu Peninsula; and the <!--del_lnk--> Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km away from mainland Japan.<p>Under <!--del_lnk--> Japanese law, Tokyo is designated as a <i><!--del_lnk--> to</i> (<!--del_lnk--> &#x90FD;, often translated &quot;<!--del_lnk--> metropolis&quot;). Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan&#39;s other <!--del_lnk--> prefectures. Within Tokyo lie dozens of smaller entities, most of them conventionally referred to as cities. It includes <!--del_lnk--> twenty-three special wards (&#x7279;&#x5225;<!--del_lnk--> &#x533A; -ku) which until 1943 comprised the <!--del_lnk--> city of Tokyo but are now separate, self-governing municipalities, each with a mayor and a council, and having the status of a city. In addition to these 23 municipalities, Tokyo also encompasses 26 more cities (<!--del_lnk--> &#x5E02; -shi), five towns (<!--del_lnk--> &#x753A; -ch&#x14D; or machi), and eight villages (<!--del_lnk--> &#x6751; -son or -mura), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government is headed by a publicly-elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its <!--del_lnk--> headquarters are in the ward of <!--del_lnk--> Shinjuku. They govern all of Tokyo, including lakes, rivers, dams, farms, remote islands, and <!--del_lnk--> national parks in addition to its famous neon jungle, skyscrapers and crowded subways.<p><a id="The_twenty-three_special_wards" name="The_twenty-three_special_wards"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The twenty-three special wards</span></h3>

In <!--del_lnk--> July 1, <!--del_lnk--> 1943, Tokyo City was merged to <!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Prefecture (until June, 1943) (&#x6771;&#x4EAC;&#x5E9C;, <i>tokyo-fu</i>), lost <!--del_lnk--> municipality status and was divided into wards.<p>Each ward is a local <!--del_lnk--> municipality with its own elected mayor and assembly, differing from an ordinary city in that certain governmental functions are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and, for most, also differing in having no particular centre and little cultural or similar distinctiveness from the immediate surroundings.<p><!--del_lnk--> As of September 1, 2003, the official total population of the special wards combined was about 8.34 million, with a population density of 13,416 persons per square kilometer.<p>The term &quot;central Tokyo&quot; today may refer to the special wards, the areas largely within the <!--del_lnk--> Yamanote Line loop (<!--del_lnk--> Shinjuku, <!--del_lnk--> Toshima, <!--del_lnk--> Bunkyo, <!--del_lnk--> Taito, <!--del_lnk--> Chiyoda, <!--del_lnk--> Chuo, <!--del_lnk--> Minato, and <!--del_lnk--> Shibuya), or to the three &quot;central wards&quot; of <!--del_lnk--> Chiyoda, <!--del_lnk--> Ch&#x16B;&#x14D; and <!--del_lnk--> Minato. While the generally-accepted centre of Tokyo is the <!--del_lnk--> Imperial Palace, as a rail-centric city, there are a number of major urban centers where business, shopping, and entertainment are concentrated around major train stations. These include:<dl>
       <dt><!--del_lnk--> Shinjuku&nbsp;<dd>Location of the <!--del_lnk--> Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. The area is best known for Tokyo&#39;s early skyscrapers, erected in the 1970s. Major department stores, electronics stores and hotels can also be found here. On the east side of <!--del_lnk--> Shinjuku Station, <!--del_lnk--> Kabuki-cho is notorious for its many bars and nightclubs. Shinjuku Station moves an estimated three million passengers a day, making it the busiest in the world.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Marunouchi and <!--del_lnk--> Otemachi&nbsp;<dd>The main financial and business district of Tokyo has many headquarters of banks, trading companies and other major corporations. The area is seeing a major redevelopment with new buildings for shopping and entertainment constructed in front of Tokyo Station&#39;s Marunouchi side.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Ginza and <!--del_lnk--> Yurakucho&nbsp;<dd>Major shopping and entertainment district with department stores, upscale shops selling brand-name goods, and movie theaters.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Shinbashi&nbsp;<dd>An area revitalized by being the gateway to <!--del_lnk--> Odaiba and the new <!--del_lnk--> Shiodome Shiosite complex of high-rise buildings.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Shinagawa&nbsp;<dd>In addition to the major hotels on the west side of Shinagawa Station, the former sleepy east side of the station has been redeveloped as a major centre for business.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Shibuya&nbsp;<dd>A long-time centre of shopping, fashion and entertainment, especially for the younger set. Shibuya is also home to some of Tokyo&#39;s largest and newest <!--del_lnk--> nightclubs.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Ikebukuro&nbsp;<dd>The busiest interchange in north central Tokyo, featuring <!--del_lnk--> Sunshine City and various shopping destinations.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Ueno&nbsp;<dd><!--del_lnk--> Ueno Station serves areas north of Tokyo from where many people commute. Besides department stores and shops in Ameyoko, Ueno boasts <!--del_lnk--> Ueno Park, <!--del_lnk--> Ueno Zoo and major national museums. In spring, Ueno Park and adjacent Shinobazu Pond are prime places to view cherry blossoms.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Odaiba&nbsp;<dd>A large, reclaimed, waterfront area that has become one of Tokyo&#39;s most popular shopping and entertainment districts.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Nagatacho&nbsp;<dd>The political heart of Tokyo and the nation. It is the location of the Diet, government ministries, and party headquarters.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Akasaka&nbsp;<dd>A district with a range of restaurants, clubs and hotels; many pedestrian alleys giving it a local neighbourhood feel. Next to <!--del_lnk--> Roppongi, <!--del_lnk--> Nagatacho, and <!--del_lnk--> Aoyama.<dt><!--del_lnk--> Aoyama&nbsp;<dd>A neighbourhood of Tokyo with parks, an enormous cemetery, expensive housing, trendy cafes and international restaurants.
