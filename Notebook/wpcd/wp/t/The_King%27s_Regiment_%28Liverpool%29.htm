      <p><b>The King&#39;s Regiment (Liverpool)</b> was one of the oldest <!--del_lnk--> infantry <!--del_lnk--> regiments of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army, having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the <!--del_lnk--> 8th (The King&#39;s) Regiment of Foot in 1751. Unlike most British regiments, which were associated with a <!--del_lnk--> county, the King&#39;s was the <a href="../../wp/c/City.htm" title="City">city</a> regiment of <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army  After 273 years of continuous existence, the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchesters in 1958.<p>The King&#39;s notably saw active service in the <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a>, the two <!--del_lnk--> world wars, and the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War. Nine <a href="../../wp/v/Victoria_Cross.htm" title="Victoria Cross">Victoria Crosses</a> were awarded to the regiment, the first in 1900 and the last in 1918. An additional two were awarded to <!--del_lnk--> Royal Army Medical Corps officer <!--del_lnk--> Noel Godfrey Chavasse, who was attached to <!--del_lnk--> the Liverpool Scottish during the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">First World War</a>.<p>In peacetime, the regiment&#39;s battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. Duties varied: riots were suppressed in Belfast, England, and the Middle East; bases were garrisoned in places such as the <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province and <!--del_lnk--> West Germany; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment&#39;s history.<p>The regiment has been referred to variously as <b>L&#39;POOL R</b>, <b>the Liverpools</b>, <b>KLR</b>, and <b>the King&#39;s</b>. Usage of &quot;L&#39;POOL R&quot; and &quot;the Liverpools&quot; was most prevalent from the 1880s to the 1920s.<p>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Cardwell reforms and <!--del_lnk--> Childers reforms from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army. The reforms entailed single-<!--del_lnk--> battalion regiments amalgamating to form multi-battalion regiments and the abolition of the numbering system in favour of city or county affiliation. Thus, on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1881, the two battalions of the unamalgamated 8th (The King&#39;s) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, <b>The King&#39;s (Liverpool Regiment)</b>. The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873, when the regiment was allocated to the 13th Brigade Depot in Liverpool. Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the <!--del_lnk--> militia and <!--del_lnk--> volunteers. Nine militia and volunteer battalions from <!--del_lnk--> Lancashire and the <a href="../../wp/i/Isle_of_Man.htm" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a> transferred to the King&#39;s, and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and <!--del_lnk--> Territorial Force. Some of these battalions maintained individual distinctions, such as unique titles, <!--del_lnk--> cap badges, <!--del_lnk--> uniforms, and honorary colonels. By 1908, the King&#39;s possessed three overtly individual battalions &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> the Liverpool Rifles (6th Btn), <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Irish (8th Btn), and <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Scottish (10th Btn).<p>Under the new system, it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas. The 1st Battalion had been located in <!--del_lnk--> North West England since the late 1870s. While based in Salford Barracks, Manchester, the battalion was subject to a bomb attack by the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republican Brotherhood (&quot;Fenians&quot;). The barracks sustained minor structural damage as a result of the explosion, which killed a child and badly wounded its mother. The battalion was also called upon to quell riots that broke out during a mineworkers&#39; strike. In 1882, the battalion was posted to <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, based in <!--del_lnk--> the Curragh. Though the posting was overall uneventful, the battalion was employed after sectarian riots broke out in <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> following the introduction of the <!--del_lnk--> 1886 Home Rule Bill in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British Parliament</a>. The battalion returned to <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">England</a> three-years later.<p><a id="Colonial_wars_.281881-1914.29" name="Colonial_wars_.281881-1914.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Colonial wars (1881-1914)</span></h3>

      <p>The 2nd King&#39;s overseas service in the <!--del_lnk--> 1880s was punctuated by the <!--del_lnk--> Third Burmese War, which began in 1885. It had been based on the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent since 1877 and had fought in the <!--del_lnk--> Second Afghan War. Invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Upper Burma began in October in the form of the Burma Field Force. Making swift progress up the <!--del_lnk--> Irrawaddy River, the force captured frontier forts and the capital <!--del_lnk--> Myingyan. Following the capital&#39;s capture, the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of <!--del_lnk--> King Thibaw. A seven-year <!--del_lnk--> guerilla campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma&#39;s annexation on <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1886. The 2nd King&#39;s operated in small groups against the guerillas in the Burmese jungle for over a year. Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion returned to India. The battalion was subsequently posted to <!--del_lnk--> Aden for a year before returning to Britain in 1892. Overseas service for the 1st King&#39;s included a two-year stay in <!--del_lnk--> Nova Scotia, where they became the last battalion of the regiment to garrison <a href="../../wp/c/Canada.htm" title="Canada">Canada</a>. The battalion was posted to the <!--del_lnk--> West Indies in 1895, then <!--del_lnk--> Natal Colony in 1897. The <a href="../../wp/s/Second_Boer_War.htm" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a> began two-years later.<p>Prior to the outbreak of the war, as relations between the British and <!--del_lnk--> Boer republics deteriorated, the 1st King&#39;s formed a company of <!--del_lnk--> mounted infantry and moved to <!--del_lnk--> Ladysmith, where it underwent intensive training. The war began on <!--del_lnk--> 11 October 1899. The Boers invaded Natal soon afterwards and <!--del_lnk--> besieged Ladysmith on <!--del_lnk--> 2 November.<p>The Boer War had provided the first opportunity for the regiment&#39;s volunteer battalions to serve overseas with the regular forces, supplying small detachments and service companies for the 1st King&#39;s and other units. In contrast, the regiment&#39;s militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th, were sent to South Africa as intact units late in the war.<p>A monument commemorating the regiment&#39;s service in the Boer War was erected in <!--del_lnk--> St John&#39;s Gardens and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on <!--del_lnk--> 9 September <!--del_lnk--> 1905. The monument was sculpted by Sir William Goscombe John. A figure of <!--del_lnk--> Britannia features prominently atop a pedestal, which has four standing soldiers positioned on its four corners, each representing a period in the regiment&#39;s history.<p><a id="World_War_I_.281914-1918.29" name="World_War_I_.281914-1918.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">World War I (1914-1918)</span></h3>

      <p>The regiment fielded 49 battalions during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">the war</a> from a pre-war establishment of two regular, two <!--del_lnk--> militia, and six <!--del_lnk--> territorial.

Some 13,795 Kingsmen died during the course of the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths. Thousands more were wounded, sick, or taken prisoner. Of higher formations, the Liverpool Pals sustained nearly 2,800 casualties and the <!--del_lnk--> 55th Division&#39;s 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, composed entirely of battalions from the King&#39;s, had losses of 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of <!--del_lnk--> 3 January <!--del_lnk--> 1916 and <!--del_lnk--> 11 November <!--del_lnk--> 1918.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>A vigorous <!--del_lnk--> recruiting campaign involving pre-war personalities such as <!--del_lnk--> Lord Kitchner and <!--del_lnk--> Lord Derby faciliated the rapid expansion of the British Army. Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915. To distinguish them from the originals, they were designated as, for instance, the 2/5th and 3/5th Battalions respectively. Second-line territorial battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training duties, but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front themselves and replaced by the third-line battalions. Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener sought an alternative to the Territorial Army, and made an appeal for an initial 100,000 volunteers (the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;New Army&quot;) under the belief the war would not be brief. The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of <!--del_lnk--> &quot;Pals&quot; for the King&#39;s Regiment, to be recruited from men of the same workplace. His proposal proved successful. Within a week, thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered and were eventually formed into the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Battalions. They were known as the City of Liverpool battalions or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Pals&quot;. Lord Derby addressed recruits on <!--del_lnk--> 28 August:<table align="center" cellpadding="10" class="cquote" style="border-collapse:collapse; background-color:transparent; border-style:none;">

      <p>The 1st King&#39;s arrived in France as part of the 6th Brigade, <!--del_lnk--> 2nd Division, one of the original components of the <!--del_lnk--> British Expeditionary Force that landed on <!--del_lnk--> 14 August <!--del_lnk--> 1914. The BEF&#39;s first encounter with the German Army at <!--del_lnk--> Mons, <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a>, was followed by a retreat that would last until <!--del_lnk--> 5 September and end at the <!--del_lnk--> Marne, a river east of <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division, the 1st King&#39;s and its brigade were ordered to prevent a German force cutting off the 4th (Guards) Brigade, forming the rearguard at <!--del_lnk--> Villers-Cotter&eacute;ts, and 70th Battery, <!--del_lnk--> Royal Horse Artillery. The guns were extricated through the actions of the brigade, earning them praise from the 2nd Division&#39;s commanding officer, General <!--del_lnk--> Monro. <p>Paris was saved with the halting of the German advance at <!--del_lnk--> the Marne; the ensuing retreat, which prompted an Allied counter-offensive, ended at <!--del_lnk--> the Aisne. After both battles were fought, the battalion moved north to <!--del_lnk--> Ypres during the so-called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Race to the Sea&quot;. In an action at <!--del_lnk--> Langemarck during the <!--del_lnk--> First Battle of Ypres, the battalion captured the small village of Molenaarelstoek, just north-east of <!--del_lnk--> Polygon Wood. As the battle progressed, the Germans sought a decisive victory against the outnumbered BEF and launched the last major assault of the battle on <!--del_lnk--> 11 November. Located to the south of Polygon Wood, the 1st King&#39;s was one of only a few units available to meet the attack. A composite division of the &eacute;lite Prussian Guard, advancing in <!--del_lnk--> column formation, was initially successful before it was pushed back after momentum was lost. In the defence of Polygon Wood, artillery and the 1st King&#39;s concentrated fire effectively destroyed the 3rd <!--del_lnk--> Prussian <!--del_lnk--> Foot Guards. By the end of the battle, the 1st King&#39;s casualties numbered 33 officers and 814 other ranks (OR) from an original strength of 27 officers and 991 ORs.

      <p>By the end of March 1915, eight battalions of the King&#39;s were serving on the Western Front. The 1st and 1/5th took part in an attack that coincided with the Allied offensive at <!--del_lnk--> Neuve Chapelle. The preliminary Allied bombardment failed to cut much of the <!--del_lnk--> barbed wire, impeding the battalion&#39;s advance. Heavy casualties were incurred as a result of the withering hail-of-fire directed at the battalion, one of whom was the <!--del_lnk--> commanding officer. One platoon that managed to reach the German lines blockaded itself in the communications trench and held on for an hour before ordered to withdraw. Over 200 casualties were sustained by the battalion. <p>The King&#39;s next fought in the <!--del_lnk--> Second Battle of Ypres, a German offensive begun on <!--del_lnk--> 24 April. &quot;Second Ypres&quot; was the 4th and <!--del_lnk--> 1/6th King&#39;s first battle. In the <!--del_lnk--> St Julien area, the 4th suffered over 400 casualties in an intense three-day period. The <!--del_lnk--> 1/6th, meanwhile, supported the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Cheshires in a small defensive action at <!--del_lnk--> Hill 60. After &#39;Second Ypres&#39; ended, four battalions were engaged in battle at <!--del_lnk--> Festubert, collectively sustaining over 1,400 casualties. Lance-Corporal <!--del_lnk--> Tombs became the regiment&#39;s first Victoria Cross recipient of the war for actions at Festubert on <!--del_lnk--> 16 May. The <!--del_lnk--> 1/10th Battalion fought its first battle on <!--del_lnk--> 16 June at <!--del_lnk--> Bellewaarde, suffering nearly 400 casualties.<p>A new British offensive was launched on <!--del_lnk--> 25 September at <!--del_lnk--> Loos, to coincide with a French offensive in the <!--del_lnk--> Champagne region. The King&#39;s were represented in the offensive by eight battalions, from standard infantry to <!--del_lnk--> pioneers. <!--del_lnk--> Chlorine gas was used on the first day of the battle. The gas, however, blew back in the wind, hindering the advance of the 1st King&#39;s and others who had to contend with uncut barbed wire. The 1/9th King&#39;s advance also stalled, though they took about 300 Germans prisoner. The battalion was later amongst those who successfully defended against a German counter-attack on <!--del_lnk--> 8 October.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>The Liverpool Pals&#39; baptism of fire came during &quot;The Big Push&quot; on <!--del_lnk--> 1 July <!--del_lnk--> 1916, on the <!--del_lnk--> first day of the Somme Offensive. The four Pals&#39; battalions of the <!--del_lnk--> 30th Division were to attack towards <!--del_lnk--> Montauban, south of where most of the British Army&#39;s casualties (nearly 60,000) were sustained on the first day. During the offensive, the 17th, 19th, and 20th Pals formed part of the 89th Brigade, whilst the 18th Pals were with the 21st Brigade. At 07:30, the 30th Division began its advance on the left of the French <!--del_lnk--> Corps de Fer. Meeting limited opposition, the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal losses, though the 18th suffered severely from machine gun fire while advancing on the Glatz Redoubt.

      <p>More battalions entered the fray as reinforcements following the first-day. Some 14 battalions took part in five attempts to capture the village of <!--del_lnk--> Guillemont between July and September. During the third attempt, three companies of the 1st and 1/8th King&#39;s were surrounded by German forces and decimated. The 1/8th had suffered 15 killed, 55 wounded, and 502 missing, while the 1st were later reinforced with drafts from <!--del_lnk--> the Manchester Regiment.

      <p>Most of the regiment&#39;s battalions were disbanded by the end of 1919, the men demobilised and returned to Britain. Many battalions had stayed on the continent or moved to overseas garrisons prior to disbandment. On <!--del_lnk--> 11 December 1918, the remnants of the 1st King&#39;s, some veterans of 1914, had marched across the German frontier &quot;at ease&quot;, bayonets fixed and their colours uncased. The battalion was based at <!--del_lnk--> D&uuml;ren and Berg Neukirchen for about five-months as part of the <!--del_lnk--> British Army of the Rhine. The 13th King&#39;s, too, served with the occupation army until disbanded in October 1919.<p><a id="Inter-war_.281918-1939.29" name="Inter-war_.281918-1939.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Inter-war (1918-1939)</span></h3>

      <p>Hostilities did not end for the the 17th King&#39;s on <!--del_lnk--> 11 November; the battalion had sailed for <!--del_lnk--> Murmansk, Russia, in October as part of an Allied intervention force sent to fight alongside the <!--del_lnk--> &quot;White&quot; forces in <!--del_lnk--> their war against the <!--del_lnk--> Bolsheviks. The battalion was moved to <!--del_lnk--> Archangel, where it was based fully intact for a short period. The battalion&#39;s companies served separately for the duration of their stay in Russia. The battalion was disbanded in September 1919.<p>Inter-war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment&#39;s territorial battalions from six to one by 1937. The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s, the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers, and a reorganisation of the TA&#39;s infantry in the mid-1930s resulted in the 6th, 7th, and 10th converting to new roles. The 6th became <!--del_lnk--> Royal Engineers, the 7th joined the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Tank Regiment, and the 10th became a battalion of the <!--del_lnk--> Queen&#39;s Own Cameron Highlanders.<p><a name="1st_King.27s"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">1st King&#39;s</span></h4>

The battalion was moved to <!--del_lnk--> Landi Kotal, <!--del_lnk--> Khyber Pass, in 1937. Service in the volatitle <!--del_lnk--> North-West Frontier Province continued into the Second World War.<p><a name="2nd_King.27s"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">2nd King&#39;s</span></h4>
      <p>The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice, and in 1919 was called upon for service in the <!--del_lnk--> Third Afghan War. Leading a &quot;Special Column&quot;, the battalion reached the <!--del_lnk--> Toba Plataeu, some 8,000 feet high, but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces.<p>Demobilisation followed and the remnants joined the <a href="../../wp/s/Sudan.htm" title="Sudan">Sudan</a> garrison in 1920, where the battalion was reformed.

      <p>Expansion was on a more modest scale to that which occurred during the previous world war. Ten battalions were raised between 1939 and 1940, including the reformed 8th (Irish). Two of these war-raised battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941; the 11th becoming the 152nd Regiment, RAC, and the 12th transferring the Royal Artillery as the 101 Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. Some 16 battalions and four <!--del_lnk--> batteries of the <!--del_lnk--> Home Guard were affiliated with the King&#39;s Regiment. The Lancashire Home Guard performed various duties in Britain supporting the <!--del_lnk--> Civil Defence Service and regular army, and served during the <!--del_lnk--> Liverpool Blitz.<p>By late-1941, three battalions of the regiment (1st, 2nd, and 13th) were stationed abroad. The remainder were located throughout the United Kingdom, poised to defend against an invasion. The 1st and 13th would serve in <!--del_lnk--> Burma as <!--del_lnk--> Chindits, the 2nd in <!--del_lnk--> Italy and <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, and the 5th and 8th in <!--del_lnk--> North-West Europe. Of battalions that had transferred and converted to other roles pre-war, only the <!--del_lnk--> 40th RTR (7th King&#39;s) saw active service. With the <!--del_lnk--> 23rd Armoured Brigade, the 40th RTR fought in <!--del_lnk--> North Africa, where they acquired the nickname &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Monty&#39;s Foxhounds&quot;, Italy, and Greece.<p><a id="Italy_and_Greece" name="Italy_and_Greece"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Italy and Greece</span></h4>
      <p>Having spent five-years in <a href="../../wp/g/Gibraltar.htm" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, the 2nd King&#39;s departed for Egypt in December 1943 to reinforce the <!--del_lnk--> 4th Infantry Division. With the division, the battalion landed in <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> in March 1944. On <!--del_lnk--> 11 May, it took part in the oppossed crossing of the <!--del_lnk--> Rapido River during the final <!--del_lnk--> battle for Monte Cassino. They came under intense mortar and artillery fire during the crossing, while many assault boats capzised due to the strong current. The 4th Division struggled to consolidate its bridgehead, during which the 2nd King&#39;s lost its commanding officer, 72 men killed or missing, and many wounded. After a five-month struggle, Monte Cassino was captured on <!--del_lnk--> 18 May by the <!--del_lnk--> Polish II Corps and the <!--del_lnk--> Gustav Line broken.<p>The Allies captured <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> in June and the King&#39;s fought in the subsequent advance to the <!--del_lnk--> Trasimene Line. Intense battles were fought in the Gioella area and <!--del_lnk--> Tuori, the latter earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army. In about nine-months of service, in difficult, mountainous terrain, with heavy casualties, the battalion was awarded four <!--del_lnk--> DSOs, nine <!--del_lnk--> MCs, three <!--del_lnk--> DCMs, four <!--del_lnk--> MMs, and six <!--del_lnk--> mentioned in despatches. Among those awarded were Sergeant Welsby, who single-handedly secured a fortified farmhouse, and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds, for his leadership and conduct around Casa Arlotti.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 12 December, the 2nd King&#39;s were flown to <!--del_lnk--> Piraeus, <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, two months after Allied troops had first landed in the country following the German withdrawal. By then, the Allies were in conflict with <a href="../../wp/c/Communism.htm" title="Communist">Communist</a> partisans seeking to establish themselves as the new authority in Greece. Shortly after landing, the 2nd King&#39;s successfully seized a partisan-held barracks at the cost of 14 casualties. For the next several weeks, the battalion was employed on internal security duties, involving many instances of house-to-house and street fighting in <a href="../../wp/a/Athens.htm" title="Athens">Athens</a>. The city was cleared of insurgents by early January 1945.

      <p>The 13th King&#39;s sailed for India in December 1941, coinciding with <!--del_lnk--> Japan&#39;s entrance into the war. Intended for garrisson duties, the battalion&#39;s strength contained many men who were of an old or medically downgraded condition. After Burma was occupied by Japan in 1942, a unit was formed to penetrate deep behind Japanese lines from India. The 13th King&#39;s provided the majority of the British contingent for the unit, which was designated as the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade (the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Chindits&#39;) and commanded by <!--del_lnk--> Orde Wingate.<p>Organised into two groups, the Chindits&#39; first operation (codenamed Longcloth) began on <!--del_lnk--> 8 February 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel S.A. Cooke, was formed from the 13th King&#39;s and divided into five independent columns, two of which (Nos 7 and 8) were commanded by majors from the battalion. No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded.<p><a id="Normandy_and_Germany" name="Normandy_and_Germany"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Normandy and Germany</span></h4>

      <p>In 1943, the 5th and 8th King&#39;s (Liverpool Irish) were provided with speciailst training at <!--del_lnk--> Ayrshire in preparation for a planned <a href="../../wp/b/Battle_of_Normandy.htm" title="Battle of Normandy">invasion of France</a>. They were selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups, whose objectives on an invasion beach were to maintain organisation, secure positions, and provide defence against counter-attack.<p>As invasion neared in mid-1944, the two battalions were moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard <!--del_lnk--> troopships and <!--del_lnk--> landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the <i>Ulster Monarch</i>, a passenger ship that had served on the <a href="../../wp/b/Belfast.htm" title="Belfast">Belfast</a>-Liverpool line before the war. After delays, the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on <!--del_lnk--> 5 June. Both King&#39;s battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at <!--del_lnk--> Sword with the <!--del_lnk--> British 3rd Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at <!--del_lnk--> Juno with the <!--del_lnk--> Canadians.<p>Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Winnipeg Rifles. Under intense machine gun and mortar fire, the landing of Major Max Morrison&#39;s &quot;A&quot; Company proceeded well, allowing some to establish a command-post upon reaching the sand dunes. In contrast, in &quot;B&quot; Company&#39;s sector, the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and <!--del_lnk--> DD tanks exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire. The company&#39;s officer commanding, Major O&#39;Brien, and the second-in-comannd were among those wounded. Experiences at Sword Beach were similar. As the 3rd Division moved inland, the 5th King&#39;s attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers. Casualties included Lieutenant-Colonel D. H. V. Board, killed by a sniper, and the OC of 9 Platoon, Lieutenant Scarfe, mortally wounded in an attack on a German position.<p>Under fire, the beach groups collected the wounded and dead, located and marked <!--del_lnk--> minefields, attempted to maintain organisation, and directed vehicles and troops inland. The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks. While the severely depleted Liverpool Irish was disbanded in August, much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements, the 5th King&#39;s was reduced to cadre strength. Disbandment was only avoided through the determination of Lieutenant-Colonel G.D. Wreford-Browne, who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit still active in the Territorial Army. <p>After the Allies began their advance into Nazi Germany in February 1945, the <!--del_lnk--> Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) formed dedicaed units to secure important objectives - equipment, installations, intelligence, and personnel. The 5th King&#39;s provided the nucleus for one such <!--del_lnk--> T (Target) Force. Elements of the 5th King&#39;s reached the naval port of <!--del_lnk--> Kiel in May 1945, securing the <!--del_lnk--> cruiser <i>Admiral Hipper</i> and taking 7,000 German sailors prisoner. The battalion continued to conduct intelligence operations until July 1946, when it was disbanded during the demoblisation process. Reconstitution into the Territorial Army followed in 1947 under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel <!--del_lnk--> Edward John Stanley (later the 18th <!--del_lnk--> Earl of Derby).<p><a id="Post-World_War_II_.281945-1958.29" name="Post-World_War_II_.281945-1958.29"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Post-World War II (1945-1958)</span></h3>
      <p>The 1st King&#39;s, still roled as parachute infantry, remained in India with responsibility for the area around <!--del_lnk--> Meerut, north-east of <a href="../../wp/n/New_Delhi.htm" title="New Delhi">New Delhi</a>. After reconverting to the infantry role, the battalion departed for Liverpool in late <!--del_lnk--> 1947.<p>Meanwhile, the 2nd King&#39;s were deployed to <!--del_lnk--> Palestine for two-weeks. First arriving on <!--del_lnk--> 29 April 1948, the battalion carried out security duties just prior to the establishment of <a href="../../wp/i/Israel.htm" title="Israel">Israel</a>. After returning to Cyprus, the battalion proceeded to <a href="../../wp/l/Liverpool.htm" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> 6 September <!--del_lnk--> 1948, the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment, Major-General <!--del_lnk--> Dudley Ward. The battalion was posted to <!--del_lnk--> West Germany shortly afterwards and moved to <!--del_lnk--> Spandau, <!--del_lnk--> West Berlin, in 1950.<p><a id="Korean_War" name="Korean_War"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Korean War</span></h4>

      <p>The battalion was ordered to Korea in June 1952. By then, the <!--del_lnk--> Korean War had entered a period of stalemate, with <a href="../../wp/t/Trench_warfare.htm" title="Trench warfare">trench warfare</a> prevailing. At Liverpool, the battalion embarked aboard the troopship <i>Devonshire</i> for <a href="../../wp/h/Hong_Kong.htm" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, where it underwent training before landing at <!--del_lnk--> Pusan, Korea, in September. Replacing the <!--del_lnk--> 1st Royal Norfolk Regiment in the <!--del_lnk--> 29th Infantry Brigade, <!--del_lnk--> 1st Commonwealth Division, the 1st King&#39;s took up defensive positions upone moving to the frontline.<p>Much of the battalion&#39;s time at the front was quiet, though their night patrols often resulted in clashes with <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">Chinese</a> troops. The battalion was withdrawn to reserve for three months in 1953. A tactically important feature known as <!--del_lnk--> &quot;The Hook&quot;, a crescent shaped ridge, was the scene of intense heavy fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May. On the night of <!--del_lnk--> 20 May, Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook, defended by the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Wellington&#39;s Regiment. Two days later, on <!--del_lnk--> 23 May, a company of the King&#39;s carried out a nighttime diversionary attack on Chinese positions known as &quot;Pheasant&quot;. One of the platoons inadvertently stumbled upon a <!--del_lnk--> minefield, suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16. The attack was consequently stalled, forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines.<p>The King&#39;s moved onto the right sector of the Hook on <!--del_lnk--> 27 May, while &quot;D&quot; Company&#39;s 10 Platoon and &quot;B&quot; Company (as reserve) were attached to the Duke of Wellington&#39;s Regiment. The battle began on <!--del_lnk--> 28 May, when a heavy bombardment targeted positions held by the Dukes at 7:53 pm. The first wave of Chinese troops was launched against the Duke&#39;s positions minutes later, followed by three further waves. Two platoons of the King&#39;s were moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position, which was then attacked by two companies of Chinese infantry. After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of <!--del_lnk--> Commonwealth <!--del_lnk--> artillery, the Chinese directed their attention to the King&#39;s on Point 146. Before the attack began, however, an artillery bombardment destroyed the Chinese formation while it assembled. Fighting continued until the remaining Chinese troops were cleared from positions at approximately 03:30 am.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>The 1st King&#39;s left Korea for Hong Kong in October, by which time its casualties numbered 28 dead and 200 wounded. Of some 1,500 men that served with the battalion in Korea, 350 were regular soldiers, the rest were <!--del_lnk--> national servicemen. The King&#39;s moved to Britain in 1955, were posted to West Germany the following year, and made its final return home in 1958.<p><a id="Amalgamation" name="Amalgamation"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Amalgamation</span></h4>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1957 Defence White Paper by Secretary of State for War <!--del_lnk--> Duncan Sandys announced, among others, a reducation in the British Army&#39;s overseas responsibilities and the abolition of national service. This was to be achieved by the amalgamation of numerous regiments, including the King&#39;s with the Manchesters. Both regiments shared an historical connection through the <!--del_lnk--> 63rd Regiment of Foot, a regiment which formed the Manchesters in 1881 having once been a battalion of the 8th Foot.<p>In June, at <!--del_lnk--> Brentwood, the colours of the two regiments were paraded for the last time in the presence of <!--del_lnk--> Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. The <b><!--del_lnk--> King&#39;s Regiment (Manchester and Liverpool)</b> formally came into being on <!--del_lnk--> 1 September <!--del_lnk--> 1958. On <!--del_lnk--> 1 July 2006, the successor regiment was also amalgamated, joining with two others to form the <!--del_lnk--> Duke of Lancaster&#39;s Regiment (King&#39;s Lancashire and Border).<p>The surviving territorial battalion of the King&#39;s (Liverpool), the 5th, retained its identity until 1967, when it was reduced to a company of the newly-formed <!--del_lnk--> Lancastrian Volunteers. As of 2006, it forms &quot;A&quot; Company, in the 4th Battalion of the Duke of Lancaster&#39;s Regiment. Contained within the company is the Liverpool Scottish Platoon.<p><a id="Battalions" name="Battalions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Battalions</span></h2>
