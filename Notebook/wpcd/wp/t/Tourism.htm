      <p><b>Tourism</b> is the act of <!--del_lnk--> travel for predominantly <!--del_lnk--> recreational or <a href="../../wp/l/Leisure.htm" title="Leisure">leisure</a> purposes, and also refers to the provision of services in support of this act. According to the <!--del_lnk--> World Tourism Organization, <b>tourists</b> are people who &quot;travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited&quot;. The distance between a place of origin and a tourism destination is immaterial to this definition. Tourism has become an extremely popular, global activity. In 2004, there were over 763 million international tourist arrivals.<p>As a <!--del_lnk--> service industry, tourism has numerous tangible and intangible elements. Major tangible elements include <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transportation</a>, accommodation, and other components of a <!--del_lnk--> hospitality industry. Major intangible elements relate to the purpose or motivation for becoming a tourist, such as rest, relaxation, the opportunity to meet new people and experience other cultures, or simply to do something different and have an adventure.<p>Tourism is vital for many countries, due to the income generated by the consumption of goods and services by tourists, the taxes levied on businesses in the tourism industry, and the opportunity for employment and economic advancement by working in the industry. For these reasons <!--del_lnk--> NGOs and government agencies may sometimes promote a specific region as a tourist destination, and support the development of a tourism industry in that area. The contemporary phenomenon of mass tourism may sometimes result in <!--del_lnk--> overdevelopment, however alternative forms of tourism such as <!--del_lnk--> ecotourism seek to avoid such outcomes by pursuing tourism in a <!--del_lnk--> sustainable way.<p>The terms <i>tourism</i> and <i>travel</i> are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms <i>tourism</i> and <i>tourist</i> are sometimes used pejoratively to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited by tourists.<p>

      <p>One of the earliest definitions of tourism was provided by the Austrian economist <!--del_lnk--> Hermann Von Schullard in <!--del_lnk--> 1910, who defined it as, &quot;sum total of operators, mainly of an economic nature, which directly relate to the entry, stay and movement of foreigners inside and outside a certain country, city or a region.&quot;<p>Hunziker and Krapf, in <!--del_lnk--> 1941, defined tourism as &quot;the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1976 Tourism Society of England defined it as &quot;Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destination outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.&quot;<p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1981 <!--del_lnk--> International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined Tourism in terms of particular activities selected by choice and undertaken outside the home environment.<p><a id="United_Nations_Definition" name="United_Nations_Definition"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">United Nations Definition</span></h3>
      <p>United Nations classified 3 forms of tourism in 1994 in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics as follows:<ol>
       <li>Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country;<li>Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country;<li>Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country.</ol>
      <p>UN also derived different categories of tourism by combining the 3 basic forms of tourism:<ol>
       <li>Internal tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and inbound tourism;<li>National tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and outbound tourism;<li>International tourism, which consists of inbound tourism and outbound tourism.</ol>
      <p><a id="Prerequisites_of_tourism" name="Prerequisites_of_tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Prerequisites of tourism</span></h3>
      <p>Before people are able to experience tourism they usually need at least:<ol>

      <p>Individually, sufficient <a href="../../wp/h/Health.htm" title="Health">health</a> is also a condition, and of course the inclination to travel. Furthermore, in some countries there are legal restrictions on travelling, especially abroad. Certain states with strong governmental control over the lives of citizens (notably established <!--del_lnk--> Communist states) may restrict foreign travel only to trustworthy citizens. The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> prohibits its citizens from traveling to some countries, for example, <a href="../../wp/c/Cuba.htm" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The history of European tourism can perhaps be said to originate with the medieval <!--del_lnk--> pilgrimage. Although undertaken primarily for religious reasons, the pilgrims in the <!--del_lnk--> Canterbury Tales quite clearly saw the experience as a kind of <!--del_lnk--> holiday (the term itself being derived from the &#39;holy day&#39; and its associated leisure activities). Pilgrimages created a variety of tourist aspects that still exist - bringing back souvenirs, obtaining credit with foreign banks (in medieval times utilising international networks established by Jews and Lombards), and making use of space available on existing forms of transport (such as the use of medieval English wine ships bound for Vigo by pilgrims to Santiago De Compostela). Pilgrimages are still important in modern tourism - such as to <!--del_lnk--> Lourdes or <!--del_lnk--> Knock in Ireland. But there are modern equivalents - <!--del_lnk--> Graceland and the grave of <!--del_lnk--> Jim Morrison in <!--del_lnk--> P&egrave;re Lachaise Cemetery.<p>During the seventeenth century, it became fashionable in England to undertake a <!--del_lnk--> Grand Tour. The sons of the <!--del_lnk--> nobility and <!--del_lnk--> gentry were sent upon an extended tour of Europe as an educational experience. The eighteenth century was the golden age of the Grand Tour, and many of the fashionable visitors were painted at Rome by <!--del_lnk--> Pompeo Batoni. A modern equivalent of the Grand Tour is the phenomenon of the <!--del_lnk--> backpacker, although cultural holidays, such as those offered by Swann-Hellenic, are also important.<p>Health tourism has always existed, but it was not until the <!--del_lnk--> eighteenth century that it became important. In England, it was associated with <!--del_lnk--> spas, places with supposedly health-giving <!--del_lnk--> mineral waters, treating diseases from <!--del_lnk--> gout to <!--del_lnk--> liver disorders and <!--del_lnk--> bronchitis. <!--del_lnk--> Bath was the most fashionable resort, but <!--del_lnk--> Buxton, <!--del_lnk--> Harrogate, and <!--del_lnk--> Tunbridge Wells, amongst others, also flourished. Of course, people visited these places for the balls and other entertainments, just as much as &#39;the waters&#39;. Continental Spas such as <!--del_lnk--> Karlsbad attracted many fashionable travellers by the <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century.<p>It could be argued that Britain was the home of the seaside holiday. In travelling to the coast, the population was following in the steps of Royalty. <!--del_lnk--> King George III made regular visits to <!--del_lnk--> Weymouth when in poor health. At the time, a number of doctors argued the benefits of bathing in sea water, and sea bathing as a widespread practice was popularised by the <!--del_lnk--> Prince Regent (later <!--del_lnk--> George IV), who frequented <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> for this purpose.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Leisure travel was associated with the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">industrialization</a> of <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> &ndash; the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, the factory owners, and the traders. These comprised the new <!--del_lnk--> middle class. <!--del_lnk--> Cox &amp; Kings were the first official travel company to be formed in 1758. Later, the <!--del_lnk--> working class could take advantage of leisure time.<p>The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. At <!--del_lnk--> Nice, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the <!--del_lnk--> French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the <i>Promenade des Anglais</i>; in many other historic resorts in <!--del_lnk--> continental Europe, old well-established palace hotels have names like the <i>Hotel Bristol</i>, the <i>Hotel Carlton</i> or the <i>Hotel Majestic</i> - reflecting the dominance of <a href="../../wp/e/England.htm" title="England">English</a> customers.<p><a id="Winter_tourism" name="Winter_tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Winter tourism</span></h3>
      <p><!--del_lnk--> Winter sports were largely invented by the British leisured classes, initially at the <a href="../../wp/s/Switzerland.htm" title="Switzerland">Swiss</a> village of <!--del_lnk--> Zermatt (<!--del_lnk--> Valais), and <!--del_lnk--> St Moritz in <!--del_lnk--> 1864. The first <!--del_lnk--> packaged winter sports holidays took place in <!--del_lnk--> 1902 at <!--del_lnk--> Adelboden, Switzerland. Winter sports were a natural answer for a leisured class looking for amusement during the coldest season.<p>Organized sport was well established in Britain before it reached other countries. The vocabulary of sport bears witness to this: <a href="../../wp/r/Rugby_football.htm" title="Rugby football">rugby</a>, <a href="../../wp/f/Football_%2528soccer%2529.htm" title="Football (soccer)">football</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> boxing all originated in Britain, and even <a href="../../wp/t/Tennis.htm" title="Tennis">tennis</a>, originally a French sport, was formalized and codified by the British, who hosted the first national championship in the nineteenth century, at <!--del_lnk--> Wimbledon.<p><a id="Mass_travel" name="Mass_travel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mass travel</span></h3>
      <p><b>Mass travel</b> could only develop with two crucial features:<ol>
       <li>improvements in technology allowed the <a href="../../wp/t/Transport.htm" title="Transport">transport</a> of large numbers of people in a short space of time to places of leisure interest, and<li>greater numbers of people began to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.</ol>

      <p>The pioneer of modern mass tourism was <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Cook who, on <!--del_lnk--> 5 July <!--del_lnk--> 1841, organized the first <!--del_lnk--> package tour in history. He arranged for the <!--del_lnk--> rail company to charge one <!--del_lnk--> shilling per person for a group of 570 <!--del_lnk--> temperance campaigners from <a href="../../wp/l/Leicester.htm" title="Leicester">Leicester</a> to a rally in <!--del_lnk--> Loughborough, eleven miles away. Cook was paid a share of the fares actually charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. There had been railway excursions before, but this one included entrance to an entertainment held in private grounds, rail tickets and food for the train journey. Cook immediately saw the potential of a convenient &#39;off the peg&#39; holiday product in which everything was included in one cost. He organised packages inclusive of accommodation for the <!--del_lnk--> Great Exhibition, and afterwards pioneered <!--del_lnk--> package holidays in both Britain (particularly in Scotland) and on the European continent (where Paris and the Alps were the most popular destinations).<p>He was soon followed by others (the <!--del_lnk--> Polytechnic Touring Association, Dean and Dawson etc.), with the result that the tourist industry developed rapidly in late <!--del_lnk--> Victorian Britain. Initially it was supported by the growing middle classes, who had time off from their work, and who could afford the luxury of travel and possibly even staying for periods of time in <!--del_lnk--> boarding houses.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Bank Holidays Act 1871 introduced a statutory right for workers to take holidays, even if they were not paid at the time. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the tradition of the working class holiday had become firmly established in Britain. These were largely focussed upon the seaside resorts.<p>The spread of the <!--del_lnk--> railway network in the <!--del_lnk--> nineteenth century resulted in the growth of Britain&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> seaside towns by bringing them within easy distance of Britain&#39;s urban centres. <a href="../../wp/b/Blackpool.htm" title="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> was created by the construction of a line to <!--del_lnk--> Fleetwood, and some resorts were promoted by the railway companies themselves - <!--del_lnk--> Morecambe by the <!--del_lnk--> Midland Railway and <!--del_lnk--> Cleethorpes by the <!--del_lnk--> Great Central Railway. Other resorts included <!--del_lnk--> Scarborough in <!--del_lnk--> Yorkshire, servicing Leeds and Bradford; <a href="../../wp/w/Weston-super-Mare.htm" title="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> in <!--del_lnk--> Somerset, catering for the inhabitants of Bristol; and <!--del_lnk--> Skegness, patronised by the residents of the industrial East Midlands. The <!--del_lnk--> cockneys of <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> flocked to <!--del_lnk--> Southend-on-Sea, mainly by <a href="../../wp/r/River_Thames.htm" title="River Thames">Thames</a> <!--del_lnk--> Steamer, and the South Coast resorts such as <!--del_lnk--> Broadstairs, <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a>, and <!--del_lnk--> Eastbourne were only a train ride away, with others further afield such as <!--del_lnk--> Bournemouth, <!--del_lnk--> Bognor Regis and <a href="../../wp/w/Weymouth.htm" title="Weymouth">Weymouth</a>.<p>For a century, domestic <strong class="selflink">tourism</strong> was the norm, with foreign travel being reserved for the rich or the culturally curious. A number of inland destinations, such as the <!--del_lnk--> English Lake District, and <a href="../../wp/s/Snowdonia.htm" title="Snowdonia">Snowdonia</a> appealed to those who liked the countryside and fine scenery. The <!--del_lnk--> holiday camp began to appear in the 1930s, but this phenomenon really expanded in the post-war period. <!--del_lnk--> Butlins and <!--del_lnk--> Pontins set this trend, but their popularity waned with the rise of overseas package tours and the increasing comforts to which visitors became accustomed at home. Towards the end of the <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a> this market has been revived by the upmarket inland resorts of Dutch company <!--del_lnk--> Centre Parcs.<p>Cox &amp; Co, the forebear of <!--del_lnk--> Cox &amp; Kings were in existence from 1758 largely entwined with the travel arrangements for the British Army serving around the Empire. While acting as &#39;agents&#39; for various regiments, they organised the payment, provision, clothing and travel arrangements for members of the armed forces. In the 19th century their network of offices contained a banking and also travel department. The company became heavily involved with affairs in India and its Shipping Agency had offices in France and the Middle East.<p>Other phenomena that helped develop the travel industry were paid holidays:<ul>
       <li>1.5 million manual workers in Britain had paid holidays by <!--del_lnk--> 1925<li>11 million by <!--del_lnk--> 1939 (30% of the population in families with paid holidays)</ul>
      <p><a id="Outside_Britain" name="Outside_Britain"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Outside Britain</span></h4>
      <p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">USA</a>, the first great seaside resort, in the European style, was <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic City, New Jersey.<p>In Continental Europe, early resorts included <!--del_lnk--> Ostend (for the people of <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>), and <!--del_lnk--> Boulogne-sur-Mer (<!--del_lnk--> Pas-de-Calais) and <!--del_lnk--> Deauville (<!--del_lnk--> Calvados) (for <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Parisians</a>).<p><a id="International_mass_tourism" name="International_mass_tourism"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">International mass tourism</span></h3>
      <p>Increasing speed on railways meant that the tourist industry could develop internationally.<p>To this may be added the development of sea travel. By <!--del_lnk--> 1901, the number of people crossing the <a href="../../wp/e/English_Channel.htm" title="English Channel">English Channel</a> from England to <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> or <a href="../../wp/b/Belgium.htm" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> had passed 0.5 million per year. Shipping companies were anxious to fill cabin space that was under utilised. For example, <!--del_lnk--> P&amp;O found that the majority of their passengers for India and the Far East joined the ship at Marseilles. Consequently, they marketed holidays based upon sea trips from London to Lisbon and Gibraltar.

      <p>However, the real age of international mass travel began with the growth of air travel after World War Two. In the immediate post-war period, there was a surplus of transport aircraft, such as the popular and reliable <!--del_lnk--> Douglas Dakota, and a number of ex military pilots ready to fly them. They were available for <!--del_lnk--> charter flights, and tour operators began to use them for European destinations, such as Paris and Ostend.<p><!--del_lnk--> Vladimir Raitz pioneered modern package tourism when on <!--del_lnk--> 20 May <!--del_lnk--> 1950 his recently founded company, Horizon, provided arrangements for a two-week holiday in <!--del_lnk--> Corsica. For an all inclusive price of &pound;32.10s.-, holiday makers could sleep under canvas, sample local wines and eat a meal containing meat twice a day - this was especially attractive due to the continuing <!--del_lnk--> austerity measures in post-war United Kingdom. Within ten years, his company had started mass tourism to <!--del_lnk--> Palma (1952), <!--del_lnk--> Lourdes (1953), <!--del_lnk--> Costa Brava (1954), <!--del_lnk--> Sardinia (1954), <!--del_lnk--> Minorca (1955), <!--del_lnk--> Porto (1956), <!--del_lnk--> Costa Blanca (1957) and <!--del_lnk--> Costa del Sol (1959).<p>However it was with cheap <!--del_lnk--> air travel in combination with the package tour that international mass tourism developed. The postwar introduction of an international system of <!--del_lnk--> airline regulation was another important factor. The bilateral agreements at the heart of the system fixed seat prices, and airlines could not fill blocks of empty seats on underused flights by discounting. But if they were purchased by a tour operator and hidden within the price of an inclusive holiday package, it would be difficult to prove that discounting had taken place - even though it was obvious that it had! This was the origin of the modern mass package tour.<p>These developments coincided with a significant increase in the standard of living in Britain. At the end of the 1950s, <a href="../../wp/h/Harold_Macmillan.htm" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> could say &quot;you&#39;ve never had it so good.&quot;<p>Another significant development also happened at the end of this decade. The devaluation of the <!--del_lnk--> Spanish peseta made <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> appear a particularly attractive destination. The cheapness of the cost of living attracted increasing numbers of visitors. Mass package tourism has at times been an exploitative process, in which tour operators in a country with a high standard of living make use of development opportunities and low operating costs in a country with a lower standard of living. However, as witness the development of many tourist areas in previously poor parts of the world, and the concomitant rise in standards of living, when there is equality of bargaining power, both parties can gain economic benefits from this arrangement.<p><a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Balearic Islands became major tourist destinations, and development probably peaked in the 1980s. At the same time, British tour operators developed the <!--del_lnk--> Algarve in <a href="../../wp/p/Portugal.htm" title="Portugal">Portugal</a>. The continuing search for new, cheaper, destinations spread mass tourism to the <!--del_lnk--> Greek Islands, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Tunisia.htm" title="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, parts of the coast of <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and more recently <a href="../../wp/c/Croatia.htm" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>.<p>For the worker living in greater <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Venice today is almost as accessible as <a href="../../wp/b/Brighton.htm" title="Brighton">Brighton</a> was 100 years ago. Consequently, the British seaside resort experienced a marked decline from the 1970s onwards. Some, such as <!--del_lnk--> New Brighton have disappeared. Others have reinvented themselves, and now cater to daytrippers and the weekend break market.<p><a id="Recent_developments" name="Recent_developments"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Recent developments</span></h2>

      <p>There has been a discernible upmarket trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe where international travel for short breaks is commonplace. Tourists have higher levels of disposable income and greater leisure time. They are also better educated and have more sophisticated tastes. There is now a demand for a better quality product in many quarters. This has resulted in the following trends:-<ul>
       <li>The old &#39;sun, sea, and sand&#39; mass market has fragmented. People want more specialised versions of it, such as &#39;Club 18 -30&#39;, quieter resorts with select hotels, self-catering, etc.<li>People are taking second holidays in the form of short breaks/city breaks, ranging from British and European cities to country hotels.<li>There has been a growth in niche markets catering for special interests or activities, including growth of <!--del_lnk--> destination hotels.</ul>
      <p>The developments in technology and transport infrastructure (particularly the advent of jumbo jets) have placed some types of holiday in the affordable mainstream:-<ul>
       <li>The development of a mass cruise holiday market.<li>The advent of affordable holidays to long-haul destinations such as Thailand or Kenya.<li>The phenomenon of the low budget airline, utilising a new generation of small regional airports.</ul>
      <p>There have also been changes in lifestyle, which may call into question the current definitions of tourism. Some people (particularly the 45+ and retired) may be adopting a tourism lifestyle, living as a tourist all the year round - eating out several times a week, going to the theatre, daytripping, and indulging in short breaks several times a year.<p>Much of this results in impulse purchasing. This is facilitated by internet purchasing of tourism products. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor- made package requested by the customer upon impulse.<p>There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as Bali and European cities. Some of the tourist destinations, including the Costa del Sol, the Baleares and Canc&uacute;n have lost popularity due to shifting tastes. In this context, the excessive building and environmental destruction often associated with traditional &quot;sun and beach&quot; tourism may contribute to a destination&#39;s saturation and subsequent decline. This appears to be the case with Spain&#39;s Costa Brava, a byword for this kind of tourism in the 1960s and 1970s. With only 11% of the Costa Brava now unblemished by low-quality development (Greenpeace Spain&#39;s figure), the destination now faces a crisis in its tourist industry.<p>Sustainable tourism is becoming more popular as people start to realize the devastating effects tourism can have on communities.<p>Receptive tourism is now growing at a very rapid rate in many developing countries, where it is often the most important economic activity in local GDP.<p>In recent years, second holidays or vacations have become more popular as people&#39;s discretionary income increases. Typical combinations are a package to the typical mass tourist resort, with a winter skiing holiday or weekend break to a city or national park.<p>On December 26, 2004 a tsunami, caused by the <a href="../../wp/2/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake.htm" title="2004 Indian Ocean earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a> hit Asian countries bordering the Indian Ocean, and also the Maldives. Tens of thousands of lives were lost, and many tourists died. This, together with the vast clean-up operation in place, has stopped or severely hampered tourism to the area.<p><a id="Special_forms_of_tourism" name="Special_forms_of_tourism"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Special forms of tourism</span></h2>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4&nbsp;%. By 2020 <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a> will remain the most popular destination, but its share will drop from 60&nbsp;% in 1995 to 46&nbsp;%. Long-haul will grow slightly faster than intraregional travel and by 2020 its share will increase from 18&nbsp;% in 1995 to 24&nbsp;%.<p>With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.) can sell their services directly. This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.<p><!--del_lnk--> Space tourism is expected to &quot;take off&quot; in the first quarter of the <a href="../../wp/2/21st_century.htm" title="21st century">21st century</a>, although compared with traditional destinations the number of tourists in orbit will remain low until technologies such as a <!--del_lnk--> space elevator make space travel cheap.<p>Technological improvement is likely to make possible air-ship hotels, based either on <!--del_lnk--> solar-powered airplanes or large <a href="../../wp/a/Airship.htm" title="Dirigible">dirigibles</a>. Underwater hotels, such as <!--del_lnk--> Hydropolis, expected to open in <a href="../../wp/d/Dubai.htm" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 2006, will be built. On the ocean tourists will be welcomed by ever larger cruise ships and perhaps <!--del_lnk--> floating cities.<p>Some futurists expect that movable hotel &quot;pods&quot; will be created that could be temporarily erected anywhere on the planet, where building a permanent resort would be unacceptable politically, economically or environmentally.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism&quot;</div>
