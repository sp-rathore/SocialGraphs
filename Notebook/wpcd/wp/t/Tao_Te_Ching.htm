      <p>The <i><b>Tao Te Ching</b></i> (<!--del_lnk--> Traditional Chinese: <span lang="zh-Hant" xml:lang="zh-Hant">&#x9053;&#x5FB7;&#x7D93;</span> [<span class="unicode audiolink"><!--del_lnk--> Listen</span>&nbsp;]), roughly translatable as <i><b>The Book of the Way and its Virtue</b></i> (see <a href="#Title" title="">below</a>), is a <!--del_lnk--> Chinese classic text. According to tradition, it was written around <!--del_lnk--> 600 BCE by the <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoist</a> sage <a href="../../wp/l/Laozi.htm" title="Laozi">Laozi</a> (or Lao Tzu, &quot;Old Master&quot;), a record-keeper at the <!--del_lnk--> Zhou Dynasty court. A careful reading of the text, however, suggests that it is a compilation of <!--del_lnk--> maxims sharing similar themes. The text&#39;s authenticity, authorship, and date of composition or compilation are still debated.<p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is fundamental to the <a href="../../wp/t/Taoism.htm" title="Taoism">Taoist</a> school (<i>Daojia</i> <span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x9053;&#x5BB6;</span>) of <!--del_lnk--> Chinese philosophy and strongly influenced other schools as well, such as <!--del_lnk--> Legalism and <!--del_lnk--> Neo-Confucianism. This ancient book is also central in <!--del_lnk--> Chinese religion, not only for Taoism (<i>Daojiao</i> &#x9053;&#x6559;) but <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including <!--del_lnk--> poets, <!--del_lnk--> painters, <a href="../../wp/c/Calligraphy.htm" title="Calligraphy">calligraphers</a>, and even <!--del_lnk--> gardeners have used the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, aided by hundreds of translations into Western languages.<p>

      <p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> has a long and complex textual history. On one hand, there are transmitted versions and commentaries that date back two millennia; on the other, there are ancient bamboo, silk, and paper manuscripts that archeologists discovered in the last century.<p><a id="Title" name="Title"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Title</span></h3>
      <p>There are many possible translations of the book&#39;s title, owing to the <!--del_lnk--> polysemy of the component <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> words:<ul>
       <li><i>D&agrave;o/<!--del_lnk--> Tao</i> <!--del_lnk--> &#x9053; literally means &quot;way&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, or &quot;route,&quot; but was extended to mean &quot;path ahead&quot;, &quot;way forward&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, &quot;principle&quot;, &quot;doctrine&quot;, or simply &quot;the Way&quot;. This term, which was variously used by other Chinese philosophers (including <a href="../../wp/c/Confucius.htm" title="Confucius">Confucius</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Mencius, <!--del_lnk--> Mozi, and <!--del_lnk--> Hanfeizi), has special meaning within the context of Taoism, where it implies the essential, unnamable process of the universe.<li><i>D&eacute;/Te</i> <!--del_lnk--> &#x5FB7; basically means &quot;virtue&quot; in the sense of &quot;personal character&quot;, &quot;inner strength&quot;, or &quot;integrity&quot;, but was used differently by Confucianists to mean &quot;morality&quot;. The semantics of this Chinese word resemble English <i>virtue</i>, which developed from a (now archaic) sense of &quot;inner potency&quot; or &quot;divine power&quot; (as in &quot;healing virtue of a drug&quot;) to the modern meaning of &quot;moral excellence&quot; or &quot;goodness&quot;. Compare the <!--del_lnk--> compound word <i>d&agrave;od&eacute;</i> (&#x9053;&#x5FB7; &quot;ethics&quot;, &quot;ethical principles&quot;, &quot;morals,&quot; or &quot;morality&quot;).<li><i>J&#x12B;ng/Ching</i> <!--del_lnk--> &#x7D93; originally meant &quot;norm&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;plan&quot;, &quot;warp&quot; (vs. &quot;woof&quot;) and was semantically extended to mean &quot;scripture&quot;, &quot;canon&quot;, &quot;great book&quot;, or &quot;classic&quot;.</ul>
      <p>Thus, <i>Tao Te Ching</i> can be translated as &quot;The Scripture/Classic/Canon of the Way/Path and the Power/Virtue&quot;, etc.<p>Besides <i>Daode Jing</i>, other titles include the <!--del_lnk--> eponymous <i>Laozi</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8001;&#x5B50;</span> &quot;Old Master[s]&quot;), the amalgam <i>Laozi Daode Jing</i> (&#x8001;&#x5B50;&#x9053;&#x5FB7;&#x7D93;), the honorific <i>Daode Zhen Jing</i> (&#x9053;&#x5FB7;&#x771F;&#x7D93; &quot;Perfect Classic of the Way and the Power&quot;), and the <i>Wuqian wen</i> (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x4E94;&#x5343;&#x6587;</span> &quot;Five thousand character [classic]&quot;; see next).<p><a id="Internal_structure" name="Internal_structure"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Internal structure</span></h3>
      <p>The received <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is a short text of around 5,000 <!--del_lnk--> Chinese characters in 81 brief chapters or sections (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x7AE0;</span>). It has two parts, the <i>Tao Ching</i> (&#x9053;&#x7D93;; chaps. 1&ndash;37) and the <i>Te Ching</i> (&#x5FB7;&#x7D93;; chaps. 38&ndash;81), which may have been edited together into the received text, possibly reversed from an original &quot;Te Tao Ching&quot; (see Mawangdui texts below). The written style is laconic, with few <!--del_lnk--> grammatical particles, frequently ambiguous, occasionally rhymed, and expressing often difficult ideas poetically.<p>The Chinese characters in the original versions were probably written in <i>zhu&agrave;nsh&#x16B;</i> (&#x7BC6;&#x66F8; <!--del_lnk--> seal script), while later versions were written in <i>l&igrave;sh&#x16B;</i> (&#x96B7;&#x66F8; <!--del_lnk--> clerical script) and <i>k&#x1CE;ish&#x16B;</i> (&#x6977;&#x66F8; <!--del_lnk--> regular script) styles. <!--del_lnk--> Daoist Chinese Characters contains a good summary of these different calligraphies.<p><a id="Historical_authenticity" name="Historical_authenticity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Historical authenticity</span></h3>
      <p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is universally ascribed to <a href="../../wp/l/Laozi.htm" title="Laozi">Laozi</a>, who may, or may not, have been a historical person (&quot;Old Master&quot;), or people (&quot;Old Masters&quot;). No one can be certain; indeed, Laozi &quot;was a hidden sage&quot; (Kaltenmark 1969:10).<p>The first reliable reference to Laozi is his &quot;biography&quot; in the circa 100 BCE <!--del_lnk--> Shiji (63, tr. Chan 1963:35-37), by Chinese historian <!--del_lnk--> Sima Qian, which combines three stories. First, Laozi was a contemporary of Confucius (551-479 BCE), his surname was Li (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x674E;</span> &quot;plum&quot;) and personal name was Er (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8033;</span> &quot;ear&quot;) or Dan (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8043;</span> &quot;long ear&quot;). He was an official in the imperial archives, and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the West. Second, Laozi was Lao Laizi (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8001;&#x4F86;&#x5B50;</span> &quot;Old Come Master&quot;), also a contemporary of Confucius, who wrote a book in 15 parts, and lived to an age of more than 160 (or 200) years. Third, Laozi was the Grand Historian and astrologer Lao Dan (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x8001;&#x8043;</span> &quot;Old Long-ears&quot;), who lived during the reign (384-362 BCE) of Duke Xian (&#x737B;&#x516C;) of <!--del_lnk--> Qin). Boltz (1993:270) concludes this biography &quot;contains virtually nothing that is demonstrably factual; we are left no choice but to acknowledge the likely fictional nature of the traditional [Laozi] figure.&quot;<p>Generations of scholars have debated the historicity of Laozi and the dating of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>. Linguistic studies of the text&#39;s vocabulary and <!--del_lnk--> rhyme scheme point to a date of composition after the <!--del_lnk--> Shi Jing yet before the <!--del_lnk--> Zhuangzi &mdash; around the late 4th or early 3rd centuries BCE.<p>Some supporters of Taosim attribute this debate to the folkloric age of Laozi of over 900 years old who had thirteen incarnates starting around the time of the Three Sovereigns, a view obviously rejected by scholars.<p><a id="Principal_versions" name="Principal_versions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Principal versions</span></h3>
      <p>Among the many transmitted editions of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> text, the three primary ones are named after early commentaries. The &quot;Yan Zun Version,&quot; which is only extant for the <i>Te Ching</i>, derives from a commentary attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Han Dynasty scholar Yan Zun (&#x5DD6;&#x5C0A;, fl. 80 BCE-10 CE). The &quot;Heshang Gong Version&quot; is named after the legendary Heshang Gong (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x6CB3;&#x4E0A;&#x516C;</span> &quot;Riverside Sage&quot;) who supposedly lived during the reign (202-157 BCE) of <!--del_lnk--> Emperor Wen of Han. This commentary (tr. Erkes 1950) has a preface written by Ge Xuan (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x845B;&#x7384;</span>, 164-244 CE), grand-uncle of <!--del_lnk--> Ge Hong, and scholarship dates this version to around the 3rd century CE. The &quot;Wang Bi Version&quot; has more verifiable origins than either of the above. <!--del_lnk--> Wang Bi (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x738B;&#x5F3C;</span>, 226 &ndash; 249 CE) was a famous <!--del_lnk--> Three Kingdoms period philosopher and commentator on the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> (tr. Lin 1977, Rump and Chan 1979) and the <i><!--del_lnk--> Yi Jing</i>.<p><i>Tao Te Ching</i> scholarship has lately advanced from archeological discoveries of manuscripts, some of which are older than any of the received texts. Beginning in the <!--del_lnk--> 1920s and <!--del_lnk--> 1930s, <!--del_lnk--> Marc Aurel Stein and others found thousands of scrolls in the <!--del_lnk--> Mogao Caves near <!--del_lnk--> Dunhuang. They included over 50 partial and complete <i>Tao Te Ching</i> manuscripts. One written by the scribe So/Su Dan (&#x7D20;&#x7D71;) is dated 270 CE, and corresponds closely with the Heshang Gong version. Another partial manuscript has the Xiang&#39;er (&#x60F3;&#x723E;) commentary, which had previously been lost. In <!--del_lnk--> 1973, archeologists discovered copies of early Chinese books, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Mawangdui Silk Texts, in a tomb dating from 168 BCE. They included two nearly complete copies of the <i>Laozi</i>, referred to as Text A (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x7532;</span>) and Text B (<span lang="zh" xml:lang="zh">&#x4E59;</span>), both of which reverse the traditional ordering and put the <i>Te Ching</i> section before the <i>Tao Ching</i>. Based on calligraphic styles and imperial <!--del_lnk--> naming taboo avoidances, scholars believe that A and B can be respectively dated to about the first and third decades of the 2nd century BCE (Boltz 1993:284). In <!--del_lnk--> 1993, the oldest known version of the text, written on bamboo tablets, was found in a tomb near the town of Guodian and dated prior to 300 BCE. The <!--del_lnk--> Guodian Chu Slips comprise about 800 slips of bamboo with a total of over 13,000 characters, about 2,000 of which correspond with the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, including 14 previously unknown verses. Both the Mawangdui and Guodian versions are generally consistent with the received texts, excepting differences in chapter sequence and graphic variants. Several recent <i>Tao Te Ching</i> translations (e.g., Lau 1989, Henricks 1989, Mair 1990, Henricks 2000, Allan and Williams 2000, and Roberts 2004) utilize these two versions, sometimes with the verses reordered to synthesize the new finds.<p><a id="Interpretation_and_themes" name="Interpretation_and_themes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Interpretation and themes</span></h2>
      <p>Many believe the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> contains universal truths that have been independently recognized in other philosophies, both religious and secular. Depending on interpretation, some ambiguous passages have multiple readings, ranging from political advice for rulers to practical wisdom for people. The following themes and concepts are central to interpreting the text.<p><a id="Ineffability" name="Ineffability"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Ineffability</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>The Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way;<dd>The names that can be named are not unvarying names.<dd>It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang;<dd>The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind. (chap. 1, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )</dl>
      <p>These famous first lines of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> ironically state that the Tao is ineffable. Wikipedia&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> List of snowclones includes &quot;The <b>X</b> that can be <b>Y</b> is not the true <b>X</b>&quot; and cites the original as &quot;The <!--del_lnk--> Tao which can be spoken of is not the true Tao.&quot;<p>Tao is nameless, goes beyond distinctions, and transcends language. Perhaps the Tao, like the <!--del_lnk--> Dharma, is what physicist <!--del_lnk--> David Bohm means by &quot;that which is&quot;, perfectly being what is, both all and nothing. &quot;My words are very easy to understand and very easy to put into practice. Yet no one under heaven understands them; no one puts them into practice&quot; (chap. 70, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )<p><a id="The_Mysterious_Female" name="The_Mysterious_Female"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">The Mysterious Female</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>The Valley Spirit never dies<dd>It is named the Mysterious Female.<dd>And the doorway of the Mysterious Female<dd>Is the base from which Heaven and Earth sprang.<dd>It is there within us all the while;<dd>Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry. (chap. 6, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )</dl>
      <p>Like the above description of the ineffable Tao as &quot;the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures&quot;, the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> advocates &quot;female&quot; (or <i><!--del_lnk--> Yin</i>) values, emphasizing the fluid and soft qualities of water (which can overcome the solid and hard), and &quot;having without possessing&quot;. This theme challenges &quot;male&quot; (or <i>Yang</i>) values such as stability, positive action, and domination of nature, which can be referred to as &quot;Confucian values.&quot; Yin and Yang should be balanced, &quot;Know masculinity, Maintain femininity, and be a ravine for all under heaven.&quot; (chap. 28, tr. Mair)<p><a id="Returning" name="Returning"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Returning</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>In Tao the only motion is returning;<dd>The only useful quality, weakness.<dd>For though all creatures under heaven are the products of Being,<dd>Being itself is the product of Not-being. &quot; (chap. 40, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )</dl>
      <p>Another theme is the <!--del_lnk--> eternal return, or what Mair (1990:139) calls &quot;the continual return of the myriad creatures to the cosmic principle from which they arose.&quot;<p>There is a contrast between the rigidity of death and the weakness of life: &quot;When he is born, man is soft and weak; in death he becomes stiff and hard. The ten thousand creatures and all plants and trees while they are alive are supple and soft, but when and dead they become brittle and dry.&quot; (chap. 76, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ). This is returning to the beginning of things, or to one&#39;s own childhood.<p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> focuses upon the beginnings of society, and describes a golden age in the past, comparable with the ideas of <a href="../../wp/j/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau.htm" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>. Human problems arose from the &quot;invention&quot; of culture and civilization. In this idealized past, &ldquo;the people should have no use for any form of writing save knotted ropes, should be contented with their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with their homes, should take pleasure in their rustic tasks.&quot; (chap. 80, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )<p>However, &quot;returning&quot; is not a simplistic reactionary retreat. Two illustrations are the anti-Confucianist saying that, &quot;Learning consists in adding to one&#39;s stock day by day; The practice of Tao consists in &#39;subtracting day by day&#39;.&quot; (chap. 48, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ); and this strategic advice &ldquo;If you doubt your ability to advance an inch, then retreat a foot&rdquo;. (chap. 69, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ) Diminishing one&#39;s ego, instead of &quot;improving&quot; it through study, is the path to real wisdom. Letting the enemy take the first step (thus reducing his range of possibilities) is the way to gain the upper hand. This theme is similar to psychological practices such as introspection or meditation, but one returns not to oneself but to nothingness, to &quot;that which is&quot;.<p><a id="Emptiness" name="Emptiness"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Emptiness</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel;<dd>But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the wheel depends.<dd>We turn clay to make a vessel;<dd>But it is on the space where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel depends.<dd>We pierce doors and windows to make a house;<dd>And it is on these spaces where there is nothing that the usefulness of the house depends.<dd>Therefore just as we take advantage of what is, we should recognize the usefulness of what is not. (chap. 11, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )</dl>
      <p>Philosophical vacuity is a common theme among Asian wisdom traditions including Taoism (especially <i><!--del_lnk--> Wu wei</i> &quot;nonaction&quot;), Buddhism, and some aspects of Confucianism. One could interpret the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> as a suite of variations on the &quot;Powers of Nothingness&quot;. This resonates with the Buddhist <!--del_lnk--> Shunyata philosophy of &quot;form is emptiness, emptiness is form.&quot;<p>Looking at a traditional Chinese <a href="../../wp/l/Landscape.htm" title="Landscape">landscape</a>, one can understand how emptiness (the unpainted) has the power of animating the trees, mountains, and rivers it surrounds. Emptiness can mean having no fixed preconceptions, preferences, intentions, or agenda. Since &quot;The Sage has no heart of his own; He uses the heart of the people as his heart.&quot; (chap. 49, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ). From a ruler&#39;s point of view, it is a <i><!--del_lnk--> laissez-faire</i> approach:<dl>
       <dd>So a wise leader may say:<dd>&quot;I practice inaction, and the people look after themselves.&quot;<dd>But from the Sage it is so hard at any price to get a single word<dd>That when his task is accomplished, his work done,<dd>Throughout the country every one says: &ldquo;It happened of its own accord&rdquo;. (chap. 17, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> )</dl>
      <p><a id="Knowledge" name="Knowledge"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Knowledge</span></h3>
      <dl>
       <dd>Knowing others is wisdom;<dd>Knowing the self is enlightenment.<dd>Mastering others requires force;<dd>Mastering the self requires strength;<dd>He who knows he has enough is rich.<dd>Perseverance is a sign of will power.<dd>He who stays where he is endures.<dd>To die but not to perish is to be eternally present. (chap. 33, tr. Feng and English)</dl>
      <p>The <i>Tao Te Ching</i> praises self knowledge but criticizes rational understanding. For example: &quot;Banish wisdom, discard knowledge, And the people will be benefited a hundredfold.&quot; (chap. 19, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ) Knowledge, like desire, should be diminished. &quot;It was when intelligence and knowledge appeared that the Great Artifice began.&quot; (chap. 18, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ).<p><a id="Connections_with_Christianity" name="Connections_with_Christianity"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Connections with Christianity</span></h3>
      <p>Since <!--del_lnk--> Christian missionaries were among the first Westerners to study the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, it is not surprising that they connected Taoism with Christianity. There are many parallels between the <!--del_lnk--> New Testament and the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, for instance, &quot;Do good to those who hate you&quot; (Luke 6:27, tr. NASB) and &quot;Requite injuries with good deeds&quot; (chap. 63, tr. Waley<!--del_lnk--> ). Note that the Chinese Bible translates <i><!--del_lnk--> logos</i> as <i>Tao</i>.<p>Two particular <i>Tao Te Ching</i> chapters are perceived as exemplifying Christian themes. Chapter 42 bears a resemblance to the <a href="../../wp/t/Trinity.htm" title="Trinity">Trinity</a> doctrine: &quot;The Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures.&quot; (tr. Mair 1990:9). In 1823, the French sinologist <!--del_lnk--> Jean-Pierre-Abel R&eacute;musat suggested that <!--del_lnk--> Yahweh was signified by three words in Chapter 14; <i>yi</i> (<!--del_lnk--> &#x5937; &quot;calm; level; barbarian&quot;), <i>xi</i> (<!--del_lnk--> &#x5E0C; &quot;rare; indiscernible; hope&quot;), and <i>wei</i> (<!--del_lnk--> &#x5FAE; &quot;tiny, small; obscure&quot;).<blockquote>
       <p>We look for it but do not see it; we name it &quot;subtle.&quot; We listen for it but do not hear it; we name it &quot;rare.&quot; We grope for it but do not grasp it; we name it &quot;serene.&quot; These three cannot be fully fathomed, Therefore, They are bound together to make unity.&quot; (chap. 14, tr. Mair 1990:74)</blockquote>
      <p>James Legge (1891:57-58<!--del_lnk--> ) dismissed this hypothetical <i>yi-xi-wei</i> and <i>Yahweh</i> connection as &quot;a mere fancy or dream&quot;. According to Holmes Welch:<blockquote>
       <p>It is not hard to understand the readiness of early scholars to assert that the doctrine of the Trinity was revealed in the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and that its fourteenth chapter contains the syllables of &quot;Yahveh.&quot; Even today, though these errors have been recognized for more than a century, the general notion that Lao Tzu was Christ&#39;s forerunner has lost none of its romantic appeal. (1965:7)</blockquote>
