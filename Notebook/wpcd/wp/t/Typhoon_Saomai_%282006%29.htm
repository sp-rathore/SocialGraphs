      <p><b>Typhoon Saomai</b> (international designation: <i><b>0608</b></i>, JTWC designation: <i><b>08W</b></i>, designated <b>Typhoon Juan</b> by <!--del_lnk--> PAGASA and sometimes called <b>Super Typhoon Saomai</b>) was a powerful <!--del_lnk--> typhoon that affected areas of <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> east coast of the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">People&#39;s Republic of China</a>. It was the eighth tropical storm, fifth typhoon, and third super typhoon of the <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Pacific typhoon season recognized by the <!--del_lnk--> Joint Typhoon Warning Centre. According to the <!--del_lnk--> Japan Meteorological Agency, Saomai was the seventh tropical storm and fifth typhoon of the season. The name &quot;Saomai&quot; was submitted by <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and is from the <!--del_lnk--> Vietnamese word for &quot;morning star&quot; (<i>sao Mai</i>), a reference to the planet <!--del_lnk--> Venus.<p>The typhoon brought heavy rain and wind to areas of the <!--del_lnk--> Mariana Islands, the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a>, Taiwan, and the east coast of China, and was responsible for at least 441 deaths and $1.5 billion (2006 USD) in damage. Saomai affected many of the same areas affected by <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Bilis_%25282006%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Bilis (2006)">Tropical Storm Bilis</a> a month earlier, and <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="PRC">PRC</a> forecasters described it as the most powerful typhoon to strike China since 1956. China Meteorological Administration claimed that Saomai was much stronger than typhoon No. 5612 in 1956. It was the strongest typhoon that ever occurred over China&#39;s offshore region as well as the most powerful typhoon ever to make landfall over mainland China.<p>

      <p>A tropical disturbance formed east of <!--del_lnk--> Chuuk on <!--del_lnk--> July 31 and gradually increased in organization over the next several days as it moved northwestward. The <!--del_lnk--> Joint Typhoon Warning Centre (JTWC) issued a <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on <!--del_lnk--> August 4, it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the <!--del_lnk--> Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on <!--del_lnk--> August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.<p>Saomai continued moving toward the northwest and passed over the Mariana Islands on <!--del_lnk--> August 6 while continuing to strengthen, and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA later that day. The storm then began organizing and intensifying more rapidly, becoming a typhoon early on <!--del_lnk--> August 7. Saomai moved into the area of responsibility of <!--del_lnk--> PAGASA on <!--del_lnk--> August 8, and was designated Typhoon Juan. Rapid intensification continued, and Saomai reached its peak intensity of 95&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> knots (175&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> km/h, 110&nbsp;<!--del_lnk--> mph) on <!--del_lnk--> August 9.<p>After passing to the south of <!--del_lnk--> Okinawa, Saomai turned westward and brushed the northern coast of <a href="../../wp/t/Taiwan.htm" title="Taiwan">Taiwan Island</a> early on <!--del_lnk--> August 10, before making landfall in <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang Province later that day. Gradual weakening ensued as Saomai moved further inland, and it weakened into a tropical depression on <!--del_lnk--> August 11, dissipating later that day.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>The <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a> <!--del_lnk--> National Weather Service issued a <!--del_lnk--> tropical storm warning for Guam as Tropical Storm Saomai approached the island on <!--del_lnk--> August 6. Military bases in northern Guam entered Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 1, meaning that winds of 50 <!--del_lnk--> knots or higher were expected within 12 hours. The rest of the island was placed under Condition of Readiness 2, meaning that such winds were possible within 24 hours. Several bases were temporarily closed.<p>The Central Weather Bureau of the <a href="../../wp/r/Republic_of_China.htm" title="Republic of China">Republic of China</a> issued land and marine typhoon warnings for areas of northern Taiwan in anticipation of Saomai&#39;s outer bands. The warnings had been upgraded from lesser warnings issued for <!--del_lnk--> Tropical Storm Bopha, which made landfall in southern Taiwan the day before.<p>In China, 990,000 people in <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang and 569,000 people in <!--del_lnk--> Fujian were evacuated to shelters prior to Saomai&#39;s landfall. Over 20,000 soldiers and police were mobilized to aid in cleanup and rescue efforts.<div style="clear: both">

      <p>While still a tropical storm, Saomai passed over <a href="../../wp/g/Guam.htm" title="Guam">Guam</a>, bringing rain and wind to the island, but no damage or deaths were reported.<p>Later, as with <a href="../../wp/t/Tropical_Storm_Bilis_%25282006%2529.htm" title="Tropical Storm Bilis (2006)">Tropical Storm Bilis</a> a month earlier, Saomai&#39;s outer rainbands affected areas of the Philippines.

      <p>The core of the typhoon passed to the north of Taiwan, but the island still experienced heavy rain and wind that disrupted traffic and cancelled flights to and from <a href="../../wp/t/Taipei.htm" title="Taipei">Taipei</a>. No serious damage or casualties were reported. Afterwards, Saomai made landfall in <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang province, where 87 deaths were reported, mostly in <!--del_lnk--> Wenzhou. Over 18,000 homes were destroyed, and major highways in the province were flooded out. Saomai was responsible for 4.9 billion <!--del_lnk--> yuan in damage in Zhejiang.<p>At least 138 people were killed in the neighboring province of <!--del_lnk--> Fujian. Most of these deaths were caused by storm surge flooding in coastal fishing communities, such as <!--del_lnk--> Fuding. At least 8 of the deaths were caused by the collapse of a damaged evacuation shelter. Strong winds and flooding destroyed 37,000 houses and flooded 38,000 <!--del_lnk--> hectares (94,000 <!--del_lnk--> acres) of farmland, and economic damage amounted to 6.3 billion yuan.<p>Another two people were killed in <!--del_lnk--> Jiangxi. One person was washed away in floodwaters while inspecting damage, while another person was killed when a damaged building collapsed. Six reservoirs in the province were destroyed, and 348 million <!--del_lnk--> yuan in damage was reported.<p><a id="Aftermath" name="Aftermath"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies made an appeal for almost 6 million <!--del_lnk--> Swiss francs ($4.8 million, 2006 USD) to assist stricken families in the <a href="../../wp/p/People%2527s_Republic_of_China.htm" title="People&#39;s Republic of China">PRC</a>. As of <!--del_lnk--> August 11, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, about 1.8 million <!--del_lnk--> Chinese yuan ($220,000) worth of relief items and financial assistance had been given to the victims. The PRC government also allocated 120 million yuan ($15.2 million) for disaster relief in areas affected by Saomai and earlier storms. The funds were used to provide food and water for displaced victims and pay for the rebuilding effort in Zhejiang and Fujian.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Saomai_%282006%29&quot;</div>
