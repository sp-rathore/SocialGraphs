       </div>
      </div>
      <p>The Hague was founded in <!--del_lnk--> 1248 by <!--del_lnk--> William II, <!--del_lnk--> Count of Holland and <!--del_lnk--> King of Germany, who was supposed to become <!--del_lnk--> Holy Roman Emperor. He started the construction of a castle in a forest near the sea in Holland, where he intended to live after his coronation. He died in battle before he could be crowned. His castle was not finished, but parts of it remain and are now called the <!--del_lnk--> Ridderzaal (Knights&#39; Hall). It is still in use for political events, such as the annual speech from the throne by the monarch.<p>Later, the <!--del_lnk--> counts of <!--del_lnk--> Holland used The Hague as their administrative centre. &#39;Des Graven Hage&#39; literally means &quot;the count&#39;s hedge&quot; or &quot;the count&#39;s private enclosure&quot;. The powerful cities of Holland, like <!--del_lnk--> Leiden, <!--del_lnk--> Delft, and <!--del_lnk--> Dordrecht, struck a compromise to choose the then small and unimportant The Hague as their administrative centre. This policy was never changed, and The Hague is to this day the centre of government but not the official capital.<p>To keep The Hague small it wasn&#39;t allowed city rights or allowed to build city walls. When city walls were finally allowed in the <!--del_lnk--> 1500s, the population decided to use the money to build a city hall instead of city walls. This proved disastrous during the <!--del_lnk--> Eighty Years&#39; War, as it allowed Spanish troops easily to occupy the town.<p>The Hague was finally <!--del_lnk--> named a city by the <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">French</a> occupation force in 1806, centuries after other Dutch cities had received similar rights. All this has led to the urban legend that The Hague is not a city but a village.<p>Because of its history, it lacks a large historical inner city like the nearby cities of <!--del_lnk--> Leiden and <!--del_lnk--> Delft. But when the government started playing a more prominent role in Dutch society after 1850, The Hague quickly expanded. The older parts of the city are therefore mostly from the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the early <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20<sup>th</sup> century</a>. The growing city annexed the municipality of <!--del_lnk--> Loosduinen partly in 1903 and completely in 1923.<p>Parts of the city sustained heavy damage during <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_II.htm" title="World War II">World War II</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Atlantic Wall was built through part of the city, causing whole neighbourhoods to be torn down by the German occupiers. On <!--del_lnk--> March 3, <!--del_lnk--> 1945, <a href="../../wp/r/Royal_Air_Force.htm" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a> mistakenly bombed the <!--del_lnk--> Bezuidenhout district. The target was an installation of <!--del_lnk--> V-2 rockets in a nearby park. Due to navigational errors, the bombs fell on a heavily populated and historic part of the city. Over 500 people died and the scars in the city can still be seen today.<p>After the war The Hague was at one point the largest building site in Europe. The city expanded massively to the southwest. The destroyed areas were also quickly rebuilt. The population peaked at 600,000 inhabitants around 1965.<p>In the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s and <!--del_lnk--> 1980s the mostly white middle classes moved to neighbouring towns like <!--del_lnk--> Voorburg, <!--del_lnk--> Leidschendam, <!--del_lnk--> Rijswijk and most of all <!--del_lnk--> Zoetermeer. This led to the traditional pattern of an impoverished inner city and more prosperous suburbs. Attempts to include parts of the suburbs in The Hague were highly controversial. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, with the consent of the Dutch Parliament, The Hague did succeed in annexing fairly large areas from its neighbouring towns on which complete new residential areas were built and are still being built.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> stork is the symbol of Den Haag.<p><a id="The_city" name="The_city"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">The city</span></h2>

      <p>City life concentrates around the <!--del_lnk--> Hofvijver and the <!--del_lnk--> Binnenhof, which is where the Parliament is located.<p>The city lacks a large student culture because it has no <a href="../../wp/u/University.htm" title="University">university</a>, but there is a school of higher professional education known as <!--del_lnk--> Haagse hogeschool which is sometimes known as The Hague University. The city has many <!--del_lnk--> civil servants and <!--del_lnk--> diplomats (see below). In fact, the number and variety of foreign residents (especially the <!--del_lnk--> expatriates) makes the city culturally quite diverse, with many foreign <!--del_lnk--> pubs, shops and cultural events.<p>The Hague is the largest Dutch city on the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> and comprises two distinct beach towns. The main beach resort <!--del_lnk--> Scheveningen, in the northwestern part of the city, is a popular destination for tourists and young people. With 10 million visitors a year it is the most popular beach town in the <!--del_lnk--> Benelux. It&#39;s perhaps for this reason that many, even some Dutch people, mistakenly believe Scheveningen is a city in its own right. That is not the case: Scheveningen is one of The Hague&#39;s eight districts (&quot;stadsdelen&quot;). <!--del_lnk--> Kijkduin, in the southwest, is The Hague&#39;s other beach resort. It is a lot smaller and attracts mainly local people.<p>The former Dutch colony of <!--del_lnk--> Netherlands East Indies (&quot;Nederlands-Indi&euml;&quot;, current-day <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>) has left its mark on The Hague. Many streets are named after places in the Netherlands East Indies and there is a sizable &quot;Indisch(e)&quot; or &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Indo&quot; (i.e. mixed Dutch-Indonesian) community. Since the loss of these Dutch possessions in December 1949, &quot;Indisch(e)&quot; or &quot;Indo&quot; people often refer to The Hague as &quot;the Widow of the Indies&quot;.<p>The older parts of the town usually have characteristically wide and long streets. Houses are generally low-rise (not more than three floors), and quite elegant. The layout of the city is more spacious than other Dutch cities. There are only a few canals in The Hague, as most of them were drained in the late 1800s.<p>Some of the most prosperous and some of the poorest neighbourhoods of the Netherlands can be found in The Hague. The wealthier areas (The Vogelwijk, Statenkwartier, Belgisch Park and Benoordenhout) are generally located in the northwest part of the city. The poorer areas (Transvaal, Moerwijk, the Schilderswijk) can be found in the southern and eastern areas. This division is reflected in the local accent: The more affluent citizens are usually called &quot;Hagenaars&quot; and speak so-called &quot;bekakt Haags&quot; (&quot;Bekakt&quot; is Dutch for &quot;stuck-up&quot;). This contrasts with the &quot;Hagenezen&quot;, who speak &quot;plat Haags&quot; (&quot;plat&quot; meaning &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;common&quot;). There is relatively little social interaction between these groups.<p>The tallest building is the <!--del_lnk--> Hoftoren (see image).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>As a result of its rich legacy in international politics, The Hague is home to over 150 international (legal) organisations. These include the <!--del_lnk--> Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the <a href="../../wp/i/International_Court_of_Justice.htm" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a>.<p>The foundation of The Hague as an &quot;international city of peace and justice&quot; was laid over a hundred years ago in 1899, when the world&#39;s first Peace Conference took place in The Hague, followed by a second in 1907. A direct result of these meetings was the establishment of the world&#39;s first organisation for the settlement of international disputes: the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). Shortly thereafter the Scottish-American millionare <a href="../../wp/a/Andrew_Carnegie.htm" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> made the necessary funds available to build the <!--del_lnk--> Peace Palace (&ldquo;Vredespaleis&rdquo;) to house the PCA.<p>After the establishment of the League of Nations, The Hague became the seat of the <!--del_lnk--> Permanent Court of International Justice, which was replaced by the UN&#39;s <a href="../../wp/i/International_Court_of_Justice.htm" title="International Court of Justice">International Court of Justice</a> after the <!--del_lnk--> Second World War. The establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Iran-US Claims Tribunal (1981), the <!--del_lnk--> ICTY (1993) and the <!--del_lnk--> ICC (2002) in the city further consolidated the role of The Hague as a centre for international legal arbitration.<p>Currently the city authority is seeking to establish an image of the city as the &quot;legal capital of the world&quot; and &quot;international city of peace and justice&quot;.<p>Major international organisations based in The Hague include:<ul>

      <p>The Hague does not have a reputation for a bustling night life, most probably because it has no university and thus little student life. What night life there is centres around the three main squares in the city centre: &quot;Het Plein&quot; (literally &quot;The Square&quot;), the Grote Markt (literally &quot;Large Market&quot;) and the &quot;Buitenhof&quot; (literally the &quot;Outer Court&quot;, which lies just outside the <!--del_lnk--> Binnenhof). The Buitenhof contains the popular <!--del_lnk--> Path&eacute; Buitenhof cinema and a handful of bars and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. A similar pattern of night life centers on the cinema in Scheveningen, although, especially in <a href="../../wp/s/Summer.htm" title="Summer">summer</a>, night-life concentrates around the sea-front boulevard with its bars, restaurants, gambling halls and other entertainment.<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h2>

On this day the colour orange predominates at a <!--del_lnk--> funfair (which sells orange <!--del_lnk--> cotton candy) and scores of informal street markets. The day is a &quot;vrijmarkt&quot; (literally &quot;free market&quot;), which means no license is needed for streetvending; children traditionally use this day to sell old unwanted toys.<li>May &amp; June: The <!--del_lnk--> Pasar Malam Besar is one of the largest Eurasian cultural festivals in Europe.

      <p><a id="Transportation" name="Transportation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Transportation</span></h2>
      <p>Public transportation in The Hague consists of a sizeable number of <!--del_lnk--> tram and <!--del_lnk--> bus routes, operated by <!--del_lnk--> HTM Personenvervoer. Plans for a subway were shelved in the early 1970s. However, in 2004 a tunnel was built under the city centre with two underground tram stations (&quot;Spui&quot; and &quot;Grote Markt&quot;); it is shared by tram routes 2, 4 and 6.<p>A regional <!--del_lnk--> light rail system called <!--del_lnk--> Randstadrail <!--del_lnk-->  connects The Hague to the suburbs, Zoetermeer and Rotterdam.<p>There are two main <!--del_lnk--> train stations in The Hague: Den Haag Hollands Spoor (HS) and Den Haag Centraal. It is somewhat confusing that many trains bypass the central station because it is a <!--del_lnk--> terminus. For instance, the international <!--del_lnk--> Thalys and <!--del_lnk--> Benelux trains to <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a> only stop at Hollands Spoor. The central station does, however, offer good connections with the rest of the country, with direct services to most major cities. With the inception of the Dutch High Speed Line (<!--del_lnk--> HSL-Zuid) in 2008/9, high speed trains will run from the central station to <!--del_lnk--> Breda, <a href="../../wp/a/Antwerp.htm" title="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>; Hollands Spoor station, however, will lose its direct connection with <a href="../../wp/p/Paris.htm" title="Paris">Paris</a> and hourly service to <a href="../../wp/b/Brussels.htm" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>.<p>The nearest airport to The Hague is <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam Airport. It is, however, not easily reachable by public transport. With four direct trains per hour from Hollands Spoor or Centraal, <!--del_lnk--> Amsterdam Schiphol Airport is more frequently used by people travelling to and from The Hague by airplane.<p>Major motorways (freeways) connecting to The Hague include the A12 (the first motorway in The Netherlands), running to Utrecht and the German border. The A12 runs directly into the heart of the city in a cutting. Built in the 1970s, this section of motorway (the &quot;Utrechtse Baan&quot;) is now heavily overburdened. Plans were made in the late 1990s for a second artery road into the city (the &quot;Trekvliettrac&eacute;&quot;) have continually been put on hold. Other connecting motorways are the A4, which connects the city with <a href="../../wp/a/Amsterdam.htm" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, and the A13, which runs to <a href="../../wp/r/Rotterdam.htm" title="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> and connects to motorways towards the Belgian border.<p><a id="Population" name="Population"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Population</span></h2>
