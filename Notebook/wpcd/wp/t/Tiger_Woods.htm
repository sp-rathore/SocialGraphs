      <p><b>Eldrick &quot;Tiger&quot; Woods</b> (born <!--del_lnk--> December 30, <!--del_lnk--> 1975 in <!--del_lnk--> Cypress, California) is an <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">American</a> <!--del_lnk--> professional <!--del_lnk--> golfer whose achievements to date rank him among the most successful golfers of all time. Currently the <!--del_lnk--> World No. 1, Woods was the highest paid professional athlete in 2005, having earned an estimated $87 million. In 2006, at the age of 30, he won his eleventh and twelfth professional <!--del_lnk--> major golf championships and has <!--del_lnk--> more wins on the <!--del_lnk--> PGA Tour than any other active golfer. He is the only active golfer currently in the top 10 in either <!--del_lnk--> career major wins or career PGA Tour wins.<p>Woods, who is <!--del_lnk--> multiracial, is credited with prompting a major surge of interest in the game of golf among <!--del_lnk--> minorities and young people in the United States.<p>

      <p>Woods&#39; father, <!--del_lnk--> Earl Woods, was a <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> veteran and a retired <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Army <!--del_lnk--> lieutenant colonel, of mixed <!--del_lnk--> African American (50 percent), <!--del_lnk--> Chinese (25 percent) and <!--del_lnk--> Native American (25 percent) ancestry. He was the chairman of his son&#39;s charitable foundation (the Tiger Woods Foundation) before his death at age 74 on May 3, 2006, following a lengthy battle with <a href="../../wp/p/Prostate_cancer.htm" title="Prostate cancer">prostate cancer</a> (see section <a href="#Charity_and_youth_projects" title="">charity and youth projects</a> below). Woods&#39; mother, <!--del_lnk--> Kultida Woods, is originally from <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, and is of mixed <!--del_lnk--> Thai (50 percent), <!--del_lnk--> Chinese (25 percent), and <!--del_lnk--> Dutch (25 percent) ancestry. This makes Woods himself one-<!--del_lnk--> quarter <!--del_lnk--> Chinese, one-quarter Thai, one-quarter <!--del_lnk--> African, one-eighth Native American, and one-eighth Dutch. He affably refers to his ethnic make-up as <!--del_lnk--> Cablinasian (a <!--del_lnk--> portmanteau of <b>Ca</b>ucasian, <b>Bl</b>ack, American-<b>In</b>dian, and <b>Asian</b>), a term he made up himself.<p>Born Eldrick Woods in <!--del_lnk--> Cypress, California, he was nicknamed &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; after Vuong Dang Phong, a Vietnamese friend of his father&rsquo;s, who served with him in <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Woods became generally known by that name and by the time he had achieved national prominence in junior and amateur golf was simply known as &quot;Tiger Woods.&quot; He grew up in the <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles area, attending high school at Western High in <!--del_lnk--> Anaheim. He also served for a semester as a <!--del_lnk--> United States House of Representatives Page.<p>Woods was the only child of Earl and Kultida&#39;s marriage, but he does have two half-brothers, Earl Jr. (b. 1955) and Kevin (b. 1957), and one half-sister, Royce (b. 1958) from the 18-year marriage of Earl Woods and his first wife, Barbara Woods Gray. Earl Junior&#39;s daughter Cheyenne Woods (b. 1991), Woods&#39; niece, is also a golfer and had received some coaching from Earl Sr.<p><a id="Marriage" name="Marriage"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Marriage</span></h3>
      <p>In November <!--del_lnk--> 2003, Woods became engaged to <!--del_lnk--> Elin Nordegren, a <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> <!--del_lnk--> model. They were introduced by Swedish golf star <!--del_lnk--> Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as a nanny, during The Open Championship in 2001. They married on October 5, 2004 and live at Isleworth, a community in <!--del_lnk--> Windermere, a suburb of <!--del_lnk--> Orlando, Florida. They also have homes in <!--del_lnk--> Jackson, Wyoming, California, and <a href="../../wp/s/Sweden.htm" title="Sweden">Sweden</a>. In January <!--del_lnk--> 2006, Woods and his wife purchased a US$39 million residential property in <!--del_lnk--> Jupiter Island, Florida, which they intend to make their primary residence.

      <p>Woods was a <!--del_lnk--> child prodigy who began to play golf at the age of two. In 1978, he demonstrated his golf skills in a television appearance on <i><!--del_lnk--> The Mike Douglas Show</i>. At age three, Woods shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy Golf Club in Cypress, California, and at age five, he appeared in <i><!--del_lnk--> Golf Digest</i> and on <!--del_lnk--> ABC&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> That&#39;s Incredible</i>. In 1984, he won the 9&ndash;10 boys&#39; event at the <!--del_lnk--> Junior World Golf Championships. He was only eight years old at the time, but 9&ndash;10 was the youngest age group available. Woods went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991. Also in 1991, at the age of 15, he became the youngest U.S. Junior Amateur Champion in golf history. He was voted Southern California Amateur Player of the Year for the second consecutive year, and Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he successfully defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, and competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan <!--del_lnk--> Los Angeles Open. The following year, he won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, and remains the event&#39;s youngest-ever and only multiple winner. In 1994, Woods became the youngest ever winner of the <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Amateur Championship. He was a member of the American team at the 1994 <!--del_lnk--> World Amateur Golf Team Championships. Later that year, he enrolled at <!--del_lnk--> Stanford University, and won his first collegiate event, the William Tucker Invitational. In 1995, Woods defended his U.S. Amateur title, and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford&#39;s Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports). He participated in his first PGA Tour major, <!--del_lnk--> The Masters, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, Woods became the first golfer in history to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles. That year he won the <!--del_lnk--> NCAA individual golf championship, and tied the British Open record for an amateur with an aggregate score of 281. He left college after two years to become a professional golfer.<p><a id="Professional_career" name="Professional_career"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Professional career</span></h3>

      <p>With the announcement, &quot;Hello World,&quot; Tiger Woods became a professional golfer in August 1996, and immediately signed endorsement deals worth $40 million from Nike and $20 million from Titleist. He played his first round of professional golf at the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Milwaukee Open. He tied for 60th place in his pro debut, but would go on to win two events in the next three months, and qualified for the <!--del_lnk--> Tour Championship. Woods was named 1996&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sportsman of the Year&quot; by <i><!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated</i> for the impact he had on the game of golf, and <!--del_lnk--> PGA Rookie of the Year by the PGA Tour. He is the only golfer to win the PGA Player of the Year award in the year following his rookie season. The following <!--del_lnk--> April, Woods won his first golf major, <!--del_lnk--> The Masters, by a record margin of 12 strokes, became the youngest Masters winner, and the first winner of African or Asian descent. He set a total of 20 Masters records and tied 6 others, and has been the highest-profile golfer in the world ever since. He would go on to win an additional three PGA Tour events that year, and On <!--del_lnk--> June 15, <!--del_lnk--> 1997, Woods rose to the number one spot in the <!--del_lnk--> Official World Golf Rankings for the first time. He achieved this in only his 42nd week as a professional -- the fastest ever ascent to the No. 1 ranking.<p>While expectations for Woods were high, Woods&#39; form began to fade in the second half of 1997, and in 1998 he only won one PGA Tour event. Woods answered the critics of his &quot;slump&quot; and what seemed to be his wavering form by maintaining that he was undergoing extensive swing changes with his coach, <!--del_lnk--> Butch Harmon, and was hoping to do better in the future.<p>In June 1999, Woods won the <!--del_lnk--> Memorial Tournament, a victory that marked the beginning of perhaps one of the greatest sustained periods of dominance in the history of men&#39;s golf. He would go on to win seventeen PGA Tour events in the two calendar years that followed, and 32 in the next five, achievements that had not been rivaled in several decades. He completed his 1999 campaign by winning his last four starts, and finishing the season with eight wins &mdash; a feat that had not been achieved in the past 25 years. He was voted PGA Tour Player of the Year and AP Male Athlete of the Year for the second time in three years. Also in late 1999, Woods embarked on a record-setting streak of 264 consecutive weeks atop the <!--del_lnk--> Official World Golf Rankings. He has been number one in the rankings more weeks than anyone. During the run, Woods won seven out of the eleven <!--del_lnk--> major championships, starting with the 1999 <!--del_lnk--> PGA Championship at <!--del_lnk--> Medinah Country Club and finishing with the 2002 <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Open at <!--del_lnk--> Bethpage Black. Woods broke <!--del_lnk--> Old Tom Morris&#39;s record for the largest victory margin ever in a major championship, which had stood since 1862, with his 15-shot win in the 2000 U.S. Open at <!--del_lnk--> Pebble Beach.<p>Woods rang in the new millennium with his fifth consecutive victory and began what would be a record-setting season, where he would win three consecutive majors, 9 PGA Tour events, and set or tie 27 TOUR records. He went on to capture his sixth consecutive victory at the <!--del_lnk--> AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am with a comeback for the ages. Trailing by seven strokes with seven holes to play, Woods finished eagle-birdie-par-birdie for a 64 and a two-stroke victory. His six consecutive wins were the most since Hogan in 1948 and only five behind Byron Nelson&rsquo;s record of 11 in a row. In the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> U.S. Open, Woods broke or tied a total of nine U.S. Open records, and became the Tour&#39;s all-time career money leader. In the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> Open Championship at <!--del_lnk--> St Andrews, which he won by eight strokes, Woods set the record for lowest score to par (&minus;19) in any major tournament, and he holds at least a share of that record in all four major championships. His major championship streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 <!--del_lnk--> PGA Championship, however, when <!--del_lnk--> Bob May went head-to-head with Woods on Sunday at <!--del_lnk--> Valhalla in <a href="../../wp/l/Louisville%252C_Kentucky.htm" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville</a>, matching Woods stroke-for-stroke. Woods only escaped with a victory after winning a three-hole playoff, with a heart-pumping birdie on the first hole and pars on the next two. He joined Ben Hogan (1953) as the only other player to win three professional majors in one season. The next season, Woods went back to dominating: his 2001 <!--del_lnk--> Masters win marked the only time &mdash; within the era of the modern &quot;grand slam&quot; &mdash; that any player was the holder of all four major championship titles at the same time. This feat has become known as the &quot;Tiger Slam&quot;. His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 in 2000 was the lowest in PGA Tour history, lower than his 68.43 average in 1999. His actual scoring average of 68.17 in 2000 was the lowest in PGA Tour history, besting <!--del_lnk--> Byron Nelson&#39;s 68.33 average in 1945.<p>The next phase of Woods&#39; career saw him remain among the top competitors on the tour, but lose his dominating edge. He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004, falling to second in the PGA Tour money list in 2003 and fourth in 2004. In September 2004, Woods&#39; record streak as the world&#39;s top-ranked golfer came to an end at the <!--del_lnk--> Deutsche Bank Championship in <!--del_lnk--> Norton, Massachusetts, when <!--del_lnk--> Vijay Singh won the tournament and overtook Woods in the rankings. Even though no one has held the number one ranking for more total weeks than Woods, many commentators were puzzled by Woods&#39; &quot;slump,&quot; offering explanations that ranged from Woods&#39; rift with swing coach <!--del_lnk--> Butch Harmon to his recent marriage to Elin Nordegren. At the same time, Woods let it be known that he was once again working on changes to his swing &mdash; this time in hopes of reducing the wear and tear on his surgically-repaired left knee, which was subjected to severe stress in the 1998&ndash;2003 version of his swing. Again, Woods anticipated that once the adjustments were complete, he would return to his previous form.<p>In the 2005 PGA Tour season, Woods quickly returned to his winning ways. On <!--del_lnk--> March 6, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 he outplayed <!--del_lnk--> Phil Mickelson to win the <!--del_lnk--> Ford Championship at Doral, and returned to the <!--del_lnk--> Official World Golf Rankings&#39; number one position in the process (though Singh displaced him once again two weeks later). On <!--del_lnk--> April 10, <!--del_lnk--> 2005, Woods finally broke his &quot;drought&quot; in the majors by winning the 2005 Masters in a tie-breaking playoff (after holing a historic chip-in on the 16th hole), which also assured him the number one spot in the World Rankings again. Singh and Woods swapped the number 1 position several times over the next couple of months, but by early July, Woods had established a substantial advantage, propelled further by a victory in the <!--del_lnk--> Open Championship, a win that also gave him his 10th major. Woods went on to win six official money events on the PGA Tour in 2005, topping the money list for the sixth time in his career. Woods&#39; 2005 wins also included two at the <!--del_lnk--> World Golf Championships.<p>For Woods, the year <!--del_lnk--> 2006 was markedly different from <!--del_lnk--> 2005. While he began just as dominantly (winning the first two tournaments he entered on the year) and was in the hunt for his fifth Masters championship in April, Woods surprisingly never mounted a Sunday charge to defend his title at Augusta, allowing <!--del_lnk--> Phil Mickelson to claim the green jacket. Shortly thereafter (<!--del_lnk--> May 3, <!--del_lnk--> 2006), Woods&#39; father/mentor/inspiration, <!--del_lnk--> Earl, died after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer. The loss was devastating to Woods, who took a nine-week-long hiatus from the PGA Tour to be with his family in the wake of Earl&#39;s death. When he finally returned for the 2006 U.S. Open, the rust was evident &mdash; he would eventually miss the cut at <!--del_lnk--> Winged Foot, the first time he had failed to qualify for the weekend at a major in his professional career, and thereby ending his record-tying streak of 39 consecutive cuts made at major championships. A tie for second at the <!--del_lnk--> Western Open just three weeks later went a long way toward silencing doubts about his game, though, and Woods seemed poised to defend his Open crown at <!--del_lnk--> Hoylake despite his grief. At <!--del_lnk--> The Open Championship, Woods would stage a tour de force in successful course management, putting, and accuracy with irons. Using almost exclusively long irons off the tee (he hit driver only one time the entire week &mdash; the 16th hole of the first round), Woods missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 86 percent of the time), and his score of &minus;18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and only seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record &minus;19, set at St Andrews in <!--del_lnk--> 2000. The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father&#39;s memory. Several weeks later, at the <!--del_lnk--> PGA Championship, Woods once again won in dominating fashion. He finished the tournament at &minus;18 to par and added more records to his already-impressive resume, equaling the to-par record in the PGA that he shares with Bob May. Woods now holds at least a share of the scoring record in relation to par in all four majors, and also holds the margin of victory record in two majors, The Masters and the U.S. Open. (Old Tom Morris holds this record in the The Open Championship, and Nicklaus holds this record in the PGA Championship.)<p>As of November 2006, Woods has won 54 official money events on the <!--del_lnk--> PGA Tour and at 30 years and 7 months old is the youngest to the 50-win mark. At the close of his first eleven seasons, Tiger had eclipsed the all time eleven-season PGA Tour total win record of 52 (set by Byron Nelson) and total majors record of 11 (set by Jack Nicklaus). He also has 19 other individual professional titles, and two team titles in the two-man <!--del_lnk--> WGC-World Cup. With his victory at the 2006 <!--del_lnk--> WGC-American Express Championship, he became the first player in PGA Tour history to win at least eight times in three seasons. It also placed him tied for 2nd for the longest PGA Tour win streak at 6 straight, tied with himself (99&ndash;00) and <!--del_lnk--> Ben Hogan (1948). Only <!--del_lnk--> Byron Nelson&#39;s streak of 11 wins in 1945 is longer. He has successfully defended a title 16 times on the PGA Tour, has finished runner-up 20 times, and has won 27% (54 out of 200) of his professional starts on the PGA Tour. He has a 38&ndash;3 winning record when leading after 54 holes in TOUR events, and owns the lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history. Woods is one of five players (along with <!--del_lnk--> Gene Sarazen, <!--del_lnk--> Ben Hogan, <!--del_lnk--> Jack Nicklaus, and <!--del_lnk--> Gary Player) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot;, and was the youngest to do so. <!--del_lnk--> Bobby Jones won all four of what were in his era considered major championships. With Woods&#39;s win in The Open Championship of 2005, he became the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have won all four majors more than once. At the 2003 TOUR Championship, it was widely reported in the print media that he set &quot;an all-time record for most consecutive <!--del_lnk--> cuts&quot;, starting in 1998, with 114 (passing <!--del_lnk--> Byron Nelson&#39;s previous record of 113) and that he extended this mark to 142 before it ended on <!--del_lnk--> May 13, <!--del_lnk--> 2005 at the <!--del_lnk--> EDS Byron Nelson Championship. Many consider this to be one of the most remarkable golf accomplishments of all time, given the margin by which he broke the old record (and against stronger fields in terms of depth than those in Nelson&#39;s day) and given that during the streak, the next longest streak by any other player was usually only in the 10s or 20s.<p>Woods won the &quot;World Sportsman of the Year&quot; award at the <!--del_lnk--> Laureus World Sports Awards in 2000 and 2001. He is the only individual two-time winner of <i><!--del_lnk--> Sports Illustrated</i> magazine&#39;s &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Sportsman of the Year&quot; award (1996, 2000).<p>When Woods turned pro, Mike &quot;Fluff&quot; Cowan was his caddie until March 8, 1999. He was replaced by <!--del_lnk--> Steve Williams, who has become a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping Woods with key shots and putts.<p><a id="Playing_style" name="Playing_style"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Playing style</span></h2>
      <p>When Woods burst onto the professional golf scene in 1996, one of the things that made the biggest impact with fans was his long driving. However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance), many opponents caught up to him, a trend that became all too obvious during the 2002&ndash;2003 PGA Tour seasons &mdash; <!--del_lnk--> Phil Mickelson would even make a joke in 2003 about Woods using &quot;inferior equipment&quot;, which did not sit well with either Nike or Woods. During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and <!--del_lnk--> graphite shaft, which coupled with his prodigious clubhead speed to make him one of the Tour&#39;s lengthier players off the tee once again.<p>Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally as accurate as any player ever to play (including Jack Nicklaus), his recovery and bunker play is often brilliant (for example, his miraculous 30-foot chip-in at Augusta&#39;s 16th during the 2005 Masters), and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for putting in more hours of practice than most.<p>Early in his professional career, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach <!--del_lnk--> Butch Harmon, but since March 2004, he has been coached by <!--del_lnk--> Hank Haney. In June 2004, Woods was involved in a media spat with Harmon, who also works as a golf broadcaster, when Harmon suggested that he was in &quot;denial&quot; about the problems in his game, but they publicly patched up their differences.<p>Although he is considered one of the most charismatic figures in golf&#39;s history, Woods&#39; approach is, at its core, cautious. He aims for consistency. Although he is better than any other Tour player when he is in top form, his dominance comes not from regularly posting extremely low rounds, but instead from avoiding bad rounds. To illustrate, the <!--del_lnk--> standard deviations of Woods&#39; 18-hole scores are typically lower than those of most Tour players. Woods plays fewer tournaments than most professionals (20&ndash;23 per year, compared to the typical 25&ndash;30), and focuses his efforts on preparing for (and peaking at) the Majors and the most prestigious of the other tournaments. Woods&#39; manner off of the course is cautious as well, as he carries himself in interviews and public appearances with a carefully controlled demeanor reminiscent of the corporate athlete persona developed between Nike and Michael Jordan. One of the few breaches of Woods&#39; fan-friendly image occurred during the 2000 U.S. Open at <!--del_lnk--> Pebble Beach, on the 18th tee in the second round. Using a driver, Woods snap-hooked his tee shot into the <a href="../../wp/p/Pacific_Ocean.htm" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>, then let loose with a stream of expletives that <!--del_lnk--> NBC&#39;s microphones broadcast live. The <!--del_lnk--> USGA received several calls from offended viewers, and Woods quickly apologized.<p>Though he is known to be extremely focused and almost machine-like during tournaments, many golfers have mentioned how Woods is easy to get along with and has a good sense of humor. <!--del_lnk--> John Daly mentioned in his autobiography that &quot;Tiger Woods is one of my favorite golfers to play with. The kid is an absolute riot and is just hysterical. Everyone who thinks he is just robotic during tournaments needs to walk 18 holes with him to realize how funny and genuine of a guy he really is.&quot;<p>Woods almost always wears a shirt in a red shade during the final round (usually on Sundays) of every tournament in which he plays. He believes the colour red symbolizes aggression and assertiveness.<p><a id="Major_Championships" name="Major_Championships"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Major Championships</span></h2>

This matched Ben Hogan&#39;s feat in 1953.<p>With his victory in The Masters in 2001, Woods became the only player ever to hold all four professional majors at once (although this did not occur in a calendar year, and is therefore not considered a true <!--del_lnk--> Grand Slam). The achievement has been nicknamed &quot;The Tiger Slam&quot;.<p>Tiger Woods and <!--del_lnk--> Lee Trevino have been the only two players to have captured the three national opens (U.S., British, and Canadian) in one year: Trevino in 1971 and Woods in 2000.<p>In the 2006 PGA Championship, Woods made only three bogeys, tying the record for fewest bogeys in a major.<p>Woods holds at least a share of the record for lowest 72-hole score in relation to par in all four majors, and at least a share of the low-72 holes record in two of them. Note that the &quot;to par&quot; and &quot;low 72-holes&quot; records are not always the same because, while most championship golf courses have a par of 72, or 288 for four rounds, some have a par of 71 or 70:<ul>

       <li><!--del_lnk--> The Open Championship: &minus;19 (269), 2000 (outright to-par record) <ul>

         <li><!--del_lnk--> David Toms holds the low 72-holes record at 265.</ul>
      </ul>
      <p>The above performances have also given him the record for victory margin in two majors:<ul>
       <li>The Masters: 12 strokes, 1997<li>U.S. Open: 15 strokes, 2000 (record for all majors)</ul>
      <p>Woods is the only player to have won multiple professional majors in consecutive years, 2005 and 2006. <!--del_lnk--> Bobby Jones won multiple majors in consecutive years in 1926 and 1927 , when the <!--del_lnk--> US Amateur and the <!--del_lnk--> British Amateur were both considered majors.<p>Woods has won two or more majors in a year four times.

      <p>Establishing which particular shot has been the greatest ever played by Woods is subjective, but his caddy <!--del_lnk--> Steve Williams is in no doubt it was during the second round of 2002 <!--del_lnk--> PGA Championship. Williams, who has caddied for Woods during 10 of his 12 major wins, was the subject of an hour-long documentary called <i>The Chosen Ones</i>, produced by SPARC, (Sport And Recreation New Zealand), and aired on Sky TV. Williams was told that a lot of people considered the holed-out chip shot at the 2005 Masters to be his best ever, and was asked &quot;is this the one that sticks in your mind&quot;? Williams shook his head and replied:<dl>
       <dd>&quot;Undoubtedly the greatest shot I have seen from him, and from anybody, and I don&#39;t think I will ever -- and I could caddy for another 20 years -- I will ever see a greater shot (than) during the 2002 PGA Championship on the final hole there , 18th hole, 197 yards out of a fairway trap. (He) barely could get in the trap to make a stance, had a big lip in front of him, had a huge row of pine trees in front of him, howling crosswind left to right, uphill shot -- 99 percent of players would chip out sideways and there would be a few players might try to advance with an 8 iron. He goes in there with a 3 iron, and I mean, there&#39;s just no way. The lip was a high lip, you&#39;d be lucky to get an 8 iron over it and he gets in there with a 3 iron, and I&#39;m thinking this is really going to be an interesting shot here....and he knocked it there to 15ft, obviously holed the putt. We were walking up there and David Toms and Ernie Els, who were playing with us, both got their towels and put them on the ground and lay down and just bowed to him, and you know, no-one will ever hit that shot again&quot;.</dl>

On it is stitched, &quot;from mom with love&quot; in Thai.<p>An <!--del_lnk--> animatronic version of Frank, created by <!--del_lnk--> M5 Industries, was used in several Nike Golf commercials starting in <!--del_lnk--> 2003, where Frank would give advice to Tiger, or even seem to be more a nuisance than a help, much in the same vein as the &quot;Lil&#39; Penny&quot; commercials Nike did with <!--del_lnk--> Penny Hardaway in the mid-<!--del_lnk--> 1990s. In one commercial, Frank was <!--del_lnk--> talking trash at <!--del_lnk--> Charles Barkley during a pro-am. In another, when Tiger thought Frank was giving bad advice, Tiger told Frank, &quot;You can be replaced.&quot; (Tiger&#39;s mom makes him a new &quot;Frank&quot; every year.)<p><a id="Other_ventures" name="Other_ventures"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Other ventures</span></h2>
      <p><a id="Charity_and_youth_projects" name="Charity_and_youth_projects"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Charity and youth projects</span></h3>
      <p>Woods has established several charitable and youth projects.<ul>
       <li><b><!--del_lnk--> The Tiger Woods Foundation</b>: The Tiger Woods Foundation was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl. It focuses on projects for children. Initially these comprised golf clinics (aimed especially at disadvantaged children), and a grant program. Further activities added since then include university scholarships, an association with Target House at St. Jude Hospital in <!--del_lnk--> Memphis, Tennessee; the Start Something character development program, which had had over one million participants by 2003; and the Tiger Woods Learning Centre.<li><b>In The City Golf Clinics and Festivals</b>: Since 1997, the Tiger Woods Foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country. The Foundation began the &ldquo;In the City&rdquo; golf clinic program in 2003. The first three clinics were held in Indio, Calif., Wilkinsburg, Pa., and San Juan, Puerto Rico, and were targeted to all youth, ages 7-17, and their families. Each three-day event features golf lessons on Thursday and Friday of clinic week and a free community festival on Saturday. Cities are selected to participate in the clinics through a formal bid process. Winning cities may invite 15 junior golfers to participate and receive instruction from local PGA professionals. Top junior golfers from each In The City Clinic are selected to participate in the annual Tiger Woods Foundation Youth Clinic. This three-day junior golf event includes tickets to Disney Resorts; a pitch, putt and drive skills tournament; a junior golf clinic; and an exhibition by Tiger Woods. As part of the junior golf clinics, TWF works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to bring at least one Make-A-Wish child to each clinic. These children are given the opportunity to meet Tiger, take some photos with him and talk to him about anything they choose.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Tiger Woods Learning Centre</b>: This is a 35,000 square foot (3,000 m&sup2;) educational facility in <!--del_lnk--> Anaheim, California which opened in February 2006. It is expected to be used by several thousand students each year, with a day program for grades 4 to 6 and an after school program for grades 7 to 12. There will also be summer programs, weekend and community outreach programs and online learning programs. The centre&#39;s website states, <i>&quot;Our mission is to provide an interactive enrichment program that will improve individual aptitude in reading, math, science and technology&quot;.</i> The centre will feature extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Tiger Jam</b>: An annual fundraising concert. 2006&#39;s Tiger Jam IX will be headlined by <!--del_lnk--> Sting.<li><b><!--del_lnk--> Target World Challenge</b>: An annual off-season charity golf tournament. The event also carries generous prize money, but Woods donates his winnings to his foundation.<li><b>Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team</b>: An eighteen member team which competes in the annual <!--del_lnk--> Junior World Golf Championships.</ul>
      <p>Woods has also participated in charity work for his current caddy, <!--del_lnk--> Steve Williams. On <!--del_lnk--> April 24, <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Woods won an <a href="../../wp/a/Auto_racing.htm" title="Auto racing">auto racing</a> event that benefited the <!--del_lnk--> Steve Williams Foundation to raise funds to provide sporting careers for disadvantaged youth.<p><a id="Hobbies" name="Hobbies"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hobbies</span></h3>
      <p>Outside of golf, Woods enjoys working out, boating, water sports, fishing, cooking and car racing. He has never owned an airplane, with his sponsor <!--del_lnk--> NetJets providing that as part of his sponsorship package.<p>In February <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Woods signed a contract with Christensen Shipyards for summer delivery of a 155 foot Trideck Motor Yacht known as Hull 026. The 4,000 nautical mile range boat was about two-thirds complete, and after Woods agreed a purchase price of around $20 million, his then fiancee Elin would travel regularly to the Vancouver, Washington, yard to make interior decorating decisions.<p>The toys on the boat include: three <!--del_lnk--> Sea-Doos, two oceangoing <!--del_lnk--> kayaks, and a pair of <!--del_lnk--> Vespa scooters. She also has six <a href="../../wp/h/Helium.htm" title="Helium">helium</a> tanks (when combined with <a href="../../wp/o/Oxygen.htm" title="Oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="../../wp/n/Nitrogen.htm" title="Nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, helium creates <!--del_lnk--> trimix, a breathable blend that lets one dive deeper than traditional tanks full of compressed air). The boat also has an inflatable decompression chamber, an important safety measure for divers who go deeper than the standard 120-foot recreational limit. All the gear is for spear fishing, with Woods once explaining his passion for diving on his website: <i>&quot;The fish don&#39;t know who I am.&quot;</i><p>Part of the contract Woods agreed with the yard was confidentiality &mdash; although pictures of the boat could be used, its name and interior details, through final fittings, were not to be disclosed. After his marriage of <!--del_lnk--> 5 October, the couple used the boat, now called <b>&quot;Privacy&quot;</b> on a honeymoon cruise to Puerto Rico &mdash; where on <!--del_lnk--> 14 October, the boat was boarded by customs officials for not giving the required four days entry notice.<p>On his return from honeymoon, Woods sued Christensen for <!--del_lnk--> more than $75,000 in damages, because his privacy was violated. But because of Woods&#39; celebrity and how much clout he carries in the advertising world, compensatory damages could have reached reach $50 million. The action was settled out of court, and it is believed that Christensen paid Woods around half the cost of his yacht in compensation.<p><a id="Endorsements" name="Endorsements"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Endorsements</span></h3>
      <p>Shortly after his 21st birthday, Woods began signing numerous endorsement deals. Some of the companies that Woods signed with included <!--del_lnk--> General Motors, <!--del_lnk--> General Mills, <!--del_lnk--> American Express, <!--del_lnk--> Accenture and the one he is most known for &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Nike. Woods signed a 5-year, $100 million endorsing contract with Nike, which at the time was the largest endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete. Some of the famous Nike advertising campaigns featuring Woods include the &quot;I am Tiger Woods&quot; spots, in which children claim they are the golfing superstar. Another featured Woods doing a trick with a golf ball in which he bounces a ball on a club several times then hits it baseball style. This is a routine that Woods often performs during golf exhibitions.<p>On Father&#39;s Day after the passing of his father in 2006, Nike released a commercial featuring home movie clips from Tiger&#39;s childhood, usually showing Tiger as a child receiving training and support from his father. The commercial was dedicated to Earl Woods and &quot;fathers everywhere.&quot; His talent, looks, youth appeal, and personality have made him a bankable celebrity and the highest valued athletic spokesperson numerous years in a row. Only <a href="../../wp/m/Michael_Jordan.htm" title="Michael Jordan">Michael Jordan</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Arnold Palmer have had longer tenures at the top for endorsements and have made more money from them overall than Woods. <p>Woods also endorses the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Tiger Woods PGA Tour&#39; series of video games; he has done so from <!--del_lnk--> 1999 up to <!--del_lnk--> 2007 and it is likely that he will continue to do so.<p>Woods collaborated with <!--del_lnk--> TAG Heuer to develop the world&#39;s first professional golf watch, released in April 2005.<p>The PGA Tour prohibits paying players appearance fees but it is common elsewhere. Initially, people speculated that Tiger&rsquo;s appearance fees were one million dollars each appearance and in 2006 had escalated to three million dollars.<p><a id="Controversy" name="Controversy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Controversy</span></h2>
      <p>Also in 1996, Woods drew harsh criticism from the media (and his fellow Tour pros) when he broke protocol and withdrew from the Buick Challenge tournament in <!--del_lnk--> Pine Mountain, Georgia; he also failed to attend a dinner held in his honour the night before (he later apologized to those in attendance). In 1997, a <!--del_lnk--> GQ article portrayed Woods as using profanity and telling racist and sexist jokes <!--del_lnk--> .<p>Also in 1997, fellow pro <!--del_lnk--> Fuzzy Zoeller referred to Tiger as &quot;that little boy&quot; and urged him not to order fried chicken or collard greens for the Masters traditional Champion&#39;s dinner. This occurred shortly after Tiger won his first green jacket in 1997.<p>Shortly after winning the Masters in 1997, Woods declined an invitation from then United States President <a href="../../wp/b/Bill_Clinton.htm" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> to attend a ceremony at Shea Stadium honoring baseball great <a href="../../wp/j/Jackie_Robinson.htm" title="Jackie Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>, who had broken the colour barrier in baseball 50 years earlier. Woods instead went to Atlantic City and to Myrtle Beach to attend ribbon cuttings at openings of the <!--del_lnk--> All-Star Cafe and then left on vacation. One of Woods&#39; managers Hughes Norton defended his action, saying that &quot;It&#39;s no disrespect by Tiger to Jackie Robinson, who is without question one of Tiger&#39;s heroes. Nor is it any disrespect to President Clinton. But it&#39;s a good indication of how important off-time is to Tiger.&quot;<p>In 2006, following the US Masters, Woods referred to himself as a &#39;<!--del_lnk--> spaz&#39; in a post-tournament interview, in reference to his putting during the tournament. While the comment brought little notice in the United States, he was criticized for his use of the word spaz, particularly outside of the United States, where the word has a more negative connotation, including by Paralympian Dame <!--del_lnk--> Tanni Grey-Thompson. His manager promptly apologized for the remark on his behalf. Woods did not speak directly about his comments.<p>Also in <!--del_lnk--> 2006, <!--del_lnk--> The Dubliner Magazine published graphs purportedly depicting his wife. During a <!--del_lnk--> Ryder Cup press conference, Woods vehemently denied that these photographs contained his wife, saying &quot;to link her to sites and such is unacceptable, and I do not accept that at all. Neither does our team.&quot; The magazine issued an apology, calling it pure satire, and a parody of tabloids. According to his agent, Woods is studying the merits of a lawsuit.<p><a id="Cut_Streak" name="Cut_Streak"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Cut Streak</span></h3>
      <p>In both Nelson&#39;s and Woods&#39;s eras, &quot;making the cut&quot; has been defined as receiving a paycheck. However, in Nelson&#39;s day only players who placed in the top 20 in an event won a paycheck whereas in Woods&#39;s day only players who reach a low enough score within the first 36 holes win a paycheck. Several golf analysts argue that Woods did not actually surpass Nelson&#39;s consecutive cuts mark, reasoning that 31 of the tournaments in which Woods competed were &quot;no-cut&quot; events, meaning all the players in the field were guaranteed to compete throughout the entire event regardless of their scores through 36 holes (and hence all &quot;made the cut,&quot; meaning that they all received a paycheck). These analysts argue that this would leave Woods&#39;s final consecutive cuts made at 111, and Nelson&#39;s at 113.<p>At least ten of the tournaments in which Nelson played did not have modern day cuts; that is, all of the players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. The Masters, for example, did not institute a 36 hole cut until 1957 (which was well after Nelson retired), the PGA Championship was match play until 1958 and it is unclear whether or not three other events in which Nelson competed had 36 hole cuts. Therefore, these analysts remove &quot;no 36 hole cut&quot; events from both cut streak measures, leaving Nelson&#39;s consecutive cuts made at 103 (or possibly less) and Woods&#39;s at 111. However, in the tournaments in which Nelson competed that did not have 36 hole cuts (that is: the Masters, PGA Championship and the possible 3 other tournaments) only the top 20 players received a paycheck even though all players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. Hence in these no 36 hole cut events, Nelson still placed in the top 20, so Nelson&#39;s 113 cuts made is reflective of his 113 top 20 finishes. Woods achieved a top 20 finish 21 consecutive times (from July 2000 to July 2001) and, in the 31 no-cut events in which he played, he won 10 and finished out of the top 10 five times. Others, including Woods himself, argue that the two streaks cannot be compared, because the variation of tournament structures in the two eras is too great for any meaningful comparison to be made.<p><a id="Tiger-Proofing" name="Tiger-Proofing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Tiger-Proofing</span></h3>
      <p>Early in Woods&#39; career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game (and thus the public appeal of professional golf). This issue was most prominent from 1999-2002, when Woods was at his most dominant. Sports writer Bill Lyon of <!--del_lnk--> Knight-Ridder asked in a column, &quot;Isn&#39;t Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?&quot; (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he wasn&#39;t).<!--del_lnk-->  At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.<p>Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including Major Championship sites like <!--del_lnk--> Augusta National) began to add yardage to their tees in an effort to slow down long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as &quot;Tiger-Proofing&quot;. Woods himself welcomed the change as he believes adding yardage to the course doesn&#39;t affect his ability to win.<!--del_lnk--> <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 2006 Tiger demonstrated his &quot;intelligence game&quot;, as he won both The Open and PGA Championships without out-driving his playing partner. In fact, during The Open Championship, Tiger only used his driver once, instead choosing long irons off the tee to hit fairways more consistently.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods&quot;</div>
