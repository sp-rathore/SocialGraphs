      <p>The <b>Triassic</b> is a <!--del_lnk--> geologic period that extends from about 251 to 200 <!--del_lnk--> Ma (million years ago).

Both the start and end of the Triassic are marked by major <!--del_lnk--> extinction events. The extinction event that closed the Triassic period has recently been more accurately dated, but as with most older geologic periods, the rock beds that define the start and end are well identified, but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain by a few million years.<p>During the Triassic, both marine and continental life show an <!--del_lnk--> adaptive radiation beginning from the starkly impoverished <a href="../../wp/b/Biosphere.htm" title="Biosphere">biosphere</a> that followed the <!--del_lnk--> Permian-Triassic extinction. Corals of the hexacorallia group make their first appearance. The first flowering plants (<!--del_lnk--> Angiosperms) may have evolved during the Triassic, as did the first flying vertebrates, the <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a>.<table class="toccolours" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

      <p>The Triassic was named in <!--del_lnk--> 1834 by <!--del_lnk--> Friedrich Von Alberti from the three distinct layers (Latin <i>trias</i> meaning triad) &mdash;<!--del_lnk--> red beds, capped by <!--del_lnk--> chalk, followed by black <!--del_lnk--> shales&mdash; that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the &#39;Trias&#39;.<p><a id="Dating_and_subdivisions" name="Dating_and_subdivisions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Dating and subdivisions</span></h2>
      <p>The Triassic is usually separated into <!--del_lnk--> Early, <!--del_lnk--> Middle, and <!--del_lnk--> Late Triassic <!--del_lnk--> Epochs, and the corresponding rocks are referred to as Lower, Middle, or Upper Triassic.

      <p>During the Triassic, almost all the Earth&#39;s land mass was concentrated into a single supercontinent centered more or less on the equator, called <!--del_lnk--> Pangea (&quot;all the land&quot;). This took the form of a giant &quot;<a href="../../wp/p/Pac-Man.htm" title="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>&quot; with an East-facing &quot;mouth&quot; constituting the <!--del_lnk--> Tethys sea, a vast gulf that opened farther westwards in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking <!--del_lnk--> Paleo-Tethys Ocean, an ocean that existed during the <!--del_lnk--> Paleozoic. The remainder was the world-ocean known as <!--del_lnk--> Panthalassa (&quot;all the sea&quot;). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through <!--del_lnk--> subduction of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> supercontinent <!--del_lnk--> Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic, especially late in the period, but had not yet separated. The first marine and nonmarine sediments in the earliest rift, which separated <!--del_lnk--> New Jersey from <a href="../../wp/m/Morocco.htm" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, are Late Triassic in origin; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the <!--del_lnk--> Newark Supergroup.<!--del_lnk-->  Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare, despite their prominence in Western Europe, where the Triassic was first studied. In North America, for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the West. Thus Triassic <!--del_lnk--> stratigraphy is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as <i><!--del_lnk--> Estheria</i> crustaceans.<p><a id="Climate" name="Climate"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Climate</span></h2>
      <p>The Triassic climate was generally hot and dry, forming typical <!--del_lnk--> red bed <!--del_lnk--> sandstones and <!--del_lnk--> evaporites. There is no evidence of <a href="../../wp/g/Glacier.htm" title="Glacier">glaciation</a> at or near either pole; in fact, the polar regions were apparently moist and <a href="../../wp/t/Temperate.htm" title="Temperate">temperate</a>, a climate suitable for reptile-like creatures. Pangea&#39;s large size limited the moderating effect of the global ocean; its <!--del_lnk--> continental climate was highly seasonal, with very hot summers and cold winters.(Stanley, 452-3) It probably had strong, cross-<!--del_lnk--> equatorial <!--del_lnk--> monsoons.(Stanley, 452-3)<p><a id="Lifeforms" name="Lifeforms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Lifeforms</span></h2>
      <p>In the <b>Triassic</b>, three categories of organisms can be distinguished: holdovers from the <!--del_lnk--> Permian-Triassic extinction, some new groups which flourished briefly, and new groups which went on to dominate the <!--del_lnk--> Mesozoic world.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> marine environments new, modern types of <!--del_lnk--> corals appeared in the <!--del_lnk--> Early Triassic, forming small patches of <!--del_lnk--> reefs of modest extent compared to the great reef systems of <a href="../../wp/d/Devonian.htm" title="Devonian">Devonian</a> times or modern reefs. The shelled <!--del_lnk--> cephalopods called <a href="../../wp/a/Ammonite.htm" title="Ammonite">Ammonites</a> recovered, diversifying from a single line that survived the Permian extinction. The fish fauna was remarkably uniform, reflecting the fact that very few families survived the Permian extinction. There were also many types of marine reptiles. These including the <!--del_lnk--> Sauropterygia, which featured <!--del_lnk--> pachypleurosaurs and <!--del_lnk--> nothosaurs (both common during the Middle Triassic, especially in the <!--del_lnk--> Tethys region), <!--del_lnk--> placodonts, and the first <a href="../../wp/p/Plesiosaur.htm" title="Plesiosaur">plesiosaurs</a>; the first of the rather lizardlike <!--del_lnk--> Thalattosauria (<!--del_lnk--> Askeptosaurs); and the highly successful <a href="../../wp/i/Ichthyosaur.htm" title="Ichthyosaur">ichthyosaurs</a>, which appeared in Early Triassic seas and soon diversified, some eventually developing to huge size during the late Triassic.<p>On land, the holdover plants included the <!--del_lnk--> lycophytes, the dominant <!--del_lnk--> cycads, <!--del_lnk--> ginkgophyta (represented in modern times by <i><!--del_lnk--> Ginkgo biloba</i>) and <!--del_lnk--> glossopterids. Seed plants dominated the land. In the northern hemisphere, conifers flourished. <i><!--del_lnk--> Glossopteris</i> (a seed fern) was the dominant southern hemisphere tree during the Early Triassic period.<p><!--del_lnk--> Temnospondyl <!--del_lnk--> amphibians were among those groups that survived the P-T extinction, some lineages (e.g. Trematosaurs) flourishing briefly in the Early Triassic, while others (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Capitosaurs) remained successful throughout the whole period, or only came to prominence in the Late Triassic (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Plagiosaurs, <!--del_lnk--> Metoposaurs). As for other amphibians, the first <!--del_lnk--> Lissamphibia are known from the Early Triassic, but the group as a whole does not become common until the <a href="../../wp/j/Jurassic.htm" title="Jurassic">Jurassic</a>, when the temnospondyls had become very rare.<p><!--del_lnk--> Archosauromorph reptiles &ndash; especially <!--del_lnk--> archosaurs &ndash; progressively replaced the <!--del_lnk--> synapsids that had dominated the Permian. Although <i><!--del_lnk--> Cynognathus</i> was a characteristic top predator in earlier Triassic (<!--del_lnk--> Olenekian and <!--del_lnk--> Anisian) <!--del_lnk--> Gondwana, and both <!--del_lnk--> Kannemeyeriid <!--del_lnk--> dicynodonts and <!--del_lnk--> gomphodont <!--del_lnk--> cynodonts remained important <a href="../../wp/h/Herbivore.htm" title="Herbivore">herbivores</a> during much of the period, by the end of the Triassic, synapsids played only bit parts. During the <!--del_lnk--> Carnian (early part of the Late Triassic), some advanced cynodont gave rise to the first <a href="../../wp/m/Mammal.htm" title="Mammal">mammals</a>. At the same time the <!--del_lnk--> Ornithodira, which until then had been small and insignificant, evolved into <a href="../../wp/p/Pterosaur.htm" title="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> and a variety of <a href="../../wp/d/Dinosaur.htm" title="Dinosaur">dinosaurs</a>. The <!--del_lnk--> Crurotarsi were the other important archosaur <!--del_lnk--> clade, and during the Late Triassic these also reached the height of their diversity, with various groups including the <!--del_lnk--> Phytosaurs, <!--del_lnk--> Aetosaurs, several distinct lineages of <!--del_lnk--> Rauisuchia, and the first <!--del_lnk--> crocodylians (the <!--del_lnk--> Sphenosuchia). Meanwhile the stocky herbivorous <!--del_lnk--> rhynchosaurs and the small to medium-sized insectivorous or piscivorous <!--del_lnk--> Prolacertiformes were important <!--del_lnk--> basal archosauromorph groups throughout most of the Triassic.<p>Among other reptiles, the earliest <!--del_lnk--> turtles, like <i><!--del_lnk--> Proganochelys</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Proterochersis</i>, appeared during the <!--del_lnk--> Norian (middle of the Late Triassic). The <!--del_lnk--> Lepidosauromorpha - specifically the <!--del_lnk--> Sphenodontia, are first known in the fossil record a little earlier (during the Carnian). The <!--del_lnk--> Procolophonidae were an important group of small <!--del_lnk--> lizard-like <!--del_lnk--> herbivores.<p><a id="Lagerst.C3.A4tten" name="Lagerst.C3.A4tten"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Lagerst&auml;tten</span></h2>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> Monte San Giorgio <!--del_lnk--> lagerst&auml;tte, now in the <!--del_lnk--> Lake Lugano region of northern Italy and Switzerland, was in Triassic times a lagoon behind reefs with an anoxic bottom layer, so there were no scavengers and little turbulence to disturb fossilization, a situation that can be compared to the better-known Jurassic <!--del_lnk--> Solnhofen limestone lagerst&auml;tte. The remains of fish, and various marine reptiles (including the common <!--del_lnk--> pachypleurosaur <i><!--del_lnk--> Neusticosaurus</i>, and the bizarre long-necked archosauromorph <i><!--del_lnk--> Tanystropheus</i>), along with some terrestrial forms like <i><!--del_lnk--> Ticinosuchus</i> and <i><!--del_lnk--> Macrocnemus</i>, have been recovered from this locality. All these fossils date from the <!--del_lnk--> Anisian/<!--del_lnk--> Ladinian transition (about 237 million years ago).<p><a id="Late_Triassic_extinction_event" name="Late_Triassic_extinction_event"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Late Triassic extinction event</span></h2>

      <p>The Triassic period ended with a mass extinction, which was particularly severe in the oceans; the <!--del_lnk--> conodonts disappeared, and all the marine reptiles except <a href="../../wp/i/Ichthyosaur.htm" title="Ichthyosaur">ichthyosaurs</a> and <!--del_lnk--> plesiosaurs. Invertebrates like <!--del_lnk--> brachiopods, <!--del_lnk--> gastropods, and <!--del_lnk--> molluscs were severely affected. In the oceans, 22 percent of marine families and possibly about half of marine genera went missing, according to <a href="../../wp/u/University_of_Chicago.htm" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> paleontologist <!--del_lnk--> Jack Sepkoski.<p>Though the end-Triassic extinction event was not equally devastating everywhere in terrestrial ecosystems (see below), several important clades of <!--del_lnk--> Crurotarsi (large archosaurian reptiles previously grouped together as the <!--del_lnk--> thecodonts) disappeared, as did most of the large labyrinthodont amphibians, a number of groups of small reptiles, and some synapsids (except for the proto-mammals). Some of the early, primitive dinosaurs also went extinct, but other, more adaptive dinosaurs survived to evolve in the Jurassic. Surviving plants that went on to dominate the Mesozoic world included modern conifers and cycadeoids.<p>It is not certain what caused this Late Triassic extinction, which was accompanied by huge volcanic eruptions about 208-213 million years ago, the largest recorded volcanic event since the planet cooled and stabilized, as the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart. Other possible causes for the extinction events include global cooling or even a <!--del_lnk--> bolide impact, for which an impact crater surrounding Manicouagan Reservoir, Quebec, Canada, has been singled out. At the <!--del_lnk--> Manicouagan impact crater (<i>see illustration at the entry</i>), however, recent research has shown that the impact melt within the crater has an age of 214&plusmn;1 Ma. The date of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has also been more accurately fixed recently, at 202&plusmn;1 Ma. Both dates are gaining accuracy by using more accurate forms of radiometric dating, in particular the decay of uranium to lead in zircons formed at the impact. So the evidence suggests the Manicouagan impact preceded the end of the Triassic by approximately 12&plusmn;2 Ma. Therefore it could not be the immediate cause of the observed mass extinction (Hodych &amp; Dunning, 1992).<p>The number of Late Triassic extinctions is disputed. Some studies suggest that there are at least two periods of extinction towards the end of the Triassic, between 12 and 17 million years apart. But arguing against this is a recent study of North American faunas. In the <!--del_lnk--> Petrified Forest of northeast Arizona there is a unique sequence of latest Carnian-early Norian terrestrial sediments. An analysis in 2002 (<!--del_lnk--> ) found no significant change in the paleoenvironment. <!--del_lnk--> Phytosaurs, the most common fossils there, experienced a change-over only at the genus level, and the number of species remained the same. Some <!--del_lnk--> Aetosaurs, the next most common tetrapods, and early dinosaurs, passed through unchanged. However, both Phytosaurs and Aetosaurs were among the groups of archosaur reptiles completely wiped out by the end-Triassic extinction event.<p>It seems likely then that there was some sort of end-Carnian extinction, when several <!--del_lnk--> herbivorous archosauromorph groups died out, while the large herbivorous <!--del_lnk--> therapsids&mdash; the <!--del_lnk--> Kannemeyeriid <!--del_lnk--> dicynodonts and the <!--del_lnk--> Traversodont <!--del_lnk--> cynodonts&mdash; were much reduced in the northern half of Pangaea (<!--del_lnk--> Laurasia).<p>These extinctions within the Triassic and at its end allowed the dinosaurs to expand into many niches that had become unoccupied. Dinosaurs would become increasingly dominant, abundant and diverse, and remained that way for the next 150 million years. The true &quot;Age of Dinosaurs&quot; is the Jurassic and Cretaceous, rather than the Triassic.<p><a id="See_also" name="See_also"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic&quot;</div>
