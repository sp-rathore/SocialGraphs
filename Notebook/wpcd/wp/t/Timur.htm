He is also known as <b>Timur-e Lang</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Persian: &#x62A;&#x6CC;&#x645;&#x648;&#x631; &#x644;&#x646;&#x6AF;) which translates to <b>Timur the Lame</b>, as he was lame after sustaining an injury to the leg as a child.<p>He ruled over an empire that extends in modern nations from south eastern <a href="../../wp/t/Turkey.htm" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="../../wp/s/Syria.htm" title="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iraq.htm" title="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kuwait.htm" title="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a>, through <!--del_lnk--> Central Asia encompassing part of <a href="../../wp/k/Kazakhstan.htm" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/r/Russia.htm" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../wp/t/Turkmenistan.htm" title="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/k/Kyrgyzstan.htm" title="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Pakistan.htm" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a>, even approaching <!--del_lnk--> Kashgar in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>.<p>Timur&#39;s legacy is a mixed one, for while Central Asia blossomed, some say even peaked, under his reign, other places such as <!--del_lnk--> Baghdad, <!--del_lnk--> Damascus, <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> and other Arab, Persian, Indian and Turkic cities were sacked and destroyed, and many thousands of people were slaughtered.

      <p>Timur was born in <!--del_lnk--> Transoxiana, near Kesh (an area now better known as <!--del_lnk--> Shahr-e Sabz), &#39;the green city,&#39; situated some 50 miles south of <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand in modern <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>.<p>Timur placed much of his early legitimacy on his genealogical roots to the great Mongol conqueror <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. What is known is that he was descended from the Mongol invaders who initially pushed westwards after the establishment of the Mongol empire.<p>His father <!--del_lnk--> Tara<u>gh</u>ay was head of the tribe of <!--del_lnk--> Barlas, a nomadic Turkic-speaking tribe of Mongol origin that traced its origin to the Mongol commander <!--del_lnk--> Qarachar Barlas. Tara<u>gh</u>ay was the great-grandson of <!--del_lnk--> Qarachar Noyon and, distinguished among his fellow-clansmen as the first convert to <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>, Tara<u>gh</u>ay might have assumed the high military rank which fell to him by right of inheritance; but like his father Burkul he preferred a life of retirement and study. Tara<u>gh</u>ay would eventually retire to a Muslim monastery, telling his son that &quot;the world is a beautiful vase filled with <!--del_lnk--> scorpions.&quot;<p>Under a paternal eye, the education of young Timur was such that at the age of twenty he had not only become an adept in manly outdoor exercises but had earned the reputation of being an attentive reader of the <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a>. Like his father, Timur was a Muslim and may have been influenced by <!--del_lnk--> Sufism. At this period, according to the <i>Memoirs</i> (<i>Malfu&#39;at</i>), he exhibited proofs of a tender and sympathetic nature, though these claims are generally now held to be spurious.<p>In addition, the spurious genealogy on his tombstone taking his descent back to Ali, and the presence of Shiites in his army led some observers and scholars to call him a Shiite. However, his official religious counselor was the Hanafite scholar Abd alJabbar Khwarazmi. There is evidence that he had converted to be Nusayri under the influence of Sayyed Barakah, a Nusayri leader from Balkh, who was a mentor of his. He also constructed one of his finest buildings at the tomb of <!--del_lnk--> Ahmed Yesevi, an influential Turkic <!--del_lnk--> Sufi saint who was doing most to spread <!--del_lnk--> Sunni Islam among the nomads.<p><a id="Military_leader" name="Military_leader"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Military leader</span></h2>

      <p>In about <!--del_lnk--> 1360 Timur gained prominence as a military leader. He took part in campaigns in <!--del_lnk--> Transoxania with <!--del_lnk--> the khan of <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai, a descendant of <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. His career for the next ten or eleven years may be thus briefly summarized from the <i>Memoirs</i>. Allying himself both in cause and by family connection with <!--del_lnk--> Kurgan, the dethroner and destroyer of <!--del_lnk--> Volga Bulgaria, he was to invade <!--del_lnk--> Khorasan at the head of a thousand horsemen. This was the second military expedition which he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjection of <!--del_lnk--> Khwarizm and <!--del_lnk--> Urganj.<p>After the murder of Kurgan the disputes which arose among the many claimants to sovereign power were halted by the invasion of <!--del_lnk--> Tughluk Timur of <!--del_lnk--> Kashgar, another descendant of <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. Timur was dispatched on a mission to the invader&#39;s camp, the result of which was his own appointment to the head of his own tribe, the <!--del_lnk--> Barlas, in place of its former leader <!--del_lnk--> Hajji Beg.<p>The exigencies of Timur&#39;s quasi-sovereign position compelled him to have recourse to his formidable patron, whose reappearance on the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Syr Darya created a consternation not easily allayed. The Barlas were taken from Timur and entrusted to a son of Tughluk, along with the rest of <!--del_lnk--> Mawarannahr; but he was defeated in battle by the bold warrior he had replaced at the head of a numerically far inferior force.<p><a id="Rise_to_power" name="Rise_to_power"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to power</span></h2>
      <p>Tughluk&#39;s death facilitated the work of reconquest, and a few years of perseverance and energy sufficed for its accomplishment, as well as for the addition of a vast extent of territory. During this period Timur and his brother-in-law Husayn, at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures full of interest and romance, became rivals and antagonists. At the close of 1369 Husayn was assassinated and Timur, having been formally proclaimed sovereign at <!--del_lnk--> Balkh, mounted the throne at Samarkand, the capital of his dominions.<p>It is notable that Timur never claimed for himself the title of <!--del_lnk--> khan, styling himself <!--del_lnk--> amir and acting in the name of the <!--del_lnk--> Chagatai ruler of Transoxania. Timur was a military genius but lacking in political sense. He tended not to leave a government apparatus behind in lands he conquered, and was often faced with the need to conquer such lands again after inevitable rebellions.<p><a id="Period_of_expansion" name="Period_of_expansion"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Period of expansion</span></h2>
      <p>Until his death, Timur spent the next 35 years in various wars and expeditions. Timur not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and north-west led him among the Mongols of the <a href="../../wp/c/Caspian_Sea.htm" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a> and to the banks of the <!--del_lnk--> Ural and the <!--del_lnk--> Volga. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>, including <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Karbala and <!--del_lnk--> Kurdistan.<p>One of the most formidable of his opponents was <!--del_lnk--> Tokhtamysh who, after having been a refugee at the court of Timur, became ruler both of the eastern <!--del_lnk--> Kipchak and the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horde and quarrelled with Timur over the possession of <!--del_lnk--> Khwarizm. Timur supported Tokhtamysh against Russians and Tokhtamysh, with armed support by Timur, invaded Russia and in <!--del_lnk--> 1382 captured <a href="../../wp/m/Moscow.htm" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. After the death of <!--del_lnk--> Abu Sa&#39;id (<!--del_lnk--> 1335), ruler of the <!--del_lnk--> Ilkhanid Dynasty, there was a power vacuum in the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Empire.htm" title="Persian Empire">Persia</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1383 Timur started the military conquest of Persia. Timur captured <!--del_lnk--> Herat, Khorasan and all eastern Persia to <!--del_lnk--> 1385.<p>In the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the <!--del_lnk--> Golden Horde, turned against Timur and invaded <a href="../../wp/a/Azerbaijan.htm" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1385. It was not until <!--del_lnk--> 1395, in the <!--del_lnk--> battle of Kur River, that the power of Tokhtamysh was finally broken, after a titanic struggle between the two monarchs. In this war, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for about 500 miles into the uninhabited steppe, then west about 1000 miles, advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. Tokhtamysh&#39;s army finally was cornered against the Volga River near <!--del_lnk--> Orenburg and destroyed. During this march, Timur&#39;s army got far enough north to be in a region of <!--del_lnk--> very long summer days, causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of <!--del_lnk--> prayers in such northern regions. Timur led a second campaign against Tokhtamysh via an easier route through the <!--del_lnk--> Caucasus, and Timur destroyed <!--del_lnk--> Sarai and <!--del_lnk--> Astrakhan, and wrecked the Golden Horde&#39;s economy based on <!--del_lnk--> Silk Road trade.<p><a id="India" name="India"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">India</span></h2>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1398 Timur, informed about civil war in <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">India</a> (started in <!--del_lnk--> 1394), began war against the <!--del_lnk--> Muslim <!--del_lnk--> Ruler in <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a>. He crossed the <a href="../../wp/i/Indus_River.htm" title="Indus River">Indus River</a> at <!--del_lnk--> Attock on <!--del_lnk--> September 24. The capture of <!--del_lnk--> towns and <!--del_lnk--> villages was very often accompanied by their destruction and the massacre of their inhabitants. On his way to <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> he met fierce resistance put up by the <!--del_lnk--> Governor of <!--del_lnk--> Meerut, Qilladar (Qilla means Fort; Qill-dar means Fort Commander) Ilyaas <!--del_lnk--> Awan Alvi, who engaged him in an intense battle which lasted nearly two months inflicting heavy losses on both sides. After the honourable and couragous death in battle of Ilaas <!--del_lnk--> Awan, Timur (though very much impressed by Ilyaas <!--del_lnk--> Awan&#39;s bravery) approached <a href="../../wp/d/Delhi.htm" title="Delhi">Delhi</a> to meet with the armies of the <!--del_lnk--> Emperor, <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> Nasir-u-Din Mehmud of <!--del_lnk--> Tughlaq <!--del_lnk--> Dynasty, who was already weak due to a fight for power in the <!--del_lnk--> Royal <a href="../../wp/f/Family.htm" title="Family">Family</a>. The <a href="../../wp/s/Sultan.htm" title="Sultan">Sultan</a>&#39;s army was easily defeated and destroyed on <!--del_lnk--> December 17, <!--del_lnk--> 1394. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in a mass of ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed more than 50,000 captives, and after the sack of Delhi almost all inhabitants who were not killed were captured and deported. It is said that the devastation of Delhi was not Timur&#39;s intent, but that his horde could simply not be controlled after entering the city gates. However, some historians have stated that he told his armies they could have free reign over Delhi.<p>Timur left Delhi in approximately January 1399. In April 1399 he was back in his own capital beyond the <!--del_lnk--> Oxus (Amu Darya). An immense quantity of spoils was conveyed from India. According to <!--del_lnk--> Ruy Gonz&aacute;les de Clavijo, ninety captured <a href="../../wp/e/Elephant.htm" title="Elephant">elephants</a> were employed merely to carry <!--del_lnk--> stones from certain quarries to enable the conqueror to erect a <a href="../../wp/m/Mosque.htm" title="Mosque">mosque</a> at Samarkand, probably the enormous <!--del_lnk--> Bibi-Khanym Mosque.<p><a id="Last_campaigns_and_death" name="Last_campaigns_and_death"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Last campaigns and death</span></h2>
      <p>Timur went to <a href="../../wp/k/Kashmir_region.htm" title="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> from Delhi and forced hundreds to embrace Islam. Before the end of 1399 Timur started a war with <!--del_lnk--> Bayezid I, sultan of the <a href="../../wp/o/Ottoman_Empire.htm" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, and the <!--del_lnk--> Mamluk sultan of <a href="../../wp/e/Egypt.htm" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Bayezid began annexing the territory of Turkmen and Muslim rulers in <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia. As Timur claimed suzerainity over the <!--del_lnk--> Turkmen rulers, they took refuge behind him. Timur invaded Syria, sacked <!--del_lnk--> Aleppo, and captured <a href="../../wp/d/Damascus.htm" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> after defeating the Mamluk&#39;s army. The city&#39;s inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans who were deported to Samarkand. This led to Tamarlane&#39;s being publicly declared an enemy of Islam.<p>He invaded <a href="../../wp/b/Baghdad.htm" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him (many warriors were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur). In 1402, Timur invaded Anatolia and defeated Bayezid in the <!--del_lnk--> Battle of Ankara on <!--del_lnk--> July 20, <!--del_lnk--> 1402. Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the twelve year <!--del_lnk--> Ottoman Interregnum period. Timur&#39;s stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of <!--del_lnk--> Seljuq authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of <!--del_lnk--> Anatolia as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur&#39;s interest with Genghizid legitimacy.<p>By 1368, the Ming had driven the Mongols out of China. The first <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming</a> Emperor <!--del_lnk--> Hongwu Emperor demanded, and got, many Central Asian states to pay homage to China as the political heirs to the former House of <!--del_lnk--> Kublai. Timur more than once sent to the Ming Government gifts which could have passed as tribute, at first not daring to defy the economic and military might of the <!--del_lnk--> Middle Kingdom.<p>Timur wished to restore the Mongol Empire, and eventually planned to conquer China. In December <!--del_lnk--> 1404, Timur started military expeditions against the <a href="../../wp/m/Ming_Dynasty.htm" title="Ming Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> of <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, but he was attacked by fever and plague when encamped on the farther side of the Sihon (<!--del_lnk--> Syr-Daria) and died at Atrar (<!--del_lnk--> Otrar) in mid-February <!--del_lnk--> 1405. His scouts explored Mongolia before his death, and the writing they carved on trees in Mongolia&#39;s mountains could still be seen even in the twentieth century.<p>Of Timur&#39;s four sons, two (Jahangir and Umar Shaykh) predeceased him. His third son, <!--del_lnk--> Miran Shah, died soon after Timur, leaving the youngest son, <!--del_lnk--> Shah Rukh. Although his designated successor was his grandson <!--del_lnk--> Pir Muhammad b. Jahangir, Timur was ultimately succeeded in power by his son Shah Rukh. His most illustrious descendant <a href="../../wp/b/Babur.htm" title="Babur">Babur</a> founded the <!--del_lnk--> Mughal Empire and ruled over most of <!--del_lnk--> North India. Babur&#39;s descendants, <a href="../../wp/a/Akbar.htm" title="Akbar">Akbar</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Jahangir, <!--del_lnk--> Shah Jahan and <!--del_lnk--> Aurangzeb, expanded the Mughal Empire to most of the <!--del_lnk--> Indian subcontinent along with parts of <a href="../../wp/a/Afghanistan.htm" title="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>.<p>Markham, in his introduction to the narrative of Clavijo&#39;s embassy, states that his body &quot;was embalmed with musk and rose water, wrapped in linen, laid in an ebony coffin and sent to <!--del_lnk--> Samarkand, where it was buried.&quot; His tomb, the <!--del_lnk--> Gur-e Amir, still stands in Samarkand. Timur had carried his victorious arms on one side from the <!--del_lnk--> Irtish and the <!--del_lnk--> Volga to the <a href="../../wp/p/Persian_Gulf.htm" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and on the other from the <!--del_lnk--> Hellespont to the <a href="../../wp/g/Ganges_River.htm" title="Ganges River">Ganges River</a>.<p><a id="Contributions_to_the_arts" name="Contributions_to_the_arts"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Contributions to the arts</span></h2>
      <p>Timur became widely known as a patron to the arts. Much of the architecture he commissioned still stands in <!--del_lnk--> Samarqand, now in present-day <a href="../../wp/u/Uzbekistan.htm" title="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>. He was known to bring the most talented artisans from the lands he conquered back to Samarkand. And he is credited with often giving them a wide latitude of artistic freedom to express themselves.<p>According to legend, <!--del_lnk--> Omar Aqta, Timur&#39;s court <!--del_lnk--> calligrapher, transcribed the <a href="../../wp/q/Qur%2527an.htm" title="Qur&#39;an">Qur&#39;an</a> using letters so small that the entire text of the book fit on a <!--del_lnk--> signet ring. Omar also is said to have created a Qur&#39;an so large that a <!--del_lnk--> wheelbarrow was required to transport it. <!--del_lnk--> Folios of what is probably this larger Qur&#39;an have been found, written in gold lettering on huge pages.<p>Timur was also said to have created <!--del_lnk--> Tamerlane Chess, a variant of <!--del_lnk--> shatranj (also known as medieval chess) played on a larger board with several additional pieces and an original method of pawn promotion.<h2> <span class="mw-headline">Exhumation</span></h2>
      <p>Timur&#39;s body was <!--del_lnk--> exhumed from his tomb in <!--del_lnk--> 1941 by the Russian anthropologist <!--del_lnk--> Mikhail M. Gerasimov. He found that Timur&#39;s facial characteristics conformed to that of Mongoloid features, which he believed, in some part, supported Timur&#39;s notion that he was descended from <a href="../../wp/g/Genghis_Khan.htm" title="Genghis Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. He also confirmed Timur&#39;s lameness. Gerasimov was able to reconstruct the likeness of Timur from his skull.<p>Famously, a curse has been attached to opening Timur&#39;s tomb. In the year of Timur&#39;s death, a sign was carved in Timur&#39;s tomb warning that whoever would dare disturb the tomb would bring demons of war onto his land. Gerasimov&#39;s expedition opened the tomb on June 19, <!--del_lnk--> 1941. <!--del_lnk--> Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany, began three days later on June 22, 1941. Shortly after Timur&#39;s skeleton and that of Ulugh Beg, his grandson, were reinterred with full Muslims burial rites in 1942, the Germans surrendered at Stalingrad. The legend of Tamerlane&#39;s curse features prominently in the 2006 Russian blockbuster <i><!--del_lnk--> Day Watch</i>.<p><a id="Fiction" name="Fiction"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Fiction</span></h2>
