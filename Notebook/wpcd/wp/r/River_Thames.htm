      <p>The Thames provided the major highway between London and Westminster in the 16th and 17th centuries. The clannish guild of watermen ferried Londoners from landing to landing and tolerated no outside interference.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/1/17th_century.htm" title="17th century">17th</a> and <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th centuries</a>, during the period now referred to as the <!--del_lnk--> Little Ice Age, the Thames often froze over in the winter. This led to the first <!--del_lnk--> Frost Fair in <!--del_lnk--> 1607, complete with a tent city set up on the river itself and offering a number of amusements, including ice bowling. After temperatures began to rise again, starting in <!--del_lnk--> 1814, the river has never frozen over completely. The building of a new <a href="../../wp/l/London_Bridge.htm" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a> in <!--del_lnk--> 1825 may also have been a factor; the new bridge had fewer pillars than the old, so allowing the river to flow more freely, thus preventing it from flowing slowly enough to freeze in cold winters.<p>By the 18th century, the Thames was one of the world&#39;s busiest waterways, as London became the centre of the vast, mercantile <a href="../../wp/b/British_Empire.htm" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. During this time, one of the worst river disasters in England took place on <!--del_lnk--> 3 September <!--del_lnk--> 1878, when the crowded pleasure boat <i><!--del_lnk--> Princess Alice</i> collided with the <i><!--del_lnk--> Bywell Castle</i>, killing over 640.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>In the &#39;<!--del_lnk--> Great Stink&#39; of <!--del_lnk--> 1858, pollution in the river reached such proportions that sittings at the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a> at Westminster had to be abandoned. A concerted effort to contain the city&#39;s sewage, by constructing massive <!--del_lnk--> sewers on the north and south river embankments followed, under the supervision of <!--del_lnk--> engineer <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Bazalgette.<p>The coming of <a href="../../wp/r/Rail_transport.htm" title="Rail transport">rail</a> and <!--del_lnk--> road transportation and the decline of the Empire, in the years following <!--del_lnk--> 1914, have reduced the prominence of the river. London itself is no longer a port of any note and the Port of London has moved downstream to <!--del_lnk--> Tilbury. In return, the river has undergone a massive clean-up, since the filthy days of the late <a href="../../wp/1/19th_century.htm" title="19th century">19th</a> and early- to mid-<a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th centuries</a> and aquatic life has returned to its formerly &#39;dead&#39; waters.<p>In the early <!--del_lnk--> 1980s a massive flood-control device, the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Barrier, was opened. It is closed several times a year to prevent water damage to London&#39;s low-lying areas upstream (as in the <!--del_lnk--> 1928 Thames flood for example). In the late <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, the 12-km-long <!--del_lnk--> Jubilee River was built, which acts as a <a href="../../wp/f/Flood.htm" title="Flood">flood</a> channel for the Thames around Maidenhead and Windsor.<p><a id="Origin_of_the_name" name="Origin_of_the_name"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Origin of the name</span></h3>
      <p>The river&#39;s name appears always to have been pronounced with a simple &quot;t&quot; at the beginning; the <!--del_lnk--> Middle English spelling was typically <i>Temese</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Latin <i><!--del_lnk--> Tamesis</i>. The &quot;th&quot; lends an air of <!--del_lnk--> Greek to the name and was added during the <a href="../../wp/r/Renaissance.htm" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, possibly to reflect or support a belief that the name was derived from <!--del_lnk--> River Thyamis in the <!--del_lnk--> Epirus region of <a href="../../wp/g/Greece.htm" title="Greece">Greece</a>, whence early <!--del_lnk--> Celtic tribes are thought to have migrated. However, most scholars now believe <i>Temese</i> and <i>Tamesis</i> come from <!--del_lnk--> Celtic (<!--del_lnk--> Brythonic) <i>Tamesa</i>, possibly meaning &#39;the dark one&#39;.<p>The name <a href="../../wp/i/Isis.htm" title="Isis">Isis</a>, given to the part of the river running through Oxford, may have come from the <!--del_lnk--> Egyptian goddess of that name but is believed to be a contraction of <i>Tamesis</i>, the <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> (or pre-Roman Celtic) name. Richard Coates has recently suggested that the river was called the <!--del_lnk--> Thames upriver, where it was narrower and Plowonida down river, where it was too wide to ford. This gave the name to a settlement on its banks, which became known as <!--del_lnk--> Londinium, from the original root Plowonida (derived from pre-celtic Old European &#39;plew&#39; and &#39;nejd,&#39; meaning something like the flowing river or the wide flowing unfordable river).<p><a id="Geography" name="Geography"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Geography</span></h2>

      <p>The Thames has a length of 346 <!--del_lnk--> km (215 <!--del_lnk--> miles). Its usually quoted <!--del_lnk--> source is at Thames Head (at <!--del_lnk--> grid reference <!--del_lnk--> ST980994), about a mile north of the village of <!--del_lnk--> Kemble and near the town of <!--del_lnk--> Cirencester, in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cotswolds.htm" title="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a>. However, Seven Springs near <!--del_lnk--> Cheltenham, where the river <!--del_lnk--> Churn rises, is also sometimes quoted as the Thames&#39; source, as this location is furthest from the mouth both in distance along its course and <!--del_lnk--> as the crow flies. The <!--del_lnk--> springs at Seven Springs also flow throughout the year, while those at Thames Head are only seasonal.<p>The Thames then flows through <!--del_lnk--> Lechlade, <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Abingdon, <!--del_lnk--> Wallingford, <!--del_lnk--> Reading, <!--del_lnk--> Henley-on-Thames, <!--del_lnk--> Marlow, <!--del_lnk--> Maidenhead, <!--del_lnk--> Windsor, <!--del_lnk--> Eton, <!--del_lnk--> Staines and <!--del_lnk--> Weybridge, before entering the <!--del_lnk--> Greater London area.<p>The river itself rises in <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire, traditionally forming the <!--del_lnk--> county boundary, firstly between <!--del_lnk--> Gloucestershire and <!--del_lnk--> Wiltshire, between <!--del_lnk--> Berkshire on the south bank and <!--del_lnk--> Oxfordshire on the north, between Berkshire and <!--del_lnk--> Buckinghamshire, between Berkshire and <!--del_lnk--> Surrey, between Surrey and <!--del_lnk--> Middlesex and between <!--del_lnk--> Essex and <!--del_lnk--> Kent. Before the 1974 boundary changes, the current boundary between Berkshire and Surrey was between Buckinghamshire and Surrey. The Oxfordshire - Berkshire boundary was also moved at that time.<p>The area to the <!--del_lnk--> west of London is normally called the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Valley, whilst <!--del_lnk--> east is called <!--del_lnk--> Thames Gateway.<p><a id="Catchment_area_and_discharge" name="Catchment_area_and_discharge"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Catchment area and discharge</span></h3>

      <p>The whole of the river drains a catchment area of some 12,935 square km (4,994 square miles) or 15,343 square km (5,924 square miles) if the <!--del_lnk--> River Medway is included as a tributary.<p><a id="The_non-tidal_section" name="The_non-tidal_section"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The non-tidal section</span></h4>
      <p>Innumerable brooks, streams and rivers, within an area of 9948 <!--del_lnk--> square km (3,841 <!--del_lnk--> square miles), combine to form 38 main tributaries feeding the Thames between its source and <!--del_lnk--> Teddington. These include the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Churn, <!--del_lnk--> Leach, <!--del_lnk--> Cole, <!--del_lnk--> Coln, <!--del_lnk--> Windrush, <!--del_lnk--> Evenlode, <!--del_lnk--> Cherwell, <!--del_lnk--> Ock, <!--del_lnk--> Thame, <!--del_lnk--> Pang, <!--del_lnk--> Kennet, <!--del_lnk--> Loddon, <!--del_lnk--> Colne, <!--del_lnk--> Wey and <!--del_lnk--> Mole.<p>Between Maidenhead and Windsor, the Thames supports an artificial secondary channel, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Jubilee River, for flood relief purposes.<p>More than half the rain that falls on this catchment is lost to evaporation and plant growth. The remainder provides the water resource that has to be shared between river flows, to support the natural environment and the community needs for water supplies to homes, industry and agriculture. During heavy rainfall events the Thames occasionally receives raw sewage discharge due to <!--del_lnk--> sanitary sewer overflow.<p><a id="The_tidal_section" name="The_tidal_section"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">The tidal section</span></h4>

      </div>
      <p>About 90 km from the sea, at Teddington, the river begins to exhibit <a href="../../wp/t/Tide.htm" title="Tide">tidal activity</a> from the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>. This tidal stretch of the river is known as &quot;the <!--del_lnk--> Tideway&quot;. London was reputedly made capital of <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Britain.htm" title="Roman Britain">Roman Britain</a> at the spot where the tides reached in <!--del_lnk--> AD 43 but this spot has moved up river, in the 2000 years since then, because of the glacial rebound effect. At London, the water is slightly <!--del_lnk--> brackish with sea salt. Below Teddington, the principal <!--del_lnk--> tributaries include the rivers <!--del_lnk--> Brent, <!--del_lnk--> Wandle, <!--del_lnk--> Effra, <!--del_lnk--> Westbourne, <!--del_lnk--> Fleet, <!--del_lnk--> Ravensbourne (the final part of which is called <!--del_lnk--> Deptford Creek), <!--del_lnk--> Lea, <!--del_lnk--> Darent and <!--del_lnk--> Ingrebourne.<p>The average discharge of the Thames grows up to approximately 66 m&sup3;/s (cumecs) at the end of its non-tidal section, at <!--del_lnk--> Kingston upon Thames, a figure which is exceeded by some other British rivers (e.g., the <a href="../../wp/r/River_Severn.htm" title="River Severn">Severn</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Tay). Indeed, if the Thames were not a tidal river, its average discharge in the centre of London would be somewhere between 80 and 100 m&sup3;/s, and the Thames would look like a small river, not the large river we can see today by Westminster, the Houses of Parliament or the City.<p>Some low-lying areas beside the tidal section of the Thames are liable to regular flooding at spring tides. However, in recent years, the flooding has been occurring more frequently at unusual times. One such example exists at <!--del_lnk--> Chiswick Lane South in London&#39;s W4 <!--del_lnk--> postal district, where the river now bursts its banks almost daily between March and September.<p><a id="Navigation" name="Navigation"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Navigation</span></h3>

      <p>The Thames is a motif in many books. <i><!--del_lnk--> Three Men in a Boat</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Jerome K. Jerome describes a boat trip up the Thames; published in 1889, it has never been out of print, proof of the continuing influence of the Thames on the literary imagination. Other authors took inspiration from this best-selling comic novel (with its side-nods to social commentary). Examples include poet <!--del_lnk--> Kim Taplin&#39;s 1993 travelogue <i><!--del_lnk--> Three Women in a Boat</i> and <!--del_lnk--> Connie Willis&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> To Say Nothing of the Dog</i>. Somewhere near the Oxford stretch is where the Liddells were rowing in the poem at the start of <i><a href="../../wp/a/Alice%2527s_Adventures_in_Wonderland.htm" title="Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland">Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</a></i>. The river is almost a character in its own right in <!--del_lnk--> Kenneth Grahame&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> The Wind in the Willows</i> and its derivatives. The utopian <!--del_lnk--> News from Nowhere is mainly the account of a journey through the <!--del_lnk--> Thames valley in a socialist future.<p>In books set in <a href="../../wp/l/London.htm" title="London">London</a> there is <!--del_lnk--> Sherlock Holmes looking for a boat in <i><!--del_lnk--> The Sign of Four</i>. Many of <a href="../../wp/c/Charles_Dickens.htm" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>&#39;s novels feature the Thames. <i><a href="../../wp/o/Oliver_Twist.htm" title="Oliver Twist">Oliver Twist</a></i> finishes in the slums and rookeries along its south bank. <i><!--del_lnk--> Our Mutual Friend</i> begins with a scavenger and his daughter pulling a dead man from the river, to legally salvage what the body might have in its pockets. Dickens opens the novel with this sketch of the river, and the people who work on it:<blockquote>
       <p><i>In these times of ours, though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise, a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance, with two figures in it, floated on the Thames, between <!--del_lnk--> Southwark Bridge which is of iron, and <a href="../../wp/l/London_Bridge.htm" title="London Bridge">London Bridge</a> which is of stone, as an autumn evening was closing in.</i></blockquote>
      <p>The Thames also features prominently in <!--del_lnk--> Philip Pullman&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> His Dark Materials</i> <!--del_lnk--> trilogy, as a communications artery for the waterborne Gyptian people of Oxford and the Fens.<p>In poetry, <!--del_lnk--> T.S. Eliot references the Thames at the beginning of The Fire Sermon, Section III of &quot;<a href="../../wp/t/The_Waste_Land.htm" title="The Waste Land">The Waste Land</a>&quot;.<p>In <i><!--del_lnk--> Heart of Darkness</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Joseph Conrad, the old sailor Marlow begins his yarn while sitting on a boat in the Thames. The serenity of the contemporary Thames is contrasted with the savagery of the <a href="../../wp/c/Congo_River.htm" title="Congo River">Congo River</a>, and with the wilderness of the Thames as it would have appeared to a Roman soldier posted to Brittania two thousand years before. Conrad also gives a memorable description of the approach to London from the <!--del_lnk--> Thames Estuary in his essays <!--del_lnk--> <i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> (1906).<p><a id="Sport" name="Sport"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sport</span></h3>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Rowing and <!--del_lnk--> sailing are the main sports which take place on the River Thames, though <!--del_lnk--> punting and <!--del_lnk--> skiffing also take place; unlike the &#39;pleasure punting&#39; common on the <!--del_lnk--> Cherwell in <a href="../../wp/o/Oxford.htm" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Cam in <a href="../../wp/c/Cambridge.htm" title="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> punting on the Thames is competitive and uses narrower craft. There are many clubs which encourage participation in these sports and organise racing and inter-club competitions. <!--del_lnk--> Kayaking on the River Thames is also popular, with <!--del_lnk--> sea kayakers using the tidal stretch for touring, and <!--del_lnk--> whitewater <!--del_lnk--> playboaters surfing <!--del_lnk--> Hurley Weir and <!--del_lnk--> Boulter&#39;s Weir.<p><a id="Rowing" name="Rowing"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Rowing</span></h4>

       <li>The <!--del_lnk--> Sex Pistols played a concert on the Queen Elizabeth Riverboat on June 7, 1977, the Queen&#39;s Silver Jubilee, while sailing down the river.<li>On January 20, 2006, a northern 16-18ft (5m) <!--del_lnk--> bottle-nosed whale was spotted in the Thames and was seen as far upstream as Chelsea. This is extremely unusual because this type of whale is generally found in deep sea waters. Crowds gathered along the riverbanks to witness the extraordinary spectacle. But it soon became clear there was cause for concern, as the animal came within yards of the banks, almost beaching, and crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding. Approx. 12 hours later, the whale was believed to be seen again near <!--del_lnk--> Greenwich, possibly heading back to sea <!--del_lnk--> . There was a rescue attempt lasting several hours, but it eventually died on a barge. <i>See <!--del_lnk--> River Thames whale</i>.<li>Amongst unusual objects floated along the Thames include a Eurostar Railway locomotive, a Concorde aircraft and a U boat Submarine.<li>It is not unusual to see the French navy in the Thames, very often French naval vessels make official visits to the Royal Navy dock, HMS President, just by the Tower Bridge.<li>While writing in his diary in June 1667 <!--del_lnk--> Samuel Pepys was disturbed by the sound of gunfire, as Dutch warships on the Thames broke through the Royal Navy to <!--del_lnk--> invade London.<li>Polar explorer and endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh became the first person ever to swim the length of the River Thames. His journey started on 17th July 2006 close to the source of the river in Gloucestershire and ended 147 miles later in London. Pugh undertook the challenge to raise awareness of climate change.<li>At various times there have been claims that angels have been sighted over the river.<!--del_lnk--> </ul>
