      <p>A <b>revolution</b> (from <a href="../../wp/v/Vulgar_Latin.htm" title="Vulgar Latin">Late Latin</a> <i>revolutio</i> which means &quot;a turn around&quot;) is a significant <!--del_lnk--> change that usually occurs in a relatively short period of time. Variously defined revolutions have been happening throughout <!--del_lnk--> human history. They vary in terms of numbers of their participants (<!--del_lnk--> revolutionaries), means employed by them, duration, <!--del_lnk--> ideology and many other aspects. They may result in a <!--del_lnk--> socio-<!--del_lnk--> political change in the <!--del_lnk--> socio-<!--del_lnk--> political institutions, or a major change in a <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> or <a href="../../wp/e/Economics.htm" title="Economics">economy</a>.<p>Scholarly debates about what is and what is not a revolution centre around several issues. Early study of revolutions primarily analyzed events in <!--del_lnk--> European history from <!--del_lnk--> psychological perspective, soon however new theories where offered using explanations for more global events and using works from other <!--del_lnk--> social sciences such as <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociology</a> and <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political sciences</a>. Several generations of scholarly thought have generated many competing theories on revolutions, gradually increasing our understanding of this complex phenomenon.<p>

      <p>The word derives from <a href="../../wp/v/Vulgar_Latin.htm" title="Vulgar Latin">Late Latin</a> <i>revolutio</i>- &quot;a revolving,&quot; from <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>revolvere</i> &quot;turn, roll back&quot;. It entered <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, from <!--del_lnk--> Old French <i>r&eacute;volution</i>, in 1390, originally only applied to <!--del_lnk--> celestial bodies. Only circa 1450 was it being used to mean &quot; [an] instance of great change in affairs&quot;. The new sense of the word came in connection with the publication of <!--del_lnk--> Copernicus&#39; <i>On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres</i>, which overthrew the official cosmology decreed by the Catholic Church. From that point on, the word &quot;revolution&quot; acquired its subversive political connotation. The presently dominant political meaning is first recorded 1600, again following <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a>, and was especially applied to the expulsion of the <!--del_lnk--> Stuart king <a href="../../wp/j/James_II_of_England.htm" title="James II of England">James II of England</a> in 1688 and transfer of sovereignty in Britain to <a href="../../wp/w/William_III_of_England.htm" title="William III of England">William III</a> and <a href="../../wp/m/Mary_II_of_England.htm" title="Mary II of England">Mary</a>. <i>Revolutionary</i> as a <!--del_lnk--> noun is first attested 1850, from the <!--del_lnk--> adjective.<p><a id="Political_and_socioeconomic_revolutions" name="Political_and_socioeconomic_revolutions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Political and socioeconomic revolutions</span></h2>

      <p>Perhaps most often, the word &#39;revolution&#39; is employed to denote a <!--del_lnk--> socio-<!--del_lnk--> political change in the <!--del_lnk--> socio-<!--del_lnk--> political institutions. <!--del_lnk--> Jeff Goodwin gives two definitions of a revolution. A broad one, where revolution is &quot;any and all instances in which a state or a political <!--del_lnk--> regime is overthrown and thereby transformed by a popular <!--del_lnk--> movement in an irregular, extraconstitutional and/or violent fashion&quot;; and a narrow one, in which &quot;revolutions entail not only <!--del_lnk--> mass mobilization and regime change, but also more or less rapid and fundamental social, economic and/or cultural change, during or soon after the struggle for <!--del_lnk--> state <!--del_lnk--> power.&quot; <!--del_lnk--> Jack Goldstone defines them as &quot;an effort to transform the political institutions and the justifications for political authority in society, accompanied by formal or informal mass mobilization and noninstitutionalized actions that undermine authorities.&quot;<p>Political and socioeconomic revolutions have been studied in many <!--del_lnk--> social sciences, particularly <a href="../../wp/s/Sociology.htm" title="Sociology">sociology</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Political_science.htm" title="Political science">political sciences</a> and <a href="../../wp/h/History.htm" title="History">history</a>.

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Jack Goldstone differentiates four &#39;generations&#39; of scholarly research dealing with revolutions. The scholars of the first generation such as <!--del_lnk--> Gustave Le Bon, <!--del_lnk--> Charles A. Ellwood or <!--del_lnk--> Pitirim Sorokin, were mainly descriptive in their approach, and their explanations of the phenomena of revolutions was usually related to <!--del_lnk--> social psychology, such as Le Bon&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> crowd psychology theory.<p>Second generation theorists sought to develop detailed <!--del_lnk--> theories of why and when revolutions arise, grounded in more complex <!--del_lnk--> social behaviour theories. They can be divided into three major approaches: psychological, sociological and political. The works of <!--del_lnk--> Ted R. Gurr, <!--del_lnk--> Ivo K. Feierbrand, <!--del_lnk--> Rosalind L. Feierbrand, <!--del_lnk--> James A. Geschwender, <!--del_lnk--> David C. Schwartz and <!--del_lnk--> Denton E. Morrison fall into the first category. They followed theories of <!--del_lnk--> cognitive psychology and <!--del_lnk--> frustration-aggression theory and saw the cause of revolution in the state of mind of the masses, and while they varied in their approach as to what exactly caused the people to revolt (ex. <!--del_lnk--> modernization, <!--del_lnk--> recession or <!--del_lnk--> discrimination), they agreed that the primary cause for revolution was the widespread frustration with socio-political situation. The second group, composed of academics such as <!--del_lnk--> Chalmers Johnson, <!--del_lnk--> Neil Smelser, <!--del_lnk--> Bob Jessop, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hart, <!--del_lnk--> Edward A. Tiryakian, <!--del_lnk--> Mark Hagopian, followed in the footsteps of <!--del_lnk--> Talcott Parsons and the <!--del_lnk--> structural-functionalist theory in sociology; they saw society as a system in equilibrium between various resources, demands and subsystems (political, cultural, etc.). As in the psychological school, they differed in their definitions of what causes disequilibrium, but agreed that it is a state of a severe disequilibrium that is responsible for revolutions. Finally, the third group, which included writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Charles Tilly, <!--del_lnk--> Samuel P. Huntington, <!--del_lnk--> Peter Ammann and <!--del_lnk--> Arthur L. Stinchcombe followed the path of <!--del_lnk--> political sciences and looked at <!--del_lnk--> pluralist theory and <!--del_lnk--> interest group conflict theory. Those theories see events as outcomes of a <!--del_lnk--> power struggle between competing <!--del_lnk--> interest groups. In such a model, revolution happen when two or more groups cannot come to terms within a normal <!--del_lnk--> decision making process traditional for a given <!--del_lnk--> political system, and simultaneously possess enough resources to employ <a href="../../wp/f/Force.htm" title="Force">force</a> in pursuing their goals. The second generation theorists saw the development of the revolutions as a two-step process; first, some <!--del_lnk--> change results in the present situation being different from the past; second, the new situation creates an opportunity for a revolution to occur. In that situation, an event that in the past would not be sufficient to cause a revolution (ex. a <a href="../../wp/w/War.htm" title="War">war</a>, a <!--del_lnk--> riot, a bad <a href="../../wp/h/Harvest.htm" title="Harvest">harvest</a>), now is sufficient &mdash; however if authorities are aware of the danger, they can still prevent a revolution (through <!--del_lnk--> reform or <!--del_lnk--> repression).<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Many of such early studies of revolutions usually concentrated on the four classic &quot;Great Revolutions&quot;, seen as famous and uncontroversial examples fitting virtually all definitions of revolutions: the <a href="../../wp/g/Glorious_Revolution.htm" title="Glorious Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> (1688), the <a href="../../wp/f/French_Revolution.htm" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> (1789&ndash;1799), the <a href="../../wp/r/Russian_Revolution_of_1917.htm" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Chinese Revolution (1927-1949). In time, scholars began to analyze hundreds of other events as revolutions (see <!--del_lnk--> list of revolutions and rebellions), and differences in definitions and approaches gave rise to new definitions and explanations. The theories of the second generation have been criticized for their limited geographical scope, difficulty in <!--del_lnk--> empirical verification, as well as that while they may explain some particular revolutions, they did not explain why revolutions did not occur in other societies in very similar situations.<p>The criticism of the second generation led to the raise of a third generation of theories, with writers such as <!--del_lnk--> Theda Skocpol, <!--del_lnk--> Barrington Moore, <!--del_lnk--> Jeffrey Paige and others expanded on the old <!--del_lnk--> Marxist <!--del_lnk--> class conflict approach, turning attention to rural agrarian-state conflicts, state conflicts with autonomous <!--del_lnk--> elites and the impact of interstate <!--del_lnk--> economic and <!--del_lnk--> military competition on domestic <!--del_lnk--> political change. Particularly Skocpol&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> States and Social Revolutions</i> became one of the most widely recognized works of the third generation; Skocpol defined revolution as &quot;rapid, basic transformations of society&#39;s state and class structures...accompanied and in part carried through by class-based revolts from below&quot;, attributing revolutions to a conjunction of multiple conflicts involving state, elites and the lower classes.<div class="thumb tright">
       <div style="width:302px;"><a class="internal" href="../../images/112/11220.jpg.htm" title="...but the fall of the Berlin Wall and most of the events of the Autumn of Nations in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful."><img alt="...but the fall of the Berlin Wall and most of the events of the Autumn of Nations in Europe, 1989, were sudden and peaceful." height="195" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Berlin-wall-dancing.jpg" src="../../images/112/11220.jpg" width="300" /></a><div class="thumbcaption">

       </div>
      </div>
      <p>From the late 1980s a new body of scholarly work begun questioning the dominance of the third generation&#39;s theories. The old theories were also dealt a significant blow by new revolutionary events that could not be easily explain by them. The <!--del_lnk--> Iranian and <!--del_lnk--> Nicaraguan Revolutions of 1979, the <!--del_lnk--> 1986 EDSA Revolution in the <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the 1989 <!--del_lnk--> Autumn of Nations in Europe saw multi-class coalitions topple seemingly powerful regimes amidst popular demonstrations and <!--del_lnk--> mass strikes in <!--del_lnk--> nonviolent revolutions. Defining revolutions as mostly European violent state versus people and <!--del_lnk--> class struggles conflicts was no longer sufficient. The study of revolutions thus evolved in three directions. Firstly, some researchers were applying previous or updated <!--del_lnk--> structuralist theories of revolutions to events beyond the previously analyzed, mostly European conflicts. Secondly, scholars called for greater attention to conscious <!--del_lnk--> agency in the form of <!--del_lnk--> ideology and <a href="../../wp/c/Culture.htm" title="Culture">culture</a> in shaping revolutionary <!--del_lnk--> mobilization and objectives. Third, analysts of both revolutions and <!--del_lnk--> social movements realized that those phenomena have much in common, and a new &#39;fourth generation&#39; literature on <!--del_lnk--> contentious politics has developed that attempts to combine insights from the study of social movements and revolutions in hopes of understanding both phenomena.<p>While revolutions encompass events ranging from <!--del_lnk--> the relatively peaceful revolutions that overthrew communist regimes to the <!--del_lnk--> violent Islamic revolution in Afghanistan, they exclude <!--del_lnk--> coups d&#39;&eacute;tats, <!--del_lnk--> civil wars, <!--del_lnk--> revolts and rebellions that make no effort to transform institutions or the justification for authority (such as <a href="../../wp/j/J%25C3%25B3zef_Pi%25C5%2582sudski.htm" title="J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski">J&oacute;zef Pi&#x142;sudski</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> May Coup of 1926 or the <a href="../../wp/a/American_Civil_War.htm" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>), as well as peaceful transitions to <a href="../../wp/d/Democracy.htm" title="Democracy">democracy</a> through institutional arrangements such as <!--del_lnk--> plebiscites and <!--del_lnk--> free elections, as in <a href="../../wp/s/Spain.htm" title="Spain">Spain</a> after the death of <!--del_lnk--> Francisco Franco.<p><a id="Types_of_political_and_socioeconomic_revolutions" name="Types_of_political_and_socioeconomic_revolutions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Types of political and socioeconomic revolutions</span></h3>

      <p>The term revolution has been used to denote great changes outside the political sphere. They are usually recognized as having transformed in society, culture, philosophy and technology much more than <!--del_lnk--> political systems. Such revolutions include, in alphabetical order:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Agricultural Revolutions, which include: <ul>
         <li><!--del_lnk--> Neolithic Revolution (perhaps 10000 years ago), which formed the basis for human civilization to develop.

It is commonly referred to as the &#39;Second Agricultural Revolution&#39;.<li><!--del_lnk--> Biogenetic Revolution (1990s-), the use of <!--del_lnk--> genetically modified plants and animals. It is sometimes referred to as the &#39;Third Agricultural Revolution&#39;.<li><!--del_lnk--> British Agricultural Revolution (18th century), which spurred urbanisation and consequently helped launch the <a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.<li><!--del_lnk--> Scottish Agricultural Revolution (18th century), which led to the <!--del_lnk--> Lowland Clearances.</ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Cultural Revolution - a struggle for power within the <!--del_lnk--> Communist Party of China, which grew to include large sections of Chinese society and eventually brought the People&#39;s Republic of China to the brink of civil war, and which lasted from 1966 to 1976<li><!--del_lnk--> Digital Revolution - the sweeping changes brought about by <!--del_lnk--> computing and <!--del_lnk--> communication technology during the later half of the 20th Century<li><a href="../../wp/i/Industrial_Revolution.htm" title="Industrial Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> - the major shift of technological, socioeconomic and cultural conditions in the late 18th and early 19th century that began in Britain and spread throughout the world <ul>
