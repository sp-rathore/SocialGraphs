In its current form, the Valmiki Ramayana is dated variously from 500 BC to 100 BC, or about co-eval to early versions of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mahabh&#x101;rata</i>. As with most traditional epics, since it has gone through a long process of interpolations and redactions, it is impossible to date it accurately. The R&#x101;m&#x101;yana had an important influence on later Sanskrit poetry, primarily through its establishment of the <!--del_lnk--> Sloka meter. But, like its epic cousin <!--del_lnk--> Mah&#x101;bh&#x101;rata, the R&#x101;m&#x101;yana is not just an ordinary story. It contains the teachings of ancient Hindu sages and presents them through allegory in narrative and the interspersion of the philosophical and the devotional. The characters of Rama, Sita, <!--del_lnk--> Lakshmana, <!--del_lnk--> Bharata, <!--del_lnk--> Hanum&#x101;n and R&#x101;vana (the villain of the piece) are all fundamental to the cultural consciousness of India.<p>One of the most important literary works on ancient India, the Ramayana has had a profound impact on art and culture in the <!--del_lnk--> Indian Subcontinent and <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia. The story of Rama also inspired a large amount of later-day literature in various languages, notable among which are the works of the sixteenth century <a href="../../wp/h/Hindi.htm" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> poet <!--del_lnk--> Tulsidas and the <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> poet <!--del_lnk--> Kambar of the 13th century.<p>The Ramayana is not just a Hindu religious tale. Starting from the 8th century, the colonisation of Southeast Asia by Indians began. Several large empires like the <!--del_lnk--> Khmers, the <!--del_lnk--> Majapahits, the <!--del_lnk--> Sailendras, the <!--del_lnk--> Champas and <!--del_lnk--> Sri Vijaya were established. Because of this, the Ramayana became popular in Southeast Asia and manifested itself in text, temple architecture and performance, particularly in <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> (<!--del_lnk--> Java, <a href="../../wp/s/Sumatra.htm" title="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, <!--del_lnk--> Bali and <!--del_lnk--> Borneo), <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, <a href="../../wp/p/Philippines.htm" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.<p>

      <p><!--del_lnk--> Valmiki&#39;s <i>Ramayana</i>, the oldest and most widely read version of Ramayana is the basis of all the various version of Ramayana that are prevalent in the various cultures. The text survives in numerous complete and partial manuscripts, the oldest surviving of which is dated from the eleventh century AD. The current text of Valmiki Ramayana has come down to us in two regional versions from the north and the south of India. Valmiki Ramayana has been traditionally divided into seven books, dealing with the life of Rama from his birth to his death.<ol>
       <li><i><b>Bala Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of the young Rama which details the miraculous birth of Rama, his early life in <!--del_lnk--> Ayodhya, his slaying of the demons of the forest at the request of <!--del_lnk--> Vishvamitra and his wedding with <!--del_lnk--> Sita.<li><i><b>Ayodhya Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of Ayodhya in which <!--del_lnk--> Dasharatha comes to grief over his promise to <!--del_lnk--> Kaikeyi and the start of Rama&#39;s exile.<li><i><b>Aranya Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of the Forest which describes Rama&#39;s life in the forest and the abduction of Sita by Ravana.<li><i><b>Kishkindya Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of Kishkinda, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Vanara</i> kingdom in which Rama befriends <!--del_lnk--> Sugriva and the Vanara army and begins the search for Sita.<li><i><b>Sundara Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of Sundara (<!--del_lnk--> Hanuman) in which Hanuman travels to Lanka and finds Sita imprisoned there and brings back the good news to Rama.<li><i><b>Yuddha Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Book of the War, which narrates the Rama-Ravana war and the return of the successful Rama to Ayodhya and his coronation.<li><i><b>Uttara Kanda</b></i> &ndash; Epilogue, which details the life of Rama and Sita after their return to Ayodhya, Sita&#39;s banishment and how Sita and Rama pass on to the next world.</ol>
      <p>There have been speculations on whether the first and the last chapters of Valmiki&#39;s <i>Ramayana</i> were indeed written by the original author. Many experts are of the opinion that they are integral part of the book in spite of the many differences in style and some contradictions in content between these two chapters and the rest of the book. These two chapters contain most of the mythological interpolations found in the Ramayana, such as the miraculous birth of Rama and his divine nature as well as the numerous legends surrounding <!--del_lnk--> Ravana.<p><a id="Main_characters" name="Main_characters"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Main characters</span></h2>

      <p>Rama, the hero of <i>Ramayana</i>, is a popular deity worshiped by Hindus, the route of his wanderings being, each year, trodden by devout pilgrims. The poem is not a mere literary monument, it is a part of <a href="../../wp/h/Hinduism.htm" title="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, and is held in such reverence that the mere reading or hearing of it, or certain passages of it, is believed by the Hindus to free them from sin and grant every desire to the reader or hearer. According to <!--del_lnk--> Hindu tradition, Rama is an incarnation (<i><!--del_lnk--> Avatar</i>), of the god <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu, who is part of the <!--del_lnk--> Hindu Trinity. The main purpose of this incarnation is to demonstrate the righteous path (<i><!--del_lnk--> dharma</i>) for the life on earth.<p><a id="Rama.27s_youth" name="Rama.27s_youth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rama&#39;s youth</span></h3>

      <p>Brahma, creator of the universe, could not revoke a boon he gave the demon king Ravana, as a reward for his severe penances, that he should not be slain by gods, demons, or spirits. Having been then rewarded, Ravana began with the help of his evil supporters, the <i>Rakshasas</i>, to lay waste the earth and to do violence to the good, especially the <!--del_lnk--> Brahmin priests, disturbing their sacrifices. All the gods, watching this devastation, went to Brahma to find a way to deliver themselves and the earth of this evil. Brahma went to Vishnu and conveyed the anguish of the gods and requested that Vishnu incarnate on earth as a human to destroy Ravana, as Ravana had not asked for protection against humans or beasts in his wishes to Brahma.<p>Meanwhile, the good king <!--del_lnk--> Dasharatha of <!--del_lnk--> Ayodhya, who had ruled over his kingdom of <!--del_lnk--> Kosala for a long time, was beginning to become anxious about his successor, for he had no sons to take over the kingdom after him. Taking advice from his ministers and priests Dasharatha organised a <i>Putrakameshti Yagna</i>, a sacrifice for progeny. Vishnu decided to be born as the eldest to Dasharatha and caused a divine being to emerge from the sacrificial fire. The divine being gave Dashratha a golden vessel filled with nectar and asked him to give it to his queens. Dasharatha divided it amongst his three queens, <!--del_lnk--> Kausalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi. In due course they became pregnant and gave birth to four sons: Queen Kausalya gives birth to the eldest son, <a href="../../wp/r/Rama.htm" title="Rama">Rama</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Bharata is born to Queen Kaikeyi, and twins, <!--del_lnk--> Lakshmana and <!--del_lnk--> Shatrughna, are born to Queen Sumitra.<p>The boys grew up learning the scriptures and the art of bowmanship from the sage <!--del_lnk--> Vasishta. One day, the sage <!--del_lnk--> Vishwamitra visited the kingdom and asked King Dasaratha to send Rama to protect him from demons who had been disturbing his sacrifices. Although very reluctant, Dasharatha agreed to send Rama and Lakshmana with Vishwamitra. As the brothers fulfilled their duties, Vishwamitra was pleased with them and bestowed upon them various celestial weapons.<p>Towards the end of their stay with Vishwamitra, Rama chanced to pass near the kingdom of Mithila and heard that its king, <!--del_lnk--> Janaka, had offered his peerless daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Sita, in marriage to the man who could bend the mighty bow of god <!--del_lnk--> Siva, which had been kept at Janaka&#39;s court. Rama at once determined to accomplish the feat, which had been tried in vain by so many suitors. When he presented himself at court Janaka was at once won by his youth and beauty. Five thousand men drew in the mighty bow, resting upon an eight-wheeled chariot. Rama, without any apparent effort, bent it until it broke and Janaka gladly gave him his beautiful daughter. After the splendid wedding ceremonies were over, the happy pair travelled back to Ayodhya.<p><a id="Rama.27s_exile" name="Rama.27s_exile"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Rama&#39;s exile</span></h3>
      <p>King Dasaratha, began to feel weary of reigning, and decided to make Rama, his eldest son and heir-apparent, the co-regent (<i>Yuvaraja</i>). His happy people received the announcement of his intention with delight and the whole city was in the midst of the most splendid preparations for the ceremony. Dasaratha went to discuss the celebrations with his favourite wife Kaikeyi. However, Kaikeyi&#39;s jealousy was aroused by her evil maid <!--del_lnk--> Manthara, because the son of Kausalya and not her own son Bharata, at that time absent from the city, was to be made king. She fled to an ante-chamber where Dasaratha found her in tears..<p>To Dasharatha&#39;s concerned queries, Kaikeyi recalled that, ages ago, the old king had granted her two boons. She now demanded the fulfilment of these before she would consent to smile upon him. Dasharatha agreed and Kaikeyi revealed her demands. She required him, first, to appoint her son Bharata as co-regent and, second, to exile Rama for fourteen years to the terrible forest of Dandaka. Dasharatha was heart-broken, but had to abide by his promise. Rama, the obedient son, immediately agreed to relinquish his claim to the throne and started to leave for his exile. His faithful wife Sita and his loving brother Lakshmana also decided to go along with Rama. With Dasharatha lying grief-stricken, Rama left for the forest, followed by the lamenting people of Ayodhya. Soon after, king Dasharatha died, overcome by grief.<p><a id="Sita.27s_abduction" name="Sita.27s_abduction"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sita&#39;s abduction</span></h3>

      <p>Rama, Sita and Lakshmana left behind Ayodhya and its people, crossed the river <!--del_lnk--> Ganges and went into the forest. They found an idyllic place called Chitrakuta to establish their hermitage. No more beautiful place could be imagined. Flowers of every kind, delicious fruits, and on every side the most pleasing prospects, together with perfect love, is stated to have made their hermitage a paradise on earth. In the forest, Rama befriended the old vulture-king, <!--del_lnk--> Jatayu.<p>Meanwhile, Bharata returned to Ayodhya and, being also devoted to Rama, became furious with Kaikeyi for her role in exiling Rama and for the death of his father. Determined to bring back Rama, he headed for the forest. When he found Rama and pleaded with him to return and assume the throne, Rama politely refused, saying that he was duty-bound to see that his father&#39;s promise was fulfilled. Reluctantly Bharata agreed to return to the kingdom, requesting that Rama give to him his sandals. Back in Ayodhya, Baratha placed Rama&#39;s sandals on the throne of Ayodhya, and ruled as Rama&#39;s proxy from a village called Nandigrama near Ayodhya, awaiting his return. He also vowed to end his own life if Rama failed to return after fourteen years.<p>One day, the <!--del_lnk--> rakshasi <!--del_lnk--> Surpanakha, a sister of the demon king Ravana, chanced upon Rama&#39;s hermitage and saw the handsome Rama and became enamored. Taking the form of a beautiful young girl, she tried to seduce Rama. Rama, ever faithful to his wife Sita, did not respond and asked her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana too refused, stating his duty towards his brother and his sister-in-law while in exile. An infuriated Surpanakha blamed Sita for the men scorning her charged at her in her original demonic form. However, Lakshmana saved Sita by severing Surpanakha&#39;s nose and ears. Surpanakha flew back to Ravana complaining about the young exiles. Ravana, after hearing of the beautiful Sita from Surpanakha, resolved to kill Rama in revenge and take Sita for himself. He enlisted the aid of the demon <!--del_lnk--> Maricha. Maricha turned himself into a golden deer that Sita wanted for herself. She asked Rama to get it for her, but after Rama left to find it, Maricha began screaming to trick Lakshmana. Lakshmana, convinced Rama was in danger, resolved to go out and find his brother. Before leaving Sita alone in the hut, Lakshmana drew a circle in the dirt saying that Sita would be safe as long as she stayed in the circle. Ravana approached the hermitage in the guise of an old man and asked Sita to give him some food. Initially hesitant to step out of Lakshmana&#39;s circle, Sita finally stepped out to give the old man some food. At this moment Ravana grabbed Sita and fled in his airborne vehicle, (<i><!--del_lnk--> Pushpaka Vimana</i>). <!--del_lnk--> Jatayu, seeing them fly, attempted to save Sita, but Ravana engaged Jatayu in combat and chopped off the vulture&#39;s wings. On returning to the hermitage, Rama and Lakshmana found it empty and anxiously began a search. Through Jatayu, whom they found lying mortally wounded, Rama and Lakshmana learnt of Sita&#39;s fate.<p><a id="Vanara_kingdom" name="Vanara_kingdom"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Vanara kingdom</span></h3>
      <p>Continuing their search, they encountered the vanara king of Kishkindha, <!--del_lnk--> Sugriva, and <!--del_lnk--> Hanuman, one of his generals, among whom Sita had dropped from the chariot her scarf and some ornaments. Sugriva had been deposed from his kingdom by his brother, <!--del_lnk--> Vali, who had also taken his wife Roma from him. Rama agreed to defeat Vali if Sugriva would assist in the search for Sita. The agreement made, Sugriva challenged Vali to a duel. While the duel was progressing, Rama shot from his bow and killed Vali. Sugriva regained his kingdom and his wife.<p>Sugriva and Rama sent the vanara soldiers in various directions in search of Sita. However, their efforts didn&#39;t bear fruit until they met another ancient vulture, <!--del_lnk--> Sampati, who was the brother of the slain Jatayu. Sampati was earthbound and deformed - his wings were burnt when he flew too close to the Sun (a story that can be considered to be similar to that of <!--del_lnk--> Icarus&#39;s). His brother, being hardier, had saved him from falling to his death. While Jatayu was the physically stronger of the two, Sampati possessed a compensating gift of vision. Sampati&#39;s vision was incredibly powerful, spanning several hundred <i><!--del_lnk--> yojanas</i> and enabling him to see farther than anyone else. On hearing of Ravana&#39;s killing his brother, he readily agreed to help the vanaras. He was soon able to spot Sita in the southern direction. He could see her imprisoned in a garden of Ashoka trees on the island of Lanka, beyond the southern ocean.<p><a id="Hanuman_in_Lanka" name="Hanuman_in_Lanka"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Hanuman in Lanka</span></h3>
      <p>Sugriva dispatched his army to the south with his nephew Angada at the head. Hanuman went with Angada as his general. When they reached deep south, they found a great ocean stretching between them and land of Lanka. They could find no means by which to cross the ocean. Commanding his soldiers to remain where they were, Hanuman expanded his body to enormous proportions, leaped the vast expanse of water, and alighted upon a mountain <i>Trikuta</i> from which he could look down upon Lanka. Perceiving the city to be closely guarded, he assumed the form of a cat, and thus, unsuspected, crept through the barriers and examined the city. He found Ravana in his apartments, surrounded by beautiful women, but Sita was not among them. Continuing his search, he at last discovered her, her beauty dimmed by grief, seated under a tree in a beautiful asoka grove, guarded by hideous rakshasas with the faces of buffaloes, dogs, and swine.<p>Assuming the form of a tiny monkey, Hanuman crept down the tree, and giving her the ring of Rama, took one from her. He offered to carry her away with him, but Sita declared that Rama must himself come to her rescue, and as proof of finding her Sita gave Hanuman a priceless jewel to take back to Rama. While they were talking together, Ravana appeared, and, after fruitless wooing, announced that if Sita did not yield herself to him in two months he would have her guards &quot;mince her limbs with steel&quot; for his morning repast.<p>In his rage, Hanuman destroyed a mango grove and was captured by the rakshasa guards, and brought before Ravana. Hanuman proclaimed that he was a messenger of Rama, and demanded that Ravana restore Sita to Rama or fall victim to Rama&#39;s wrath. Furious at hearing Hanuman&#39;s words, Ravana ordered Hanuman&#39;s death.<p><!--del_lnk--> Vibhishana, Ravana&#39;s righteous brother, intervened and counseled Ravana to follow the scriptures, reminding that it was improper to execute a messenger, and instead told him to exact the appropriate punishment for Hanuman&#39;s crime. Ravana accepted and ordered his rakshasas to set fire to Hanuman&#39;s tail. As soon as this was done, Hanuman made himself very small, slipped from his bonds, and, jumping upon the roofs, spread a conflagration through the city of Lanka. He leaped back to the mainland, conveyed the news of Sita&#39;s captivity to Rama and Sugriva, and was soon engaged in active preparations for the campaign.<p><a id="Battle_of_Lanka" name="Battle_of_Lanka"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Battle of Lanka</span></h3>

      <p>Rama decided that as long as the ocean was not bridged, it was impossible for any one but Hanuman to cross it. Rama meditated for three days without food or water, but in vain. In his anger at being so ignored, Rama turned his weapons against the ocean, until from the terrified waves arose <!--del_lnk--> Varuna, the god of the ocean, who promised him that if Nila and Nala from his army built a bridge, the waves should support the materials as firmly as though it were built on land.<p>Terror reigned in Lanka at the news of the approach of Rama. Vibishana, Ravana&#39;s brother, deserted to Rama, because of the demon&#39;s rage when he advised him to make peace with Rama. Fiercely fought battles ensued, in which even the gods took part--Vishnu and Indra taking sides with Rama, and the evil spirits fighting with Ravana.<p>After the war had been fought for some time, with varying results, and a great number of troops on both sides were killed, it was decided to determine the victor by single combat between Ravana and Rama. Even the gods were terrified at the fierceness of the conflict. At each shot Rama&#39;s mighty bow cut off a head of Ravana, which at once grew back, and the hero was in despair until Vibhishana told him to aim at Ravana&#39;s belly-button. Rama took careful aim.<p>As Ravana fell by this weapon, flowers rained from heaven upon the happy victor, and his ears were ravished with celestial music. Touched by the grief of Ravana&#39;s widow, <!--del_lnk--> Mandodari, Rama ordered a splendid funeral for his foe, and then sought the conquered city.<p>Sita was led forth, beaming with happiness at finding herself re-united to her husband; but her happiness was destined to be of short duration. Rama received her with coldness and with downcast eyes, saying that she could no longer be his wife, after having dwelt in the house of Ravana. Sita assured him of her innocence; but on his continuing to revile her, she ordered her funeral pyre to be built, since she would rather die by fire than live despised by Rama. The sympathy of all the bystanders was with Sita, but Rama saw her enter the flames without a tremor. Soon <!--del_lnk--> Agni, the god of fire, appeared, bearing the uninjured Sita in his arms. Her innocence thus publicly proved by the trial by fire, she was welcomed by Rama, whose treatment she tenderly forgave.<p>The conquest won, Ravana defeated, and Sita restored, Rama returned in triumph to Ayodhya, and assumed the governance to the great delight of Bharata and the people of Ayondhya.<p><a id="Sita_banished" name="Sita_banished"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Sita banished</span></h3>
      <p>Ayodhya was prosperous, the people were happy, and for a time all went well. It was not long, however, before whispers concerning Sita&#39;s long stay in <!--del_lnk--> Lanka spread through the city, and Rama came to hear the whisperings that a famine in the country was due to the guilt of Sita, who had suffered the caresses of Ravana while in captivity. Under the pressure from the citizens of Ayodhya, Rama banished her to the forest in which they had spent together the happy years of their exile.<p>Without a murmur the unhappy Sita dragged herself to the forest, and, torn with grief of body and spirit, found the hermitage of <!--del_lnk--> Valmiki, where she gave birth to twin sons, <!--del_lnk--> Lava and <!--del_lnk--> Kush. Here she reared them, with the assistance of the hermit, who was their teacher, and under whose care they grew to manhood, handsome and strong.<p>It chanced that about the time the youths were twenty years old, Rama began to think the gods were angered with him because he had killed Ravana, who was the son of a Brahman. Rama became determined to propitiate them by means of Ashvamedha, the great sacrifice, in which he caused a horse to be turned loose in the forest. When his men went to retake it, at the end of the year, they found it caught by two strong and beautiful youths who resisted all efforts to capture them. When his men couldn&#39;t retake the horse, Rama went to the forest in person, only to learn that the youths were his twin sons, Lava and Kush. Struck with remorse, Rama recalled the sufferings of his wife Sita, and on learning that she was at the hermitage of Valmiki, requested her to come with him.<p>Sita had had time to recover from the love of her youth, and the prospect of life with Rama, she felt, was not altogether pleasant. She appealed to the earth, if she had never loved any man but Rama, if her truth and purity were known to the earth, let it open its bosom and take her to it. While the people stood trembling with horror, the earth opened, a gorgeous throne appeared, and the goddess of earth, seated upon it, took Sita beside her and conveyed her to the realms of eternal happiness, leaving the too late repentant people to wear out the remaining years in penitence.<p><a id="Morals_in_Ramayana" name="Morals_in_Ramayana"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Morals in Ramayana</span></h2>
      <p>In his <i>Ramayana,</i> Valmiki expresses his view of human code of conduct through Rama: life is <!--del_lnk--> evanescent and the <!--del_lnk--> hedonistic approach to it is meaningless. However, that should not allow one to be indifferent to one&#39;s own rights and duties laid down in the ancient texts. He thus adopts the view that <i><!--del_lnk--> Dharma</i> is what is proclaimed in the <!--del_lnk--> Veda and it should be followed for its own sake, not for what it brings you in pain or pleasure. Doing this will ensure one&#39;s welfare in this and the next world. In addition, Ramayana also reinforces the need for thinking about the consequences before making promises, for if you make them you must keep them, no matter how hard it may be.<p><i>Sankshepa Ramayana</i>, the brief narration of the entire Ramayana story by the sage <!--del_lnk--> Narada to Valmiki, forms the first <i>sarga</i> of Valmiki Ramayana. Narada lists the sixteen qualities of the ideal man and says that Rama was the complete man possessing all sixteen of these qualities. Although Rama himself declares &quot;he is but a man, and never once claims to be divine, Rama is regarded by Hindus as one of the most important <i><!--del_lnk--> Avatar</i> of the god <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu and as an ideal man.<p>Valmiki portrays Rama not as a supernatural being, but as a human with all the attendant shortcomings, who encounters moral dilemmas but who overcomes these by simply adhering to the <i>dharma</i>--the righteous way. There are several instances narrated in Valmiki Ramayana which cast shadows on the pristine character of the hero and reinforce the theme of Ram struggling with mortal flaws and prejudices whilst struggling to follow the path of dharma. When Rama killed Vali ( See <!--del_lnk--> Vali_vadha for a detailed description of the event) to aid Sugriva regain his throne, it was not in fair combat, but while hiding behind a tree. When Sita was freed from Ravana&#39;s prison, Rama forced Sita to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove her purity and later as the king, Rama killed the <!--del_lnk--> Shudra <!--del_lnk--> Shambuka for performing a yogic penance not in keeping with his perceived low station in the society, though this latter incident is contested and may have crept in because of reinterpretation later on.<p><a id="Concept_of_Dharma-Artha-Kama_as_per_Ramayana" name="Concept_of_Dharma-Artha-Kama_as_per_Ramayana"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Concept of <!--del_lnk--> Dharma-<!--del_lnk--> Artha-<!--del_lnk--> Kama as per Ramayana</span></h2>
      <p>The concepts of <!--del_lnk--> Dharma, <!--del_lnk--> Artha, <!--del_lnk--> Kama (and <!--del_lnk--> Moksha) are very old Hindu concepts. They are also known as <!--del_lnk--> Purusharthas. There are two prominent instances of it being defined in <strong class="selflink">Ramayana</strong>. The first was when <!--del_lnk--> Bharat came to forest (<!--del_lnk--> Chitrakoot) to meet Rama. Rama asked him whether he followed the rules of Dharma, Artha and Kaama properly. As per Rama it is defined as: Artha should not interfere with Dharma and vice versa. Similarly Kaama should not interfere with either Dharma or with Artha. Since Bharat was already knowledgeable he was to be reminded in very short words. But Dharma here means the duties and welfare one does for the society. Making wells, for example, is part of the dharma of a king. Arth means earnings. As it is further asked by Rama: The king has to see that there is enough income from taxes, the salaries of the employees are given at proper time and the tax should not be more than 1/6 th (16.6 %) of a person&#39;s income. Kaama means pleasure here. One is allowed to have pleasure but without affecting the duties and earnings. The other instance of this concept comes in Yudha Kanda. Here <!--del_lnk--> Kumbhakarna, <!--del_lnk--> Ravana&#39;s brother, advises Ravana that one should use dharma in the morning, artha in the daytime and Kaama at night. He further says to Ravana that he (Ravana) is busy with Kaama all the time and this will take him to destruction. Interestingly one of Ravana&#39;s ministers <!--del_lnk--> Mahodara scolds Kubhakarna and to please his master says that a King can enjoy Kaama at any time.<p><a id="Textual_history" name="Textual_history"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Textual history</span></h2>
      <p>Traditionally the epic belongs to the <!--del_lnk--> Treta Yuga, one of the four eons of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu chronology and is attributed to <!--del_lnk--> Valmiki, is an active participant in the story.<p>It is composed in <!--del_lnk--> Epic Sanskrit, an early variant of <!--del_lnk--> Classical Sanskrit, so that in principle the core of the work may date to as early as the <!--del_lnk--> 5th century BCE. Since in its current form, after hundreds of years of transmission through recitations and in manuscript form, the epic has gone thorough numerous variations, it cannot be dated by linguistic analysis as a whole, and should be considered to have emerged over a long process, spanning from the 5th to 1st centuries BC.<p>The core events told in the epic may well be of even greater age, the names of the characters, Rama, Sita, Dasharata, Janaka, Vasishta and Vishwamitra are all known in the Vedic literature such as the <i><!--del_lnk--> Brahmanas</i> which are older than the Valmiki Ramayana. However, nowhere in the surviving Vedic poetry is a story similar to the Ramayana of Valmiki. <!--del_lnk--> Brahma, one of the main characters of <i>Ramayana</i>, and <!--del_lnk--> Vishnu, who according to <i>Bala Kanda</i> was incarnated as Rama are not Vedic deities, and come first into prominence with the epics themselves (and further during the &#39;Puranic&#39; period of the later 1st millennium AD).<p>There is general consensus that books two to six form the oldest portion of the epic while the first book <i>Bala Kanda</i> and the last the <i>Uttara Kanda</i> are later additions. The author or authors of <i>Bala Kanda</i> and <i>Ayodhya Kanda</i> appear to be familiar with the eastern <!--del_lnk--> Gangetic basin region of northern India and the <!--del_lnk--> Kosala and <!--del_lnk--> Magadha region during the period of the sixteen <i><!--del_lnk--> janapadas</i> as the geographical and geopolitical data is in keeping with what is known about the region. However, when the story moves to the <i>Aranya Kanda</i> and beyond, it seems to turn abruptly into fantasy with its demon-slaying hero and fantastic creatures. The geography of central and south India is increasingly vaguely described. The knowledge of the location of the island of <a href="../../wp/s/Sri_Lanka.htm" title="Sri Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> also lacks detail. Basing his assumption on these features, the historian H.D. Sankalia has proposed a date of the 4th century BC for the composition of the text. A. L. Basham, however, is of the opinion that Rama may have been a minor chief who lived in the 8th or the 7th century BC.<p>The events of the epic have also been dated to as early as 6000 BC by adherents of <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeoastronomy.htm" title="Archaeoastronomy">archaeoastronomy</a>.<p><a id="Variant_versions" name="Variant_versions"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Variant versions</span></h2>

      <p>As in many oral epics, multiple versions of the Ramayana survive. In particular, the Ramayana related in north India differs in important respects from that preserved in South India and the rest of South-East Asia. There is an extensive tradition of oral storytelling based on the Ramayana in <a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>, <a href="../../wp/c/Cambodia.htm" title="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="../../wp/m/Malaysia.htm" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="../../wp/l/Laos.htm" title="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam.htm" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, and <a href="../../wp/i/Indonesia.htm" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>.<p>In many <!--del_lnk--> Malay versions, Lakshmana is given greater importance than Rama, whose character is considered somewhat weak.<p><a id="Within_India" name="Within_India"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Within India</span></h3>
      <p>There are diverse regional versions of the Ramayana written by various authors in India. Some of them differ significantly from each other. During the twelfth century AD, <!--del_lnk--> Kamban wrote <i>Ramavatharam</i>, known popularly as <!--del_lnk--> Kambaramayanam in <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>. Although based on Valmiki Ramayana , <!--del_lnk--> Kambaramayanam is a true classic and unique in that Kamban has modified and reinterpreted many anecdotes in Valmiki Ramayana to suit the <!--del_lnk--> Tamil culture and his own ideas. Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana inspired the <i><!--del_lnk--> Sri Ramacharit Manas</i> by <!--del_lnk--> Tulasidas in 1576 , an epic <!--del_lnk--> Awadhi (a dialect of Hindi) version with a slant more grounded in a different realm of <!--del_lnk--> Hindu literature, that of <!--del_lnk--> bhakti. It is an acknowledged masterpiece of India. It is popularly known as <i>Tulsi-krita Ramayana</i>. <!--del_lnk--> Gujarati poet Premanand wrote a version of <i>Ramayana</i> in the 17th century. Other versions include, a <!--del_lnk--> Bengali version by Krittivas in the 14th century, in <!--del_lnk--> Oriya by Balarama Das in the 16th century, in <!--del_lnk--> Marathi by Sridhara in the 18th century, a Telugu version by Ranganatha in the 15th century, a Kannada Ramayana by the 16th century poet Narahari, Kotha Ramayana in <!--del_lnk--> Assamese by the 14th century poet <!--del_lnk--> Madhava Kandali and <!--del_lnk--> Adhyathma Ramayanam Kilippattu, a <!--del_lnk--> Malayalam version by <!--del_lnk--> Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan in the 16th century.<p>There is a sub-plot to Ramayana, prevalent in some parts of India relates to the adventures of Ahi Ravana and Mahi Ravana, the evil brother of Ravana, which enhances the role of Hanuman in the story. Hanuman rescues Rama and Lakshmana after they are kidnapped by the Ahi-mahi Ravana at the behest of Ravana and held prisoner in a subterranean cave, ready to be sacrificed to the goddess <!--del_lnk--> Kali.<p>There have been reports of a version of the Ramayana story prevalent amongst the Mappilas of Kerala. This version, known as <i>Mappila Ramayana</i>, forms a part of the <i><!--del_lnk--> Mappillapattu</i>. <i>Mappillapattu</i> is a genre of folk singing popular amonst the musims of <a href="../../wp/k/Kerala.htm" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Lakshadweep. Being of Muslim origin, the hero of this story is a sultan. There are no major changes in the names of characters except for that of Rama&#39;s which is changed to `Laman&#39;. The language and the imagery projected in the Mappilapattu are in accordance with the social fabric of the earlier Muslim community.<p><a id="Southeast_Asian_versions" name="Southeast_Asian_versions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Southeast Asian versions</span></h3>
      <p>Many other Asian cultures have adapted the Ramayana, resulting in other <!--del_lnk--> national epics. Aspects of the <a href="../../wp/c/Chinese_language.htm" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a> epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Journey to the West</i> were inspired by the Ramayana, particularly the character <!--del_lnk--> Sun Wukong, who is believed to have been based on <!--del_lnk--> Hanuman. <span class="Unicode"><!--del_lnk--> Kakawin R&#x101;m&acirc;ya&#x1E47;a</span> is an old <!--del_lnk--> Javanese rendering of the Sanskrit Ramayana from the ninth century Indonesia. It is a faithful rendering of the Hindu epic with very little variation. <!--del_lnk--> Phra Lak Phra Lam is a <!--del_lnk--> Lao language version, whose title comes from Lakshmana and Rama. The story of Lakshmana and Rama is told as the previous life of the <a href="../../wp/b/Buddha.htm" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> Hikayat Seri Rama of Malaysia, <!--del_lnk--> Dasharatha is the great-grandson of the Prophet <!--del_lnk--> Adam. Ravana receives boons from <a href="../../wp/a/Allah.htm" title="Allah">Allah</a> instead of Brahma.<p><a href="../../wp/t/Thailand.htm" title="Thailand">Thailand</a>&#39;s popular national epic <i><!--del_lnk--> Ramakien</i> is derived from the Hindu epic. In <i>Ramakien</i>, Sita is the daughter of Ravana and Mandodari (<i>T&#39;os&#39;akanth</i> (=Dasakand) and <i>Mont&#39;o</i>). Vibhisana (<i>P&#39;ip&#39;ek</i>), the astrologer brother of Ravana, predicts calamity from the horoscope of Sita. So Ravana has her thrown into the waters, who, later, is picked by Janaka (<i>Janok</i>). While the main story is identical to that of the <i>Ramayana</i>, many other aspects were transposed into a <!--del_lnk--> Thai context, such as the clothes, weapons, topography, and elements of nature, which are described as being Thai in style. It has an expanded role for <!--del_lnk--> Hanuman and he is portrayed as a lascivious character. Ramakien can be seen in an elaborate illustration at the <!--del_lnk--> Wat Phra Kaew temple in Bangkok.<p>Other <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asian adaptations include <!--del_lnk--> Ramakavaca of Bali, <!--del_lnk--> Maradia Lawana of the Philippines, the <!--del_lnk--> Reamker of Cambodia and the <!--del_lnk--> Yama Zatdaw of <a href="../../wp/m/Myanmar.htm" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>.<p><a id="Contemporary_versions" name="Contemporary_versions"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Contemporary versions</span></h3>
