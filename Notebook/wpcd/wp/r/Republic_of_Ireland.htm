      <p>The <b>Republic of Ireland</b> (<!--del_lnk--> Irish: <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>Poblacht na h&Eacute;ireann</i></span>) is the official description of the sovereign state which covers approximately five-sixths of the island of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>, off the coast of north-west <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The state&#39;s official name is <b>Ireland</b> (<span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">in the Irish language: <i><a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589ire.htm" title="&Eacute;ire">&Eacute;ire</a></i></span>) and this is how international organisations and residents usually refer to the country. It is a member of the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>, has a <!--del_lnk--> developed economy and a population of slightly more than 4.2 million. The remaining sixth of the island of Ireland is known as <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and is part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.<p>

      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> constitution provides that the name of the state is &Eacute;ire, or, in the <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English language</a>, Ireland. However, the <!--del_lnk--> state is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Republic of Ireland,&quot; in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland. The name <i>Republic of Ireland</i> came into use after the <!--del_lnk--> Republic of Ireland Act defined it as the official description of the state in 1949 (the purpose of the act being to declare that the state was a <!--del_lnk--> republic rather than a form of <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>). It is also the accepted legal name of the state in the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as per the <!--del_lnk--> Ireland Act 1949. Today, while <i>Republic of Ireland</i> is a valid term for the state, <i>Ireland</i> is used for official purposes such as treaties, government and legal documents, and membership of international organisations. However with <!--del_lnk--> Irish being named the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>&#39;s 21st official language in 2007; the state will be referred to in both constitutional official languages, the Irish and English languages, similarly to other countries such as Finland and Belgium using more than one language at <span class="abbr" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted" title="European Union">EU</span> level. This means the label &#39;&Eacute;ire Ireland&#39; will be used on various signage and nameplates referring to the state.<p>The state is also known by many other names in English, such as <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i><a href="../../wp/%25/%25C3%2589ire.htm" title="&Eacute;ire">&Eacute;ire</a></i></span>, <i>The Free State</i> and the <i>Twenty-six Counties</i>. The use of <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">&Eacute;ire</span> when speaking English in Ireland has become increasingly rare, not least due to historical condescending connotations. Often in the United Kingdom the state is referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Southern Ireland, though this term is used informally and was only used officially for a brief period in the state&#39;s history. Irish people sometimes refer to the state as &quot;The South&quot; - it is not uncommon to hear Northern Irish people talking about going &quot;down south&quot;. The same is true of &quot;The North&quot;. When entering Northern Ireland from the South, you are said to be going &quot;up north&quot;. The names &quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot; are used in common speech to refer to the individual states, rather than their geographical location; when one enters County Donegal (in the Republic) from County Fermanagh (in Northern Ireland), one is still said to be going &quot;down south&quot;, despite Donegal being further north geographically than Fermanagh.<p>The state has had more than one official title. The revolutionary state, declared in 1919 by the large majority of Irish <!--del_lnk--> Members of (the United Kindom) Parliament elected in 1918, was known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Irish Republic&quot;; when the state achieved <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>de jure</i></span> independence in 1922, it became known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State&quot; (in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish language <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i>Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann</i></span>), a name that was retained until 1937.<p>To confuse matters further, from <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2007, the country will be known, at <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">EU</a> level as <b>Eire Ireland</b> in official documents. This is due to the <i>Irish Language</i> becoming an official language of the European Union on that date<!--del_lnk--> .<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>The state known today as the Republic of Ireland came into being when 26 of the counties of <a href="../../wp/i/Ireland.htm" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> seceded from the <!--del_lnk--> United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (<span class="abbr" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted" title="United Kingdom">UK</span>) in <!--del_lnk--> 1922. The remaining six counties remained within the <span class="abbr">UK</span> as <a href="../../wp/n/Northern_Ireland.htm" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. This action, known as the <!--del_lnk--> Partition of Ireland, came about because of complex constitutional developments in the early twentieth century.<p>From <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 1801 until <!--del_lnk--> 6 December <!--del_lnk--> 1922, Ireland was part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. During the <!--del_lnk--> Great Famine from 1845 to 1849 the island&#39;s population of over 8 million fell by 30 percent. One million Irish died of starvation and another 1.5 million emigrated,(see: <cite style="font-style:normal"><!--del_lnk--> Mokyr, Joel (1984). &quot;New Developments in Irish Population History 1700-1850&quot;. <i>Irish Economic and Social History</i> <b>xi</b>: 101-121.</cite>) which set the pattern of emigration for the century to come and would result in a constant decline up to the 1960s. From 1874, but particularly from 1880 under <!--del_lnk--> Charles Stewart Parnell, the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Parliamentary Party moved to prominence with its attempts to achieve <!--del_lnk--> Home Rule, which would have given Ireland some autonomy without requiring it to leave the United Kingdom. It seemed possible in 1911 when the <a href="../../wp/h/House_of_Lords.htm" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> lost their veto, and <!--del_lnk--> John Redmond secured the Third <!--del_lnk--> Home Rule Act 1914. The <!--del_lnk--> unionist movement, however, had been growing since 1886 among Irish <!--del_lnk--> Protestants, fearing that they would face discrimination and lose economic and social privileges if Irish <!--del_lnk--> Catholics were to achieve real political power. Though Irish unionism existed throughout the whole of Ireland, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century unionism was particularly strong in parts of <!--del_lnk--> Ulster, where industrialisation was more common in contrast to the more agrarian rest of the island. (Any tariff barriers would, it was feared, most heavily hit that region.) In addition, the Protestant population was more strongly located in Ulster, with unionist majorities existing in about four counties. Under the leadership of the <a href="../../wp/d/Dublin.htm" title="Dublin">Dublin</a>-born <!--del_lnk--> Sir Edward Carson and the northerner <!--del_lnk--> Sir James Craig they became more militant. In 1914, to avoid rebellion in Ulster, the British <!--del_lnk--> Prime Minister <!--del_lnk--> H. H. Asquith, with agreement of the leadership of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Parliamentary Party leadership, inserted a clause into the bill providing for home rule for 26 of the 32 counties, with an as of yet undecided new set of measures to be introduced for the area temporarily excluded. Though it received the <!--del_lnk--> Royal Assent, the Third <!--del_lnk--> Home Rule Act 1914&#39;s implementation was suspended until after the <a href="../../wp/w/World_War_I.htm" title="World War I">Great War</a>. (The war at that stage was expected to be ended by 1915, not the four years it did ultimately last.) For the prior reasons Redmond and his Irish <!--del_lnk--> National Volunteers supported the Allied cause, and tens of thousands joined the <!--del_lnk--> British Army.<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" class="toccolours" style="float: right; border-sollapse: collapse; margin: 0 0 1.5em 1.5em;">

      <p>In January 1919, after the December 1918 <!--del_lnk--> general elections, 73 of Ireland&#39;s 106 <!--del_lnk--> MPs elected were <!--del_lnk--> Sinn F&eacute;in members who refused to take their seats in the <a href="../../wp/b/British_House_of_Commons.htm" title="British House of Commons">British House of Commons</a>. Instead, they set up an extra-legal Irish parliament called <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. <!--del_lnk--> This D&aacute;il in January 1919 issued a <!--del_lnk--> Unilateral Declaration of Independence and proclaimed an <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republic. The Declaration was mainly a restatement of the 1916 <!--del_lnk--> Proclamation with the additional provision that Ireland was no longer a part of the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Kingdom.htm" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. Despite this, the new <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republic remained unrecognised internationally except by <a href="../../wp/v/Vladimir_Lenin.htm" title="Lenin">Lenin</a>&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Russian Republic. Nevertheless the Republic&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> Aireacht (ministry) sent a delegation under <!--del_lnk--> Ceann Comhairle <!--del_lnk--> Sean T. O&#39;Kelly to the <!--del_lnk--> Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but it was not admitted. After the bitterly fought <!--del_lnk--> War of Independence, representatives of the <!--del_lnk--> British government and the Irish rebels negotiated the <!--del_lnk--> Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921 under which the British agreed to the establishment of an independent Irish State whereby the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State (in the <!--del_lnk--> Irish language <i>Saorst&aacute;t &Eacute;ireann</i>) with <!--del_lnk--> dominion status was created. The <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;il narrowly ratified the treaty.<p>The Treaty was not entirely satisfactory to either side. It gave more concessions to the Irish than the British had intended to give but did not go far enough to satisfy republican aspirations. The new Irish Free State was in theory to cover the entire island, subject to the proviso that six counties in the north-east, termed &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; (which had been created as a separate entity under the <i><!--del_lnk--> Government of Ireland Act 1920</i>) could opt out and choose to remain part of the United Kingdom, which they duly did. The remaining twenty-six counties became the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Free State, a <a href="../../wp/c/Constitutional_monarchy.htm" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> over which the British monarch reigned (from 1927 with the title <!--del_lnk--> King of Ireland). It had a <!--del_lnk--> Governor-General, a <!--del_lnk--> bicameral parliament, a cabinet called the &quot;Executive Council&quot; and a prime minister called the <!--del_lnk--> President of the Executive Council.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> Irish Civil War was the direct consequence of the creation of the Irish Free State. Anti-Treaty forces, led by <!--del_lnk--> Eamon de Valera, objected to the fact that acceptance of the Treaty <i>abolished</i> the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republic of 1919 to which they had sworn loyalty, arguing in the face of public support for the settlement that the &quot;people have no right to do wrong&quot;. They objected most to the fact that the state would remain part of the <!--del_lnk--> British Commonwealth and that <!--del_lnk--> Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la would have to swear an oath of fidelity to <a href="../../wp/g/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom.htm" title="George V of the United Kingdom">King George V</a> and his successors. Pro-Treaty forces, led by <!--del_lnk--> Michael Collins, argued that the Treaty gave &quot;not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire to and develop, but the freedom to achieve it&quot;.<p>At the start of the war, the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Republican Army (<span class="abbr">IRA</span>) split into two opposing camps: a pro-treaty <span class="abbr" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted" title="Irish Republican Army">IRA</span> and an <!--del_lnk--> anti-treaty <span class="abbr">IRA</span>. The pro-Treaty <span class="abbr">IRA</span> became part of the new <!--del_lnk--> National Army. However, through the lack of an effective command structure in the anti-Treaty <span class="abbr">IRA</span>, and their defensive tactics throughout the war, <!--del_lnk--> Collins and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army capable of overwhelming the anti-Treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed any doubts about the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty Irregulars, and the determination of the government to overcome them, contributed significantly to their defeat.<p>The National Army suffered 800 fatalities and perhaps as many as 4,000 people were killed altogether. As their forces retreated, the Irregulars showed a major talent for destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence.<div class="floatleft"><span><a class="image" href="../../images/272/27296.png.htm" title="Irish population through the 20th century."><img alt="Irish population through the 20th century." height="278" longdesc="/wiki/Image:Irishpopulation.png" src="../../images/272/27296.png" width="400" /></a></span></div>
      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 29 December <!--del_lnk--> 1937 a new constitution, the <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Ireland, came into force. It replaced the Irish Free State by a new state called simply &quot;Ireland&quot;. Though this state&#39;s <i>constitutional</i> structures provided for a <!--del_lnk--> President of Ireland instead of a king, it was not technically a republic; the principal key role possessed by a head of state, that of symbolically representing the state internationally remained vested, in <i>statute law</i>, in the King as an <i>organ</i>. On <!--del_lnk--> 21 December <!--del_lnk--> 1948 the Republic of Ireland Act declared a republic, with the functions previously given to the Governor-General acting on the behalf of the King given instead to the President of Ireland.<p>The Irish state had remained a member of the then-<!--del_lnk--> British Commonwealth after independence until the declaration of a republic on 18th April 1949. Under Commonwealth rules declaration of a republic automatically terminated membership of the association; since a reapplication for membership was not made, Ireland consequently ceased to be a member.<p>The Republic of Ireland joined the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> in 1955 and the <!--del_lnk--> European Community (now the <a href="../../wp/e/European_Union.htm" title="European Union">European Union</a>) in 1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful reunification of Ireland and have usually cooperated with the <!--del_lnk--> British government in the violent conflict with the <!--del_lnk--> Provisional IRA and <!--del_lnk--> <span class="abbr" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted" title="Ulster Volunteer Force">UVF</span> in Northern Ireland known as the &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Troubles&quot;. A peace settlement for Northern Ireland, the <!--del_lnk--> Belfast Agreement, was approved in 1998 in referenda north and south of the border, and is currently being implemented, albeit more slowly than many would like.<p><a id="Politics" name="Politics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Politics</span></h2>
      <p>The state is a <!--del_lnk--> republic, with a parliamentary system of government. The <!--del_lnk--> President of Ireland, who serves as <!--del_lnk--> head of state, is elected for a seven-year term and can be re-elected only once. The president is largely a <!--del_lnk--> figurehead but can still carry out certain <!--del_lnk--> constitutional powers and functions, aided by the <!--del_lnk--> Council of State, an advisory body. The <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i><!--del_lnk--> Taoiseach</i></span> (<!--del_lnk--> prime minister), is appointed by the president on the nomination of parliament. The <span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">Taoiseach</span> is normally the leader of the political party which wins the most seats in the national elections.

      <p>The Republic of Ireland has traditionally had 26 <!--del_lnk--> counties, and these are used in political, cultural and sporting contexts. <!--del_lnk--> D&aacute;il constituencies are required by statute to follow county boundaries, as far as possible. Hence counties with greater populations have multiple constituencies (e.g. Limerick East/West) and some constituencies consist of more than one county (e.g. Sligo-Leitrim), but by and large, the actual county boundaries are not crossed. As local government units, however, some have been restructured, with the now-abolished <!--del_lnk--> County Dublin distributed between three new county councils in the 1990s and County Tipperary having been administratively two separate counties since the 1890s, giving a present-day total of 29 administrative counties and five cities. The five cities &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway , and Waterford &mdash; are administered separately from the remainder of their respective counties. Five boroughs &mdash; Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny, Sligo and Wexford &mdash; have a level of autonomy within the county:<table align="center" cellpadding="10">

      <p>The economy of Ireland has transformed in recent years from an agricultural focus to one dependent on trade, industry and investment.

On paper, the country is the largest exporter of software-related goods and services in the world. In fact, a lot of foreign software, and sometimes music, is filtered through the country to avail of the state&#39;s non-taxing of royalties from copyrighted goods.<p>One key reason for the country&#39;s economic surge might be the government&#39;s role in the past ten years. A number of initiatives to address the problems of high <!--del_lnk--> inflation (with poor results in recent years), large tax burdens, government spending, lack-lustre foreign investment and low job skills have been introduced.<p>A key part of economic policy, since 1987, has been <!--del_lnk--> Social Partnership which is a <!--del_lnk--> neo-corporatist set of voluntary &#39;pay pacts&#39; between the Government, employers and trades unions. These usually set agreed pay rises for three-year periods.<p>The state joined in launching the <a href="../../wp/e/Euro.htm" title="Euro">euro</a> currency system in January 1999 (leaving behind the <!--del_lnk--> Irish pound) along with ten other <span class="abbr">EU</span> nations. The 1995 to 2000 period of high economic growth led many to call the country the <!--del_lnk--> Celtic Tiger. The economy felt the impact of the global economic slowdown in 2001, particularly in the high-tech export sector &mdash; the growth rate in that area was cut by nearly half. <span class="abbr">GDP</span> growth continued to be relatively robust, with a rate of about 6% in 2001 and 2002.

      <p>The Republic&#39;s armed forces are organised under the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Defence Forces (<span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga"><i><!--del_lnk--> &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann</i></span>). The <!--del_lnk--> Irish Army is relatively small(compared to other armies in the region), but well equipped, with 8,500 full-time military personnel (13,000 in the reserve army). This is principally due to Ireland&#39;s designation as a <!--del_lnk--> neutral country. Due to the &quot;triple-lock&quot; rules governing participation in conflicts, deployments are on <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">UN</a> peace-keeping duties and protection of the Republic&#39;s territorial waters (in the case of the <!--del_lnk--> Irish Naval Service).

      <p>The Irish peoples are mainly of indigenous <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic ancestry; although some of the population are also of English, Scottish, Anglo-Norman, Viking and Welsh ancestry, these groups have been assimilated and do not form distinct <!--del_lnk--> minority groups. <!--del_lnk--> Celtic culture and language forms an important part of national identity (see language section below). The <!--del_lnk--> Irish Travellers are an ethnic <!--del_lnk--> minority group.<p><a id="Languages" name="Languages"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Languages</span></h3>
      <p>The official languages are <!--del_lnk--> Irish and <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>. Teaching of the Irish language is compulsory in primary and secondary level schools which receive money and recognition from the state. Some students may be exempt from the requirement to receive instruction in the language. <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> is by far the predominant language spoken throughout the country. People living in predominantly Irish-speaking communities (the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeltacht) are limited to the low tens of thousands in isolated pockets largely on the western seaboard. Roads signs are usually bilingual, except in the <!--del_lnk--> Gaeltacht, where they are in Irish only. The legal status of place names has recently been the subject of controversy, with an order made in 2005 under the <!--del_lnk--> Official Languages Act changing the official name of certain locations from English to Irish (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Dingle is now officially named <i>An Daingean</i>). Most public notices are only in <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a>, as are most of the print media. National media in Irish exist on TV, radio, and in print.<p><a id="Recent_population_growth" name="Recent_population_growth"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Recent population growth</span></h3>
      <p>According to &quot;Marketing Ireland&quot; Ireland has experienced a massive influx in the number of people from the 10 new <span class="abbr">EU</span> accession states. Some 210,000 <!--del_lnk--> PPS numbers have been issued to people from Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 140,000 PPS number have been given to <!--del_lnk--> Poles in Ireland. However, not all those who have received PPS numbers will have remained in Ireland. There are also around 10,000 Americans living in Ireland. There is also a significant Asian, largely Chinese, community in Ireland with an estimated 22,000 people and a Nigerian population of around 9,000 in 2002 <!--del_lnk--> . It is estimated that 10,000 Poles arrive in Ireland to work every month.<p>The <!--del_lnk--> CSO published preliminary findings based on the 2006 Census of Population on <!--del_lnk--> July 19, <!--del_lnk--> 2006. These indicate:<ul>
       <li>The total population of Ireland on Census Day, <!--del_lnk--> April 23, <!--del_lnk--> 2006, was 4,234,925, an increase of 317,722, or 8.1% since <!--del_lnk--> 2002<li>Allowing for the incidence of births (245,000) and deaths (114,000), the derived net immigration of people to Ireland between 2002 and 2006 was 186,000. It is estimated that the cohort of non-nationals resident in Ireland is of the order of 400,000 &mdash; a number that will be clarified in <!--del_lnk--> April <!--del_lnk--> 2007.<li>The average annual rate of increase, 2%, is the highest on record &ndash; compared to 1.3% between 1996 and 2002 and 1.5% between 1971 and 1979.<li>The 2006 population was last exceeded in the 1861 Census when the population then was 4.4 million The lowest population of Ireland was recorded in the 1961 Census &ndash; 2.6 million.<li>All provinces of Ireland recorded population growth. The population of <!--del_lnk--> Leinster grew by 8.9%; <!--del_lnk--> Munster by 6.5%; and the long-term population decline of <!--del_lnk--> Connacht &ndash; <!--del_lnk--> Ulster has stopped.<li>The ratio of males to females has declined in each of the four provinces between 1979 and 2006. Leinster is the only province where the number of females exceeds the number of males. Males predominate in rural counties such as <!--del_lnk--> Cavan, <!--del_lnk--> Leitrim, and <!--del_lnk--> Roscommon while the are more females in cities and urban areas.</ul>

      <p>The Republic of Ireland is 88% nominally <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic, and has one of the highest rates of church attendance in the <!--del_lnk--> Western World. However, there has been a major decline in Mass attendance among <!--del_lnk--> Irish Catholics since the liturgical, disciplinary and theological reforms of the <!--del_lnk--> Second Vatican Council were implemented. Between 1996 and 2001, regular <!--del_lnk--> Mass attendance, already previously in decline, declined from 60% to 48% (it had been above 90% before 1973), and all but two of its sacerdotal seminaries have closed.<p>The second largest Christian denomination, the <a href="../../wp/c/Church_of_Ireland.htm" title="Church of Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> (<a href="../../wp/a/Anglicanism.htm" title="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>), having been in decline for most of the twentieth century, has now experienced an increase in membership, according to the 2002 census, as have other small Christian denominations, and <a href="../../wp/i/Islam.htm" title="Islam">Islam</a>. The largest other Protestant denominations are the <!--del_lnk--> Presbyterian Church in Ireland, followed by the <!--del_lnk--> Methodist Church in Ireland. The very small <a href="../../wp/j/Judaism.htm" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> community in the state also recorded a marginal increase(see <!--del_lnk--> History of the Jews in Ireland).<p><a id="Religion_and_politics" name="Religion_and_politics"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Religion and politics</span></h3>
      <p>The <!--del_lnk--> 1937 <!--del_lnk--> Constitution of Ireland gave the Roman Catholic Church a &quot;special position&quot; as the church of the majority, but also recognised other Christian and Jewish sects. As with other predominantly Roman Catholic European states (e.g., <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>), the Irish state underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late <a href="../../wp/2/20th_century.htm" title="20th century">20th century</a>. In <!--del_lnk--> 1972, the articles mentioning specific religions groups, including the Catholic Church were deleted from the Irish constitution by the <!--del_lnk--> Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.<p>Still remaining in the Constitution is Article 44, which begins:<dl>
       <dd><i>The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.</i></dl>
      <p>The article also establishes freedom of religion (for belief, practice, and organisation without undue interference from the state), prohibits endowment of any particular religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner.<p>Catholic doctrine prohibits <!--del_lnk--> abortion in most circumstances, putting it in conflict with the <!--del_lnk--> pro-choice movement. In <!--del_lnk--> 1983, the <!--del_lnk--> Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland recognised &quot;the right to life of the unborn&quot;, subject to qualifications concerning the &quot;equal right to life&quot; of the mother. The case of <i><!--del_lnk--> Attorney General v. X</i> prompted passage of the <!--del_lnk--> Thirteenth and <!--del_lnk--> Fourteenth Amendments, guaranteeing the right to travel abroad to have an abortion performed, and the right of citizens to learn about &quot;services&quot; that are illegal in Ireland but legal outside the country. (See <!--del_lnk--> Abortion in Ireland.)<p>Catholic and Protestant attitudes in 1937 also disfavoured <!--del_lnk--> divorce, which was prohibited by the original Constitution. It was not until <!--del_lnk--> 1995 that the <!--del_lnk--> Fifteenth Amendment repealed this ban.<p>The Catholic Church was hit in the 1990s by a series of sexual abuse scandals and cover-up charges against its hierarchy. In 2005, a major inquiry was made into <!--del_lnk--> child sexual abuse allegations. The Ferns report, published on <!--del_lnk--> 25 October <!--del_lnk--> 2005, revealed that more than 100 cases of child sexual abuse, between 1962 and 2002, by 21 priests, had taken place in the Diocese of Ferns alone. The report criticised the <!--del_lnk--> Garda and the health authorities, who failed to protect the children to the best of their abilities; and in the case of the Garda before 1988, no file was ever recorded on sexual abuse complaints. (See <!--del_lnk--> Roman Catholic sex abuse cases.)<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
