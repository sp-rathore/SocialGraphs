<h2>Become a Regional Coordinator</h2>
<p><strong>Regional Coordinators</strong> (RC) raise awareness of the work of SOS Children and facilitate fundraising within the community, volunteering their time for free. They use their local contacts to meet with schools, companies, community groups and the media to introduce and highlight the work of SOS Children. </p><p>The work of a Regional Coordinator ranges from encouraging people to take part in challenge events, such as sky dives and marathons, and recruiting child and village sponsors to organising fundraising events from charity dinners to sponsored head-shaves! </p><p>All Regional Coordinators are fully supported by SOS Children's UK head office. We provide training, a comprehensive information pack, resources and are always on the end of the phone to offer advice, support and encouragement. </p><p>If you are interested in learning more or have any questions about the role please contact Bec on 01223 365589 or email <a href="mailto:bec@soschildren.org"> bec@soschildren.org</a>.</p><h3>The life of a Regional Coordinator</h3>
<img src="../../wp/l/Lindsy__RC_pic.jpg" width="194" height="259" alt="Lindsy Gray, running for SOS Children in the 2006 Leeds 10km run" class="right" /><p>Lindsy Gray is the SOS Children's Regional Coordinator (RC) for Doncaster. Since becoming an RC in March 2006, Lindsy has organized two Keepy Uppy football events as part of the <a href="../../wp/s/Six_Villages.htm">&quot;6 villages for 2006&quot;</a> World Cup campaign. Young people paid &pound;1 to enter and were timed on how long they could juggle a football in the air. The event raised almost &pound;300, which will pay for an entire month's medical expenses for three SOS Children's Villages in Africa. </p><p>As part of <a href="../../wp/w/Wow_Main.htm">World Orphan Week</a>, Lindsy organised an envelope drop for collections in her neighbourhood as well as a raffle and rounders tournament at Doncaster County Council, where she works. All the money raised will go towards buying beds for orphaned and abandoned children living in the SOS Children&rsquo;s Village in Mai Dich, <a href="../../wp/v/Vietnam_A.htm">Vietnam</a>.</p><h3>Recent Regional Coordinator events</h3>
