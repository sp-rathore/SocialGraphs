      <p><b>Rice</b> is two species in the <!--del_lnk--> Poaceae (&quot;true grass&quot;) family, <i><b>Oryza sativa</b></i> and <i><b>Oryza glaberrima</b></i>. These <a href="../../wp/p/Plant.htm" title="Plants">plants</a> are native to tropical and subtropical southern and southeastern <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asia</a> and in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Rice provides more than one fifth of the <!--del_lnk--> calories consumed by <a href="../../wp/h/Human.htm" title="Human">humans</a> in their global diets. (The term &quot;wild rice&quot; can refer to wild species of <i>Oryza</i>, but conventionally refers to species of the related genus <i><!--del_lnk--> Zizania</i>, both wild and domesticated.) Rice is a <!--del_lnk--> monocarpic <!--del_lnk--> annual plant, growing to 1&ndash;1.8 m tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and <a href="../../wp/s/Soil.htm" title="Soil">soil</a> fertility. The grass has long, slender <!--del_lnk--> leaves 50&ndash;100 cm long and 2&ndash;2.5 cm broad. The small <!--del_lnk--> wind-pollinated <a href="../../wp/f/Flower.htm" title="Flower">flowers</a> are produced in a branched arching to pendulous <!--del_lnk--> inflorescence 30&ndash;50 cm long. The <a href="../../wp/s/Seed.htm" title="Seed">seed</a> is a <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Grain">grain</a> (caryopsis) 5&ndash;12 mm long and 2&ndash;3 mm thick.<p>Rice is a <!--del_lnk--> staple for a large part of the world&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> human population, especially in <!--del_lnk--> East and <!--del_lnk--> Southeast Asia, making it the most consumed <!--del_lnk--> cereal grain. Rice is the world&#39;s third largest crop, behind <a href="../../wp/m/Maize.htm" title="Maize">maize</a> (&quot;corn&quot;) and <a href="../../wp/w/Wheat.htm" title="Wheat">wheat</a>. Rice <!--del_lnk--> cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low <!--del_lnk--> labour costs and high <a href="../../wp/r/Rain.htm" title="Rainfall">rainfall</a>, as it is very labour-intensive to cultivate and requires plenty of water for <a href="../../wp/i/Irrigation.htm" title="Irrigation">irrigation</a>, much like the <!--del_lnk--> licorice crops found in Eastern Europe. Rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on <!--del_lnk--> steep <!--del_lnk--> hillsides. Although its species are native to South Asia and certain parts of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a>, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures.<script type="text/javascript">

      <p>Rice is often grown in <!--del_lnk--> paddies. The shallow puddles take advantage of the rice plant&#39;s tolerance to water; the water in the paddies prevents <a href="../../wp/w/Weed.htm" title="Weed">weeds</a> from outgrowing the crop. Once the rice has established dominance of the field, the water can be drained in preparation for harvest. Paddies increase productivity, although rice can also be grown on dry land (including on <!--del_lnk--> terraced hillsides) with the help of chemical weed controls.<p>In some instances, a deep-water strain of rice often called <i>floating rice</i> is grown. Floating rice can develop elongated stems capable of coping with water depths exceeding 2 meters (6.5 feet).<p>Rice paddies are an important habitat for birds such as <a href="../../wp/h/Heron.htm" title="Heron">herons</a> and <!--del_lnk--> warblers, and a wide range of <!--del_lnk--> amphibians and <!--del_lnk--> snakes. They perform a useful function in controlling insect <!--del_lnk--> pests by providing useful habitats for those who prey on them. For most farm families in the <!--del_lnk--> Greater Mekong Subregion the rice field is the main source of household food security. Not only does rice itself provide most of the calories in the rural diet, but the rice paddy is an important source of wild and cultivated fish <!--del_lnk--> .<p><!--del_lnk--> Rice blast, caused by the <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungus</a> <i>Magnaporthe grisea</i>, is the most significant disease affecting rice cultivation.<p><a id="Preparation_as_food" name="Preparation_as_food"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Preparation as food</span></h2>

      <p>The seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a <!--del_lnk--> rice huller to remove the <!--del_lnk--> chaff (the outer husks of the grain). At this point in the process the product is called <!--del_lnk--> brown rice. This process may be continued, removing the <!--del_lnk--> germ and the rest of the husk, called the <a href="../../wp/b/Bran.htm" title="Bran">bran</a> at this point, creating <!--del_lnk--> white rice. The white rice may then be buffed with glucose or talc powder (often called <i>polished rice,</i> though this term may also refer to white rice in general), <!--del_lnk--> parboiled, or processed into <!--del_lnk--> flour. The white rice may also be enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>While washing is counter-productive for powder-enriched rice, it is absolutely necessary when talc-coated rice is used, not least because of concerns about the negative health effects of talc consumption and possibility of asbestos accompanying the talc. Despite the hypothetical health risks of talc (such as stomach cancer), talc-coated rice remains the norm in some countries due to its attractive shiny appearance, but it has been banned in some and is no longer widely used in others such as the United States. Even where talc is not used, glucose, starch, or other coatings may be used to improve the appearance of the grains; for this reason, many rice lovers still recommend washing all rice in order to create a better-tasting rice with a better consistency, despite the recommendation of suppliers. Much of the rices produced today are in fact water polished.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Rice, like other <a href="../../wp/c/Cereal.htm" title="Cereal">cereal</a> <!--del_lnk--> grains, can be <i>puffed</i> (or <i>popped</i>). This process takes advantage of the grains&#39; <a href="../../wp/w/Water.htm" title="Water">water</a> content and typically involves heating grain pellets in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing pre-puffed pellets in a low-<!--del_lnk--> pressure chamber. The <!--del_lnk--> ideal gas law means that either lowering the local pressure or raising the water <!--del_lnk--> temperature results in an increase in <!--del_lnk--> volume prior to water <!--del_lnk--> evaporation, resulting in a puffy <!--del_lnk--> texture.<p><a id="Cooking" name="Cooking"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Cooking</span></h2>

      <p>Rice is cooked by <!--del_lnk--> boiling or <!--del_lnk--> steaming. It can be cooked in just enough water to cook it through (the absorption method), or it can be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving (the rapid-boil method). Electric <!--del_lnk--> rice cookers, which are popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice.<p>Rice may also be made into <!--del_lnk--> rice porridge by adding more water than usual, so that the cooked rice is saturated with water to the point that it becomes very soft, expanded, and fluffy. Rice porridge is very easy to digest, so it is especially suitable for the sick.<p>Rice may be soaked prior to cooking. Soaked rice cooks faster. For some varieties, soaking improves the texture of the cooked rice by increasing expansion of the grains.<p>In some culinary traditions, especially those of <a href="../../wp/l/Latin_America.htm" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a>, and Turkey dry rice grains are <!--del_lnk--> fried in <!--del_lnk--> oil before cooking in water.<p>Much of today&#39;s rice is consumed as parboiled rice. Also known as easi-cook rice. Parboiled rice is subjected to a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice. This causes nutrients from the outer husk to move into the grain itself. The parboil process causes a gelatisisation of the starch in the grains. The grains become less brittle, and the colour of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. The rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or consumed as brown rice. Milled parboil rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice. Parboiled rice has an additional benefit in that it does not stick to the pan during cooking as happens when cooking regular white rice.<p>A nutritionally superior method of preparing brown rice known as <b>GABA Rice</b> or GBR (Germinated Brown Rice) may be used. This involves soaking washed brown rice for 20 hours in warm water (38 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;C or 100 <!--del_lnk--> &deg;F) prior to cooking it. This process stimulates <!--del_lnk--> germination, which <!--del_lnk--> activates various <!--del_lnk--> enzymes in the rice. By this method, a result of research carried out for the <a href="../../wp/u/United_Nations.htm" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> Year of Rice, it is possible to obtain a more complete <!--del_lnk--> amino acid profile, including <!--del_lnk--> GABA.<p><a id="History" name="History"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>

      <p>It is widely accepted that the term Rice comes from the <a href="../../wp/t/Tamil_language.htm" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> word for rice <i>Arisi</i>. According to <i><!--del_lnk--> Microsoft Encarta Dictionary</i> (2004) and to <i><!--del_lnk--> Chambers Dictionary of Etymology</i> (1988), the word <i>rice</i> has an <!--del_lnk--> Indo-Iranian origin. It came to <a href="../../wp/e/English_language.htm" title="English language">English</a> from <!--del_lnk--> Greek <i>&oacute;ryza</i>, via <a href="../../wp/l/Latin.htm" title="Latin">Latin</a> <i>oriza</i>, <!--del_lnk--> Italian <i>riso</i> and finally <!--del_lnk--> Old French <i>ris</i> (the same as present day <a href="../../wp/f/French_language.htm" title="French language">French</a> <i>riz</i>).<br /> The same Indo-Iranian origin produced the <a href="../../wp/a/Arabic_language.htm" title="Arabic language">Arabic</a> <i>ar-ruzz</i>, from which the <a href="../../wp/p/Portuguese_language.htm" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> and <a href="../../wp/s/Spanish_language.htm" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> word <i>arroz</i> originated. <!--del_lnk--> Orzo, a pasta shaped like small grains of rice, presumably gets its name from the Latin <i>oriza</i>.<p><a id="Genetic_History" name="Genetic_History"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Genetic History</span></h3>

      <p>Rice is considered to have begun simultaneously in many countries over 6500 years ago. Two species of rice were <!--del_lnk--> domesticated, Asian rice (<i>O. sativa</i>) and African rice (<i>O. glaberrima</i>).<p>One genetic study suggests that common wild rice, <i><!--del_lnk--> Oryza rufipogon</i>, was the wild ancestor of Asian rice. However, the description that Zohary and Hopf (2000) provide suggests that rice was cultivated at three separate locations, as shown by the three groups of cultivars: the short-grained &quot;japonica&quot; or &quot;sinica&quot; varieties, exemplified by <!--del_lnk--> Japanese rice; the long-grained &quot;indica&quot; varieties, exemplified by <!--del_lnk--> Basmati rice; and the broad-grained &quot;javonica&quot; varieties, which thrive under tropical conditions. However Zohary and Hopf note that the earliest find site for the javonica variety, dated to the fifth millennium BC, was in the earliest phases of the <!--del_lnk--> Hemudu culture on the south side of <!--del_lnk--> Hangzhou Bay in <a href="../../wp/c/China.htm" title="China">China</a>, but was found along with japonica types.<p>According to Londo and Chiang, <i>O. sativa</i> appears to have originated around the <!--del_lnk--> foothills of the <a href="../../wp/h/Himalayas.htm" title="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, with <i>O. sativa</i> var. <i>indica</i> on the <a href="../../wp/i/India.htm" title="India">Indian</a> side and <i>O. sativa</i> var. <i>japonica</i> on the Chinese and <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japanese</a> side.<p><a id="East_Asia" name="East_Asia"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">East Asia</span></h3>

      <p>The origins of rice cultivation is the object of research of specialized branch of <a href="../../wp/a/Archaeology.htm" title="Archaeology">archaeology</a> called <!--del_lnk--> palaeoethnobotany. Research in China is active, well reported, and there are a number of differing perspectives on when rice was <!--del_lnk--> domesticated, and when the intensive cultivation of domesticated rice first began.<p><b>China</b><p>Z. Zhao, a Chinese palaeoethnobotanist, hypothesizes that people of the <!--del_lnk--> Late Pleistocene began to collect wild rice. Zhao explains that the collection of wild rice from an early date eventually led to its domestication and then the exclusive use of domesticated rice strains by circa 6400 B.C. at the latest (Zhao 1998). Stone tool evidence from the Yunchanyan site in <!--del_lnk--> Hunan province suggests the possibility that Early <!--del_lnk--> Neolithic groups cultivated rice as early as circa 9000 B.C. (Crawford and Shen 1998:862). Crawford and Shen point out that calibrated radiocarbon dates show that direct evidence of the earliest cultivated rice is no older than 7000 B.C. (Crawford and Shen 1998:862). <!--del_lnk--> Jared Diamond, a biologist and popular science author, summarizes some of the work done by professional archaeologists mentioned above and estimates that the earliest attested domestication of rice took place in China by 7500 B.C.<p>One early findspot of rice from <!--del_lnk--> Pengtoushan in the <!--del_lnk--> Hupei basin was dated by AMS radiocarbon techniques to 6400&ndash;5800 BC (Zohary and Hopf 2000), but most of the Neolithic sites in China with finds of charred rice and radiocarbon dates are from 5000 BC or later (Crawford and Shen 1998). This evidence leads most archaeologists to say that large-scale dry-land rice farming began between 5000 and 4500 BC in the area of <!--del_lnk--> Yangtze Delta (for example <!--del_lnk--> Hemudu culture, discovered in 1970s), and the wet-rice cultivation began at approximately 2500 BC in the same area (<!--del_lnk--> Liangzhu culture). It is now commonly thought that some areas such as the alluvial plains in <!--del_lnk--> Shaoxing and <!--del_lnk--> Ningbo in <!--del_lnk--> Zhejiang province are the cradle-lands of East Asian rice cultivation. Finally, ancient textual evidence of the cultivation of rice in China dates to 3000 years ago.<p><b>Korea and Japan</b><p>In 2003 archaeologists alleged that they discovered burnt grains (domesticated rice) in Soro-ri, Korea, that predate the oldest grains in China. This find potentially challenges the mainstream explanation that domesticated rice originated in China. Unfortunately, the media reports of the Soro-ri charred grains are brief and lack sufficient detail for archaeologists and other scientists to properly evaluate the true meaning of this very unusual find.<p>Reliable, mainstream archaeological evidence derived from palaeoethnobotanical investigations indicate that dry-land rice was introduced to <a href="../../wp/j/Japan.htm" title="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="../../wp/k/Korea.htm" title="Korea">Korea</a> some time between <!--del_lnk--> 3500 and <!--del_lnk--> 1200 BC. The cultivation of rice in Korea and Japan during that time occurred on a small-scale, fields were impermanent plots, and evidence shows that in some cases domesticated and wild grains were planted together. The technological, subsistence, and social impact of rice and grain cultivation is not evident in archaeological data until after <!--del_lnk--> 1500 BC. For example, intensive wet-<!--del_lnk--> paddy rice agriculture was introduced into Korea shortly before or during the Middle <!--del_lnk--> Mumun Pottery Period (c. 850&ndash;550 BC) and reached Japan by the Final Jomon or Initial <!--del_lnk--> Yayoi circa <!--del_lnk--> 300 BC (Crawford and Lee 2003; Crawford and Shen 1998).<p><a id="India" name="India"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">India</span></h3>
      <p>It is generally assumed that the <!--del_lnk--> Rigveda&#39;s have no mention of rice. There is however mention of ApUpa, Puro-das and Odana (rice-gruel) in the Rig Veda, terms that, at least in later texts, refer to rice dishes, The rigvedic commentator <!--del_lnk--> Sayana refers to &quot;tandula&quot; when commenting on RV 1.16.2., which usually means rice. It was also speculated that the rigvedic term dhana (dhanaa, dhanya) could possibly refer to rice. Both <!--del_lnk--> Charaka and <!--del_lnk--> Sushruta mention rice in some detail. The <!--del_lnk--> Arthasastra discusses some aspects of rice cultivation. The <!--del_lnk--> Kashyapiyakrishisukti by <!--del_lnk--> Kashyapa is the most detailed ancient Sanskrit text on rice cultivation.<p><a id="Africa" name="Africa"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">Africa</span></h3>
      <p>African rice has been cultivated for 3500 years.

They report that a large sample of rice grains was recovered from a grave at <!--del_lnk--> Susa in <a href="../../wp/i/Iran.htm" title="Iran">Iran</a> (dated to the first century AD) at one end of the ancient world, while at the same time rice was grown in the <!--del_lnk--> Po valley in Italy. However, <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder writes that rice (<i>oryza</i>) is grown only in &quot;Egypt, Syria, Cilicia, Asia Minor and Greece&quot; (<i><!--del_lnk--> N.H.</i> 18.19). The <!--del_lnk--> Moors brought it to the <!--del_lnk--> Iberian Peninsula when they conquered it in <!--del_lnk--> 711. After the middle of the <a href="../../wp/1/15th_century.htm" title="15th century">15th century</a>, rice spread throughout <a href="../../wp/i/Italy.htm" title="Italy">Italy</a> and then <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a>, later propagating to all the continents during the great age of European exploration.<p><a id="The_Americas" name="The_Americas"></a><h3><span class="mw-headline">The Americas</span></h3>
      <p>In <!--del_lnk--> 1694, rice arrived in <!--del_lnk--> South Carolina, probably originating from <a href="../../wp/m/Madagascar.htm" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. The Spanish brought rice to <a href="../../wp/s/South_America.htm" title="South America">South America</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../../wp/1/18th_century.htm" title="18th century">18th century</a>.<p>In the <a href="../../wp/u/United_States.htm" title="United States">United States</a>, <!--del_lnk--> colonial South Carolina and <!--del_lnk--> Georgia grew and amassed great <!--del_lnk--> wealth from the <a href="../../wp/s/Slavery.htm" title="Slavery">slave</a> labour obtained from the <!--del_lnk--> Senegambia area of <!--del_lnk--> West Africa. At the <!--del_lnk--> port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from this region of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> brought the highest prices, in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice <!--del_lnk--> plantations around <!--del_lnk--> Georgetown, <!--del_lnk--> Charleston, and <!--del_lnk--> Savannah. From the slaves, plantation owners learned how to dyke the <!--del_lnk--> marshes and periodically flood the fields. At first the rice was milled by hand with <a href="../../wp/w/Wood.htm" title="Wood">wooden</a> paddles, then winnowed in <!--del_lnk--> sweetgrass <!--del_lnk--> baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by the slaves). The invention of the rice <!--del_lnk--> mill increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in <!--del_lnk--> 1787 by <!--del_lnk--> millwright <!--del_lnk--> Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.

      <p>Rice pests are any <!--del_lnk--> organisms or <!--del_lnk--> microbes with the potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop (or of rice seeds) (Jahn et al 2007). Rice pests include <a href="../../wp/w/Weed.htm" title="Weed">weeds</a>, <!--del_lnk--> pathogens, <a href="../../wp/i/Insect.htm" title="Insect">insects</a>, <!--del_lnk--> rodents, and <a href="../../wp/b/Bird.htm" title="Bird">birds</a>. A variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including the overuse of <!--del_lnk--> pesticides and high rates of <!--del_lnk--> nitrogen fertilizer application (e.g. Jahn et al. 2005)<!--del_lnk--> . Weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. For example, rice gall midge and army worm outbreaks tend to follow high rainfall early in the wet season, while <!--del_lnk--> thrips outbreaks are associated with drought (<!--del_lnk--> Douangboupha et al. 2006).<p>One of the challenges facing crop protection specialists is to develop rice pest management techniques which are sustainable. In other words, to manage crop pests in such a manner that future crop production is not threatened (Jahn et al. 2001). Rice pests are managed by cultural techniques, pest-resistant rice varieties, and <!--del_lnk--> pesticides (which include <!--del_lnk--> insecticide). Increasingly, there is evidence that farmers&#39; pesticide applications are often unnecessary (Jahn et al. <!--del_lnk--> 1996, <!--del_lnk--> 2004a,b) <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> <!--del_lnk--> . By reducing the populations of natural enemies of rice pests (Jahn 1992), misuse of insecticides can actually lead to pest outbreaks (Cohen et al. 1994). Botanicals, so-called &ldquo;natural pesticides&rdquo;, are used by some farmers in an attempt to control rice pests, but in general the practice is not common. Upland rice is grown without standing water in the field. Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (<i>Chromolaena odorata</i> (L.)) over the surface of fields after planting. The practice probably helps the soil retain moisture and thereby facilitates seed germination. Farmers also claim the leaves are a natural fertilizer and helps suppress weed and insect infestations (Jahn et al. 1999).<p>Among rice cultivars there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage (<!--del_lnk--> Jahn et al. 2004c, Khiev et al. 2000). Therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. Major rice pests include the brown <!--del_lnk--> planthopper<!--del_lnk-->  (Preap et al. 2006), <!--del_lnk--> armyworms<!--del_lnk--> , <!--del_lnk--> the green leafhopper, the rice gall midge (Jahn and Khiev 2004), the <!--del_lnk--> rice bug <!--del_lnk--> (Jahn et al. 2004c), hispa (Murphy et al. 2006), <!--del_lnk--> the rice leaffolder, <!--del_lnk--> stemborer, rats (Leung et al 2002), and the weed <i>Echinochloa crusgali</i> (Pheng et al. 2001). Major rice diseases include <!--del_lnk--> Rice Ragged Stunt, <!--del_lnk--> Sheath Blight and <!--del_lnk--> Tungro.<p><a id="Cultivars" name="Cultivars"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Cultivars</span></h2>
      <p>The largest collection of rice cultivars is at the <!--del_lnk--> International Rice Research Institute (<!--del_lnk--> IRRI), with over 100,000 rice accessions <!--del_lnk-->  held in the International Rice Genebank <!--del_lnk--> . Rice <a href="../../wp/c/Cultivar.htm" title="Cultivar">cultivars</a> are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. For example, Thai <!--del_lnk--> Jasmine rice is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as long-grain rice contains less <!--del_lnk--> amylopectin than short-grain cultivars. Chinese restaurants usually serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice. Japanese <!--del_lnk--> mochi rice and Chinese <!--del_lnk--> sticky rice are short-grain. Chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as &quot;glutinous rice&quot; (note: glutinous refer to the glue-like characteristic of rice; does not refer to &quot;gluten&quot;) to make <!--del_lnk--> zongzi. The <!--del_lnk--> Japanese table rice is a sticky, short-grain rice. Japanese <!--del_lnk--> sake rice is another kind as well.<p>Indian rice cultivars include long-grained and aromatic <!--del_lnk--> Basmati (grown in the North), long and medium-grained <!--del_lnk--> Patna rice and short-grained Masoori. In South India the most prized cultivar is &#39;ponni&#39; which is primarily grown in the delta regions of <!--del_lnk--> Kaveri River. <!--del_lnk--> Kaveri is also referred to as ponni in the South and the name reflects the geographic region where it is grown. Rice in <!--del_lnk--> East India and <!--del_lnk--> South India, is usually prepared by boiling the rice in large pans immediately after harvesting and before removing the husk; this is referred to in English as <i><!--del_lnk--> parboiled rice</i>. It is then dried, and the husk removed later. It often displays small red speckles, and has a smoky flavour from the fires. Usually coarser rice is used for this procedure. It helps to retain the natural vitamins and kill any <a href="../../wp/f/Fungus.htm" title="Fungus">fungi</a> or other contaminants, but leads to an odour which some find peculiar. This rice is easier on the stomach to digest. In <!--del_lnk--> South India, it is also used to make <!--del_lnk--> idlis.<div class="thumb tright">

      <p>Aromatic rices have definite aromas and flavours; the most noted cultivars are <!--del_lnk--> Thai fragrant rice, Basmati, Patna rice, and a <!--del_lnk--> hybrid cultivar from America sold under the trade name, <!--del_lnk--> Texmati. It is a cross between Basmati and American long-grained rice that is creating great controversy. Both Basmati and Texmati have a mild <!--del_lnk--> popcorn-like aroma and flavour. In Indonesia there are also <i>red</i> and <i>black</i> cultivars.<p>High-yield cultivars of rice suitable for cultivation in <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and other dry <!--del_lnk--> ecosystems called the <!--del_lnk--> new rice for Africa (NERICA) cultivars have been developed. It is hoped that their cultivation will improve <!--del_lnk--> food security in <!--del_lnk--> West Africa.<p>Scientists are working on so-called <i><!--del_lnk--> golden rice</i> which is genetically modified to produce beta <!--del_lnk--> carotene, the precursor to <!--del_lnk--> vitamin A.<p>Draft <!--del_lnk--> genomes for the two most common rice cultivars, <i>indica</i> and <i>japonica</i>, were published in April 2002. Rice was chosen as a <!--del_lnk--> model organism for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 mega<!--del_lnk--> base pairs). Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence. Basmati rice is the oldest, common <!--del_lnk--> progenitor for most types.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> December 16, <!--del_lnk--> 2002, the <!--del_lnk--> UN General Assembly declared the year <!--del_lnk--> 2004 the International Year of Rice.
