      </div>
      <p>Shakespeare&#39;s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was published in two distinct <!--del_lnk--> quarto editions prior to the publication of the <!--del_lnk--> First Folio of 1623. These are referred to as <!--del_lnk--> Q1 and <!--del_lnk--> Q2.<p>Q1, the first printed edition, appeared in 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a &#39;<!--del_lnk--> bad quarto&#39;: the twentieth century editor T. J .B. Spencer described it as &quot;a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors.&quot;<p>The superior <!--del_lnk--> Q2 followed in <!--del_lnk--> 1599, published by Cuthbert Burby and printed by Thomas Creede. It is a much more complete and reliable text, and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5). Its title page describes it as &quot;Newly corrected, augmented and amended&quot;. Scholars believe that this text was based on Shakespeare&#39;s pre-performance draft, since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and &quot;false starts&quot; for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. Q2 contains 800 lines missing from <!--del_lnk--> Q1. Q2 also has an interestingly defective stage direction: it reads &quot;Enter <!--del_lnk--> Will Kempe&quot; instead of &quot;Enter Peter&quot; in IV,v,102.<p>The First Folio text of 1623 seems to be based primarily on Q3, with some clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical promptbook.<p>The greater part of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is written in <!--del_lnk--> iambic pentameter. However, the play is also notable for its copious use of <!--del_lnk--> rhymed verse, notably in the <!--del_lnk--> sonnet contained in Romeo and Juliet&#39;s dialogue in the scene where they first meet (Act I, Scene v, Lines 95-108).<p><a id="Performance_history" name="Performance_history"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Performance history</span></h2>
      <p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was a popular play in Shakespeare&#39;s lifetime. Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, in the period after the death of <!--del_lnk--> Marlowe and <!--del_lnk--> Kyd but before the ascendancy of <a href="../../wp/b/Ben_Jonson.htm" title="Ben Jonson">Jonson</a> during which Shakespeare was London&#39;s dominant playwright.<p>After the theatres re-opened in the <!--del_lnk--> Restoration, Sir <!--del_lnk--> William Davenant staged a 1662 production in which <!--del_lnk--> Henry Harris played Romeo, <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Betterton was Mercutio, and Betterton&#39;s wife <!--del_lnk--> Mary Saunderson played Juliet. <!--del_lnk--> Thomas Otway&#39;s adaptation <i>The History and Fall of Caius Marius</i>, one of the more extreme of the Restoration versions of Shakespeare, debuted in 1679. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebians; Juliet/Lavina wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway&#39;s version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. <!--del_lnk--> Theophilus Cibber mounted his own adaptation in 1744, followed by <!--del_lnk--> David Garrick&#39;s in 1748. Both Cibber and Garrick used variations on Otway&#39;s innovation in the tomb scene.<p>In 1750 came the so-called &quot;Battle of the Romeos,&quot; with <!--del_lnk--> Spranger Barry and <!--del_lnk--> Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at <!--del_lnk--> Covent Garden versus <!--del_lnk--> David Garrick and <!--del_lnk--> George Anne Bellamy at <a href="../../wp/t/Theatre_Royal%252C_Drury_Lane.htm" title="Theatre Royal, Drury Lane">Drury Lane</a>. Shakespeare&#39;s original returned to the stage in 1845 in the United States (with the sisters <!--del_lnk--> Charlotte and Susan Cushman as Romeo and Juliet), and in 1847 in Britain (<!--del_lnk--> Samuel Phelps at <!--del_lnk--> Sadler&#39;s Wells).<p><!--del_lnk--> Henry Irving&#39;s 1882 production at the <!--del_lnk--> Lyceum Theatre is considered an archetype of his &quot;pictorial&quot; style, placing the action on elaborate sets. Irving hmself played Romeo, and <!--del_lnk--> Ellen Terry played Juliet.<p>In one of the most notable twentieth century performances, staged by <!--del_lnk--> John Gielgud at the <!--del_lnk--> New Theatre in 1934, Gielgud and <a href="../../wp/l/Laurence_Olivier.htm" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> played the roles of Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with <!--del_lnk--> Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet.<p><a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a><h2><span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>

      <p>The play begins with a 14-line <!--del_lnk--> prologue by a Chorus in the form of a <!--del_lnk--> Shakespearean sonnet. The Chorus explains to the audience that the story concerns two noble families of <!--del_lnk--> Verona, the <!--del_lnk--> Capulets and the <!--del_lnk--> Montagues, that have <!--del_lnk--> feuded for generations. The prologue also explains that the lovers&#39; tragic <!--del_lnk--> suicides &quot;bury their parents&#39; strife.&quot;<p>The action proper starts with a street-battle between the two families&#39; servants. The Prince of <!--del_lnk--> Verona, <!--del_lnk--> Escalus, finally intervenes with his men. The Prince declares that the heads of the two families will be held personally accountable for any further breach of the peace, and disperses the crowd.<p><!--del_lnk--> Count Paris, a young nobleman, talks to Capulet about marrying his thirteen-year-old daughter, <!--del_lnk--> Juliet. Capulet demurs, citing the girl&#39;s tender age, and invites him to attract the attention of Juliet during a <!--del_lnk--> ball that the family is to hold that night. Meanwhile Juliet&#39;s mother tries to persuade her young daughter to accept Paris&#39; wooing during their coming ball. Young Juliet admits to not having considered marriage, but accedes to her mother&#39;s wishes as a dutiful daughter. This scene also introduces Juliet&#39;s nurse, the comic relief of the play.<p>Meantime, <!--del_lnk--> Benvolio queries his cousin <a href="../../wp/r/Romeo_and_Juliet.htm" title="Romeo Montague">Romeo</a>, Montague&#39;s son, to find out the source of his melancholy. He discovers that it stems from an unrequited love of a girl named <!--del_lnk--> Rosaline, (an <!--del_lnk--> unseen character). Despite the playful taunts of nobleman and friend <!--del_lnk--> Mercutio, Romeo decides to attend the masquerade at the Capulet house, in hope of meeting Rosaline.<p>Alongside his masked friends, Romeo attends the ball as planned, but falls instead for Juliet, and she with him. In the famous <!--del_lnk--> balcony scene, the two eloquently declare their love for each other. This scene contains arguably the most famous line of Romeo and Juliet, &quot;Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?&quot; spoken by Juliet to the darkness (&quot;wherefore&quot; means &quot;why&quot; not &quot;where&quot; &mdash; Juliet is lamenting that Romeo is a Montague, and thus her enemy). The young lovers decide to marry without informing their parents, with the Nurse as an intermediary.<p>With the help of the <!--del_lnk--> Franciscan <!--del_lnk--> Friar Lawrence, who hoped to reconcile the two families through their children&#39;s union, the two are <!--del_lnk--> married that next day.<p>Events take a darker turn in Act Three. <!--del_lnk--> Tybalt, Juliet&#39;s hot-blooded <!--del_lnk--> cousin, challenges Romeo to a <!--del_lnk--> duel for appearing in the Capulets&#39; ball disguised. Romeo refuses to fight Tybalt as they are now kinsmen by marriage, but Mercutio, Romeo&#39;s companion, who is also unaware of the marriage, is incensed by Tybalt&#39;s insolence and accepts instead. In the ensuing duel, Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo tries to intervene. Romeo, angered by his friend&#39;s death, pursues and slays Tybalt, then flees.<p>A grieving Prince proclaims his judgement: he fines the head of each house heavily, and <!--del_lnk--> exiles Romeo from Verona, in recognition that Tybalt had first killed Mercutio, who had not only been Romeo&#39;s friend but a kinsman of the Prince.<p>Meanwhile the Capulets had engaged their unwilling daughter to marry Paris in three days&#39; time, threatening to disown her if she does not. The Nurse, once her confidante, tells Juliet she should discard the exiled Romeo and comply.<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Juliet visits Friar Lawrence, who comes up with a plan: he hands her a <!--del_lnk--> drug which will put her into a death-like coma for &quot;two and forty hours&quot; (Act IV. Scene I); she is to take it and when discovered apparently dead, she will be laid in the family <!--del_lnk--> crypt. Meanwhile, the Friar will send a messenger to inform Romeo, so that she can rejoin him when she awakes. The enforced messenge does not reach Romeo, however, due to a <!--del_lnk--> plague quarantine. Romeo learns of Juliet&#39;s supposed &quot;death&quot; from his servant Balthasar. Grief-stricken, he buys strong <!--del_lnk--> poison from an <!--del_lnk--> apothecary, returns to Verona in secret, and visits the Capulets&#39; crypt, encountering Paris, who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Paris confronts Romeo, believing him to be a vandal. In the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris in the darkness. After burying Paris within the Capulet monument, Romeo says his final words to the comatose Juliet and drinks the poison in <!--del_lnk--> suicide.<p>At this point Juliet awakes. Friar Lawrence arrives, and aware of the tragedies which have ensued from misunderstanding, tries to convince Juliet to leave, but she refuses. Discovering her lover&#39;s dead body, she stabs herself fatally with Romeo&#39;s dagger.<p>The two feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb and are horrified to find three new casualties. A captured Friar Lawrence then recounts the love and secret marriage of Romeo and Juliet, and how the tragedies occurred. It is revealed by Montague that his wife has died of grief after hearing of her son&#39;s exile, thus completing the cycle of two family members from each house being lost. The families are reconciled by their children&#39;s deaths and agree to end their violent feud, as foretold by the prologue. The play ends with the Prince&#39;s brief <!--del_lnk--> elegy for the lovers.<div class="notice spoiler endspoiler" style="border-top: 2px solid #dddddd; border-bottom:2px solid #dddddd; text-align: justify; margin: 1em; padding: 0.2em;"><i><b>Spoilers end here.</b></i></div>
