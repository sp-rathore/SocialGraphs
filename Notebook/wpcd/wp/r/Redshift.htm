      <p>In <a href="../../wp/p/Physics.htm" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="../../wp/a/Astronomy.htm" title="Astronomy">astronomy</a>, <b>redshift</b> occurs when the <!--del_lnk--> visible light from an object is shifted towards the red end of the <!--del_lnk--> spectrum. More generally, redshift is defined as an <i>increase</i> in the <!--del_lnk--> wavelength of <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> received by a detector compared with the wavelength <!--del_lnk--> emitted by the source. This increase in wavelength corresponds to a decrease in the <!--del_lnk--> frequency of the <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>. Conversely, a <i>decrease</i> in wavelength is called <!--del_lnk--> blueshift.<p>Any increase in wavelength is called &quot;redshift&quot; even if it occurs in <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> of non-optical wavelengths, such as <!--del_lnk--> gamma rays, <!--del_lnk--> x-rays and <a href="../../wp/u/Ultraviolet.htm" title="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>. This nomenclature might be confusing since, at wavelengths longer than red (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> infrared, <!--del_lnk--> microwaves, and <a href="../../wp/r/Radio.htm" title="Radio">radio waves</a>), redshifts shift the radiation <i>away</i> from the red wavelengths.<p>A redshift can occur when a light source moves away from an observer, corresponding to the <!--del_lnk--> Doppler shift that changes the frequency of <a href="../../wp/s/Sound.htm" title="Sound">sound waves</a>. Although observing such redshifts has several terrestrial applications (e.g. <!--del_lnk--> Doppler radar and <!--del_lnk--> radar guns), <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic astrophysics uses Doppler redshifts to determine the movement of distant astronomical objects. This Doppler redshift phenomenon was first predicted and observed in the nineteenth century as scientists began to consider the dynamical implications of the <a href="../../wp/w/Wave.htm" title="Wave">wave</a>-nature of <a href="../../wp/l/Light.htm" title="Light">light</a>.<p>Another redshift mechanism accounts for the famous observation that the spectral redshifts of distant <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxies</a>, <!--del_lnk--> quasars, and <!--del_lnk--> intergalactic gas clouds are observed to increase <!--del_lnk--> proportionally with their distance to the observer. This relation is accounted for by models that predict <a href="../../wp/m/Metric_expansion_of_space.htm" title="Metric expansion of space">the universe is expanding</a>, seen in, for example, the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> model. Yet a third type of redshift, the <!--del_lnk--> gravitational redshift also known as the <!--del_lnk--> Einstein effect, results from the <!--del_lnk--> time dilation that occurs in <!--del_lnk--> general relativity near massive objects.<p>

      <p>The history of the subject begins with the development in the nineteenth century of <!--del_lnk--> wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the <!--del_lnk--> Doppler effect. The effect is named after <!--del_lnk--> Christian Andreas Doppler who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in <!--del_lnk--> 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for <!--del_lnk--> sound waves by the <a href="../../wp/n/Netherlands.htm" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> scientist <!--del_lnk--> Christoph Hendrik Diederik Buys Ballot in <!--del_lnk--> 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all <a href="../../wp/w/Wave.htm" title="Wave">waves</a>, and in particular suggested that the varying <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colors</a> of <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth. While this attribution turned out to be incorrect (stellar colors are indicators of a star&#39;s <!--del_lnk--> temperature, not motion), Doppler would later be vindicated by verified redshift observations.<p>The first Doppler redshift was described by French physicist <!--del_lnk--> Armand-Hippolyte-Louis Fizeau in <!--del_lnk--> 1848 who pointed to the shift in <!--del_lnk--> spectral lines seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the &quot;Doppler-Fizeau effect&quot;. In <!--del_lnk--> 1868, British astronomer <!--del_lnk--> William Huggins was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by this method.<p>In 1871, optical redshift is confirmed when the phenomenon is observed in <!--del_lnk--> Fraunhofer lines using solar rotation, about 0.1 &Aring; in the red.  In 1901 <!--del_lnk--> Aristarkh Belopolsky verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.<p>The earliest occurrence of the term &quot;red-shift&quot; in print (in this hyphenated form), appears to be by American astronomer <!--del_lnk--> Walter S. Adams in 1908, where he mentions &quot;Two methods of investigating that nature of the nebular red-shift&quot;. The word doesn&#39;t appear unhyphenated, perhaps indicating a more common usage of its German equivalent, <i>Rotverschiebung</i>, until about 1934 by <!--del_lnk--> Willem de Sitter.<p>Beginning with observations in 1912, <!--del_lnk--> Vesto Slipher discovered that most <!--del_lnk--> spiral nebulae had considerable redshifts. Subsequently, <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble discovered an approximate relationship between the redshift of such &quot;nebulae&quot; (now known to be <!--del_lnk--> galaxies in their own right) and the <!--del_lnk--> distance to them with the formulation of his eponymous <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>. These observations are today considered strong evidence for an expanding universe and the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory.<p><a id="Measurement.2C_characterization.2C_and_interpretation" name="Measurement.2C_characterization.2C_and_interpretation"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Measurement, characterization, and interpretation</span></h2>
      <p>A redshift can be measured by looking at the <!--del_lnk--> spectrum of light that comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right). If there are features in this spectrum such as <!--del_lnk--> absorption lines, <!--del_lnk--> emission lines, or other variations in <!--del_lnk--> light intensity, then a redshift can in principle be calculated. This requires comparing the observed spectrum to a known spectrum with similar features. For example, the <a href="../../wp/c/Chemical_element.htm" title="Chemical element">atomic element</a> <a href="../../wp/h/Hydrogen.htm" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, when exposed to light, has a definite <!--del_lnk--> signature spectrum that shows features at regular intervals. If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum occurring at shifted wavelengths, then a redshift can be measured for the object. Determining the redshift of an object therefore requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at isolated features or with a spectrum that is featureless or <!--del_lnk--> white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).<p>Redshift (and blueshift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy it is customary to refer to this change using a <!--del_lnk--> dimensionless quantity called <i>z</i>. If <i>&lambda;</i> represents wavelength and <i>f</i> represents frequency (note, <i>&lambda;f</i> = <i>c</i> where <i>c</i> is the <a href="../../wp/s/Speed_of_light.htm" title="Speed of light">speed of light</a>), then <i>z</i> is defined by the equations:<table align="center" class="wikitable">

      <p>After <i>z</i> is measured, the distinction between redshift and blueshift is simply a matter of whether <i>z</i> is positive or negative. According to the <a href="#Mechanisms" title="">mechanisms section</a> below, there are some basic interpretations that follow when either a redshift or blueshift is observed. For example, <!--del_lnk--> Doppler effect blueshifts (<i>z</i> &lt; 0) are associated with objects approaching (moving closer) to the observer with the light shifting to greater <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energies</a>. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts (<i>z</i> &gt; 0) are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, Einstein effect blueshifts are associated with light entering a strong <!--del_lnk--> gravitational field while Einstein effect redshifts imply light is leaving the field.<p><a id="Mechanisms" name="Mechanisms"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mechanisms</span></h2>
      <p>A single <a href="../../wp/p/Photon.htm" title="Photon">photon</a> propagated through a <!--del_lnk--> vacuum can redshift in several distinct ways. Each of these mechanisms produces a Doppler-like redshift, meaning that <i>z</i> is independent of wavelength. These mechanisms are described with <!--del_lnk--> Galilean, <!--del_lnk--> Lorentz, or <!--del_lnk--> general relativistic transformations between one <!--del_lnk--> frame of reference and another.<table align="center" class="wikitable">

      <p>If a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift (<i>z</i> &gt; 0) occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then <!--del_lnk--> blueshift (<i>z</i> &lt; 0) occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the <!--del_lnk--> Doppler effect. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the <i>Doppler redshift</i>.

      <p>A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the <!--del_lnk--> relativistic Doppler effect. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the <!--del_lnk--> time dilation of <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> which can be corrected for by introducing the <!--del_lnk--> Lorentz factor <i>&gamma;</i> into the classical Doppler formula as follows:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="1 + z = \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \gamma" class="tex" src="../../images/436/43609.png" /></dl>
      <p>This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell, called the <!--del_lnk--> Ives-Stilwell experiment.<p>Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the <!--del_lnk--> magnitude of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the <!--del_lnk--> projection of the movement of the source into the <!--del_lnk--> line of sight which yields different results for different orientations. Consequently, for an object moving at an angle <i>&theta;</i> to the observer (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="1+ z = \frac{1 + v \cos (\theta)/c}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}" class="tex" src="../../images/436/43610.png" /></dl>
      <p>and for motion solely in the line of sight (&theta; = 0&deg;), this equation reduces to:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="1 + z = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \frac{v}{c}}{1 - \frac{v}{c}}}" class="tex" src="../../images/436/43611.png" /></dl>
      <p>For the special case that the source is moving at <!--del_lnk--> right angles (&theta; = 90&deg;) to the detector, the relativistic redshift is known as the <!--del_lnk--> transverse redshift, and a redshift is measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even if the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse <!--del_lnk--> component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.<p><a id="Expansion_of_space" name="Expansion_of_space"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion of space</span></h3>

      <p>In the early part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Hubble and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as due solely to the Doppler effect, but later Hubble discovered a rough correlation between the increasing redshifts and the increasing distance of galaxies. Theorists almost immediately realized that these observations could be explained by a different mechanism for producing redshifts. <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a> of the correlation between redshifts and distances is required by models of cosmology derived from general relativity that have a <a href="../../wp/m/Metric_expansion_of_space.htm" title="Metric expansion of space">metric expansion of space</a>. As a result, photons propagating through the expanding space are stretched, creating the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological redshift. This differs from the Doppler effect redshifts described above because the velocity boost (i.e. the <!--del_lnk--> Lorentz transformation) between the source and observer is not due to classical <a href="../../wp/m/Momentum.htm" title="Momentum">momentum</a> and <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> transfer, but instead the photons increase in wavelength and redshift as the space through which they are traveling expands. This effect is prescribed by <!--del_lnk--> the current cosmological model as an observable manifestation of the time-dependent cosmic <!--del_lnk--> scale factor (<span class="texhtml"><i>a</i></span>) in the following way:<dl>
       <dd><img alt="1+z = \frac{a_{\mathrm{now}}}{a_{\mathrm{then}}}." class="tex" src="../../images/436/43612.png" /></dl>
      <p>This type of redshift is called the <i><!--del_lnk--> cosmological redshift</i> or <i>Hubble redshift</i>. If the universe were contracting instead of expanding, we would see distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.<p>These galaxies are not receding simply by means of a physical velocity in the direction away from the observer; instead, the intervening space is stretching, which accounts for the large-scale isotropy of the effect demanded by the <!--del_lnk--> cosmological principle. For cosmological redshifts of z &lt; 0.1 the effects of spacetime expansion are minimal and observed redshifts dominated by the peculiar motions of the galaxies relative to one another that cause additional Doppler redshifts and blueshifts. The difference between physical velocity and space expansion is clearly illustrated by the <!--del_lnk--> Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe, a common cosmological analogy used to describe the expansion of space. If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet, the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion. The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to the sheet and the sheet is stretched. (Obviously there are dimensional problems with the model, as the ball bearings should be in the sheet and cosmological redshift produces higher velocities than Doppler if the distance between two objects is far enough.)<p>In spite of the distinction between redshifts caused by the velocity of objects and the redshifts associated with the expanding universe, astronomers (especially professional ones) sometimes refer to &quot;recession velocity&quot; in the context of the redshifting of distant galaxies from the expansion of the Universe, even though it is only an apparent recession. As a consequence, popular literature often uses the expression &quot;Doppler redshift&quot; instead of &quot;cosmological redshift&quot; to describe the motion of galaxies dominated by the expansion of spacetime, despite the fact that a &quot;cosmological recessional speed&quot; when calculated will not equal the velocity in the relativistic Doppler equation. In particular, Doppler redshift is bound by <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a>; thus <i>v &gt; c</i> is impossible while, in contrast, <i>v &gt; c</i> is possible for cosmological redshift because the space which separates the objects (e.g., a quasar from the Earth) can expand faster than the speed of light. More mathematically, the viewpoint that &quot;distant galaxies are receding&quot; and the viewpoint that &quot;the space between galaxies is expanding&quot; are related by changing <!--del_lnk--> coordinate systems. Expressing this precisely requires working with the mathematics of the <!--del_lnk--> Robertson-Walker metric.<p><a id="Gravitational_redshift" name="Gravitational_redshift"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Gravitational redshift</span></h3>

      <p>This <!--del_lnk--> gravitational redshift results can be derived from the assumptions of <a href="../../wp/s/Special_relativity.htm" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> equivalence principle; the full theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity is not required.<p>The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the <!--del_lnk--> Mossbauer effect and was first observed in the <!--del_lnk--> Pound-Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a <a href="../../wp/b/Black_hole.htm" title="Black hole">black hole</a>, and as an object approaches the <!--del_lnk--> event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> (see <!--del_lnk--> Sachs-Wolfe effect).<p><a id="Observations_in_astronomy" name="Observations_in_astronomy"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Observations in astronomy</span></h2>
      <p>The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the <!--del_lnk--> emission and <!--del_lnk--> absorption spectra for <a href="../../wp/a/Atom.htm" title="Atom">atoms</a> are distinctive and well known, calibrated from <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic experiments in <!--del_lnk--> laboratories on Earth. When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured, <i>z</i> is found to be remarkably constant. (See <!--del_lnk--> Is the fine structure constant really constant?) Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by thermal or mechanical motion of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts. Alternative hypotheses are not generally considered plausible.<p>Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple <!--del_lnk--> photometry which measures the <!--del_lnk--> brightness of astronomical objects through certain <!--del_lnk--> filters. When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble_Deep_Field.htm" title="Hubble Deep Field">Hubble Deep Field</a> and the <!--del_lnk--> Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring <!--del_lnk--> photometric redshifts. Due to the filter being sensitive to a range of wavelengths and the technique relying on making many assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, <!--del_lnk--> errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to &delta;<i>z</i> = 0.5, and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. However, photometry does allow at least for a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a sun-like spectrum had a redshift of <i>z</i> = 1, it would be brightest in the <!--del_lnk--> infrared rather than at the yellow-green colour associated with the peak of its <!--del_lnk--> blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of two (1+<i>z</i>) (see <!--del_lnk--> K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift).<p><a id="Local_observations" name="Local_observations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Local observations</span></h3>
      <p>In nearby objects (within our <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a> <a href="../../wp/g/Galaxy.htm" title="Galaxy">galaxy</a>) observed redshifts are almost always related to the <!--del_lnk--> line of sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure <!--del_lnk--> velocities and parametrize the <!--del_lnk--> masses of the <!--del_lnk--> orbiting <a href="../../wp/s/Star.htm" title="Star">stars</a> in <a href="../../wp/b/Binary_star.htm" title="Spectroscopic binaries">spectroscopic binaries</a>, a method first employed in <!--del_lnk--> 1868 by British astronomer <!--del_lnk--> William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to <!--del_lnk--> diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of <a href="../../wp/e/Extrasolar_planet.htm" title="Extrasolar planet">planetary systems</a> around other stars. Measurements of redshifts to fine detail are used in <!--del_lnk--> helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the <!--del_lnk--> photosphere of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">Sun</a>. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the <!--del_lnk--> rotation rates of <a href="../../wp/p/Planet.htm" title="Planet">planets</a>, velocities of <!--del_lnk--> interstellar clouds, the <!--del_lnk--> rotation of galaxies, and the <!--del_lnk--> dynamics of <!--del_lnk--> accretion onto <!--del_lnk--> neutron stars and <a href="../../wp/b/Black_hole.htm" title="Black hole">black holes</a> which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the <!--del_lnk--> temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring <!--del_lnk--> Doppler broadening &mdash; effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter <!--del_lnk--> hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the <!--del_lnk--> recessional velocities of <!--del_lnk--> interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the <!--del_lnk--> rotation curve of our <a href="../../wp/m/Milky_Way.htm" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as <!--del_lnk--> Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements are one of the most important <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.<p><a id="Extragalactic_observations" name="Extragalactic_observations"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Extragalactic observations</span></h3>

      <p>The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the <!--del_lnk--> Hubble flow of the universe. The largest observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the <a href="../../wp/c/Cosmic_microwave_background_radiation.htm" title="Cosmic microwave background radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>; the numerical value of its redshift is about <i>z</i> = 1089 (<i>z</i> = 0 corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the Universe about 13.7 billion years ago, and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a>.<p>The luminous point-like cores of <!--del_lnk--> quasars were the first &quot;high-redshift&quot; (<span class="texhtml"><i>z</i> &gt; 0.1</span>) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift <!--del_lnk--> galaxies. Currently, the highest measured quasar redshift is <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i> = 6.4</span>, with the highest confirmed galaxy redshift being <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i> = 7.0</span> while as-yet unconfirmed reports from a <!--del_lnk--> gravitational lens observed in a distant <!--del_lnk--> galaxy cluster may indicate a galaxy with a redshift of <span class="texhtml"><i>z</i> = 10</span>.<p>For galaxies more distant than the <!--del_lnk--> Local Group and the nearby <!--del_lnk--> Virgo Cluster, but within a thousand <!--del_lnk--> megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy&#39;s distance. This correlation was first observed by <!--del_lnk--> Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>. <!--del_lnk--> Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about the year <!--del_lnk--> 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher&#39;s measurements with distances he <!--del_lnk--> measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a> follows in part from the <!--del_lnk--> Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how <!--del_lnk--> luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using <a href="../../wp/h/Hubble%2527s_law.htm" title="Hubble&#39;s law">Hubble&#39;s law</a>.<p><a href="../../wp/g/Gravitation.htm" title="Gravity">Gravitational interactions</a> of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant <!--del_lnk--> scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The <!--del_lnk--> peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the <!--del_lnk--> mass of <!--del_lnk--> virialized objects in the universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the <a href="../../wp/a/Andromeda_Galaxy.htm" title="Andromeda Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common <!--del_lnk--> barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a <!--del_lnk--> Finger of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the <i><!--del_lnk--> mass to light ratio</i> (the ratio of a galaxy&#39;s mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring <!--del_lnk--> dark matter.<p>For more distant galaxies, the relationship between current distance and observed redshift becomes more complex. When one sees a distant galaxy, one is seeing the galaxy as it was sometime in the past, when the expansion rate of the Universe was different from what it is now. At these early times, we expect differences in the expansion rate for at least two reasons:<ol>
       <li>The gravitational attraction between galaxies has been acting to slow down the expansion of the Universe since then.<li>The possible existence of a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant or <!--del_lnk--> quintessence may be changing the expansion rate of the Universe</ol>
      <p>Recent observations have suggested the expansion of the Universe is not slowing down, as expected from the first point, but accelerating. It is widely, though not quite universally, believed that this is because there is a form of <!--del_lnk--> dark energy dominating the evolution of the universe. Such a <!--del_lnk--> cosmological constant implies that the <!--del_lnk--> ultimate fate of the Universe is not a <!--del_lnk--> Big Crunch, but instead will continue to exist foreseeably (though most physical processes within the Universe will still come to an <!--del_lnk--> eventual end).<p>The expanding Universe is a central prediction of the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory. If extrapolated back in time, the theory predicts a &quot;singularity&quot;, a point in time when the Universe had infinite density. The theory of <!--del_lnk--> general relativity, on which the <a href="../../wp/b/Big_Bang.htm" title="Big Bang">Big Bang</a> theory is based, breaks down at this point. It is believed that a yet unknown theory of <!--del_lnk--> quantum gravity would take over before the density becomes infinite.<p><a id="Redshift_surveys" name="Redshift_surveys"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Redshift surveys</span></h3>

      <p>With the advent of automated <a href="../../wp/t/Telescope.htm" title="Telescope">telescopes</a> and improvements in <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the <!--del_lnk--> large-scale structure of the universe. The <!--del_lnk--> Great Wall, a vast <!--del_lnk--> supercluster of galaxies over 500 million <!--del_lnk--> light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.<p>The first redshift survey was the <!--del_lnk--> CfA Redshift Survey, started in <!--del_lnk--> 1977 with the initial data collection completed in <!--del_lnk--> 1982. More recently, the <!--del_lnk--> 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey determined the large-scale structure of one section of the Universe, measuring <i>z</i>-values for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final data set was released <!--del_lnk--> 30 June 2003. (In addition to mapping large-scale patterns of galaxies, 2dF established an upper limit on <!--del_lnk--> neutrino mass.) Another notable investigation, the <!--del_lnk--> Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), is ongoing <!--del_lnk--> as of 2005 and aims to obtain measurements on around 100 million objects. SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.4, and has been involved in the detection of <!--del_lnk--> quasars beyond <i>z</i> = 6. The <!--del_lnk--> DEEP2 Redshift Survey uses the <!--del_lnk--> Keck telescopes with the new &quot;DEIMOS&quot; <!--del_lnk--> spectrograph; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a complement to SDSS and 2dF.<p><a id="Effects_due_to_physical_optics_or_radiative_transfer" name="Effects_due_to_physical_optics_or_radiative_transfer"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Effects due to physical optics or radiative transfer</span></h2>
      <p>The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of <!--del_lnk--> radiative transfer and <!--del_lnk--> physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being due to a transformation between reference frames. These shifts can be due to <!--del_lnk--> coherence effects (see <!--del_lnk--> Wolf effect) or due to the <!--del_lnk--> scattering of <a href="../../wp/e/Electromagnetic_radiation.htm" title="Electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> whether from <a href="../../wp/e/Electric_charge.htm" title="Electric charge">charged</a> <!--del_lnk--> elementary particles, from particulates, or from fluctuations in a <!--del_lnk--> dielectric medium. While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as &quot;redshifts&quot; and &quot;blueshifts&quot;, the physical interactions of the electromagnetic radiation field with itself or intervening matter distinguishes these phenomena from the reference-frame effects. In astrophysics, light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as &quot;reddening&quot; rather than &quot;redshifting&quot; which, as a term, is normally reserved for the <a href="#Mechanisms" title="">effects discussed above</a>.<p>In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because <a href="../../wp/e/Entropy.htm" title="Entropy">entropy</a> results in the predominance of many low <a href="../../wp/e/Energy.htm" title="Energy">energy</a> photons over few high energy ones (while <!--del_lnk--> conserving total energy). Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated <i>z</i> is generally a <!--del_lnk--> function of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from <!--del_lnk--> random <a href="../../wp/m/Matter.htm" title="Matter">media</a> generally occurs at many <!--del_lnk--> angles, and <i>z</i> is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of <!--del_lnk--> spectral lines as well.<p>In <!--del_lnk--> interstellar astronomy, <!--del_lnk--> visible spectra can appear <!--del_lnk--> redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as <!--del_lnk--> interstellar reddening &mdash; similarly <!--del_lnk--> Rayleigh scattering causes the <!--del_lnk--> atmospheric reddening of the <a href="../../wp/s/Sun.htm" title="Sun">sun</a> seen in the <!--del_lnk--> sunrise or <!--del_lnk--> sunset and causes the rest of the <!--del_lnk--> sky to have a <!--del_lnk--> blue <a href="../../wp/c/Color.htm" title="Color">colour</a>. This phenomenon is distinct from red<i>shift</i>ing because the <!--del_lnk--> spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional <!--del_lnk--> dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the <!--del_lnk--> line of sight.<div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift&quot;</div>
