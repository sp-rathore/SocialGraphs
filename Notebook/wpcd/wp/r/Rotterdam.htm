It is situated on the banks of the river <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwe Maas (&quot;New Meuse&quot;), one of the streams in the delta formed by the Rhine and Meuse rivers.

      <p>On <!--del_lnk--> 1 January <!--del_lnk--> 2006 (source: <!--del_lnk--> Statistics Netherlands), the <!--del_lnk--> municipality covered an area of 304.22 km&sup2; (206.44 km&sup2; land) with a population of 588,500. The population of the greater Rotterdam metropolitan area Rijnmond (&quot;Mouth of the Rhine&quot;) was 1,145,673. In 1965, the municipal population reached its peak at 731,000, but by 1984, it had decreased to 555,000 as a result of <!--del_lnk--> suburbanization.<p>Rotterdam consists of 11 submunicipalities: Charlois (including Heijplaat), <!--del_lnk--> Delfshaven, <!--del_lnk--> Feijenoord, <!--del_lnk--> Hillegersberg-Schiebroek, Hoek van Holland, <!--del_lnk--> Hoogvliet, <!--del_lnk--> IJsselmonde, <!--del_lnk--> Kralingen-Crooswijk, Noord, Overschie, and <!--del_lnk--> Prins Alexander (with around 85,000 inhabitants the most populous submunicipality).

      <p>Rotterdam has the largest <!--del_lnk--> port in <a href="../../wp/e/Europe.htm" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Since <!--del_lnk--> 2004, <a href="../../wp/a/Asia.htm" title="Asia">Asian</a> ports like <!--del_lnk--> Singapore and <a href="../../wp/s/Shanghai.htm" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> have taken over its <!--del_lnk--> world leading position. In <!--del_lnk--> 2004, Rotterdam was the seventh largest port in the world in terms of containers (<!--del_lnk--> TEU) handled.<p>Most important for the port of Rotterdam are the <!--del_lnk--> petrochemical industry and general <!--del_lnk--> cargo transhipment handling. The harbour functions as an important transit point for <!--del_lnk--> bulk and other goods between the European continent and other parts of the world. From Rotterdam goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. Since <!--del_lnk--> 2000, the <i><!--del_lnk--> Betuweroute</i>, a fast cargo <!--del_lnk--> railway from Rotterdam to <a href="../../wp/g/Germany.htm" title="Germany">Germany</a>, has been under construction. Large <a href="../../wp/o/Oil_refinery.htm" title="Oil refinery">oil refineries</a> are located west of the city. The rivers <!--del_lnk--> Meuse and <a href="../../wp/r/Rhine.htm" title="Rhine">Rhine</a> also provide excellent access to the <!--del_lnk--> hinterland.<p>In 1872, the <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwe Waterweg (&quot;New Waterway&quot;) opened, a ship canal constructed to keep the city and port of Rotterdam accessible to seafaring vessels as the natural Meuse-Rhine branches silted up. In the first half of the twentieth century, the port&#39;s centre of gravity shifted westward towards the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a>.<p>Covering 105 square kilometers, the port of Rotterdam stretches over a distance of 40 kilometers. It consists of the city center&#39;s historic harbour area, including <!--del_lnk--> Delfshaven; the Maashaven/Rijnhaven/<!--del_lnk--> Feijenoord complex; the harbors around Nieuw-Mathenesse; Waalhaven; Vondelingenplaat; Eemhaven; <!--del_lnk--> Botlek; <!--del_lnk--> Europoort, situated along the Calandkanaal, <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwe Waterweg and <!--del_lnk--> Scheur (the latter two being continuations of the Nieuwe Maas); and the reclaimed <!--del_lnk--> Maasvlakte area, which projects into the North Sea. The construction of a second Maasvlakte received initial political approval in 2004, but was stopped by the Raad van State (the <!--del_lnk--> Dutch Council of State, which advises the government and parliament on legislation and governance) in 2005, because the plans did not take enough account of environmental issues. On October 10, 2006, however, approval was acquired to start construction in 2008, aiming for the first ship to anchor in 2013.<p><a id="History_and_recent_developments" name="History_and_recent_developments"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">History and recent developments</span></h2>

      <p>Rotterdam was granted <!--del_lnk--> city rights on <!--del_lnk--> 7 June <!--del_lnk--> 1340 by <!--del_lnk--> Willem IV of Holland.<p>The port of Rotterdam slowly but steadily grew into a port of importance, becoming the seat of one of the six chambers of the VOC, or the <!--del_lnk--> Netherlands East India Company.<p>The greatest spurt of growth, both in port activity and population, followed after the already mentioned completion of the <i>Nieuwe Waterweg</i> in 1872. The city and harbour started to expand on the South bank of the river. Delivering evidence of its rapid growth and success is the skyscraper in the French Chateau style, the <!--del_lnk--> White House, or Witte Huis, built in the American spirit of office buildings in 1898; its height is 45 m, it was at the time of completion the tallest office building in Europe.<p>On <!--del_lnk--> May 14, <!--del_lnk--> 1940, <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam was bombed by the German <a href="../../wp/l/Luftwaffe.htm" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, on the last of five days of war in the Netherlands (save <!--del_lnk--> Zeeland). The heart of the city was almost completely destroyed, which <!--del_lnk--> Ossip Zadkine later expressed strikingly with his statue <i>Stad zonder hart</i> (City without a heart). The statue is located near the <i>Leuvehaven</i>, not far from the <!--del_lnk--> Erasmusbrug in the north of the city. From the <!--del_lnk--> 1950s through the <!--del_lnk--> 1970s, the city was rebuilt. It remained quite <a href="../../wp/w/Wind.htm" title="Wind">windy</a> and open until the city councils from the <!--del_lnk--> 1980s on began developing an active architectural policy. Daring and new styles of <!--del_lnk--> apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more &#39;<!--del_lnk--> livable&#39; city centre with a new skyline. In the <!--del_lnk--> 1990s, a new business centre on the south bank of the river, the <i>Kop van Zuid</i> has been built. The City Hall survived the bombing campaign.<p><a id="Demographics" name="Demographics"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Demographics</span></h2>

      <p>Rotterdam is divided into a northern and a southern part by the river <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwe Maas, connected by (from west to east): the Beneluxtunnel; the Maastunnel; the Erasmusbrug (Erasmus Bridge); a subway tunnel; a train tunnel; the Willemsbrug (Willems Bridge); the Koninginnebrug (&quot;Queen&#39;s Bridge&quot;); and the Van Brienenoordbrug (Van Brienenoord Bridge). The former railway lift <a href="../../wp/b/Bridge.htm" title="Bridge">bridge</a> &quot;De Hef&quot; (&quot;the Lift&quot;) is preserved as a monument in lifted position between the Noordereiland (&quot;Northern Island&quot;) and the south of Rotterdam.<p>The city center is located on the northern bank of the Nieuwe Maas, although recent urban development has extended the centre to parts of southern Rotterdam known as De Kop van Zuid (&quot;the Head of South&quot;, i.e. the northern part of southern Rotterdam). From its inland core, Rotterdam reaches the <a href="../../wp/n/North_Sea.htm" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> by a swath of predominantly harbour area.<p>Built mostly behind dykes, large parts of the Rotterdam territory are below sea level. For instance, the Prins Alexander Polder in the northeast of Rotterdam well extends 6 meters below sea level, or rather below <!--del_lnk--> Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP) or Amsterdam Ordnance Datum. The lowest point in the Netherlands (6.76 meters below NAP) is situated just to the east of Rotterdam, in the municipality of <!--del_lnk--> Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel.<p>The Rotte river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly. Since the early 1980s, when the construction of Rotterdam&rsquo;s second subway line interfered with the Rotte&rsquo;s course, its waters have been pumped through a pipe into the Nieuwe Maas via the Boerengat.<p><a id="Education" name="Education"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h2>
      <p>Rotterdam has one major university, the <!--del_lnk--> Erasmus University Rotterdam, named after one of the city&#39;s famous former inhabitants, <!--del_lnk--> Desiderius Erasmus. Many of the departments are world renowned. The &#39;Woudestein&#39; campus houses (among others) the <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam School of Management, which is a top ranked MBA school. In <!--del_lnk--> Financial Times&#39; 2005 rankings it placed 29th globally and 7th in Europe. The School of Economics is ranked 4th globally. The &#39;Hoboken&#39; campus of EUR houses the Sophia (children) and Dijkzigt (general) hospitals, as well as the Medical Department of the University. These are known collectively as Erasmus MC (Erasmus Medisch Centrum in Dutch / Erasmus Medical Center in English). Erasmus Medical Center holds the 3rd worldwide ranking in medical research, behind the American institutions Harvard and Johns Hopkins. As a combined medical treatment and research centre it is particularly noted for its patient cohort studies in which large numbers of patients are followed for long periods of time.<p>There are also three <i><!--del_lnk--> Hogescholen</i> in Rotterdam. These schools award their students a <!--del_lnk--> Bachelor&#39;s degree and postgraduate or <!--del_lnk--> Master&#39;s degree. The three <i>Hogescholen</i> are <!--del_lnk--> Hogeschool Rotterdam, <!--del_lnk--> Hogeschool INHOLLAND and <!--del_lnk--> Hogeschool voor Muziek en Dans.<p>Students in <!--del_lnk--> higher education comprise around 20% of Rotterdam&#39;s population.<p><a id="Museums" name="Museums"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Museums</span></h2>
      <p>Rotterdam has many museums. Well known <!--del_lnk--> museums are the <i><!--del_lnk--> Boijmans-van Beuningen</i> Museum, the <!--del_lnk--> [NAI] (Netherlands Architecture Institute), the <i>Historisch Museum</i> (Historical museum), the <i>Volkenkundig Museum</i> (foreign peoples and cultures), the <i><!--del_lnk--> [KunstHal]</i> (design by Rem Koolhaas), the <i><!--del_lnk--> Maritiem Museum</i> and the <i>Brandweermuseum</i> (Fire brigade museum). Other museums include the tax museum, the nature historical museum, historical museum the <!--del_lnk--> Dubbelde Palmboom and the Schielandhuis. At the historical shipyard and museum <!--del_lnk--> Scheepswerf &#39;De Delft&#39; the reconstruction of <!--del_lnk--> Ship of the Line &#39;De Delft&#39; can be visited.<p><a id="Culture" name="Culture"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Culture</span></h2>
      <p>Alongside Porto, Rotterdam was <!--del_lnk--> European Capital of Culture in 2001. The city has its own orchestra, the <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra with its world famous musical director <!--del_lnk--> Valery Gergiev, a large congress and concert building called <i><!--del_lnk--> De Doelen</i>, plus many theatres (including the new <i>Luxor</i> theatre) and movie theatres. The <i>Ahoy</i> complex in the south of the city is used for pop concerts, exhibitions, tennis tournaments and other activities. A major <!--del_lnk--> zoo called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Diergaarde Blijdorp&quot; is situated at the northwest side of Rotterdam, complete with a walkthrough sea aquarium called &quot;<!--del_lnk--> Oceanium&quot;.<p>The city is home to the <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts.<p>Rotterdam is currently going through somewhat of a renaissance, with some urban renewal projects featuring ambitious architecture, an increasingly sparkling nightlife, and a host of summer festivals celebrating the city&#39;s multicultural population and identity, such as the Caribbean-inspired &#39;Summer Carnival&#39;, the Dance Parade, Rotterdam 666, the Metropolis pop festival and the World Harbour days. There are also the International Film Festival in January, the Poetry International Festival in June, the North Sea Jazz Festival in July, the Valery Gergiev Festival in September, September in Rotterdam and the World of the Witte de With.<p>The self-image of the city is that of a no-nonsense workers&#39; city. In that sense, there is a healthy competition with Amsterdam, which is often viewed as the cultural capital of the Netherlands. There is a popular saying: &quot;Amsterdam to party, Den Hague to live, Rotterdam to work&quot;.<p>Rotterdam has had a rich hiphop scene since the early 1980s. It is also the home of <!--del_lnk--> Gabber, a type of music popular in the mid-1990s, with hard beats and samples. Bands like <!--del_lnk--> Neophyte and <!--del_lnk--> Rotterdam Terror Corps (RTC) started in Rotterdam.<p><a id="Architecture_and_skyline" name="Architecture_and_skyline"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Architecture and skyline</span></h2>

      <p>In 1898 the 45 meter high rise office building, the White House was completed, at that time the tallest office building in Europe.<p>In the first decades of the 20th century some influential architecture in the modern style was built in Rotterdam. Notable are the <!--del_lnk--> Van Nelle fabriek (1929) a monument of modern factory design by <!--del_lnk--> Brinkman en Van der Vlugt, and Feyenoord&#39;s football stadium <!--del_lnk--> de Kuip (1936) also by <!--del_lnk--> Brinkman en Van der Vlugt.
