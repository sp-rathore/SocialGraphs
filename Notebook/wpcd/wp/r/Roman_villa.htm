      <p>The <a href="../../wp/r/Roman_Empire.htm" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> contained many kinds of <!--del_lnk--> villas. Some were pleasure houses such as those like <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian&#39;s Villa at <!--del_lnk--> Tivoli, that were sited in the cool hills within easy reach of <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Rome</a> or on picturesque sites overlooking the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Naples. Some villas were more like the country houses of <!--del_lnk--> Early Modern England, <a href="../../wp/f/France.htm" title="France">France</a> or <a href="../../wp/p/Poland.htm" title="Poland">Poland</a>, the visible seat of power of a local magnate, such as the famous palace rediscovered at <!--del_lnk--> Fishbourne in <!--del_lnk--> Sussex. Suburban villas on the edge of cities were also known, such as the Middle and Late Republican villas that encroached on the <!--del_lnk--> Campus Martius, at that time on the edge of Rome, and which can be also seen outside the city walls of <a href="../../wp/p/Pompeii.htm" title="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>. These early suburban villas, such as the one at Rome&#39;s Auditorium site<!--del_lnk-->  or at <!--del_lnk--> Grottarossa, demonstrate the antiquity and heritage of the <i>villa suburbana</i> in Central Italy. It is possible that these early, suburban villas were also in fact the seats of power (maybe even palaces) of regional strongmen or heads of important families (<i>gentes</i>). A third type of villa provided the organizational centre of the large holdings called <!--del_lnk--> latifundia, that produced and exported agricultural produce; such villas might be lacking in luxuries. By the 4th century, <i>villa</i> could simply connote an agricultural holding: <!--del_lnk--> Jerome translated the <!--del_lnk--> Gospel of Mark (xiv, 32) <i>chorion</i>, describing the olive grove of <!--del_lnk--> Gethsemane, with <i>villa</i>, without an inference that there were any dwellings there at all (<i>Catholic Encyclopedia</i> &quot;Gethsemane&quot;).<p>The late <!--del_lnk--> Roman Republic witnessed an explosion of villa construction in Italy. In Etruria, the villa at <!--del_lnk--> Settefinestre has been interpreted as being one of the <i><!--del_lnk--> latifundia</i>, or large slave-run villas, that were involved in large-scale agricultural production. Other villas in the hinterland of Rome are interpreted in light of the agrarian treatises written by the <!--del_lnk--> elder Cato, <!--del_lnk--> Columella and <!--del_lnk--> Varro, both of whom sought to define the suitable lifestyle of conservative Romans, at least in idealistic terms.<p>By the first century B.C., the &quot;classic&quot; villa had a widespread architectural form with many examples showing the use of atrium/peristyle architecture. This explosion of construction takes place especially in the years following the dictatorship of Sulla. A villa might be quite palatial, such as the imperial villas built on seaside slopes around the <!--del_lnk--> Bay of Naples such as at <!--del_lnk--> Baiae; others were preserved at <!--del_lnk--> Stabiae and <!--del_lnk--> Herculaneum by the ashfall and mudslide from the eruption of <!--del_lnk--> Vesuvius in 79 A.D., which also preserved the <!--del_lnk--> Villa of the Papyri and its libraries. Deeper in the countryside, villas were largely self-supporting with associated farms, olive groves, and vineyards. Large villas dominated the rural economy of the <!--del_lnk--> Po valley, <!--del_lnk--> Campania, and <!--del_lnk--> Sicily, and were also found in <!--del_lnk--> Gaul. Villas specializing in the sea-going export of olive oil to Roman legions in Germany were a feature of the southern Iberian province of <!--del_lnk--> Hispania Baetica. Some luxurious villas have been excavated in North Africa in the provinces of <a href="../../wp/a/Africa.htm" title="Africa">Africa</a> and <!--del_lnk--> Numidia, or at <!--del_lnk--> Fishbourne in Britannia.<p>Certain areas within easy reach of Rome offered cool lodgings in the heat of summer. <!--del_lnk--> Maecenas asked what kind of house could possibly be suitable at all seasons. The emperor <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian had a villa at Tibur (<!--del_lnk--> Tivoli), in an area that was popular with Romans of rank. <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian&#39;s Villa (<!--del_lnk--> 123 AD) was more like a palace. <!--del_lnk--> Cicero had several villas. <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Younger described his villas in his letters. The Romans invented the <!--del_lnk--> seaside villa: a vignette in a frescoed wall at the house of <i>Lucretius Fronto</i> in Pompeii still shows a row of seafront pleasure houses, all with porticos along the front, some rising up in porticoed tiers to an <i>altana</i> at the top that would catch a breeze on the most stifling evenings (Veyne 1987 ill. p 152)<div class="thumb tleft">

      <p>Late Roman owners of villae had luxuries like <!--del_lnk--> hypocaust-heated rooms with mosaics (<!--del_lnk--> La Olmeda, Spain). As the Roman Empire collapsed in the 4th and 5th centuries, the villas were more and more isolated and came to be protected by walls. Though in England the villas were abandoned, looted, and burned by Anglo-Saxon invaders in the 5th century, other areas had large working villas donated by aristocrats and territorial magnates to individual monks that often became the nucleus of famous <!--del_lnk--> monasteries. In this way, the villa system of late Antiquity was preserved into the early Medieval period. <!--del_lnk--> Saint Benedict established his influential monastery of <!--del_lnk--> Monte Cassino in the ruins of a villa at Subiaco that had belonged to <!--del_lnk--> Nero; there are fuller details at the entry for <!--del_lnk--> Benedict. Around 590, <!--del_lnk--> Saint Eligius was born in a highly-placed Gallo-Roman family at the &#39;villa&#39; of Chaptelat near Limoges, in Aquitaine (now France). The abbey at <!--del_lnk--> Stavelot was founded ca 650 on the domain of a former villa near <!--del_lnk--> Li&egrave;ge and the abbey of <!--del_lnk--> V&eacute;zelay had a similar founding. As late as 698, <!--del_lnk--> Willibrord established an abbey at a Roman villa of <!--del_lnk--> Echternach, in <!--del_lnk--> Luxemburg near <!--del_lnk--> Trier, which was presented to him by <!--del_lnk--> Irmina, daughter of <!--del_lnk--> Dagobert II, king of the <a href="../../wp/f/Franks.htm" title="Franks">Franks</a>.<p>Some of the known Roman villas are:<ul>
       <li><!--del_lnk--> Hadrian&#39;s Villa at Tivoli, Italy<li><!--del_lnk--> Fishbourne Roman Palace in West Sussex, England<li><!--del_lnk--> Lullingstone villa in Kent, England<li><!--del_lnk--> Villa Romana del Casale in Piazza Armerina, Sicily, Italy<li><!--del_lnk--> Chedworth Roman Villa in Gloucestershire</ul>

      <p>Upper class, wealthy Roman Citizens in the countryside around Rome and throughout the Empire lived in villa-complexes, the accommodation for rural farms.<p>The villa-complex consisted of three parts.<p>The &quot;Villa Urbana&quot; where the owner and his family lived. This would be similar to the wealthy-person&#39;s <i><!--del_lnk--> domus</i> in the city and would have painted walls and artistic mosaics on the floors.<p>The &quot;Villa Rustica&quot; where the staff and slaves of the villa worked and lived. This was also the living quarters for the farms animals. There would usually be other rooms here that might be used as store rooms, a hospital and even a prison!<p>The third part of the villa-complex would be the storage rooms. These would be where the products of the farm were stored ready for transport to buyers. Storage rooms here would have been used for Oil, Wine, Grain, Grapes and any other produce of the villa. Other rooms in the villa might include an office, a temple for worship, several bedrooms, a dining room and a kitchen.<p>Villas were often plumbed with running water and many would have had under-floor central heating known as a &quot;<!--del_lnk--> hypocaust&quot;.<p>A <b>villa</b> was originally a <a href="../../wp/r/Rome.htm" title="Rome">Roman</a> country <a href="../../wp/h/House.htm" title="House">house</a> built for the upper class. According to <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Elder, there were two kinds of villas: the <i>villa urbana</i>, which was a country seat that could easily be reached from Rome (or another city) for a night or two, and the <i>villa rustica</i>, the farm-house estate permanently occupied by the servants who had charge generally of the estate. It would centre on the villa itself, perhaps only seasonally occupied. There were a concentration of Imperial villas near the Bay of Naples, especially on the Isle of <!--del_lnk--> Capri, at <!--del_lnk--> Monte Circeo on the coast and at Antium (<!--del_lnk--> Anzio). Wealthy Romans escaped the summer heat in the hills round Rome, especially around <!--del_lnk--> Frascati (<i>cf</i> <!--del_lnk--> Hadrian&#39;s Villa). <!--del_lnk--> Cicero is said to have possessed no less than seven villas, the oldest of which was near Arpinum, which he inherited. <!--del_lnk--> Pliny the Younger had three or four, of which the example near Laurentium is the best known from his descriptions.<p>Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their villas, where they drank their own wine and pressed their own oil, a commonly used <!--del_lnk--> literary <i>topos</i>. An ideal Roman citizen was the independent farmer tilling his own land, and the agricultural writers wanted to give their readers a chance to link themselves with their ancestors through this image of self-sufficient villas. The truth was not too far from it, either, while even the profit-oriented <!--del_lnk--> <i>latifundia</i> probably grew enough of all the basic foodstuffs to provide for their own consumption. Even the &#39;monoculture&#39; farms, concentrating [[<i>desunt multa</i>]]<p><a id="Individual_Roman_villas" name="Individual_Roman_villas"></a><div class="printfooter"> Retrieved from &quot;<!--del_lnk--> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_villa&quot;</div>
